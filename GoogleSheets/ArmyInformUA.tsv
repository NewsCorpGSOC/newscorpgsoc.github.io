-Historical turning point-: the expert explained the importance of the European rearmament plan	This opinion was expressed by a lawyer, a serviceman of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko, in a conversation with an ArmyInform correspondent. -In the context of the fact that the USA is now suspending its aid to Ukraine, the consolidation of Europe is very important and necessary. It should be understood that the security of Europe directly depends on the security of Ukraine,- says Oleksandr Musienko. He emphasizes that if before some of the Europeans had unnecessary illusions that the USA is ready to provide its help at any moment and is the guarantor of Europe's security, now such confidence is disappearing. -Because it is not a fact that the United States will be ready to defend Europe. Today it is a shock for Europe what is happening and the decisions that the United States is making. But this shock should mobilize. Maybe someone is scared, someone is afraid, does not know what to do among European politicians. So: to do what is needed now is to consolidate around Ukraine and, together with Ukraine, oppose Russian aggression, which is a threat to Europe,- the interlocutor emphasizes. At the same time, according to Oleksandr Musienko, -challenges have intensified- because the United States really wants to reduce its military presence in Europe. -It is for this purpose that the plan for the rearmament of Europe was developed and presented. This is an unprecedented event, it is about 800 billion euros. The plan will involve more investment in the production of weapons in Europe, will involve cooperation between European countries, cooperation, complementarity and replacement of those components and means that are lacking. I would call this program a new industrialization, because a lot will be invested in the defense industry itself, the purchase of weapons, first of all, air defense systems, artillery ammunition, drones. This is what Ukraine really needs now,- the expert says. In his words, this is -truly a historical turning point for Europe.- -It's good that it's happening. Of course, in this way we can hope that, in particular, after the summit in London, the countries of Europe become closer to the idea of ​​a united army and united around Ukraine.- At the same time, Oleksandr Musienko calls it -strange- that the Baltic countries were not invited to the summit in London. -This is probably the only negative that can be said about this event. Other decisions are important. In particular, Britain's adoption of an air defense aid package. These are billions of pounds, which Britain will urgently allocate now and help Ukraine. It is important now to state this consolidation of Europeans and the proposal to create an appropriate coalition — a reboot, let's say, of the anti-Putin coalition,- the interlocutor summarized. Oleksandr Musienko once again emphasized that it is important to hold the summit after the visit of the President of Ukraine to Washington: because it -shows that Ukraine is not alone - Europe is with us.- As ArmiyaInform wrote, on March 4, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen presented a plan for the rearmament of the European Union (ReArm Europe) and support for Ukraine. It should be noted that at the summit in London with the participation of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi on March 2 discussed the challenges facing Ukraine and all of Europe, the struggle against Russian aggression and the search for ways to a just, sustainable peace. On the same day, it became known that Ukraine will be able to use 1.6 billion pounds of British export financing for the purchase of 5,000 more missiles for air defense systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/05/istorychnyj-perelam-ekspert-poyasnyv-chym-vazhlyvyj-plan-pereozbroyennya-yevropy/	2025-03-04T20:54:47-08:00
Higher education and management experience: how to get an officer rank for mobilized privates and se...	Eligible opportunities apply during martial law and prescribed in the Order of the Minister of Defense No. 170. In particular, privates, sergeants, and senior officers who serve under the draft during mobilization can receive the rank of second lieutenant and be appointed to positions with the rank of colonel. Requirements: Of course, we are talking about positions that correspond to the profile of official activity, acquired experience and specialty. Such servicemen continue to undergo military service under the draft during mobilization, the document says. So there is no requirement to sign a contract. There is also no requirement that they undergo appropriate training before being appointed to the position. However, it will still be necessary to learn later. According to the instructions, in the future such servicemen will be sent to professional military education courses (L-courses) to obtain the appropriate levels of military education. It should be noted that the primary officer rank can be obtained by privates, sergeants and senior officers who have a higher education not lower than a bachelor. But they need to undergo military training under the officer training program. By the way, sergeants who do not have a higher education can also receive the rank of officer. To do this, you need to sign a contract, as well as have combat experience and experience as an officer. You can read about it in more detail here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/05/vyshha-osvita-ta-dosvid-kerivnoyi-roboty-yak-mobilizovanym-ryadovym-ta-serzhantam-otrymaty-oficzerske-zvannya/	2025-03-04T20:40:30-08:00
Onslaught of the hybrid generation: the United States is testing a new reconnaissance vehicle that c...	According to portal DefensePost, the next stage of testing took place at the annual exercise Combined Resolve 25-1 at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany, during which the car was driven by servicemen from the 3rd Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division of the US Army. During the conducted practical tests, the high potential of the NGTV-H for performing complex reconnaissance operations was revealed, as the new vehicle allows soldiers to collect and transmit critical intelligence data on the battlefield in difficult conditions. The tests are part of the US Army's ongoing effort to modernize its capabilities to meet the changing demands of today's battlefield. The new equipment was delivered as part of the Transformation in Contact initiative, which allows testing new developments in conditions close to combat. This hybrid diesel-electric light reconnaissance vehicle could be a potential replacement for the legendary Humvee, which has served the military for more than 40 years. Market analysts emphasize the fact that the new NGTV-H vehicle was presented at the annual conference of the Association of the US Army only in October 2024. While there is currently no formal requirement to replace the Humvee, the NGTV-H's hybrid electric technologies could meet the Army's new needs for mobility and energy efficiency. The NGTV-H is based on the Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD ZR2 platform. It is equipped with a Duramax engine with an advanced 12-module battery, supplemented by motors on the front and rear axles, which is already used in the Army's Infantry Squad Vehicle. The car combines a diesel engine with an electric battery capable of producing up to 300 kilowatt-hours of energy and has a 15-gallon (56.7 liter) fuel tank. One of the key advantages of the hybrid system is the -silent mode-. These features allow the NGTV-H to utilize Silent Drive and Watch technologies, greatly enhancing stealth capabilities. Thanks to the electric battery, the car can operate without engine noise, which is especially important in combat conditions. Switching between modes is carried out by pressing one key. This reduces the military's dependence on additional batteries: from 48 pounds (21.7 kg) of batteries per platoon during operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield, this figure has now increased to 1,200 pounds (544.3 kg). NGTV-H helps reduce this burden significantly. The car is equipped with numerous safety features, including rollover protection, anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control and advanced camera systems that provide a 360-degree view. The NGTV-H is designed to meet the challenges of today's battlefields, offering capabilities such as: The vehicle can be transported by C-130 and C-17 aircraft, as well as transported by CH-47 Chinook or MH-53 King Stallion helicopters. -Our NGTV-H represents a transformative mobile solution that offers significant tactical advantages through the use of GM's proven commercial technologies,- said Steve Dumont, president of GM Defense. Although the Army leadership is only beginning to integrate hybrid-electric technologies into combat vehicles, tests in Europe could speed up the process. The use of NGTV-H not only meets modern requirements for energy efficiency, but also opens up new opportunities for the application of such technologies on the battlefield. The testing of this hybrid tactical vehicle is another step in the direction of quieter, greener and more mobile military vehicles capable of meeting the future needs of the Army. Once fully operational, the new tactical vehicle is expected to significantly increase the stealth of reconnaissance operations and provide units with better mobility in difficult terrain. The US Army is testing a new Next Generation Tactical Vehicle-Hybrid (NGTV-H) hybrid pickup.

Lies until they get caught: enemy fakers spawned a scarecrow about -bloody ZSushniks-	This -information creation- actively uses enemy resources, accompanied by edited screenshots of Ukrainian media. Allegedly, our fighter, returning from the front, opened fire on the child. Logic? What is the logic? The main thing is to spread panic and sow hatred for the Armed Forces. And now let's get down to the facts. The fake is based on a real event that happened in February 2023 in Boryslav. A man named Mykhailo Petrunyak, not a military man, but a civilian, fired a shot from a modified flare gun, wounding a 15-year-old boy in the thigh. The court found Petrunyak guilty and he received the appropriate punishment. But how to make the -terrible truth- about the -bloody ZSushniks- out of it? It's very simple: we take a real news item, add the words -fighter of the 21st OMBr- - and voila, a new narrative is ready. This is not the first time. Russian propaganda has tried more than once to link Ukrainian military crimes that they did not commit. This was the case with the fake about the -murder of the TCC employee- and with the alleged -punitive executions of civilians.- Everything is simple. The Ukrainian army is one of the main targets of the Russian information war. After all, strong, motivated soldiers supported by the people are what Moscow fears the most.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/05/breshy-poky-ne-spijmaly-vorozhi-fejkoroby-rozrodylys-lyakalkoyu-pro-kryvavyh-zsushnykiv/	2025-03-04T20:04:53-08:00
EW-dismantling: how our drones disable enemy systems on the left bank of the Dnieper	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. -We are making the enemy's REBs safe - several systems have been destroyed on the left bank of the Dnieper,- the brigade succinctly reported. This operation is an important step in the fight against Russian aggression. EW systems allow the enemy to jam signals of communication, navigation and control of drones, which greatly complicates the work of the Ukrainian military. As ArmyInform reported, -Oops. It seems that Santa forgot to give someone a gift,- the fighters of the 126 separate brigade of territorial defense said with irony, publishing a video of a jewelry strike according to the occupants.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/reb-demontazh-yak-nashi-dronari-vymykayut-vorozhi-systemy-na-livomu-berezi-dnipra/	2025-03-04T11:55:29-08:00

Weather-dependent enemy assaults - the enemy attacks -under the weather- in Chasovoy Yar	Ivan Petrychak, representative of the press service of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyny telethon. According to him, the enemy storms -under the weather.- Snow, fog, rain - the enemy becomes more active, because then the -eyes- - Ukrainian UAVs - cannot see. -In normal weather, we detect these groups and destroy them far away on approaches. But when the weather worsens, they already have a chance to get closer to the positions of our infantry. Then there are shooting battles, the infantry enters the battle and cuts off the enemy. When drones can fly, they cut off the enemy on approaches,- Ivan Petrychak noted. As reported ArmyInform, in the Novopavlovsk direction, in the operational zone of the 37th separate marine brigade, compared to last week, enemy activity has decreased somewhat, the number of attacks has decreased.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/meteozalezhni-vorozhi-shturmy-v-chasovomu-yaru-protyvnyk-atakuye-pid-pogodu/	2025-03-04T11:28:37-08:00

Ecocide in Donbas: the occupiers turn mines into a source of poisonous water	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. The fake -government- of the so-called -DNR- headed by -Vice Prime Minister- Andrii Chertkov plans to -purify- mine water from at least five mines. However, unauthorized mine water pumping will lead to groundwater and soil pollution, as well as landslides and subsidence. -The fact that the unauthorized pumping of mine waters does not lead to a local problem, but to a potential environmental disaster, does not stop the Kremlin's plans. It threatens nature, people's health and the stability of entire regions,- the Center of National Resistance emphasizes. Meanwhile, the Kalmius River has turned into a floating landfill for industrial emissions, domestic waste and sewage. This is happening against the background of a total fresh water crisis in the temporarily occupied territories. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian occupiers have deployed a new filtration camp in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, where they forcibly detain local residents. The camp is designed for 1,000 people and is designed to -test the loyalty- of residents of recently captured settlements.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/ekoczyd-na-donbasi-okupanty-peretvoryuyut-shahty-na-dzherelo-otrujnoyi-vody/	2025-03-04T11:13:14-08:00

The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -It took 7 seconds to repulse an enemy assault in Rubizhny,- says -Rio-. Then, at the beginning of a full-scale invasion, the enemy assault group consisted of seven invaders, five of whom were in his crosshairs. -I said hello to everyone. It all took 7 seconds — and the assault was over,- the fighter recalls. -Rio- is a person with positive energy. His nickname seems to hint at life on the beaches of Copacabana, surfing and football. However, in war he is a ruthless hunter who strikes fear into the enemy. -The main task of a sniper is to eliminate the enemy. How exactly - there are many options,- he explains. Among the main difficulties in the work of -Rio- singles out drones. -They are very disruptive. Especially with thermal imagers — they are constantly looking for our positions. You have to be careful. And you still have a lot of weight, constant cold. His -heap of weight- is about 40 kg of equipment: a sniper rifle, an assault rifle, camouflage materials, a supply of food and water, chargers, ammunition. Sniper -Rubigue- works with different calibers - from 308 to 50. However, he calls the UAR-10 rifle the main weapon: -It is a golden mean between range, accuracy and weight.- During the war, he eliminated enemies both at a distance of 10 meters and at 1100. But he notes that he is not chasing records. -The main thing is to complete the task,- he says. And he adds: -There is a sniper as long as there is wind.- As ArmyInform reported, -It's probably a little easier for me to fight because I'm a hunter,- says 33-year-old Olexandr. from 32 separate mechanized brigade. He spoke about his experience of fighting on the front lines, where -on the battlefield, every day seems like an eternity.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/7-sekund-do-pekla-snajper-rio-rozpoviv-yak-samotuzhky-zupynyv-shturm-okupantiv-u-rubizhnomu/	2025-03-04T10:42:00-08:00
Motorcycles were used to get to Romania: a ferryman with a client was stopped in Transcarpathia	informs about this. The perpetrator came up with a scheme according to which he and his client were to ride motorcycles to one of the tracts near the border, and then try to cross the snowy highlands on foot in order to get to Romania without the checkpoints.

Ukraine and America deserve a respectful dialogue and a clear position of each other - President	The video address was published on the President's website. -Today, many have one question: what will happen next with help from America? I instructed the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the heads of our intelligence, diplomats to contact their counterparts in the United States of America and get official information. People don't have to guess. Ukraine and America deserve a respectful dialogue, a clear position of each other. Especially when it comes to protecting lives during a full-scale war. Of course, we in Ukraine have received various signals for more than one week, and there was already a precedent for stopping aid. There was a stoppage of humanitarian and energy aid. There was also a stoppage of military aid — at the end of January, but then everything was quickly restored. We saw the risks. Therefore, our services — both military and special services — had time to work out algorithms for actions in case of any development of the situation. This is not the 22nd year. Now our resilience is higher. We have protection. But for us, normal, partnership relations with America are important for the real end of the war. None of us wants endless war. Ukraine will always be grateful to America for all the support it provided and continues to provide, and which works to preserve the currently rather fragile foundations of security in Europe. It's not just about our country. This is about everyone in Europe. We seek constructive cooperation. Partnership relations. One can only regret what happened in the White House instead of our negotiations. But we must find the strength to go on, respect each other, as we always respect America, Europe, all partners, and do everything together to bring peace closer. And I thank everyone who supports Ukraine in this. Today I already spoke with the President of Finland, with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, with the Prime Minister of Greece, with the Prime Minister of Croatia, with the Secretary General of NATO, with the leader of the German CDU party, Friedrich Mertz - this is the party that won the recent elections to the Bundestag. Clear support for Ukraine. Thank you. There is very important news from the European Commission regarding substantial funds for the defense of Europe. For us, this is primarily additional air defense — additional systems, additional missiles, an additional opportunity to defend our cities and villages, our positions. And all this creates a good additional basis for working to end the war. We will continue consultations, and there will be new joint steps. Ukraine deserves peace. Ukrainians deserve respect. And the last thing. We know that the Russians have not changed their positions and demands regarding Ukraine. They will demand the reduction of our army, they will want a legal relinquishment of our territories, as well as a significant political deformation of Ukraine with a weakening of the Ukrainian Constitution. And I will say that in fact, as long as we all in Ukraine stand together and firmly, as long as we are here, no one will succeed — the peace will be worthy,- assured Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As ArmiyaInform reported, Volodymyr Zelensky declared that he is ready to work under the leadership of Donald Trump for peace. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/ukrayina-j-ameryka-zaslugovuyut-na-povazhnyj-dialog-i-chitku-pozycziyu-odne-odnogo-prezydent/	2025-03-04T10:18:21-08:00

And also about the powerlifting competition. -Sport is my motivation,- he says. -He helps me adapt to reality.- He appeals to his brothers: -Take care. Remember your relatives who are waiting for you. And never forget what you stand for. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleksiy Sereda, chief sergeant, technician of one of the navigation systems of the 114th tactical brigade of aviation, known by the nickname -Panda-, told an incredible story of his combat experience in the Vovchan direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/koktejl-z-endorfinu-dofaminu-ta-serotoninu-pablo-pro-te-shho-vidchuvaye-operator-drona-koly-nyshhyt-okupantiv/	2025-03-04T05:43:41-08:00

The training and training center of the SSO: we will teach, prepare, check, and then everything again in a circle,- the defenders commented. The main goal of the small unit tactics training phase is to prepare well-trained and highly qualified groups capable of successfully operating in dynamic conditions, adapting to various external factors. Cadets of the SSO Qualification Course undergo intensive training in realistic conditions. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces together with the gunners of a friendly unit destroyed the newest the Russian 2С43 -Malva- self-propelled artillery installation, which the occupiers began to produce only in 2023.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/pidgotovka-v-realistychnyh-umovah-yak-vijskovi-prohodyt-q-kurs-speczpryznachencziv/	2025-03-04T05:26:00-08:00
They hit armored vehicles, crushed the infantry - our drones showed their hits	The video of combat work was released on March 4 on the brigade's channel. -No dugout, no armored car, no occupier will hide from the -birds- of our brigade. FPV drones accurately find the target and destroy the enemy where he feels -safe-. Targeted. Mercilessly. Efficiently. Death to the enemies! Glory to Ukraine!- - said in the message of the brigade. Polish paratroopers are included in the list of military units where the -Contract 18-24- program operates. As reported by ArmiyaInform, military counterintelligence of the SBU together with soldiers of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade of the Polish Army conducted another special operation, which demonstrates that in the ranks of the Russian army there are those who value money more than -ideology-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/urazyly-bronetehniku-rozgromyly-pihotu-nashi-dronari-pokazaly-svoyi-vluchannya/	2025-03-04T05:09:16-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, several hundred people have already applied to the 28th separate of the mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign under the new project -Contract -18-24-. As a reminder, -Contrakt 18-24- is a voluntary initiative that allows Ukrainians in the specified age category to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine for one year. The project offers a decent financial reward, professional combat training according to NATO standards and social guarantees that no civilian profession can provide.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/nadijni-pobratymy-i-shyrokyj-vybir-speczialnostej-lyczari-pro-perevagy-sluzhby-za-proyektom-kontrakt-18-24/	2025-03-04T04:54:44-08:00
From the stadium to the trenches: the occupiers turn athletes into -cannon fodder- for TOT	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. -Traitors will combine military service with training. However, given the exclusion of the Russian Federation from a number of sports competitions and the world's non-recognition of the occupied territories, it is possible that the athletes will still have to finish their sports careers and be eliminated on the battlefield,- the Center of National Resistance emphasizes. In fact, the occupiers use athletes as -cannon fodder- despite their athletic achievements. This is another example of how Russia disregards human lives for its imperial ambitions. The National Resistance Center calls for information on collaborators and traitors who aid the occupiers in their criminal activities. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian occupiers have deployed a new filtration camp in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, where they forcibly detain local residents. The camp is designed for 1,000 people and is designed to -test the loyalty- of residents of recently captured settlements.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/vid-stadionu-do-okopu-okupanty-peretvoryuyut-sportsmeniv-na-garmatne-myaso-na-tot/	2025-03-04T04:36:45-08:00
From the stage in the center of Moscow called to kill Ukrainians: Ivan Okhlobystin was informed of t...	This was reported by the SBU on March 4. According to the investigation, in September 2022 he became the headliner of a concert-meeting on Red Square in Moscow, which took place on the occasion of the fake annexation of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine to Russia. -Then Okhlobystin directly from the stage called for the continuation of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, the killing of Ukrainians and the seizure of new regions of our state. In addition, the SBU documented other speeches of the person involved, where he campaigned for the spread of the Kremlin regime throughout the territory of Ukraine,- the report says. The SBU noted that for public support of racism, in particular war crimes of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin regularly honors the figure with various awards as an ideological propagandist. Linguistic expertise initiated by the Security Service confirmed the facts of the attacker's subversive activities for the benefit of the aggressor country. Based on the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service notified Okhlobystin of suspicion under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: -Since the suspect is hiding on the territory of Russia, complex measures are underway to bring him to justice for crimes against our state,- the SBU said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service collected the evidence base and reported suspicion to the Russian singer-propagandist Grigory Lepsveridze, better known by his stage name -Leps-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/zi-sczeny-u-czentri-moskvy-zaklykav-vbyvaty-ukrayincziv-povidomleno-pro-pidozru-ivanu-ohlobystinu/	2025-03-04T04:16:00-08:00
-Passport or death-: the occupiers are depriving Ukrainians of medical care at the TOT	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. From January 1, 2026, TOT residents will not be able to receive medical care without the so-called -OMS policies- (compulsory health insurance). It is impossible to issue this -policy- without a Russian passport. -Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the Russian side has continued to implement a large-scale campaign of forced issuance of passports in the temporarily occupied territories. The occupiers call this process -caring for local residents-, but in fact these actions are an illegal way of subjugating, controlling and destroying the national identity of Ukrainians,- the Center of National Resistance emphasizes. In fact, the occupiers present Ukrainians with a choice: either accept Russian citizenship or remain without access to medical services. This is another step in the policy of forced assimilation and genocide of the Ukrainian people. The National Resistance Center reminds that forced passporting is a violation of international law. As reported by ArmyInform, in the temporarily occupied Luhansk region, collaborators are organizing forced blood donation drives for Russian military personnel fighting in Ukraine. Events have become mandatory for all employees of budget institutions and students of local pseudo-universities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/pasport-abo-smert-okupanty-pozbavlyayut-ukrayincziv-na-tot-medychnoyi-dopomogy/	2025-03-04T04:05:19-08:00

In Toretsk, the enemy suffered numerous losses, but did not give up their aggressive intentions to capture the Ukrainian city. -Another episode of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The invader decided to blow up the building using anti-tank mines. However, this was his last combat mission in his life - the detonator did not work,- the message reads. Your browser does not support video. As a result, Ukrainian fighters eliminated the occupier with sniper fire, and the FPV drone operator put an end to this story. -The drone hit the invader directly. The battle for the city of Toretsk continues. Our defenders choose the right to live freely in extremely difficult conditions. Soldiers of the guard battalion, together with other adjacent units, are desperately defending Ukrainian land,- the military assured. It is noted that this footage was filmed by the 4th guard battalion of the 101st separate guard brigade of the General Staff named after Colonel General Gennady Vorobyov. As reported by ArmyInform, from this unit heavy battles are being fought with the Russians in Toretsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/hotiv-pidirvaty-budivlyu-ale-ne-spraczyuvav-detonator-nashi-bijczi-likviduvaly-nevdachlyvogo-okupanta/	2025-03-04T03:47:24-08:00
The defense forces struck strategic objects of the fuel infrastructure of the Russian Federation	informs the General Staff of the ZSU. In particular, in the Rostov region of the Russian Federation, the oil pumping infrastructure of the occupiers, involved in the provision of the invading army, was damaged. Heavy explosions and fire were recorded in the target area. There are also hits on the production facilities of the Syzran Oil Refinery in the Samara region. The enemy actively countered with the means of radio-electronic warfare and air defense. A fire was recorded at the enterprise. In addition, there is information about powerful explosions in the Sokhranovsky district of the line-production management of main gas pipelines in the Rostov region of the Russian Federation. Detailed information on the consequences of damage to objects is currently being clarified. As reported by ArmyInform, on the night of February 28, the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroyed a storage warehouse for thermobaric ammunition of the Russian invaders in the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk oblast, in Selidovoy district.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/syly-oborony-zavdaly-udariv-po-strategichnyh-obyektah-palyvnoyi-infrastruktury-rf/	2025-03-04T03:37:17-08:00
The Russians are not allowed to accumulate - in the Kharkiv region, assaults are nipped in the bud	Volodymyr Degtyarev, a representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade, told about this on the air of -Suspilny-. According to him, if you analyze the losses of the enemy in February, you can see an interesting trend - there are more dead enemies than wounded. This trend may be due to the fact that the enemy has less movement and more crowding. And the enemy practically does not use heavy equipment, hiding it underground. -Because we have created such ``kill zones'' for them. That is, dead zones — from their positions and a dozen kilometers to the rear, which are controlled from the air by our FPV and strike drones. We destroy their shelters, destroy their logistics, stop their equipment. Over the past month, we burned more than a dozen passenger cars. The only tank that we managed to destroy was standing in a closed position,- said the representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade. As reported ArmyInform, in the direction of Sumy, UAV calculations of the 15th mobile border detachment -Steel Kordon- were arranged a real -safari- on the occupiers. Thanks to the vigilance of the border guards, several enemy shelters where Russian soldiers were holed up were discovered.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/ne-dayut-rosiyanam-akumulyuvatysya-na-harkivshhyni-shturmy-znyshhuyut-u-zarodku/	2025-03-04T03:32:52-08:00

If the new specifications for men's underwear were approved as early as February 2024, then such underwear for female defenders - only at the beginning of 2025. The following specifications have been approved for men's and women's underwear: Both underwear are available in three colors: Coyote, Olive Green and Black, and also include sizes from XS to 3XL. The Director of the Department of Procurement Policy of the Ministry of Defense, Hleb Kanevskyi, said that in 2024 and 2025, the procurement agency of the Ministry of Defense, DOT, purchased men's thermal underwear according to new specifications in the amount of more than UAH 890 million. -We plan to start purchasing women's samples as well. We are constantly working to improve conditions for our military. The new underwear is comfortable, wear-resistant, provides the proper level of thermal insulation and moisture removal,- he said. &nbsp; The new demi-season underwear should be made of a knitted fabric that combines 95% cotton and 5% elastane.

A woman from Kharkiv was waiting for the Russian peace, she received a criminal case	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, the suspect has been an active participant in pro-Russian chats on Telegram since March 2024, where she spread theses of Kremlin propaganda. She claimed that -Russia is not conquering territories, but liberating lands from the Nazis,- and called the Russian military -heroes.- The illegal nature of the woman's statements was confirmed by the conclusion of the forensic linguistic examination. She was informed of the suspicion due to the fact of the distribution of materials containing the justification of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine (Part 2, 3 of Article 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). -This woman, like many other supporters of the -Russian measure-, lived in the illusion that Russia would bring her -liberation-. But instead, she got only problems with the law,- the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office noted. As reported by ArmyInform, within the scope of tasks regarding increasing the level of awareness of personnel about international humanitarian law, determined by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in Kyiv for representatives the legal service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine organized and conducted a training course on operational law.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/harkivyanka-chekala-na-ruskyj-myr-otrymala-kryminalnu-spravu/	2025-03-04T02:24:46-08:00
Rapid fire: the French-English development is able to effectively counter swarms of drones	This mobile multipurpose weapon system is designed to respond to the new threats facing today's armed forces, including drones that can attack in swarms and can overwhelm conventional missile defenses. With a powerful anti-aircraft gun, a high-performance 3D radar and a versatile C2 module, the RAPIDFire is optimized to engage all types of air threats, including fighter-attack (FGA), helicopters or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), cruise missiles or precision-guided munitions. The first samples of RapidFire were presented back in 2012. In early 2014, Rapidfire conducted successful tests, hitting two unmanned aerial vehicles. RapdiFire has demonstrated its ability to rapidly engage very small targets such as UAVs, which are becoming increasingly important as reconnaissance systems as well as vehicles. The anti-aircraft turret is mounted on the back of the 6×6 truck chassis. The turret is remote-controlled and armed with a 40 mm cannon that has an effective range of 4,000 meters against air targets and 2,500 meters against ground targets. Although the gun has a rate of fire of up to 200 rounds per minute, it only takes one to ten rounds to hit a target. The RAPIDFire system was also designed to fire the STARStreak missile system, a very short-range air defense missile system with a missile speed of over Mach 3 and a range of about 7 km. The combination of six STARStreak missiles and the latest generation 40mm ammunition provide both precision attack and high firepower. RapidFire uses a variety of munitions, including Anti-Air Burst Ammunition (AA-AB) for air defense and Stabilized Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) or General Purpose Round-Air Burst (GPR-AB) munitions against armored fighting vehicles, ground forces and other ground threats. RapidFire can fire on the move for self-defense purposes. The vehicle has a total of 140 ready-to-fire ammunition in the turret (a combination of anti-aircraft, anti-missile and GPR shells) and 80 in the storage box. The APFSDS anti-armor munition penetrates 140 mm rolled homogeneous armor at a distance of 1500 m. In the firing position, the stabilization of the machine is provided by two telescopic supports with a hydraulic drive, installed on each side of the chassis. The RapidfFire gun system is mounted on a high-terrain chassis. An armored cabin with seats for the driver and gunner is installed in the front of the machine. The cabin is made of welded steel armor and provides protection against fire from small arms of caliber up to 7.62 mm and projectile fragments. There is one door on each side of the crew cabin. The cabin windows are 26 mm thick, and the cabin is equipped with an air conditioning system. RAPIDFire is highly automated, and a person is actually only needed to assign the weapon type and fire orders. High mobility is ensured by the fact that the RapidFire gun turret is mounted on the Mercedes-Benz Unimog 6×6 U2450 off-road truck chassis, but the system can be integrated on another wheeled chassis. The engine of the RapidFire car is a Mercedes-Benz LA 240 hp 6-cylinder turbocharged diesel. at 2600 rpm. The gearbox is mechanical, with 8 forward gears and 1 reverse gear. The Mercedes-Benz Unimog 6×6 U2450 can travel at a maximum highway speed of 95 km/h with a maximum range of 600 km. The RapidFire fire control system includes a gyro-stabilized sensor head, IR (infrared) day and night electro-optics with an infrared detection range of up to 18 km, and a laser range finder. Optoelectronic sensors are built directly into the turret, allowing RAPIDFire to operate autonomously if necessary. RapidFire is also immune to most known jamming technologies, thus protecting it from interference and enemy attacks. The systems receive target information from the CONTROL Master 60 surveillance radar and the CONTROL View command and control module, manufactured by Thales. This C2 system controls up to six RAPIDFire units simultaneously. To enter firing mode, the RAPIDFire machine stops and communicates with the controller, which takes about one minute. Optoelectronic sensors are mounted directly on the turret, so the gun can operate even if it is not connected to the surveillance radar. The gun can open fire within 4.5 seconds after the target is detected by the radar. RapidFire has a reaction time of 4.5 seconds from target detection to readiness to fire. RAPIDFire systems can be coordinated with CONTROLMaster 200 or CONTROLMaster 60 control stations. The CONTROLMaster family is based on GROUNDMaster radars.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/strimkyj-vogon-franczuzko-anglijska-rozrobka-zdatna-efektyvno-protystoyaty-zgrayam-droniv/	2025-03-04T02:18:41-08:00

During the event, military experts discussed key aspects of the institutionalization of the study of combat experience, the modernization of the military training system, and the impact of combat analysis on military innovation. -Today, the Armed Forces of Ukraine already have a system for studying and implementing combat experience. In addition to collecting information and summarizing reports, special groups are being formed in military-scientific institutions. They work directly on the frontline, analyze the situation and develop recommendations for the necessary changes,- noted the head of the Department of Innovative Activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Vitaliy Dobryanskyi. The importance of such measures is difficult to overestimate, because Ukrainian combat experience is unique not only for national defense, but also for international partners. The exchange of knowledge contributes to the improvement of military strategy and increasing the efficiency of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in modern conditions. As reported by ArmyInform, within the limits of tasks regarding increasing the level of awareness of personnel about international humanitarian law, determined by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in Kyiv for representatives of the legal service The Armed Forces of Ukraine organized and held a training course on operational law.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/ukrayinski-vijskovi-obgovoryly-vprovadzhennya-bojovogo-dosvidu-na-mizhnarodnij-konferencziyi/	2025-03-04T02:07:53-08:00
The new EU rearmament and support plan for Ukraine: what it entails	She announced this in a statement on March 4. The first part of ReArm Europe's plan is to unlock the use of public defense funding at the national level. -Member states are ready to invest more in their own security if they have the financial space. And we should give them that opportunity. That is why we will soon propose to activate the provisions of the Pact on national security,- said Ursula von der Leyen. This would allow member states to significantly increase their defense spending without resorting to the excessive deficit procedure. For example: if member states increase their defense spending by an average of 1.5% of GDP, this could create fiscal space of around €650 billion over four years. The second proposal will be a new tool. It will provide member countries with 150 billion euros in defense investment loans. -It's basically about spending better — and spending together. We are talking about pan-European areas of capabilities. For example, anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense, artillery systems, unmanned aerial vehicles with missiles and ammunition and anti-drone systems,- said the President of the European Commission. This will help member countries to combine demand and make joint purchases. With these purchases, member states can also significantly strengthen their support for Ukraine. The third point is the use of the EU budget. The European Commission will offer additional opportunities and incentives for member states, as well as provide an opportunity to use cohesion funds to increase defense spending. The use of these funds does not require unanimity, so countries such as Hungary or Slovakia will not be able to block these decisions. The last two areas of activity are aimed at mobilizing private capital by accelerating the work of the savings and investment union and through the European Investment Bank. -Europe is ready to take responsibility. The ReArm Europe initiative can mobilize almost €800 billion for a safe and resilient Europe. We will continue to work closely with our NATO partners. This is a turning point for Europe. And we are ready to take a step forward,- concluded Ursula von der Leyen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/novyj-plan-pereozbroyennya-yes-ta-pidtrymky-ukrayiny-shho-vin-peredbachaye/	2025-03-04T01:54:32-08:00

-This is a win-win situation-: recruits will help the 92nd brigade implement a new assault concept	Mstislav Banik, head of the recruiting section of the 475th separate assault battalion of the 92nd separate assault brigade, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti- href=-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4XONrDJWsc-> According to him, in general, 18-year-old boys who want to be stormtroopers and 18-year-old boys who want other positions apply to the recruiters of the 475th assault battalion of the 92nd brigade. And also older people of various abilities. The battalion is looking for everyone who will help implement its assault concept. -Our idea is that drones will destroy everything, create a dead zone from enemy positions. Then, accordingly, the assault infantry will enter these positions, finish them off, occupy places. It must be of very good quality, so for us &#8220;contracts 18-24&#8221; very important,- said the head of the recruiting section of the 475th separate assault battalion. According to Mstislav Banik, the demand for the positions of stormtroopers is quite high. Despite the fact that this job is probably the most difficult in the army. -For many, this is a ticket to life. An opportunity to get some career growth, earn money. Many guys who apply for such contracts are from the village. They have problems with work, problems with creating, providing for a family, and so on. But this is not 100% of our audience. There are guys from big cities who say: well, it's time to destroy my enemies, too,- noted Mstislav Banik. The state offered an excellent solution, he notes. It's a win-win for everyone. And most importantly, current recruits will be able to form an exceptional elite within assault battalions and assault brigades. -Guys get an opportunity to sign a contract for just one year. And after that, have both reservations and the importance of going abroad. You can earn up to $80,000 this year. That is, these are all absolutely real numbers and, accordingly, the Armed Forces will win in this way, because there are young personnel, young guys who are really ready to carry this burden and perform such difficult tasks,- summarized the head of the recruiting section of the 475th separate assault battalion of the 92nd separate assault brigade Yakreported ArmyInform, the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk is one of the six brigades participating in the -Contract 18-24- project. She already has her first recruits. The recruits received the first payments under the contract — 200,000 hryvnias — and have already started training.

The Russians attacked Sloviansk and Kramatorsk: two correctional officers were detained	This was reported by the SBU on March 4. As the investigation established, the enemy tried most of all to find out the locations of the bases and logistics centers of the Defense Forces, which are involved in hostilities on the eastern front. In order to obtain the coordinates for the fire damage, the occupiers remotely recruited two local residents. One of the traitors turned out to be a 47-year-old resident of Sloviansk. -In August 2024, the man came to the attention of the military intelligence of the Russian Federation when he published pro-Kremlin comments on social networks. After the recruitment, the agent monitored the locations of the largest concentration of personnel of the Ukrainian troops, in particular in the areas of checkpoints at the entrances to the city,- the report says. Also, the suspect tried to identify warehouses with ammunition and repair stations for military equipment of the Defense Forces. He passed the collected information through -Odnoklasniki- to his old friend - a fighter of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation, who is fighting near Bakhmut and cooperates with the Russian special services. Another traitor turned out to be a 37-year-old factory worker in Kramatorsk. -The man worked for the FSB, which recruited him through a Telegram channel, where he made -posts- in support of the occupiers. On the instructions of the Russian special service agent, the agent went around the area, and also took pictures and marked the locations of Ukrainian troops on Google maps,- the SBU said. The SBU officers detained the suspect when he was preparing an intelligence -report- with the coordinates of potential targets. -Investigators of the Security Service informed both detainees about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrators are in custody. They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property,- the SBU said. As reported by ArmyInform, the guard of one of the Kharkiv hotels, who did not have patriotic beliefs and helped the Russian Federation to correct strikes in Kharkiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/navodyly-udary-rf-na-slovyansk-ta-kramatorsk-zatrymano-dvoh-koryguvalnykiv/	2025-03-04T01:21:59-08:00

Electronic referrals to the VLC in Reserve+ now contain the exact date and place of the medical exam...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. The innovation is part of a large-scale reform of the VLK, which involves the digitization of procedures and the improvement of the regulatory and legal framework. The corresponding changes were approved by Order No. 4 of January 3, 2025. According to the document, the heads of the TCC and SP, as well as the heads of the recruiting centers of the Armed Forces, will form referrals to the VLK in electronic form by means of the Unified State Register of conscripts, conscripts and reservists -Oberig-. Citizens will be able to submit a request and receive this document in the -Rezerv+- application. Electronic referrals are available both for those who wish to go through the commission on their own, and for those who have already received a paper summons to the VLK. It is enough to make a request in the application. -Time is one of the most valuable human resources. The update will allow you to pass the commission without unnecessary visits to the TCC, papers and long queues. I am glad that thanks to Rezerv+ we are helping our citizens free up time for important matters,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. A paper version of the referral, printed from the registry, will be available if needed. In this case, the document will necessarily have a QR code with all the necessary information and will be registered in the journal in accordance with the requirements established by Government Resolution No. 560 of May 16, 2024. It is also possible to receive a paper referral in the form given in Appendix 11 to the Procedure for the Conscription of Citizens for Military Service During Mobilization, for a special period approved by CMU Resolution No. 560. In particular, this refers to citizens who, during martial law, expressed a desire to mobilize directly to a selected military unit. In this case, the commander of the military unit is obliged to inform the territorial manning center about the issuance of the corresponding referral, and the commander of the TCC - to enter this information in the -Oberig- register. As reported by ArmyInform, since the beginning of 2025, with the assistance of the Central Department for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights (TSUZPV), 156 issues of defenders have been resolved and their families based on the results of processing applications and requests from them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/elektronni-napravlennya-na-vlk-u-rezerv-teper-mistyat-tochnu-datu-ta-miscze-prohodzhennya-medoglyadu/	2025-03-04T00:33:06-08:00

Your browser does not support video. -Hunters became victims. -Enemy drone pilots are a 'fat' target and this time it was destroyed,- the message said. According to the description, the Russian operator calmly left the dugout, launched the drone, and then returned to adjust the fire. However, the Ukrainian military watched his actions. -Next is pure tactics. One dugout, the other&#8230; FPV drones have caught up with them everywhere. As a result, these -pilots- will never take to the sky again,- the brigade notes. As reported by ArmyInform, the soldiers of the 108th separate mountain assault battalion of the 10th OGSHBr -Edelweiss- demonstrate an indomitable spirit and a constant desire for improvement. Even the most experienced fighters who have passed through the hottest points of the front do not stop training, because honed skill is the key to victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/ne-vstygly-zapustyty-yak-uzhe-pryzemlyly-rosijskyh-operatoriv-bpla-likvidovano-razom-iz-blindazhem/	2025-03-04T00:24:43-08:00
-Heating - according to the weather, water - according to the mood-: how the occupiers -take care- o...	informs about this the head of Luhansk OVA Artem Lysogor. According to the invaders' logic, warmth in homes is an optional factor of comfort. They took their time to restore the infrastructure, and now proudly report on the completion of the work. The residents of these cities spent the last three winters without heat, but now, perhaps, they will finally warm up. If, of course, the -tests- are -successful-. And if spring does not come earlier than heating. Another -victory- of the occupiers is the struggle with water supply in Lysychansk. Despite the attempt to start the system, there are more breaches than the hours during which people actually receive water. In the remote areas of the city, water supply was forgotten a long time ago - the delivery of drinking or even technical water was stopped as early as the summer of 2024. So, the occupying power once again proved that the comfort and safety of people is the last priority for it. As reported by ArmyInform, at night the Russian troops carried out another massive attack on Odessa using attack drones. The attack damaged the city's energy infrastructure, leading to emergency power outages in some areas.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/opalennya-za-pogodoyu-voda-za-nastroyem-yak-okupanty-pikluyutsya-pro-tot-luganshhyny/	2025-03-04T00:08:18-08:00

About the Polish -Kraby- near Pokrovsk, interaction with the 117th brigade and Russian stormtroopers...	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform managed to visit one of the control points of the 157th brigade and record an interview with the deputy commander of the 3rd mechanized battalion Artem with the call sign -Historik-. A man from the Poltava region voluntarily mobilized at the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. Got into the 53rd brigade as an ordinary soldier. He led a platoon near Vugledar, where he was severely wounded by shrapnel from a tank shell. He went through a long treatment and recovery. He received the rank of officer in Odessa following an accelerated training course, because he had a higher education. After the formation of the 157th brigade, he was offered a position there. Artem talked about the combat situation, the enemy's tactics near Pokrovsk, how many enemy attack aircraft our infantrymen manage to destroy in a day, about the battle with Russian -ssoshniks-, which units of the Russian army are the most difficult to fight, and also about what the Rashists tell when they are captured. - Artem, tell us about the daily difficult tasks performed by the infantrymen in your unit's area of ​​responsibility. - Currently, the 3rd mechanized battalion is performing defensive tasks. In some places, there can be maneuver defense, and we also carry out assault actions. We storm the enemy, repulse his positions, improve our tactical position. It cannot be said that this is some dull defense or an attack. That is, the situation on the battlefield, I would say, is floating and rapidly changing. Everything, of course, depends on the combat situation. - What are the advantages of maneuverable defense? - They consist in the fact that we can withdraw a little, free some space for the enemy to enter. What is it for? For example, the enemy enters there in the evening, and we come in the morning and storm this position. The enemy either surrenders or we destroy him. That is, how it works: we leave the enemy a place, he thinks he is entering new positions, occupies them, but in fact he walks into our trap. Because we either undermine these positions or leave certain secrets in order to restore them again later. That is, our first task in defense is to inflict maximum losses on the enemy, which we are now coping with, which is confirmed by objective monitoring of destroyed enemies. - A bit about statistics. How many enemies can be destroyed in a day? - It happens differently. It can be from three to 15 people. Now the enemy is constantly storming. And if, for example, there is such a situation that today two means of fire work against the enemy, then tomorrow more may already work. And it depends on how many enemies we destroy, so the number of forces involved is important. After all, the first priority for us is to use firearms and protect people. People are the most important and ultimate trump card going into battle. - What exactly are the weapons of fire used by your unit to destroy the Russians? - Unmanned systems. In addition, Western models of weapons, for example, MK-19, show themselves quite well. This is an analogue of the AGS-17, an automatic grenade launcher plus mortars show themselves well. Engineers also do a great job. That is, these are mine barriers, the creation of obstacles, for example, -jagoza-, which makes it difficult for the enemy to move, and we can direct him into our -channel-. We can even involve a UAV that drops a piece of -yagoza- into a trench or somewhere else. What is a -jagoza-? This is such a twisted barbed wire, where a grenade is attached to the trigger in the middle. And when this piece of -jagoza- is dropped, the grenade explodes and it unravels. Then it is already difficult to pass the enemy in a certain area. And taking into account the fact that the main roads and logistics in the fields are outlined by the presence of forest plantations, these actions force the enemy to go out into the open. This helps a lot on the front end. — Are drones, -efpivishki- already connected? —Yes. In some cases, if the assault is more or less massive, artillery can be connected. These are, for example, self-propelled artillery installations of the KRAB type. Of course, FPV drones and drones with resets, without them there is no way. We can also involve neighbors' firearms. For example, we currently have a very close interaction with the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade. They engage their firepower in tandem with ours. On the other hand, if we need more firepower to suppress the enemy, they are happy to join in immediately. Such interaction helps to destroy the enemy more effectively and faster. There are no dividing lines, everyone understands that today is bad for you and tomorrow will be bad for me. Therefore, there is full interaction. —Small assault groups, how does the enemy use them near Pokrovsk? — The enemy has been using small assault groups for a long time. The offensives, both chaotic and not, are fairly well organized. For example, today we are being stormed by a separate motorized rifle company of Rashists, it is divided into groups. Lately, the enemy has been trying very hard to penetrate our defenses, but nothing has come of it. In addition to ordinary infantrymen, even units of special operations forces of the Russian Federation took part in the campaign. This was objectively captured by drones. These were groups of 4-5 people who are equipped with binocular night vision devices and who attack at once from two directions. How do they work? They need to capture a certain point that is on the map, it is key. dashers deal a diversionary strike on a primary point, and can land a primary strike on a secondary point. And the enemy thinks that he will distract us with his actions and come from a completely different direction. But the Russians have already tried this more than once, but it does not work and will not work. Some absolutely absurd situations happen. It even got to the point that the enemy sent people without weapons, body armor and helmets into the attack. At first, they concentrated themselves on the positions in the forest strip and tried to simply move forward. It was a group of eight people, we destroyed them with heavy bombers -Vampire-. Although if we had known that they were unarmed, we would have simply captured them. The thing is that at that time it was not very clear in the landing what kind of weapons they had and what they had. But even after the first bomb drop from -Vampire- it was clear that these people did not understand what was happening at all. There is such a concept that people have not even learned to be afraid. So we completely destroyed them all there and, to be honest, we were a little surprised. But, according to Russian prisoners of war, such tactics are practiced by the enemy. For example, a person refuses to go to a position. At first, she is physically and morally -processed- somewhere in the basement. And then she still goes to our positions, but without anything. This is simply to -illuminate- the fire point or distract our main fire means while some other fire group does its work. —Regarding prisoners of war of the Russian Federation. Who are these people, from which units? What do they say? -We captured servicemen of the 5th and 110th motorized rifle brigades, various separate battalions, Storm-Z units, etc. Our battalion took about 15 Russian prisoners of war directly in this area where we are now standing. If you divide them into social strata, then, in general, they are different people. But the vast majority are those who were threatened with prison terms or who were already in Russian prisons. For example, there was a prisoner from Krasnoyarsk, a soldier of the Russian Federation from the 5th brigade. He is 61 years old, he did not serve two years for the murder of his own son and decided to go to war. — did the Rashists come to the colony and incite him? —He himself wanted to go to fight. There were also prisoners from the temporarily occupied Yasynuvat district of the Donetsk region. Mobilized. One boy was 21-22 years old. You ask him: how old were you in 2014, he says, 10 or 11 years old. That is, you already understand for yourself that the generation in the occupied territories has already grown up. And already consciously or maybe unconsciously, with weapons in their hands, they are going to fight against us. But he had another story - the threat of prison time. And the RF system always offers a choice. Either-or. So they go. There were also representatives of various regions of the Russian Federation: Siberia, Krasnoyarsk, Kemerovo, Stavropol. They come in -packs-, and you understand who is from which region. —Who is currently the most skilled and combat-capable of the Russian units? Who is it difficult to fight? -The most skilled are the line units of the Russian army, contract workers who have been serving for a long time. And, of course, these are special operations forces. But they did not always show themselves from the best side. We had a case: a night assault was going on, all Russian military personnel have expensive and high-quality equipment for conducting combat operations at night, etc. Yes, they stormed our trenches. And Russian special forces in the number of 7 people thought that they had caught our guys by surprise, but it turned out a little differently. And when we flew in -Mavik- with a thermal camera to see what and how there is. Our guys already chased these Katsap -ssoshniks- around the trenches so much that they didn't know what to do with them. They only did what they shouted - -Surrender, we are Russian spetsnaz.- And our guys answered: -We are Ukrainian tractor drivers. And today we are -bumping- on you. Fought to the last. Unfortunately, some soldiers were injured, but in general they fought back and held back the invaders. For such cases, we always have a reserve that can come to the rescue. Ours jumped into the trenches, and there, accordingly, tied up the occupiers with a fight, until the -Vampire- flew up with big bombs - and our bomber then simply gave these -suckers- hell. In our area, the enemy is trying to break through in various ways. For example, with the involvement of technology. Of course, it is less here, because even according to the words of the Russian prisoners themselves, logistics in them suffers greatly. They, from Ocheretyn, go to their positions on foot. They tried a mechanized assault once, but we planted anti-tank mines early and that was the end of it. I did not observe other methods of using mechanized assaults. This was a one-time promotion. —What about the use of motorcycles, buggies, etc.? —Yes, they do, but it is in my area, and this is confirmed by the words of Russian prisoners that they walk. They are simply given the order to go and go. Or, for example, it happens like this, the Rashists storm, we inflict fire damage, they retreat. And even then we watch how the occupiers move 400-500 meters away, and then their walkie-talkie -breaks- and they turn around and go back. - The prisoners themselves say: either to storm or die - there is no choice? - Yes. Most often, those who understand everything themselves are captured. There were cases when enemies simply killed themselves with a weapon or blew themselves up with a grenade. Somehow there was a situation, we discovered the enemy's positions, then there was a shelter in a forest plantation. We -ironed- them with -Vampires- all night, after that one live raschist got out and surrendered. It is not known if there were any more wounded, no one else came out. So, we were thinking of taking this one rashist prisoner, but we didn't have time. The Russians killed him with a drop from a drone. They shot right at him, although he was whole and unharmed. That is, they took the life of their own soldier. —How do you manage to capture the Russians? — There are also people sitting in the positions. And they have a rather difficult morale. When I talk to a prisoner and ask: -How many of your people are sitting there?- He says, -12 people.- I ask if they will surrender. The occupier says that 10 people will give up like that and 2 won't. I say, why not two? He answers because they are ideological, in the Russian army since 2014, their main task is to -hold- the situation in position so that others do not surrender. Therefore, as an option, we use Russian prisoners so that they convince -their- soldiers to voluntarily surrender to captivity, that they have a chance to survive, to keep their lives, that such a chance will no longer exist, that the Russians will die during the assaults or that their commanders will shoot them. And it works. First of all, such tactics save the lives of our servicemen, why go into battle, suffer losses, get wounded, if you can force them to leave calmly and surrender. Especially since the firing position itself is not destroyed and can be occupied. - What can you tell us about the positions of the Russians, how they are arranged, their daily life, etc.? -Their daily life boils down to one thing, how they live somewhere in -Khrushchevka-, where, sorry, everything is planted, the same way they behave in the positions. The only thing worth noting is the pattern of Russian officers. For example, if they make a position for a mortar somewhere in the rear, it will be equipped -according to the last letter of the book.- And there will be people who will do this work. Again, they have more manpower to set up a mortar position, because a lot of earth cubes have to be thrown away. As well as doing the appropriate work to properly disguise this position, and they have the resources to do so. They don't use tractors, they have people for that. - the Kremlin has always been spitting on people. - Yes, even -interceptions- show the attitude. For example, if the Russians dig something there and complain that they have neither water nor food. They are answered: if you do not dig so much, you will not be given water or food, and you will not be changed here at all. This often happened near Avdiivka. And so, they, like obedient slaves, wave a pickaxe and everything is fine. When we allow Russian prisoners to call their relatives in the Russian Federation, any of them begins their dialogue by telling their relatives that the Ukrainian army is fighting for each of its wounded, trying to -pull out- its -200s-, and he has never seen such a thing in the Russian army. We had a case when we were carrying prisoners and came under fire. Then one of the prisoners helped pull our -300- and even covered it with himself. And then that Russian also thanked the Ukrainian military that he survived and that they saved his life. There are different people, for example, they stormed the dugout, and we knew for sure that there were two -Wagners- there, we really wanted to capture them. Moreover, there was some evidence that they had committed war crimes against Ukrainians. And then another prisoner we took, he, by the way, was also from the 110th brigade of the Russian Federation, says that the -Agnerov- shot themselves, they did not want to be captured. As evidence, he showed their brains on his back. By the way, this Russian soldier has been passed on and will be exchanged. Once we had 5 prisoners, and they asked to record an appeal to the military court of the Russian Federation, where they asked not to abuse the Ukrainian military, not to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. - And how do the Russian occupiers explain their war crimes, why do they shoot our soldiers, how do they justify it? -The answer is always the same - we are not like that, there is no such thing in our unit. That is, complete -frost-. —Tell us about the organization of work at the battalion's KSP? —In general, this is interaction. The structure of the unit is made so that communication and objective control of positions are the first and most important. That is, our UAV pilots who are on duty here, plus there are calculations at the very positions. We constantly see a 24/7 picture of everything that is happening on the battlefield, at the front edge, to identify the enemy on the far flanks and inflict fire damage on them before they come within shooting range of our infantry. That is, it is actually a battle control point. Continuous review and monitoring. Close contact with company commanders, who are located a little closer to the front edge and manage their soldiers. We have developed a clear cascade system -from top to bottom- and, accordingly, back. This is such a -blood circulation- of information that is constantly moving, there is a constant exchange of information. All our work is aimed at only one thing - to destroy the enemy. - What are your capabilities for conducting aerial reconnaissance deep into the enemy's battle formations? -If we talk about the battalion level, then most often for reconnaissance we use such boards as Mavic during the day and Mavic 3T at night. We also use FPV drones. The brigade already conducts more in-depth reconnaissance with the use of such reconnaissance boards as -Stork-, etc., which are used for reconnaissance and detection of enemy firepower. If we see that one of our positions is being shelled, we immediately find out where the shelling is coming from, the frequency of shelling, and then pass this information on to the brigade. The brigade immediately monitors the nearest populated place from where the shelling is taking place, and accordingly directs a reconnaissance plane there and engages fire means to suppress or destroy the enemy. We also apply -fire on the ban.- That is, there are certain serifs where Russian mortars, Grads, guns can be located, and there is a possible concentration of the enemy. There is a preemptive strike. This works very often and helps stop the shelling. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, sometimes the enemy is camouflaged in such a way that it is very difficult to detect a firearm.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/pro-polski-kraby-pid-pokrovskom-vzayemodiyu-iz-117-brygadoyu-ta-rosijskyh-zekiv-shturmovykiv-intervyu-zastupnyka-kombata-157-ombr/	2025-03-03T23:47:03-08:00

Danylo Borysenko, chief of intelligence of the anti-aircraft missile and artillery division of the -Rubizh- brigade, told about this on the air of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. In the Kupyansk direction, there was one assault attempt in the area of ​​the settlement of Zagryzovy, in the Lymansk direction there were 13 attacks in the Novopavlivka and Yampolivka areas. They also tried to storm in the Seversky direction - in the Bilogorivka area. According to the officer, the enemy's tactics remain unchanged. These are -volumetric- artillery attacks, including rocket salvo systems. Also, the enemy uses aviation with KABs and FABs, a lot of FPV drones, including fiber-optic drones. -Assault actions are being tried to be carried out mainly by the tactics of small infantry groups, which are trying to infiltrate, gain a foothold somewhere in the forest strips, in the junctions between our units. If they manage to accumulate enough personnel in these areas, then they try to advance further. However, our guys are trying to destroy them even on the approaches to the battle line,- Danylo Borysenko said. As ArmyInform reported, in the Pokrovsky direction, the combined forces of the enemy reach approximately one combined army. These are tens of thousands of people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/optovolokonni-drony-aviacziya-ta-obyemni-obstrily-pidtrymuyut-ataky-rosijskyh-shturmovykiv-na-shodi/	2025-03-03T23:28:04-08:00

At first, he used the drone for reconnaissance — monitoring approaches to enemy positions and actions. But his own initiative turned into a profession. -I was a machine gunner, and I used UAVs for security. It helped to see the enemy, his maneuvers, act in advance,- says -Lemon-. Its crew consists of four people, and together they inflicted heavy losses on the occupiers. -Lemon- himself stopped counting the destroyed enemies when their number exceeded fifty. Bohdan felt a qualitative difference in the 46th brigade of the DSHV - in security, approaches to combat, level of armament. -It's grown-up here,- he says. Its task now is not only reconnaissance, but also targeted damage. He does not regret his choice, because he feels the main thing is confidence in his siblings. -In war, many things lose meaning. But brotherhood is something I've come to believe in even more,- Lemon concludes. His drone continues to fly, and he himself does everything every day so that the invaders do not have a chance. As reported by ArmyInform, war changes people, hardens characters and reveals the true essence of everyone. This is what happened to the soldier, known by the call sign -Afghan-, who today transfers his combat experience to recruits of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/sidav-na-kasky-okupantiv-operator-bpla-lymon-pro-svoyu-robotu-na-fronti/	2025-03-03T23:07:19-08:00

-Even if my legs were torn off, I would fight-: -Afghan- is an instructor who went through the hell ...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Before the war, he worked at the Toyota factory abroad, assembling cars. However, on February 28, 2022, -Afghan- left everything behind and returned to Ukraine. Tried to mobilize through the TCC, but was refused. He could not sit at home - he signed up for the Teroborona, and later managed to be mobilized and joined the 33rd Brigade, where he became a machine gunner. His baptism of fire took place on June 7-8 during the Zaporizhia counteroffensive. He was in the front lines on the M-113, serving as a platoon leader. The battle was successful, after which the enemy trenches had to be cleared. On June 14, -Afghan- received a shrapnel wound - a mine exploded four meters from him, shattering the meniscus. The impact was so strong that the helmet simply broke off. Despite the pain, he managed to walk more than 150 meters to the shelter, where he received first aid. After the evacuation, doctors removed two fragments, two more remained in the leg forever. Despite this, the fighter did not leave the service. After treatment, he returned to the unit, was a driver, a gunner-medic. Later, his experience and methods of training fighters attracted attention. He was offered to train recruits in the newly created platoon of instructors. At first it was planned to be a short-term task, but later it became clear that his method works. -Afghan- was sent for training: first in Ukraine, and then in Great Britain, where he was trained by Norwegian instructors. -The Norwegians were impressed by our skills. They even called their families, talking about us with pride. We gave them a Ukrainian flag, which one of them hung at home in a place of honor,- recalls -Afghan-. But the most important thing that he acquired abroad was the military training methodology. Now, every day of his life begins with motivation for new recruits. -Our enemy is cunning and insidious, but not immortal. Don't be afraid of him. We are Ukrainians, we are not timid. When we show our teeth, the occupiers will be scared,- -Afghan- tells his charges. He is not worried about his fate, but he is worried about his brothers. Teaches them that in battle the main thing is to survive and win. -Victory will come when the shelling stops, when the brothers return to their families, and Ukraine liberates all the occupied territories,- -Afghan- is confident. And until that day comes, he continues to impart knowledge and train warriors who will change the course of history. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleksiy Sereda, chief sergeant, technician of one of the navigation systems of the 114th tactical aviation brigade, known under the call sign -Panda-, told an incredible story of his combat experience in the Vovchansk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/navit-yakby-vidirvalo-nogy-ya-b-voyuvav-afgan-instruktor-yakyj-projshov-peklo-vijny/	2025-03-03T22:27:26-08:00

An incredible escape from captivity: the story of a Czech man who impressed even the enemy with his ...	But everything changed in February 2022: military comrades from the Defense Forces of Ukraine said that it was time to turn back - Russia was preparing for a full-scale attack on Ukraine. Oleksiy did not renew his contract with the private military company where he worked for 12 years. He immediately wrote a report and flew to Ukraine. Everything that followed is more reminiscent of a movie script than the real life of a real person, a movie about evil and faith, about inner strength and physical pain, about torture and safety, about a father's example and about male dignity. And about many things and meanings. This story, which the correspondent of ArmiyaInform recorded in one of the capital's medical institutions, is about Oleksiy with the nickname -Czech-. He is currently undergoing rehabilitation after his injury. He is 41 years old, the chief sergeant of a company of one of the units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Then his story: in direct language, without unnecessary words. -I served the military service from 2003 to 2005, I really liked it. Signed a contract for another three years - from 2005 to 2008. During the time when I was in contract service, familiar friends were part of the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent in Iraq. They talked a lot, shared their impressions. And when my contract ended, some of my brothers decided to go to the Middle East to work in one of the private military companies. Duties include oil well security, paramilitary security, official escort, etc. At the time, it was an attractive proposition, plus it paid well. One of the main requirements is at least a basic level of English to understand the commands you receive over the radio. Therefore, in 2008, I did not renew my contract with the Armed Forces. The contract worker's salary was not enough to support the young family, in 2007 the son Yaroslav was born. I liked being in the army, but there was not enough money. Since 2010, I started working abroad, while improving my English. Rotation schedule: 12 weeks work, four weeks off. So I worked for 9 months, I was with my family in Ukraine for three. At the beginning of 2010, my salary was 7 thousand dollars per month. Then, in 2014, global oil prices fell, and wages fell after that. In 2022, this amount was 4 thousand dollars. It was difficult when my son started growing up. As soon as I started to pack my suitcase before leaving, Yaroslav climbed into it and said that he was coming with me. My son is my main strength and motivation. There have been many difficult situations in life when it seems that something is about to break in you. And then you say to yourself: -You have a son, and by some parental example you should show how it should be done.- Now he is already 17 years old, and he is a professional athlete for me - he is engaged in mixed martial arts. At the age of seven, he started practicing judo&#8230; And when he was still very small, he was only one year old, maybe just learning to walk, he saw me doing some physical exercise in the morning, let's say, push-ups from the floor, and he tried to repeat the exercise himself (smiles). I talked a lot with coaches about what a child should start doing, and that's how he first came to judo, and then things went downhill. There were many Ukrainian military personnel in our group that worked with in Iraq, and in 2022 we had an understanding that there would be a full-scale war. Comrades from the Defense Forces of Ukraine also wrote and explained that it was worth returning. We had no doubts. We wrote reports, the management of the company went to meet. It helped as much as it could. I returned to Ukraine on February 14, 2022 without renewing the contract. From Iraq, transfer in Istanbul, from there to Boryspil. My colleagues' rotation in this company ended on February 25, 2022. The wife was in the Czech Republic, the son was still in Ukraine. On February 24, we were at home with our son when we realized that a full-scale war had begun. Next to us was a military camp - everything was audible. Son was evacuated from Ukraine on February 28. And two cats in carriers. And March 1 has already arrived in Dnipro. My comrades and I knew in which unit we would serve, we did not plan to go to the Military Commissariat. There were five of us, we knew each other because we worked in the same team abroad for several years. As a small volunteer formation, we joined one unit, some of their groups were already working in the Raisin direction. Was in the rank of sergeant. Received the call sign -Czech-. Why -Czech-? At one time, my wife and I decided that we wanted to live in the Czech Republic. My wife's mother has lived in this country for 20 years, and when there were holidays and I went to visit my relatives in the Czech Republic, my brothers asked me to bring delicious Czech beer (laughs). That's how he got the call sign - -Czech Republic-. Although I do not speak Czech. Next was the Izyum direction. And here he could not apply all his experience gained abroad. Yes, in some cases it makes sense - in terms of preparation and so on. But not countermeasures to the Russians: Pod*ar aviation was very active, our air defense did not work like that. Yes, some MANPADS calculations knocked them down, but the Russians calmly entered our airspace and delivered Kharkiv or Izyum. They were flying at very low altitudes, I could make out what was written on the wings of the plane, etc. It was difficult, but it is important which unit you are in. An experienced and competent commander is important. Clear and step-by-step action planning is important. It is important to consider the number of the enemy and their weapons. And when all this is announced at the briefing before the task, then each of the group understands their actions in the future and what depends on them. In the Izyum direction, the scale of how the Russians climbed: in columns, was impressive. I have never seen this in any movie. I remember how we were in the village of Hrushevakha. A river divided this village. When our Defense Forces took control of it and the bridges over the river were blown up, then the Russians tried to make pontoon crossings across the river. Among our tasks, in particular, were adjustments and mining. Then there was Raisin itself, and the work of the artillery was also adjusted. Then there was Kharkiv, the ring road, the village of Pyatikhatki - they started working there from the middle of April. There was a gray area, near Ruska Lozova. Forest. And here we had tasks: to find the enemy's firing points, to identify enemy DRGs, their routes, etc. At that time, our group did not have drones, we collected information on our own. At least 10 km were walked every day - through a dense forest, in gear. The exits were for at least two or three days. One of these tasks was carried out on May 8, when the counteroffensive of the Defense Forces began. We needed to conduct surveillance on one of the sections of the road where the Russians could advance. And then we found the forester's house, next to it was a section of the road. And it was our mistake, or we were a little relaxed and did not take into account that in the middle of the forest the house is an obvious landmark, I don't know&#8230; We understood that we would have to stay for three days, there was no desire to dig in, it was cloudy, not the best weather. So we decided to set up our observation post not far from this house. Two hours passed, and the mortar shelling began, the mines were falling very densely. And the landmark-house played a wicked joke on us: they hit it. We started to leave, but there was a flight, and one of the projectiles very badly wounded my brother Roman in the leg. The fragment entered the knee, through the entire thigh and lodged in the hip joint. We pulled him away and began to administer first aid. But we understood that we had gone deep for 12 kilometers, and it would be difficult to carry him back the same distance. We had no luggage with us. It was difficult to communicate due to the topography of the area. Colleagues decided to move a little further to get in touch with another group and explain the situation. I stayed with the wounded man, gave him painkillers. And about 40 minutes later, I saw some silhouettes among the trees with my side vision. At first I thought it was ours coming back. There was no feeling of anxiety. There wasn't even a thought that you should put on the equipment - it was lying nearby. As the people came closer, I realized that it was already under. In balaclavas. My brother was in pain shock, periodically screaming. I warned him that we had -guests- and asked him to endure the pain. I tried to stretch it, about 5 meters at the most. I tried to get in touch with my relatives, but there was no connection. Therefore, he said to his friend: -Roma, let's press as low as possible to the ground.- I had no thoughts of leaving him. There was still hope that this core of the DRG could pass and not notice us. But visual contact was made, and in about 10-15 minutes they began to take us into a semi-circle. I understood that I would have time to put on the bulletproof vest. Weapons are nearby, grenades are nearby. They started throwing grenades at us. Three -ergedeshka- flew, one of them fell near my leg and I managed to push it away. Debris hit the leg and right side. Then there are the short lines. Hands and blindfolded. He managed to hear something like: -He is heavy, we will not drag him through the forest.- And as for you, everything depends on you: if you go, you will live.- I tried to stand up, felt pain. Then there was a road through the forest for approximately 30 minutes. Then they were transported on some type of quad bike, then thrown into a truck. And then they started to find out who I am. I was saved by the fact that I had no phone, no military ID, no tattoo. I came up with a legend that was as true as possible, although I listened to a lot of idiotic questions. However, they did not learn anything about my unit or the commander. He replied that we communicated only by callsigns&#8230; But it is necessary to understand that each person has his own pain threshold. Someone does not survive on the second or third interrogation, someone on the 10th. Torture began in the field camp. They said that I -can sculpt fables-, but -one corner - and you will still tell the truth.- They called that shot -truth serum,- but I didn't pay any attention to that, I'm not in a James Bond movie. Simultaneously with the interrogations, torture continued: nails, ribs were broken. All in order to break you mentally and physically. The eyes were constantly blindfolded. And the same question could be repeated several times during the interrogation. I was alone in this field camp, interrogated mostly by contract officers of the Russian army. Then I was brought to some other place where there were cells and basements. There were also other prisoners. During these few days, my hands were constantly tied and very tight. I even thought that their blood circulation had already stopped because it didn't feel as if they were dry. I just didn't feel them. And I went to the first interrogation already at the -new- place. I am a person of faith, and the Lord gave me strength that I did not have any panicky moods. I was just going over it in my head and reminding myself what I shouldn't say and what I should make them believe. And where I should confuse them as much as possible. During the interrogation, one should behave as calmly as possible. Because as soon as they feel weakness, they get pleasure from it. Yes, I understand that everyone feels pain. But everyone can somehow control this pain. And during all these interrogations, they kept asking me: -Are you stubborn? Masochist?-. I said no. I was questioned: -Do you like being fucked?- Just say so, and we'll wake you up later.- All this took place on May 9-10. It was the third day that I was in captivity, and the second hour of interrogation. I haven't gone to the toilet all this time. All my fingers were broken, my nails were torn. Asked to go to the toilet. They asked if he had ever peed his pants. Then they pointed to the tapik and its wires&#8230; When the interrogation ended, I was taken to the toilet and my hands were untied, but I did not feel them. I asked to remove the tape from my eyes. I was led to the toilet. But I had military pants with a bunch of buttons, plus a belt I just couldn't handle with my numb hands. I was asked why it took so long. To which I replied that my hands did not work. Then the second Russian came up and said to the first one: -Unbutton his shirt.- And he replied: -What, I'm going to unbutton the dill?-. And he did it. After some time I realized where I was - this is Hoptivka, our border point. Before, there were no cameras there, just some rooms and a grid welded on top. Prisoners were kept there: both military and civilian. Concrete floor, humidity&#8230; The next day, a paramedic came, provided help, and gave analgin. Then a facebooker started working with me, there were long interrogations. Working in Iraq saved me a lot. When I started talking about it, they kind of switched gears. They called me a mercenary, although I appealed to the fact that their companies also work there. They wondered what the salaries were, for example&#8230; Then they sent propagandists with a camera - forced to give interviews. They asked why I, as a native of Donetsk region, do not defend my native region on the side of the Russians. In other words, they tried to break as much as possible. But I felt the support of loved ones, even at a distance. I understood that they would cut out of this interview and publish only what they were interested in. And I said this: -I have a son, he is now 15 years old. And now I'm in captivity, nothing depends on me, I can't defend myself in any way. But I don't want my son, who is 15 years old, who is now a young man, to see his father chewing snot on camera and then being shown on all Telegram channels. For him, it will be a psychological trauma for the rest of his life. He is an athlete. What example will I set for him if I only think for my own skin?... But it is important for me that my son thinks that his father is not a traitor.- To which the chief replied: -Well, you are stubborn&#8230; Nabazaril dohyera, I would have shot you already. But you answered like a man.- And I sit and think: -Wow, they also give compliments-&#8230; After that, everyone left, only one remained in a balaclava, and suddenly points a gun at me&#8230; I checked that I am not in the basement, there are no blood stains on the floor - that is, there is clearly no shooting here. He stood like that, saw that I had no reaction, lowered his weapon and left. After that, I was no longer called for questioning. After that, I was already transferred to Kupyansk to a temporary detention center. I spent another four months there. The memory of my son and faith in God helped me. Six people sat in solitary confinement: three prisoners of war and three more criminals who were imprisoned for murder. They were -settled- with us. Summer has begun. There was some kind of holiday in the pod*riv - the day of their pod*rstan. They came to us and told us to learn the Russian national anthem. They gave a piece of paper with the text&#8230; I didn't even touch it. Others began to teach. Then they look into our cell and ask: -You are stubborn, you don't understand where you got to?-. I replied that it was not my holiday, but theirs, and they called me a moron. Two hours passed, my guys from the cell said that I have nothing to prove to anyone, and that I am not in solitary confinement, but everyone can pay for my stubbornness. Then I asked one of the guards to transfer me to solitary confinement. To which he replied that during the evening inspection he would f*ck my cellmates until I learned the national anthem. I had no choice, I had to learn that hymn. Although I understood that we would be filmed on a phone and it might be published somewhere. I was in a very confusing situation and I didn't know how to do the right thing. There were 12 cameras in total and everyone started singing in turn. And our camera just hummed. And the warden replied that now he will cheer us up - he took out a tear gas grenade and threw it into our cell. And closed the door. Tears, snot, saliva flows&#8230; It's still hot, because it was June&#8230; And once they brought a girl - thin, young. It can be seen that she is some kind of drug addict. She was also placed in a cell, waiting for interrogation. I asked for a cigarette. The guard replied that if he squats 500 times, then he will let him smoke. And she starts squatting: 10 times, 20 times, 200 times! And counts out loud! We all wondered how it would end! She squatted 500 times in one breath. And got a well-deserved cigarette. These 500 times are very memorable to me, because I have never squatted 500 times myself. We were forbidden to do any physical exercises at all. Our camera was never taken out into the courtyard for a walk. Then, when we were transferred to another, larger cell, I started to do some physical exercises. Little by little, I started with prints from the floor. I started, and within a week the whole camera joined my physical training. But those 500 squats are very stuck in my head&#8230; From July to September I trained. In the end, I was able to squat three times for 500 times! And he did push-ups, standing on his hands on the floor. Every night, falling asleep, I mentally thanked God for giving me the strength to live another day. At the beginning of September 2022, we heard the first explosions. The guys from the camera assumed that probably ours started to press the bottom. On September 6, there was such a strong arrival that those who were lying on the bunks were hit. And the apartment flew out with an explosive wave. The next day we were warned that there might be shelling and that we should hide under the windows at night, in case of shelling, so that the glass would not fall on us. And at night it was just as bad - the grill on the windows even bent. The defense forces of Ukraine did press. We heard machinery moving outside, heard an artillery duel. We understood that the counteroffensive was going on, but we did not understand how it would benefit us. There was a feeling of incomprehension. The guys from the neighboring cell said that they have no windows at all. There was silence in the corridor - no one. It turned out that the guards were so scared and ran away that they even left the keys to the cameras. Comrades from the neighboring camera were released. There were some 120-130 people. We still wanted to find our personal affairs in the offices and burn them. Although there was a risk that the fall would return. Then I suggested that the last one who goes out, let it just set fire to the room, because if 100 people start looking for their business, it can be a long time. One of the guys who sat with us was from Kupyansk nodal. He knew all the routes and trails. Therefore, he is our statement. He led us to the house where we were able to eat, dress. When we ran across the bridge in Kupyansk, it began to shine. Under ** the equipment began to retreat, the city battles continued &#8230; Subsequently, a friend took us on the car, we went to the house. It was September 8. I was captured on May 8. Exactly 4 months. For the first time during this time he was normal. And turned on the TV. It turned out that we released raisins, Balaklium, and the direction of Kupyansk developed. And in a few days our brothers met a neighbor who, as it turned out, worked on a*duty &#8230; During a brief conversation, it became clear that we need to run. And it was necessary to swim across the river. He gave us bicycles, and the three of us started traffic. I still asked if this is a picture that is a picture of bicycles in the village? ( laughs ). Well, they went. Thank God that there was no to meet. We reached the river, heard enemy drones hung above us. The river sailed, they got the right bank - and there is our -espe-. There were our boys there - we looked at them, and they were at us. They explained the situation, we were told in which way to move. We went to the checkpoint, we were told that we will be checked by representatives of the VSP from Kharkiv. They interviewed us and then punched us on their base, asked what military unit. And we were a volunteer formation, we had nothing on a military ticket. In the end, they punched: Sashko was as prisoners of war, and I was missing. He did not remember the phone numbers, but remembered the group commander. He contacted him - he called back in 5 minutes. They were talking, I was glad that I was found, he already wanted to pick me up the next day. But at first I had to negotiate a military counterintelligence. Later, I was taken away by the commander, then there was a hospital in the Dnieper. And yet - an official investigation to find out the circumstances of how I was captured, where I was and so on. Such investigations always begin after captivity. But for me, it was the worst thing about all this that some people thought that I shot my brother Romk, switched to the*River side. And so I was on the lists not as captured, but missing missing, because it seemed to move to the side of the enemy. It was very difficult for me &#8230; Because these were shot by the Russians. I learned about it in the field camp. And then I was told that the body of Romka was taken away by our brothers from another subgroup in two to three days. The official investigation lasted for about three months. Yes, after all, I was released from captivity. And when communicating with military counterintelligence staff, they stated that they had not yet met such cases when people were released from captivity. Physical form and hardening in captivity came in handy when they overcome the river and the plot to the river. I know one thing: the power must be maintained, because without physical form it would be very difficult. And psychological stability is important. I always return myself to my son, a professional athlete. When I was given 30 days of vacation after injury and treatment and I went to the Czech Republic, I went to workout. He fights athletes, older than he, somewhere 20-year-olds and older. He only 17. I somehow said it could be difficult for him, because it is objectively stronger. To which he answered to me, -Dad, how difficult it could be here, if you were in captivity and in the video said that you did not want your son to see that you were weak.- And these words are important to me: that I, as his father, did not break in captivity. And he remembered his son. My son is a motivation for me as I am for him. He gives me the power of the internal as I do. After captivity, I continued service in the army, but in another unit. In 2023 he participated in a counter -offensive in the Zaporozhye direction. In the Verbov area he was injured. He was a little late and returned again. In the summer of 2024 they worked in Vovchansk, then transferred to the time of Yar. It was difficult because Vlad was killed with the call sign -hookah-. He is the son of a military man, with whom we started in 2022 in one group. There was a guy very volitional, bold. His body could not immediately pick up &#8230; And my brothers and I followed him. Under*the Drones were very active. Even before we approached the landing - we worked for us both discharges and mortars. All the boys from the group were injured. I have been treating and rehabilitation for the fourth month. The wife with her son is very worried about me &#8230; What are my plans for the future? Rehabilitation so far. I want to note work with a psychologist. Earlier, she thought she would have a little result, but that's not. I advise everyone. Next - VLK. It is necessary to determine my condition and whether I will continue to military service in the position I occupy. Because the main sergeant of the company is the position responsible, one must be an example for your subordinates &#8230; But there may be another position related to the preparation of personnel, say. What is my dream about the future? Do you know what profession I may be interested in? .. There is such a profession in the Czech Republic - a beer taster. So she would fit me (laughs). And this is my little dream - to tasting beer on small brewery &#8221;.

-Listen, who is speaking?-: new deepfake audio from the Russian Federation	The fake recording is distributed through pro-Russian Telegram channels and -anonymous insiders- who specialize in -biolaboratories-, -secret plans of the West- and other conspiracy stories. However, this time the technique was clearly not enough for a high-quality editing, because the deepfake reveals itself immediately: The logic of Russian propaganda is simple: throw a fake into the information space and see if someone will pick it up. In the best case for the Kremlin, one of the Western fringe politicians or journalists will take it at face value. At worst, the propagandists will simply indulge in the imitation of -treason- in the West in order to somehow justify their failures at the front. These methods have already been used before: the West is -tired of Ukraine-, then -the Americans admit defeat-, then something else from the same series. But every time these information attacks fail, because the world has long understood that all Moscow's statements must be divided by at least ten. You might think, -Well, fake and fake, who cares?- But the problem is that Russia is not just generating informational garbage - it is trying to create an alternative reality. Deepfakes and false narratives are aimed at undermining trust between allies and weakening support for Ukraine. What will be the next fake? Maybe the voice of Barack Obama, who -admits- that he is working for Ukraine? Or Joe Biden, who -offers- to transfer all NATO military equipment to Russia? Kremlin scriptwriters do not stop fantasizing, but the reality is this: deepfakes will not help win the war. And while Russian propagandists stamp new -revelations-, on the front, their troops suffer not at all virtual losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/04/sluhaj-hto-govoryt-nove-dypfejkove-audio-vid-rf/	2025-03-03T20:02:00-08:00

According to him, the attacks do not stop and follow one scenario. Stormtroopers are either dropped to the Defense Force position on -armor- or, more often than not, they just go on foot. -That is, two infantrymen are coming. They reach a certain fortification, after that they form a group of 8, 10 or more people, and then storm our positions. We are trying to destroy as many of these groups as possible at the stage of formation,- Maksym Bilousov said. Also, according to him, it is necessary to stop the equipment at the entrance - so that it cannot land the landing party. And it is also important to destroy it completely, so that the next attack aircraft do not use the -armor- as a cover. Precisely because the enemy's equipment is burning very actively, the current mechanized assaults cannot be compared with last year's. -There was such a so-called tsar-mangal, when there were huge superstructures on tanks. And there were also -king-REBs- - it seemed that mistletoe was growing on trees, this was approximately the number of REBs on the tank. Now the number of mechanized assaults has decreased,- said the head of the communications department of the 60th separate mechanized brigade.

Russians are really getting fewer techniques. That is why we increasingly see -interesting- videos. -When the Buryats on ponies ride across a snowy field - something like the Battle of Kalka. If it had been 800 years ago, they would have looked very scary. But we have already passed the stage where at least something looks exotic. Unless some Yakut militiamen will come on the moose,- Viktor Tregubov said. As ArmyInform reported, the Defense Forces managed to partially stabilize the enemy's advance in the Pokrovsky direction. However, the Russians are pulling up reserves and using a large number of personnel, evenly -pushing- across the entire width of the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/03/hiba-shho-yakutski-opolchenczi-na-losyah-na-shidnomu-fronti-rosijska-armiya-vse-bilshe-peretvoryuyetsya-na-ordu/	2025-03-03T03:37:36-08:00

26 GCS mechanized demining machines will be delivered to Ukraine in 2025	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on March 3. Representatives of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine visited the production facilities of the Swiss-German company Global Clearance Solutions in Germany, which develops and tests GCS demining machines. The visit took place at the invitation of the management of the Ukrainian branch of this company. The GCS-200 unmanned multi-purpose platform, samples of which the partners handed over to one of the military units of the Support Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine last year, has a number of modifications. As a tracked machine, it is very maneuverable and can turn in places with a minimum radius of about four meters. The project is financed by international donors, in particular the governments of Germany, Switzerland, Canada, the USA, Great Britain, and Lithuania, as well as through the United24 platform. The use of mechanized demining machines reduces risks for the deminer and speeds up land clearing processes. This was emphasized by Colonel Yevhenii Zubarevskyi, head of the department for the organization of mine action activities - deputy head of the mine action department of the Main Directorate of Mine Action, Civil Protection and Environmental Safety. -The Global Clearance Solutions company is one of the world leaders in the production of robotic complexes for demining, the equipment of which is part of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the State Special Transport Service, the State Emergency Service and the National Police. It is actively used in demining the territory of Ukraine,- he said. According to him, these are reliable modern complexes that have shown their effectiveness during the execution of works. -It is important to note that the company provides a full range of services to the Security and Defense Forces, which includes training and technical support for its vehicles. In addition to mechanized demining machines, Global Clearance Solutions is developing the latest technologies for automating the demining process with the use of UAVs and sensors to search for explosive objects,- Yevgeny Zubarevsky noted. As reported by ArmyInform, the long-term plan for the development of Ukraine's demining potential for 2024-2034 envisages the allocation of 700 mln to our state euros from partners for the purchase of equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/03/do-ukrayiny-postavlyat-26-mashyn-mehanizovanogo-rozminuvannya-gcs-u-2025-roczi/	2025-03-03T03:02:10-08:00

This -businessman- in uniform agreed to sell ammunition, weapons and other weapons to Ukrainian defenders. And all this is for personal enrichment. -They fight for money. We are for victory!- - is succinctly commented in the 95th brigade. It seems that the Russian military is not only -demilitarizing- its own equipment, but is also ready to -demilitarize- its own warehouses. Not for free, of course. As reported by ArmyInform, the project -Contract 18-24- is gaining momentum, and applications are increasing.

This was reported by the head of the Ukrainian state on his page. -Over the past week, the enemy has carried out more than 1,050 drone strikes, launched almost 1,300 aerial bombs and more than 20 missiles. This is the purposeful destruction of Ukrainian cities and the killing of our people,- the head of state said. The President emphasized that those who really want peace do not strike the civilian population with ballistic missiles. That is why it is necessary to strengthen international support for Ukraine in order to stop Russian attacks. -We must focus on strengthening our air defense, supporting the army and creating effective security guarantees that will prevent the return of Russian aggression,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. The head of state emphasized that justice must prevail, and Ukraine believes in the power of unity and the restoration of a just peace.

-Iron Support-: How ground-based drones are helping Defense Force fighters on the front lines	A photo report of the combat work of ground drones was published on the brigade's page. -The direction of ground drones in our country is developing very quickly and is setting trends for the entire robotics industry in the world,- the brigade notes. Ground robotic systems perform a wide range of tasks: Over the past year, Ukrainian engineers have developed more than 200 different ground robotic systems, including logistics-evacuators, mining robots and impact robots. Their main goal is to minimize military involvement in dangerous operations. The 65th military brigades actively use Ukrainian-made wheeled and tracked drones, and also cooperate with developers to improve the technology. -Any drone must be modified to perform tasks on a specific section of the front and under specific conditions (these are electronic warfare systems, and features of the terrain and radio horizon, the minefield of the territory, the nature of the soil, and the distance from the anti-aircraft missile system),- the brigade explains. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the -Ronins- unit 65 mechanized brigade of the Veliky Lug Armed Forces hit three Russian Buk M-3 anti-aircraft missile systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/03/zalizna-pidtrymka-yak-nazemni-drony-dopomagayut-bijczyam-syl-oborony-na-peredovij/	2025-03-02T22:39:34-08:00
-Hunter- from Kharkiv region: an infantryman told about the -thoughtlessness- of the occupiers and l...	The story of the fighter was made public on page 32 of the separate mechanized brigade. Oleksandr is used to shooting with aim, but admits that he is not impressed by the very fact of killing the occupiers, but by their -thoughtlessness-. -The closest contact I had with the enemy was a few meters away. This is when the position was set up in a country house, and the occupants climbed right under the windows. Four dozen of them were already lying dead around the house. And what struck me was not the daily routine of killing the invaders with single shots, but the thoughtlessness with which they kept going and going at our bullets,- he says. The occupiers, even after seeing a large number of dead comrades, continued to advance. -If I had seen so many bodies of my comrades, I would probably have thought about whether it was worth rushing to that intersection. And these were staring eyes and pearls,- Oleksandr wonders. At night, Ukrainian fighters cut the backpacks off the dead occupiers, looking for power banks to charge radios and phones. -It was noticed that they did not even take enough ammunition with them. Usually four stores are staffed. It was as if they were gathering for the last time, in one end. Did they find an additional three packs of ammunition in one stocky man,- says the infantryman. On the front lines, every day is a challenge. -Especially now, in the cold,- adds the fighter. — We stock up on chemical warmers. Last time, the gap was covered, so they covered themselves with blankets and lit trench candles. If there is snow, then there will be no problems with water for tea. I always take my phone with me because I miss my family. There is a calm moment - I definitely look at photos with them.- Oleksandr gets into a bus to go to the positions. When asked where he gets his strength from, he answers that he does not need to be motivated, because he comes from Kharkiv Oblast and lived under occupation. -And we also dream about children with our beloved. And we want to give birth to them under a peaceful sky,- he admits.

The average age of a soldier of the US Army, the Ukrainian IDF and the eternal confrontation with th...	&#8220;On the agenda is such a question as mobilization of people aged 18 to 24. Definitely on a voluntary basis, definitely under a contract, and the package offered by the state in the financial part is truly unique in world history. Is this the right step and is it a step forward? Definitely. Let's take a concrete example: the average age of a soldier in the US Army, which is considered the most powerful in the world, is 26 years. And the average age of a serviceman mobilized in our country varies from 40 to 46 years. We must be well aware that both mental resistance and physical fitness, conditionally, of 20-25-year-olds and people who have reached the age of 40 are not one and the same. This is an absolutely balanced, reasonable and very correct step, and the fact that everything is built on both financial and ideological motivation is incredibly good. I have no doubt that at least several tens of thousands of Ukrainians will definitely follow this program. Now, again, a bit of history. We have to understand that when there are big wars, there is always a big mobilization. And I must remind you that, for example, in the United States of America during the Second World War, mobilization began at the age of 18. And if you read our Constitution carefully, protecting the territorial integrity and inviolability of our state is the duty of every citizen. And so, they say that 22-23-year-olds cannot fight: this does not stand up to any criticism, because they are the same citizens. If they want to have all the rights that other citizens over the age of 25 have, then that is their duty. Both as a citizen and as an expert, I fully support this opinion of our top military-political leadership and believe that it will be useful and appropriate. And in general, if we continue to indulge in the general philosophy, then the time will come when absolutely everyone will serve, and all men without exception should receive basic military training, starting from the age of 18. That is, we have to build the Ukrainian IDF. We have no other option in the eternal confrontation with the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/03/serednij-vik-voyina-armiyi-ssha-ukrayinskyj-czahal-ta-odvichne-protystoyannya-z-rf-ekspert-pro-proyekt-kontrakt-18-24/	2025-03-02T20:45:47-08:00
Jet gigantomania: the UAE army flaunts the world's largest MLRS with 240 barrels	However, such a decision can be explained not only by the great respect of the rulers of the leading countries of the Arab world for things characterized by adjectives of the highest degree of comparison with the prefix -nai-, but also by the not too large number of personnel in the UAE army. After all, according to the information of the experts of the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition, this monster installation, which includes weapons comparable in strength to six BM-21 -Grad- machines, and which by default has 30 artillery personnel, here there is a need for only 3 military personnel, ArmiyaInform reports. In general, analysts of the arms market noted that this multiple rocket launcher system, known as the JDS Multiple Cradle Launcher, developed by Jobaria Defense Systems for the UAE Armed Forces, is the most powerful installation of its class. It is better known by the name Jahanam, which in Islamic terminology means -hell-. Its firepower surpasses all existing analogues due to its unique architecture, which allows for the simultaneous release of 240 122 mm projectiles. The basis of the system is the concept of maximizing the number of guides in one salvo, which allows replacing an entire battery of traditional MLRS with a minimum crew. Instead of several machines working in coordination, a single platform has been created with four autonomous launchers, each of which has three transport-launch containers designed for 60 ammunition. The design of the complex is based on a five-axle semi-trailer towed by a heavy three-axle Oshkosh HET tractor. Our editors have repeatedly told in their publications about the family of these American high-powered special vehicles. But back to Jahanam. Its total length in the extended position reaches 29 meters, the width is 4 meters, and the height is 3.8 meters. The total mass of the system exceeds 105 tons, making it the largest among known jet systems. The armored cabin is equipped with protection according to the STANAG 4569 standard, which ensures resistance to the impact factors of small arms and shrapnel. For operation in extreme climatic conditions, a powerful air conditioner is provided, as well as an air filtration system to protect against weapons of mass destruction. In the initial position, the launchers are transported in a horizontal position, and when entering the combat position, they are deployed and fixed at a given angle. Four pairs of outriggers with hydraulic outriggers are used to provide stability during a salvo, which, when deployed, raise the landing gear completely off the ground. The system is equipped with its own 380V auxiliary diesel generator, which provides power for all electronic systems, including guidance and fire control. The guidance of the launchers is carried out by high-precision electric drives, while each of the four launchers can change the angle of inclination independently of the others, which allows you to fire at several targets at the same time or adjust the ballistics depending on the range. Each unit deploys in azimuth to an angle of up to 90°, and hydraulic cylinders provide angle elevation. Roketsan TR-122 and TRB-122 missiles are used as ammunition, created on the basis of Soviet shells for BM-21 -Grad-, but with improved range and accuracy characteristics. The length of the missile is 2.9 meters, the mass reaches 72 kg, and the warhead can be both high-explosive and cluster, which carries impressive elements in the form of steel balls. The effective range of fire is from 16 to 40 km depending on the modification of the projectile, and a volley of all 240 missiles allows you to destroy targets in an area of ​​up to 4 km². The rate of fire is 2 missiles per second, which means that a full volley can be fired in less than two minutes. This makes the system both powerful and highly effective at suppressing the enemy at large and large distances and areas. After the salvo is completed, the crew can either change position to avoid return fire, or reload using a specialized transport loader. Full reloading takes about 30 minutes thanks to the presence of two taps that allow two cartridges of ammunition to be replaced at the same time. This significantly reduces the time of preparation for the next salvo and increases the tactical flexibility of the complex. The fire control system is integrated with modern means of navigation and communication, including inertial and satellite systems, which allows effective coordination of fire support with other units. Built-in communications enable data transmission between batteries and command posts, enabling automated target allocation and high-precision salvo firing. All calculations of aiming angles are performed by the fire control system taking into account the data of the meteorological station, which allows taking into account the influence of wind, temperature and other factors on the trajectory of the missiles. For all its firepower, the JDS Multiple Cradle Launcher has a number of drawbacks related to its large size and limited mobility. The system is designed for use on roads with a hard surface and is poorly adapted to rough terrain, which makes it less effective in conditions of intensive maneuvering combat. In addition, the high cost and complexity of operation limit its mass production. However, for the conditions of the Middle East, where the armed forces can rely on a developed road network and the absence of dense forests, such a complex is a powerful means of fire suppression at long distances. After the first demonstration of the system at the IDEX international exhibition in 2013, the UAE Armed Forces adopted it for use. However, despite the unique characteristics, foreign countries have not shown interest in purchasing, which may indicate its highly specialized application. Later, Jobaria Defense Systems began development of improved variants of the complex, including versions capable of using heavier 300 mm missiles with a range of up to 100 km. However, such systems remain rather a demonstration of technological capabilities than a mass solution for modern armies. The development of various weapons and military equipment, aimed at improving the main characteristics, often leads to very remarkable results. The improvement of modern rocket systems of salvo fire, which pursued similar goals, several years ago led to the appearance of a unique combat vehicle JDS Multiple Cradle Launcher. As far as is known, this technique was used only by the UAE army, while other countries did not order similar combat vehicles. Such results, perhaps, clearly confirm the obvious fact: not every increase in performance makes sense and can find practical application. However, it should be taken into account that such conclusions are drawn based on the results of the study of a ready-made sample of equipment that has been tested and used in the troops.

Camels for the Wagners, captives from the Far East and EW in a backpack: the story of eight-child Is...	How did the enemy act in Bahmut? What did the captured Russians in the Zaporozhye direction tell? But how did military trickery allow the Isaiah group to seize an enemy position where 30 Russians were at once? A military man told our correspondent about it. -When the large-scale invasion began, I didn't see any other options for myself. I just couldn't stay at home. Although I also have a large family - I have eight children - but still. I have six sons, two daughters. The eldest son is also fighting. And, besides everything, I am from Kharkiv. When the enemy had already entered my city, I could not imagine anything else for myself: in any case, I had to go to fight. &#8230;We performed tasks in Bakhmut. Enemy infantry constantly stormed us there. The occupiers from Wagner fought against us. They actually know how to fight, let's not say otherwise. Because underestimating the enemy is pointless, it is a big mistake. They had small assault groups, up to 5 people at most. After they entered the building, the so-called camels went to them. These are people without weapons, with backpacks containing ammunition, food, and water. Because the assault group entered -lightly-: the equipment was normal, but they were mostly in sneakers. And these are young, trained guys. And their sports training was also quite good. These were not alcoholics or drug addicts of any kind. Later, reinforcements approached them. There was a case when we shot their senior group. Others left. We quickly took it, took the radio station and sat listening to the enemy. And, by the way, I was also wounded there in Bakhmut. &#8230;Then our unit was already working in the Zaporizhzhia direction. There it was necessary to capture the enemy. Most of them were convicts. In the same direction, there were cases when I participated in the evacuation of our wounded. One day, I, two officers and the operative on duty, because all the soldiers were in their positions, went to pick up our wounded. They took the electronic device with them in a backpack. It is necessary to understand that when you are involved in the evacuation, especially of the seriously injured, more people are needed for this, so that there is an opportunity to exchange with those who carry comrades. And we had to walk eight and a half kilometers there. At the evacuation point, we then called our quad bike, which was adapted specifically for transporting the wounded. And our guys were taken away on it. At that moment, the enemy tried to attack us with drones. We muffled something with REB. And I shot down one drone with a machine gun. There, in the Zaporozhye direction, we and a group of seven people captured 13 Russians at once in two days. We talked to them: they thought that the Ukrainians were no longer here, that the Poles were here. Well, we helped their wounded. Because I don't want to be like these scoundrels. Those we took that time were from the Russian Far East. There was also a case when again a group of seven people captured an enemy position, which was occupied by 30 Russians at once. Again, some were captured. Then we went to them in the morning. Passed through their positions: solely due to team cohesion, training and determination. Their observational posts simply put us to sleep. We approached one enemy dugout. I whisper in Russian: -Open!- From there, someone: -Are you Styopa?-. I answer: -Me, brother!-. They came out, I immediately said: -On the ground!-. There were five of them in that dugout. Then moved on to their position. They also had those who accepted the battle. But it did not help them. Because each of us thought only about the liberation of the Ukrainian land. Later, while still in captivity, we took some of them. We simply moved around them and shouted that they were surrounded and to surrender. They were misled. We then listened to their intercepts. So they thought then that there were many of us and that we were everywhere.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/03/verblyudy-dlya-vagneriv-poloneni-z-dalnogo-shodu-ta-reb-u-ryukzachku-istoriya-vosmyditnogo-isaya/	2025-03-02T20:18:49-08:00
About Russian wheat: from a savior to a tool of blackmail	Ukraine is traditionally one of the largest grain exporters in the world. However, starting in 2022, Russia is deliberately blocking Ukrainian exports, creating an artificial deficit on world markets. This leads to rising prices and threatens the food security of many countries. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal emphasized that such actions of the Kremlin are aimed at provoking global instability and hunger. While Russian officials talk about -saving- the world with their wheat, they are simultaneously engaged in stealing Ukrainian grain in the occupied territories. This grain is then sold on international markets under the guise of Russian, which is a gross violation of international law and ethical norms. Russia is not the first time using food as a means of pressure. Blocking Ukrainian ports and preventing grain exports, the Kremlin is trying to force the international community to make concessions. This is a cynical game on human lives, where hunger becomes a tool to achieve political goals. In response to Russian blackmail, Ukraine launched the -Grain from Ukraine- initiative aimed at supporting countries suffering from the food crisis. Within the limits of this program, Ukrainian grain is supplied to the most vulnerable regions of the world, demonstrating true solidarity and responsibility. Russian propaganda skillfully creates the illusion of benevolence, hiding behind it the true motives of control, blackmail and political pressure. The world community must be vigilant and not succumb to these manipulations, realizing that real help lies in supporting those who act transparently and responsibly.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/03/pro-rosijsku-pshenyczyu-vid-ryativnyczi-do-instrumentu-shantazhu/	2025-03-02T20:00:13-08:00

At the summit in London, four steps were agreed on regarding the situation in Ukraine: details	This was announced by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Keir Starmer, at a briefing on Sunday.

-Panda- from the -Mainland-: the story of an aircraft engineer who captured 11 invaders in the Khark...	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Air Command -West- of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the middle of 2024, during the planned rotation, Oleksiy was seconded to the Kharkiv National University of the Air Force to perform combat missions as part of the combined battalion -Mainland-. There he held the position of commander of the detachment, protecting the village of Staritsa in the Kharkiv region. On September 30, while at the observation post, -Panda- along with three comrades engaged in a fierce battle with an enemy assault group. -We occupied firing points and were ready to meet the enemy,- Oleksiy recalls. Thanks to the support of the attack drones of neighboring units, Ukrainian fighters forced the invaders to hide in the basement of a neighboring house. -We decided to go to the basement and throw grenades at it,- says -Panda-. After intense grenade fire, Ukrainian soldiers offered the enemy to surrender. To their surprise, 11 unarmed occupants came out of the basement. -We were in shock - there were only four of us, and there were 11 of them! It was incredible,- admits Oleksiy. However, the adventures did not end there. During the convoy of prisoners, the group was attacked by enemy drones. -They dropped the ammunition and I was wounded in my left forearm. But because of the adrenaline, I didn't feel much pain, so I continued tying up the prisoners,- says -Panda-. After being evacuated to a military hospital, Oleksii was successfully treated and returned to service. -I don't consider myself a hero,- says Oleksii. - I'm just doing my duty, like all my brothers. We stood up to defend our country and defend our families so our children don't know what war is like. As reported by ArmyInform, -I was almost covered by a drone,- says a 20-year-old fighter of the -Rubizh- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Quiet- with a smile. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/bila-kaska-vryatuvala-20-richnyj-tyhyj-z-rubizhu-pro-drony-bij-pid-lozovoyu-ta-frontovu-medyczynu/->-.

-Lucky-: from a Lviv lawyer to a drone commander on the front line	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Before the full-scale invasion, Oleksandr worked in the State Emergency Service and planned to go to Spain to earn money. -On February 19, 2022, my 3-year contract with the State Emergency Service expired, I resigned and planned to go abroad to earn money,- Oleksandr says. -It was necessary to spin, to support the family.- However, when the Russians invaded, Alexander handed in his ticket and went to the Military Commissariat. -They refused to mobilize me because I was too young and had not served my term. I went seven times and kept hearing the same thing - we don't take it,- he recalls. Only on March 3, thanks to the help of a friend, Oleksandr got to the 128th brigade. At first, he worked in the medical unit, evacuating the wounded from the front line. -I worked with Prometheus, a very experienced combat medic. He delivered the wounded from the evacuation point to the stabilization point, and Prometheus provided them with assistance on the way,- Oleksandr says. Later, Oleksandr volunteered for the drone unit, where he was trained and became the commander of the FPV drone unit. -In the beginning, there were very few drones, we protected them as much as we could. And even FPVs were often used not as kamikazes but as bombers,- he recalls. Alexander received the nickname Lucky (lucky) for his ability to survive in extreme situations. -I could have died many times, but I survived. Once an enemy drone flew into our pickup truck, then a comrade sitting in front was killed. Another time, the drone also flew into our car, but bounced off the protective net and exploded 20 meters from the driver,- he says. Last May, Oleksandr's younger brother also joined the 128th brigade, serving in the drone unit. -For a long time, I dissuaded my brother from joining the army, because I think that I alone is enough from our family,- says Lucky. -However, when I realized that he had made a firm decision, I persuaded him to come to me.- Oleksandr plans to attend officer courses in the future, using his higher legal education to further serve Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, Denis under the pseudonym -Forest- is a fighter of the 127th separate territorial defense brigade, who passed a lot of hot fighting and forced the Russian group to retreat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/laki-vid-lvivskogo-yurysta-do-komandyra-droniv-na-peredovij/	2025-03-02T07:49:45-08:00
The feat of the Hero of Ukraine: a 19-year-old border guard took out 21 comrades	reported this in DPSU. The defender showed heroism already in the first months of his stay at the front, where he, coming from a military family, went in April 2024, just after reaching his 18th birthday. Soldier Vladyslav Stepanchuk and his comrades were setting up firing positions at one of the border areas, but the Russians noticed this and launched a heavy combined attack on the Ukrainian units. Artillery, Lancet drones, mortars, infantry groups - the fighters had to retreat. The commander of the cannon with which Vladyslav's unit worked was seriously wounded during the retreat. The young border guard led his comrades to the nearest forest strip, provided the necessary assistance to the wounded and took command of the adjacent units that had lost contact and were disoriented. As a result of the battle, which lasted for four hours, the Ukrainian defenders under the command of soldier Stepanchuk left the dangerous zone to reserve positions.

Ukraine condemned the rotation of IAEA employees at the Zaporizhia NPP through the occupied territor...	This is stated in a statement on the department's website. It is noted that these violations were the result of Russian blackmail and systematic attempts to impose illegal and contradictory mechanisms of activity on the temporarily occupied territories on international organizations. -Russia purposefully creates artificial obstacles for the activities of international organizations in Ukraine, forcing them to violate Ukrainian legislation, bilateral agreements with Ukraine, as well as to disregard the resolutions of the UN General Assembly,- the statement reads. The situation at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant became a special example of such Russian blackmail. The occupiers actually forced the IAEA employees to stay at the station without rotation for 80 days, which is much longer than the planned period, keeping people under unprecedented psychological pressure, in a zone of increased risks. Moscow actually deprived international experts of their freedom of movement and used them as a tool of political pressure on the international community. Ukraine has repeatedly offered a safe and legal route of rotation through controlled territory. However, Moscow systematically refused the IAEA to provide security guarantees under these conditions. The Kremlin deliberately blocked the safe exit of specialists through the territory controlled by Ukraine, forcing the Agency to agree to Russian conditions. -We consider the actions of the IAEA not as a rotation of experts at the ZNPP, but as a humanitarian evacuation in conditions of threat to the lives and health of people who are employees of the Agency,- the Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized. Ukraine sent a note of protest to the leadership of the IAEA, in which it condemns the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state and warns against repeating any similar actions in the future. The Ukrainian side will also raise the issue of unprecedented blackmail of the Russian Federation at the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors in the coming days. Earlier on Sunday, information appeared that the IAEA could for the first time conduct a rotation at the ZNPP through the occupied territories of Ukraine. Probably, this could happen due to the territory of the Russian Federation and the temporarily occupied Crimea. So far, no official comments have been received from the IAEA regarding this information.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/ukrayina-zasudyla-rotacziyu-spivrobitnykiv-magate-na-zaporizkij-aes-cherez-okupovani-terytoriyi/	2025-03-02T05:44:51-08:00

In a few sorties, the drones destroyed 45 OABr: As reported by ArmyInform, our defenders shot down a Russian Supercam S350 drone.

30 meters to the enemy: tankers of the Kyiv brigade about the fight without the right to make a mist...	The tank crew was told in the -War-show- episode on Channel 5 of the separate Kyiv assault brigade. -When you get to the position and start working, it's the best feeling,- says Green, the crew chief. At the age of 21, he drives his car into hell, attacking the enemy from 20-30 meters. Thanks to the features of the T-80, they can approach almost imperceptibly: the turbine works more quietly, and the tracks do not create the usual rumble on soft ground. Each of their outings is a surgically precise shot. They drive up to a minimum distance, quickly work off and leave, leaving behind only the ruins of enemy fortifications. -We worked in the dugout - 20-30 meters, almost close to each other. I've seen the enemy live, and my only desire is to bury him there so he doesn't come out again,- admits Green. A tank in war is an armored bastion, but it is not immortal either. FPV drones have changed the rules of the game: if previously the main threats were artillery and ATGMs, now the main danger is kamikaze drones. -Before, you drove without fear, but now you don't think about artillery or mines, but only about a drone that can fly into a hatch or into an ammunition kit,- the fighters say. The most intense moment is the fighting in Ivanovo. They went out in the morning to destroy the fortified house in which the enemies were holed up. 18 shells and the building was reduced to rubble. And when the Russians tried to return fire, the T-80 crew quickly found and destroyed the enemy BMP hiding behind the house. -Bekha was 60 meters away. One shot - and she was already on fire,- recalls gunner Cherny. But not all departures are perfect. In one of the last battles, the enemy hit a tank - the debris pierced the hatch, and the driver-mechanic Moroz was injured. -Shards flew into the face, and a lump of earth also flew. But there is no blood, so we continue to work,- he says. Each exit of the tank crew is support for the infantry fighting for every meter of Ukrainian land. -When you come back and the guys are waving at you from the trenches, it's the best feeling. They understand that we have not abandoned them, that we are with them,- the tankers say. The war changed them. No more fear, no more hesitation. -It used to be scary, now it's not. You drive, you work, and even your knees don't tremble anymore. There is only one goal - to beat the enemy until we drive them out,- says Commander Green. The 5th Separate Assault Brigade is always looking for new fighters. -If you have a desire, come. We teach everything: driving, navigation, shooting. Anyone can become a tanker, we have places for both mechanics and support,- the soldiers assure. -Don't hesitate. Come to the 5th assault team - let's beat the enemy together!- they say. As reported by ArmyInform, the roar of shots, harmonious work and life between battles - this is what daily life of artillerymen of the 56th separate motorized infantry brigade of Mariupol. They are an integral part of the defense, its -shield and striking power-, working in advance, striking where the enemy does not expect it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/30-metriv-do-voroga-tankisty-kyyivskoyi-brygady-pro-bij-bez-prava-na-pomylku/	2025-03-02T04:48:50-08:00
Character of Steel: The Story of a Marine Who Turned Mining Experience into Military Prowess	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Since 2023, Anton has been serving in the reconnaissance battalion of the marines, where, despite his young age and lack of experience in leading people in civilian life, he successfully performs the duties of a unit commander. -My motivation is simple. I treat the service as a job. It just so happens that I'm here, so I have to do my job at a high level. The main thing is to preserve the life and health of my subordinates. I have to teach them well and provide them with everything they need,- Anton shares. During his service, the marine was repeatedly wounded and participated in operations on the left bank of the Dnieper. The work of a scout requires a lot of preparation, endurance and often goes to the limits of human capabilities. The main task of intelligence is to obtain information that becomes the basis for planning operations. This requires knowledge and high motivation. It depends on the commander how he will find an approach to each fighter, build discipline and the training process. -I firmly believe in my people. They have repeatedly proven their professionalism in critical situations. We will win this war together and return home together,- Anton is confident. As ArmiyaInform reported, -I was almost covered by a drone,- says a 20-year-old fighter of the -Rubizh- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Quiet- with a smile. Despite his young age, he already managed to go through the flames of war, be in occupation, go abroad and return to the Motherland to defend it from the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/stalevyj-harakter-istoriya-morpiha-shho-perekuvav-shahtarskyj-dosvid-na-vijskovu-majsternist/	2025-03-02T04:27:33-08:00

The Russians use drones continuously for reconnaissance, artillery fire adjustment and espionage. But Ukrainian anti-aircraft fighters prove every time: there will be no flight with impunity here. As reported by ArmyInform, the roar of shots, coordinated work and life between battles - this is how the daily life of artillerymen of the 56th separate motorized infantry of Mariupol looks like brigade. They are an integral part of the defense, its -shield and striking power-, working in advance, striking where the enemy does not expect it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/polyuvannya-na-ptashok-slobozhanski-zenitnyky-znyaly-z-neba-30-vorozhyh-droniv-za-misyacz/	2025-03-02T04:03:45-08:00

-Knights- received hundreds of applications for the new project -Contract -18-24-	Yevhen Alkhimov, press officer of the 28th OMBr, told about this on the air of the telethon Edyny Novyni. -We have several hundred new applications. People leave despite the fact that the positions are not easy, they are infantry positions, scouts. But citizens under the age of 24 are best suited for such a job,- said Yevhen Alkhimov. One of the advantages for recruits will be that the instructors of the 28th OMBr will work with them in the training center. -They are training under the conditions of current hostilities, the training is of better quality, because we have to fight with these people and we are interested in their training,- the press officer explained. He added that the brigade's recruiting center also continues to recruit volunteers outside of this program, as people are needed for very different positions, from cook to tank commander. -People are most needed in the infantry, as they need to be replaced. Now the most difficult thing is not even to be in positions, but to make rotations, for this you need people. We are looking for UAV pilots, as we bet on unmanned systems in battles. We are doing everything so that the infantry enters the battle as little as possible-, As ArmyInform reported, the brigades are already preparing the first recruits, who joined the Armed Forces within the framework of the -Contract 18-24- project. The first volunteers are already undergoing training in 72 separate mechanized brigades named after the Black Zaporozhets. As a reminder, -Contrakt 18-24- is a voluntary initiative that allows Ukrainians in the specified age category to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine for one year. The project offers a decent financial reward, professional combat training according to NATO standards and social guarantees that no civilian profession provides.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/lyczari-otrymaly-sotni-zayavok-za-novym-proyektom-kontrakt-18-24/	2025-03-02T03:24:01-08:00
I like to be a hunter, not a victim-: the story of an attack aircraft -Dryus- from Luhansk region	The story of the fighter was made public on page 58 of the separate motorized infantry brigade named after Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky -They said: we are too old to change life. No persuasion worked,- Andrii recalls. He himself left at the age of 18, entering the Kharkiv educational institution as a dental technician. But a full-scale invasion changed everything: at the age of 24, he joined the army. Due to his health, Andrei was initially sent to the rear unit, where he served until last year. However, the desire to fight did not leave him. Repeated requests to be transferred to a combat unit finally yielded results: he ended up in the 58th Motorized Infantry Brigade, and later in an assault unit fighting in Donbas. -I remember my first fight well. It wasn't scary at all - I just didn't understand anything yet. We were driven to the enemy trenches on an -emka- (American armored personnel carrier M113). While they were disembarking, our machine gunner fired. We caught the enemy by surprise, threw grenades, cleared the position and got out without casualties,- says Andriy. But war teaches quickly. -When the guys you live with don't come back from the war one day, when you see empty beds, the realization comes. And before each next assault, you think that this could be your last fight,- the fighter admits. Andriy is convinced: active attack is his element. -Attack or defense? Of course, storm! I'm an impatient person, I need to act. Once I had to sit in defense, so I almost lost my mind. Tossed off the bronik and climbed up to the parapet to smoke - at least some fun. I like to be in an active position, in the role of the hunter, not the victim,- he explains. Assaults, well-aimed strikes, destruction of the enemy - this is the life of -Drews- today. And behind his shoulders is an occupied home, his parents who remained, and his hometown, for which he is fighting. This war is personal for him. And he's not going to stop. As reported by ArmyInform, Denis under the pseudonym -Forest- is a fighter of the 127th separate territorial defense brigade, who passed a lot of hot fighting and forced the Russian group to retreat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/ya-lyublyu-buty-myslyvczem-a-ne-zhertvoyu-istoriya-shturmovyka-dryusa-z-luganshhyny/	2025-03-02T03:11:13-08:00

This was said on the air of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon, the spokesman of the -Luhansk- OTU, Lt. Col. Dmytro Zaporozhets. -Some of our units have already summed up the results for the month, and it is the component of assault actions that indicates that their number in our operational zone has decreased,- said Dmytro Zaporozhets. The spokesman reported that 839 enemy assaults were recorded in January, while 533 enemy assaults were recorded in February. The majority is in the Toretsk direction. -In general, along the entire line of combat, the enemy is carrying out certain activities, logistical movements, movement of personnel. Perhaps this is connected with the change of leaders from the aggressor in certain areas of the front, who want to show some activity,- the spokesman said. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy made 15 attacks in the areas of populated areas in the Toretsk direction Krymske, Dachne, Toretsk and Diliivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/otu-lugansk-vorog-zmenshyv-kilkist-shturmiv-u-lyutomu-perevazhno-atakuvav-na-toreczkomu-napryamku/	2025-03-02T02:53:06-08:00
Lithuania invests in joint production of weapons with Ukraine	The Ministry of Defense of Lithuania informed about this The corresponding decision was agreed upon at a meeting between Defense Minister of Lithuania Dovila Shakaliene, Oleksandr Kamyshin, senior adviser to the President of Ukraine on strategic issues, and Herman Smetanin, Minister of Strategic Industry of Ukraine. Doville Shakaliene noted that the Ukrainian defense industry has incredible potential to become a world-class player thanks to a high level of expertise based on direct combat experience, motivation and competence of engineers. -Lithuania will continue to invest in the Ukrainian defense industry, purchasing in Ukraine for Ukraine. 20 million euros have already been allocated for this, and this amount will continue to grow. However, we seek even closer cooperation — to develop joint Lithuanian-Ukrainian arms production both in Lithuania and Ukraine,- she said. -We will always be grateful to Lithuania for the support it has given us since day one. And the simultaneous development of the defense industry in Lithuania is a powerful next step that strengthens NATO's eastern flank,- said Oleksandr Kamyshyn. For security reasons, the specific types of weapons involved in the agreement have not been disclosed. In the near future, joint meetings of representatives of Ukraine and Lithuania will be held in Lithuania, where details of the implementation of the agreement will be discussed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/lytva-investuye-u-spilne-vyrobnycztvo-zbroyi-z-ukrayinoyu/	2025-03-02T02:41:24-08:00

The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the National Guard of Ukraine. -Tyhiy- joined the -Rubizh- brigade at the end of 2023 and is currently temporarily acting as the grenade launcher platoon commander. He does not hesitate to answer the question about his motivation: -Who, if not young people, -move-? During the war, you get skills that you could not have acquired in civilian life under any circumstances.- His combat experience is impressive. During the battles near Lozova, covering the Ukrainian infantry from the American MK19 automatic grenade launcher, -Tykhy- was 100 meters from the positions of the occupiers. -It was not possible to fire for a long time - the enemy actively responded,- he recalls. During the maneuvers, when their dugout became overcrowded, Tikhoi was almost covered by an enemy drone. -My trademark white helmet saved me, as they told me on the walkie-talkie,- the fighter laughs. In that battle, unfortunately, there were losses, but -Silent- managed to save the lives of his wounded comrades. -On the way, it was necessary to provide assistance to neighbors. Their lungs were cut by shrapnel. If you didn't know MARCH (algorithm for providing medical care), you wouldn't have been saved. They ran out of first-aid kits - we took everything out of ours, shared what everyone had in excess,- he says. -Tykhy- has been performing the duties of the platoon commander for four months. -Not that I wanted to, but I didn't mind either,- he says. -I came here to do a job.- After basic military training, he was sent to Norway, where he completed the unit commander's course and received the appropriate certificate. -The main thing in the position of a platoon leader is for people to understand what is required of them. There are not many people in the platoon, I try to pay enough attention to everyone,- shares -Tyhyy-. As reported by ArmyInform, Denis under the pseudonym -Forest- is a fighter of the 127th separate territorial defense brigade, who passed a lot of hot fighting and forced the Russian group to retreat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/bila-kaska-vryatuvala-20-richnyj-tyhyj-z-rubizhu-pro-drony-bij-pid-lozovoyu-ta-frontovu-medyczynu/	2025-03-02T02:27:41-08:00
Elite hunters of Ukraine: -Group 13- struck 15 ships and 3 helicopters of the Russian Federation in ...	The video of the combat work of -Group 13- was published on the page of the special unit of the GUR MOU -Artan-. In two years, -Group 13- managed to hit 15 ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the aggressor state, nine of which were completely destroyed. These successes have become possible thanks to the continuous improvement of weapons and innovative approaches to combat operations. One of the most striking achievements of -Group 13- was the destruction of an enemy air target with the help of a naval drone. On December 31, 2024, special forces fighters fired missiles from Magura V5 platforms at three Russian Mi-8 helicopters. Two of them were destroyed by drowning in the Black Sea. This became the first case in the world when an aerial target was destroyed by a strike from a naval drone. -Group 13- continues to demonstrate high professionalism and efficiency in the defense of Ukraine. Their successes are an important contribution to the fight against Russian aggression. -Congratulations, brothers. Have a successful hunt!-, says the message of the special unit of the GUR -Artan-.

-Fake report-: Russia is trying to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of international partners	informs the GUR of the IOU about this. In recent days, fake information accusing the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine (GUR MOU) of an alleged attempt to provoke an armed conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has been actively spreading in the Armenian information space, in particular in Telegram channels. Propagandists claim that a new war between these countries will force Russia to open a -second front- and disperse its troops, which is allegedly beneficial to Ukraine. The -proof- of these accusations is a fake report, allegedly from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, addressed to the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Ivan Havryliuk. This document contains numerous gross errors, such as -Yivan- instead of -Ivan-, -SDR- instead of -YEDRPOU-, and also does not meet the requirements of the official documents of Ukraine. The GUR of the IOU declares that this information operation is aimed at discrediting Ukraine and worsening its relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is primarily beneficial to Russia, which seeks to weaken international support for Ukraine. -Conducting the indicated information operation is aimed at discrediting Ukraine and worsening Ukrainian-Armenian and Ukrainian-Azerbaijani relations, which is beneficial primarily for the aggressor state of Russia,- the message of the GUR of the IOU reads. Ukrainian intelligence calls on citizens and the international community to be vigilant and not succumb to provocations. As ArmiyaInform reported, the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, said that Russia will continue to try to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. However, according to him, all hostile actions will receive a worthy rebuff.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/fejkova-dopovid-rosiya-namagayetsya-dyskredytuvaty-ukrayinu-v-ochah-mizhnarodnyh-partneriv/	2025-03-02T01:44:47-08:00
Changed the chair of the driving school director to a trench: the story of Oleksandr Karbashevskyi	Today we will talk about one of the regional branches of the TSOU — Chernivtsi regional, which is headed by reserve colonel Oleksandr Karbashevskyi. During the anti-terrorist operation, he, a reserve colonel of the regional department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, put on an army uniform with the epaulets of a senior sergeant and spent almost two years -at ground zero- as a unit commander. Then, after freeing himself, he once again led the Bukovyna defenders. Well, on February 24, 2022, after the invasion of the Russians, I immediately packed my bag and went to the TCC. He spoke about what made him take such a decision, the help that the regional organization of the Society provides to our army. -There is such a feeling as if you have not done something important in your life-&#8230; - When the Russians came to -liberate- us, what were your first actions? — There was no shock or confusion: no one expected anything else from such nonsense as Putin and his Kremlin supporters. At that time, our region had not yet come under shelling, which made it possible to hold a quick operational meeting with the directors of our divisions, to determine priority actions to ensure the preservation of documents and property, additional forms of communication, and more, using mobile communications. — At one time, you, a reserve colonel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the head of one of the regional police units, wore an army uniform and, wearing the shoulder straps of a senior sergeant, commanded a department in the ATO/OOS area. And after the large-scale Russian invasion, they joined the army again and served in the district TCC for several years. What made you want to serve again? — Yes, there was something like that in my life. You know, there is a feeling as if you haven't done something important in your life, haven't given it your all, as they say in such cases. Apparently, something similar came to me then, affecting me as a person who wore epaulettes for most of my conscious life. Therefore, he changed the chair of the director of the Kitzman driving school to a trench. How did I end up in the army a second time? On the morning of February 24, 2022, he arrived at the territorial picking center. Hundreds of volunteers were already being sought there. Having gone through all the necessary procedures in such cases. The very next day he was mobilized to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Then we all had one thing in our minds - to protect our country, people, family from the Russians, who came here to destroy us, our children and grandchildren. Everyone who came to the TCC that day did not know where they would serve, in the rear or at the front. At least I didn't try to stay as far from the front as possible. But it turned out differently: unlike the times of the ATO/UOS, I did not fight with a -Kalash- in my hands. But he performed mobilization tasks to provide the army with vehicles. The decision to join the army for the second time was also influenced by the fact that, during his stay in the ATO area, he had the opportunity to see with his own eyes the -humanism- of the Russians in relation to our soldiers and officers, as well as the civilian population. But these horrors, which they commit today on our land, exceed those thousands of times. The ancient Persian philosopher-humanist Omar Khayyam said the following words: -Never regret what you did if you were happy at that moment.- Yes, they can be interpreted in different ways, but adequate people who do not have faulty thinking and psyche will understand them as Omar Khayyam himself understood them. -My son supported my decision to join the army- - How did your family react to your decision to join the army again? — My son serves in the National Police. He understood me. And there are no former officers. Well, what about the wife, daughter&#8230; What to say? They were not delighted, but treated my step with understanding. They did not want and do not want the people of Chernivtsi to repeat the fate of Buchi, and the whole of Bukovyna lived according to the wolf laws of the occupiers. However, the Syromans have laws by which they live, perhaps, more humane. About the charity project for training young people and restoring equipment for the front - I know that today you and your colleagues are implementing a project to create an educational institution where UAV pilots will be trained. Tell us in more detail what it involves, what the training period will be, where you will find specialists who will teach the guys to master this newest weapon. — UAVs have convincingly proven and continue to prove their effectiveness in war. But, apart from them, we desperately need people who know how to manage them, destroying both the enemy's manpower and its equipment. At the moment, we have decided on the location of the training, purchased simulators, relevant training programs, and part of the necessary aircraft. We are looking for training specialists, there are considerable difficulties with this. We want to launch this project for student youth on a charitable basis, and for the adult population for a fee. — Bukovyna defenders began to provide volunteer assistance to our army back in 2014. Does this work somehow continue after a large-scale enemy invasion? — Yes, emergency aid to the defenders of the Ukrainian land began to be provided more than 10 years ago, when I did not yet work in the Society, and therefore it is difficult for me to operate with numbers. But I know for sure that Chernivtsi OO TSO of Ukraine, like all other regional units, made every effort to help our soldiers. Starting in the spring of 2022, we are not outside observers either. Members of the Chernivtsi regional organization are actively involved in fundraising for the purchase of technical means or other items for the needs of the Armed Forces. The largest financial project recently has been the restoration of cars by the forces of driving schools, which are so needed at the front. Hundreds of thousands of hryvnias were spent for this. They also bought all-wheel drive Opel Frontera and UAZ-452 cars at their own expense. Responding to the request of the military, they helped in the restoration of other equipment, in particular, welding UAZ-452 all-wheel drive cars, as well as the GAZELLE minibus. However, assistance to the Ukrainian army is not limited to the purchase and repair of automobile equipment. For example, from the moment of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the Chernivtsi driving school provides premises free of charge for the needs of the personnel of various divisions, as well as for volunteers who carry out restoration and repair work on machinery, equipment, and inventory. Premises with an area of ​​more than 100 -squares- were provided for the storage of humanitarian aid. Members of our regional defense unit, mobilized to the ranks of the Armed Forces, are also not left without financial support. Yes, at their request, my colleagues collected and transferred to their units funds for the purchase of necessary military equipment and equipment. A lot of assistance is provided to charitable foundations, public organizations, local territorial defense units, and internally displaced persons. We do not believe that our help will significantly contribute to our victory. But I am sure that every Ukrainian, if he is one not only according to his passport, should do what he can for the sake of this victory. After all, small rivers form large ones, and those form seas and oceans. It is the same today in Ukraine: every hryvnia given to our defenders is a kind of nail in the coffin into which all of Moscow must turn. As reported by ArmyInform, soldier Rodion with the call sign -White- from the fire support company of the 228th battalion of the 127th separate brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the ZSU. He stopped a group of Russian infantry that was trying to break through to Ukrainian positions on motorcycles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/zminyv-krislo-dyrektora-avtoshkoly-na-okop-istoriya-oleksandra-karbashevskogo/	2025-03-02T01:24:50-08:00

The occupiers are trying to replenish blood supplies for wounded soldiers by using the civilian population of the occupied territories. Putin's party -United Russia- takes an active part in the organization of donor actions. Over the past few days, members of the party have forcibly driven at least 350 residents of occupied Luhansk to mobile laboratories. In the end, they reported to the Kremlin about 177 liters of collected blood. It was not without propaganda statements in the spirit of -the people and the army are one-, with which the occupiers try to justify their actions. Such actions are systematic in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. In particular, in temporarily occupied Henichesk, local collaborators held a -Donor Day- with the involvement of a mobile laboratory for collecting donor blood. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian occupiers have deployed a new filtration camp in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, where local residents are forcibly detained. The camp is designed for 1,000 people and is intended to -test the loyalty- of residents of recently captured settlements.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/krov-dlya-geroyiv-svo-okupanty-prymusovo-zganyayut-byudzhetnykiv-ta-studentiv-na-donorski-akcziyi/	2025-03-02T00:48:43-08:00

One step ahead: how Ukrainian EW specialists resist enemy technologies	The video of combat work was published on the brigade's page. Despite the fact that the Russian occupiers are constantly improving their systems, the REB company of the 80th brigade not only successfully opposes them, but also often outpaces them in the technological race. In its own workshop, the brigade's specialists create means that detect and neutralize enemy reconnaissance drones, and also improve systems to combat FPV drones, one of the main threats on the battlefield. -This is an invisible dome that protects our guys,- is how the work of the EW company in the 80th Brigade is described. For security reasons, detailed information about the technology and its use on the battlefield has not been disclosed. This is done in order to maintain an advantage over the enemy and to ensure the effectiveness of the unit. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian defenders from the 63rd separate mechanized brigade shared a funny incident that happened on the front line. Russian invaders, trying to break through Ukrainian positions, used motorcycles. But their -operation- ended in complete fiasco.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/na-krok-poperedu-yak-ukrayinski-reb-fahivczi-protystoyat-vorozhym-tehnologiyam/	2025-03-01T23:49:15-08:00
Ukrainian drones shot down a Russian reconnaissance drone worth $100,000	The video of combat work was published on the brigade's page. This time the Russian drone Supercam S350 became the -prey-. This reconnaissance drone, worth about 100,000 dollars, is able to rise to a height of up to 5 kilometers, penetrate 100 kilometers deep into Ukrainian territory and develop a speed of up to 120 kilometers per hour. -It was a challenge to catch her, but our FPV pilots did it!- - says the message of the 63rd OMBr. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian defenders from the 63rd separate mechanized brigade shared a funny incident that happened on the front line.

Beaver on a bird: the story of a Volyn warrior who destroys the enemy from the sky	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -My father, who has been serving since the beginning, had the call sign -Beaver-. When I later joined the unit, I received the call sign -Beaver Lesser-, and after moving to my current position, I became a simple -Beaver-, says the fighter. -Beaver- went through a difficult combat path, starting with service in the support unit and ending with participation in the battles in the Serebryan Forest and near Ocheretyn. He compares these areas with Toretsk, where he currently serves, and says that urban development creates many unpleasant nuances. During one of the combat missions near Toretsk, -Beaver- was seriously injured. -It was a landing in a forest lane near the tericon. There were three of us. On the first night, 80- and 120-mm mortars flew at our position (80- and 120-millimeter mortars - ed.) and we were slightly injured, but we continued to hold the designated line. The next day, the enemy aircraft started working, covering us with KABs. After the second such arrival, as a result of the blast wave, my eardrums ruptured,- the fighter recalls. After treatment and rehabilitation, -Beaver- returned to the front, but later, due to certain circumstances, he went to the SZCH, from where he soon returned. -Returning from the SZCH to the unit, I was mentally ready to continue serving in the infantry, but I understood that my physical condition would not allow me to fully perform the tasks assigned to me, so I asked the command to transfer me to the BpLA unit, and I was given the green light,- Valentin says. Now -Beaver- is a UAV operator in the 1st rifle battalion of the 100th OMBr. He is engaged in dropping -gifts- on the heads of invaders and plans to do so until the last occupier leaves Ukrainian land. -What's more, a fighter whose life motto is: 'Always forward' simply cannot do otherwise, especially when his mother Svitlana Evgeniyevna, two younger brothers: Andriy and Viktor and his beloved girlfriend Sabrina are waiting for him in the rear,- the publication says. As reported by ArmiyaInform, this story is about Oleg with the call sign -Gran-, who until the age of 45 had nothing to do with the army, but in 2024 received a summons and without hesitation stood up for the defense of Ukraine as part of the 100th separate mechanized brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/bober-na-ptashczi-istoriya-volynskogo-voyina-yakyj-nyshhyt-voroga-z-neba/	2025-03-01T23:09:52-08:00

Nizhna -Trembita-, rejection of the TCC and the golden age of artillery: the story of the gunner -Ru...	Her story, told for ArmiyaTV, is not just a dry service report. This is an explosive mixture of courage, discipline and the fight against stereotypes, which proves that at the front a woman can not only keep up with men, but sometimes surpass them. Runa knows what looks like surprise or skepticism. She laughs at how civilians still can't get used to women in the army: -Society still doesn't fully understand that a woman on the front can perform combat tasks on par with men, and sometimes even better than them. The military got used to this a long time ago, but with the civilians&#8230; They see a military man in uniform on the street and automatically think it's a man.- Her love for weapons was born in school, when she first picked up a machine gun. The dream of becoming a soldier burned in her despite everything: upbringing in a boarding school, distant relations with her parents - these difficulties only hardened her. Her sister and friends supported her, admiring the courage that drove her forward. The path to the army was not easy. At first, Runa was refused at the district TCC - there were no vacancies. -I was so disappointed that I went home in tears,- she recalls. But fate loves the brave: the same day she received a call with an offer to serve. Without hesitation, she packed her things and jumped on the train and headed to the training center. It was the beginning - sharp as a shot and irreversible&#8230; Since 2018, a girl is in the Armed Forces, and her crew is not just a team, but a real combat family. There is everyone here: from young fighters to a 55-year-old veteran who could have retired but chose the front. -My crew is all men. The oldest is 55 years old, retired from civilian life, but continues to serve and protect the country. The crew ranges from young to those with decades of experience. We work as one mechanism. While working, everyone listens to my commands: -Fire!-, -Stop!-, -Recoil!- — everything is going smoothly, because I have the best boyfriends,- she says. There are also old-timers, like a soldier with the call sign -Volt-, who has been with Runa since 2018, and newcomers who quickly learn in the hot conditions of war. Everyone knows that when Rune shouts -Fire!-, the cannon obeys and the enemy trembles. In 2019, she entered the Tavri State University of Agrotechnology in Marketing. Service, courses at night, distance learning, she juggled it all, even when a full-scale invasion closed her way to field sessions. After completing her bachelor's degree, she went on to do her master's part-time. When the cannon falls silent, Runa opens her laptop. In war, there is no time for swagger. Every day is training for a real battle. Recruits learn on the fly, but everyone here is a volunteer, charged with the desire to defend their land. -We are the only ones working so close to the enemy. When we leave, they immediately know who we are by radio communication. The guys from the infantry often give thanks for the support, especially during assault operations. Some have tried to work from a longer distance, but experience has shown that firepower is lost. We drive up, complete the tasks and leave, changing positions several times a day,- the girl says. Their weapon is the old but legendary AZP-57, affectionately known as the Trembita. -When it was given to us, it worked as it should. I have been on it for almost two years. To this - ZU-23-2. Over time, the cannon wears out, but regular maintenance, cleaning and repairs allow it to hit the enemy effectively. Sometimes it breaks - some finger or charging mechanism flies out, but after repair it -sings- again. We even call her 'Trembita': when she deploys in a battle stance, it looks incredible,- laughs Runa. War has changed. In 2022, Runa still didn't know what FPV drones or EW were, and now she doesn't do a single step without them. Drones buzz overhead, targeting the KamAZ, but EW systems save the day. -When we hear the sound of an FPV drone, everyone crouches down. But there is no protection on the KamAZ - neither armor nor shelter. Therefore, in such a situation, we make a quick rollback. We are chased not only by artillery, but also by drones. You need to constantly listen to the front, the sky, and still perform tasks,- she shares. But despite the technology of the enemy, artillery is its trump card. -In fact, every day is a golden time for artillery for us. There is enough work both during the day and at night,- says Runa. Her call sign is no accident. The Teyvaz rune tattoo on her neck, made in the Pokrovsky direction, became her amulet. The symbol of a warrior and a winner perfectly reflects her spirit. And there is also sport, which keeps her in good shape. -It's not about perfect workouts, it's about movement,- she explains. Between departures - 20-30 minutes for push-ups, press or improvised dumbbells made of water eggplants. Boots instead of sneakers, but the main thing is not to stop. Her dream? Own sports hall. Initially, she planned to live in Mariupol, but the war changed her plans: -I have a dream, but I will realize it after the war. At first I wanted to do it in Mariupol. The main thing is not in Kyiv, because this metropolis is too noisy. I really like Chernivtsi - a city with a unique atmosphere, reminiscent of Lviv.- Rune is not just a name. It is a symbol of force that breaks patterns. Her cannon thunders on the front lines, her voice rules the battle, and her dreams live on even in the chaos of war. Women on the frontline are not an exception, but a reality that Runa now embodies every day&#8230;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/nizhna-trembita-vidmova-v-tczk-ta-zolotyj-chas-artyleriyi-istoriya-artylerystky-runy/	2025-03-01T21:10:03-08:00

-Baba Yaga- makes hell for the occupiers: hexacopter -Vampire- hunts the enemy near Pokrovsk	-Baba Yaga- in the district. Urgently to the shelter-, - heard on the radio intercepts how the Russians in a panic are waiting for the -arrival- of the Ukrainian attack bomber -Vampir-. -Where is the -night-light-, I can't see anything?-, -It's interesting how -Baba Yaga- looks, the boys said that it is big-, - the Rashists are not calming down. Another occupier answers them: -It's a pity that you never saw her, because if you really saw her, you would no longer be alive.- The occupiers of the -Vampire- cannot be seen at night, although it is very large in size, but the hum of the -Baba Yaga- engine, as they call our drone, can be heard even on approach. -In general, when the -Vampire- flies, the sound of the engine can be heard all the way behind kilometer It is audible, but the drone itself is not visible. The sound seems to be approaching from all sides, and the enemy simply does not understand where the danger is coming from. And this brings real terror to the enemy, because he doesn't know how to counter our bomber,- says -Owl-. Here's a look: Bohdan shows an aerial reconnaissance video from -Mavik-, where the Russian positions are in complete chaos, shooting, someone runs to the dugout, others run to the fields and explode on mines nearby. Some of the Rashists take assault rifles and aim in the air, trying to shoot down the -Vampire-. But it doesn't work. -Lord's Punishment- steadily approaches the enemy. -Owl- confidently leads the bomber to the target. 3 km from the front line, our reconnaissance found a shelter of enemy infantry. Here we see, -Vampire- is hovering over the target. The guy presses the button on the control panel, the anti-personnel mine rocket flies at the heads of the occupants, and not even a few seconds pass - an explosion. This is daily night combat work. The guys say: they are making hell for the occupiers on our land. Bohdan -Sova- told ArmyInform correspondents about the combat work of the attack drone-bomber, how -Vampyr- differs from another heavy bomber -Bat-, about courier delivery to the front line and why this drone has become a real terror for Russians. The weight of this UAV is 30 kg, it can carry 15-kilogram discharge, range of use up to 9 km. The optimal distance at which the crew flew and destroyed the enemy was up to 7-8 km along the line of battle. Under favorable weather conditions and battery capacity, work in the air is up to 40 minutes. This time is enough to fly to a point on the terrain, make an accurate hit on the racks and return. The calculation of the -Vampire- hits places where the enemy's manpower is concentrated: dugouts, shelters and various structures. Plus, he makes discounts on heavy and light armored vehicles of the Russian Federation. -I worked on the -Bat-, now I destroy the Russians on the -Vampire-. I will say that both drones are powerful and high-quality weapons. If we talk about advantages, then -Vampire- is somewhat better in terms of capabilities. Stronger communication, works more stably over a long distance and behaves better in the air when suppressing enemy EW,- says -Owl-. The choice of means of damage is very diverse: high-explosive fragmentation, cumulative, thermobaric and fragmentation-incendiary ammunition. If we need to hit the Russian infantry, then we stick to fragmentation projectiles. And if you destroy an armored tank, then you need cumulative-. -Vampire- works only at night, because during the day it can be spotted and shot down. It has an eight-mode thermal imager. Not every enemy EW according to its characteristics is capable of suppressing the bomber. But, of course, it is best to bypass the area of ​​influence of the enemy's EW or, if possible, gain a higher altitude. Communication with -Vampire- can be up to 500 meters. And most of the Russian EWs that are on the equipment have a range of up to 300-400 meters. Even if the calculation has lost contact with the drone, it can independently return via satellite to the point from which it took off. The guys say that it is very convenient and high-quality to do remote mining from the hexacopter. -We can remotely replace any point with the terrain that we are told. Probable routes of advance of enemy infantry, armored vehicles or tank-dangerous areas are determined. Our drones mine these roads with anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, block the enemy's approach routes, which complicates his logistics, &#8211; says Bohdan. The better the mined approaches to the positions, the less equipment and personnel of the enemy will be able to approach our defenders. The bomber crew is 3 people, an operator, an assistant operator and an ammunition engineer. The -Owl- has more than a year of experience in managing the -Vampire- and defeating the occupiers. As a standard, work on positions is up to 5 days. After obtaining the coordinates of the target, the average combat operation is 25 minutes: this is the time that the -Vampire- overcomes at a distance of, for example, 7 km to the target, the actual defeat and return. The maximum drop weight carried by the hexacopter on the occupiers is 18 kg. Once the boys were given the task of -extinguishing- the enemy in a one-story brick building. Inside are Russian attack aircraft that were preparing to storm Ukrainian positions. -It was night, they quickly flew up to this house. It is not easy to destroy an entire house at once. Performance technique is important here. First, ammunition is thrown from the drone at the accident site, the cord, which burns, pierces the roof, the projectile -enters- the house and rests. The cord burns out and ignites the discharge charge, an inertial explosion occurs, and then the ammunition itself ignites. After that, it detonates and tears apart the entire building. All! A goal in the goal! -Mavik- UAV crews work in tandem with us, conducting aerial reconnaissance and usually recording fire damage to the enemy,- &#8211; says Bohdan. When there is a very strong fog, it is a sign for the enemy to advance. Then they form small assault groups that advance towards our infantry positions. Recently, the enemy has been very active in our direction. It happened that 50 attack aircraft were advancing from different directions. The occupiers thought that the fog had already settled and they would not be seen, but it was a fatal mistake. In fact, the fog was still up and we caught them doing it. Then three sides of heavy bombers -Vampire- worked on the enemy. On the same day, but at night, the enemy attacked again. An assault group of 15 armed squads, each shouldered by infantry weapons. Plus, the enemy had anti-thermal imaging cloaks, which should have made the stormtroopers invisible. They put everyone together. In general, now the occupiers began to use invisibility cloaks much more in the dark. They hide and cover themselves in forest plantations. So they sleep undisturbed until morning. Logistics at the position of the infantrymen are now very complicated. You won't get by on the equipment, enemy FPV drones are hunting. Therefore, -Vampires- help a lot. Often using heavy drones, pilots deliver food, water, BC, medicine, batteries for walkie-talkies, cigarettes and even fuel for generators. That is, they work like a courier delivery: quickly and at the right time. The guys thank you for the -tasties- and then fight with even more enthusiasm. The crew of the -Vampire- hexacopter is a priority target for the occupiers. The enemy is constantly looking for the location of drones. Therefore, you have to be very careful. It is usually better to set up positions in destroyed settlements, of course, if there is no such possibility, you have to work from forest plantations. 4-5 km from the contact line. -In Karlivka, the Russians attacked our bomber with ordinary Maviks.- Just rammed. Then one blade on it was knocked off, but the drone will still be operational, because there are 5 more blades. -Vampire- bombarded the bombers with drops and turned back. The occupiers still practice dropping nets or ropes from above the bomber. If the blades become entangled, the drone may even fall. But fortunately, the enemy did not manage to do this. In fact, it is very difficult to do it in the air, you need to have a higher level of piloting skill. Katsaps have problems with this. Usually, one or two blades of the -Vampire- may fail, but the drone still performs its task and returns,- &#8211; Bohdan -Sova- told.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/baba-yaga-robyt-peklo-okupantam-geksakopter-vampir-polyuye-za-vorogom-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-03-01T20:40:24-08:00
Explosive 3D printers: ammunition containers and rocket fuel to be printed for the Pentagon	According to the official portal of Supernova Industries Corp (-Supernova-), this company from Austin, the capital of Texas, received a $2 million subcontract from the American Center for Manufacturing and Innovation (ACMI) for 3D printing of military-grade energy materials, ArmyInform notes. And to put it simply, this contract is about the creation of explosives used to fill projectiles and solid fuel for rockets. As noted in a profile release from the firm, which specializes in advanced 3D printing technologies for various sectors of society's life, the allocation of funds took place within the Critical Chemicals Pilot Program of the American Center for Manufacturing and Innovation (ACMI) through a multi-purpose contract of the US Department of Defense. At the same time, we are talking about the production contract, although, considering its total amount, it can still be perceived as a guideline. Experts of the defense portal IKK Defense Express (DE), who understood the details of this agreement, reported that the know-how of Supernova Industries consists in the fact that they invented a way to print mixtures by laminating and adding their impurity, which leads to their hardening under the influence of light. -The technology is called Viscous Lithography Manufacturing (VLM) and allows printing materials with unlimited viscosity. And, as a bonus, in fact of any form in terms of complexity,- stated defense technology market researchers. The demonstration video shows that the company is already working with APCP blends. It is a solid rocket fuel based on ammonium perchlorate, and also with the RDX explosive - hexane. Supernova representatives also stated that their research chemists are also working on their own -energy formulas-. -In this way, with the help of 3D printing, the problem of -unstitching- the rather narrow mouth of ammunition production - combat equipment is solved. Usually traditionally, this process is done by pressing or pouring explosives into the case. And given that the ammunition case can also be printed on a 3D printer, everything becomes much more interesting,- DE experts concluded. -Our technology has the potential to overcome the design limitations of conventional manufacturing methods to produce the next generation of military-grade power components, including solid-state rocket motors (SRMs), explosives and pyrotechnics,- said Roger Antunes, founder and CEO of Supernova Industries Corp. Supernova has already printed simulated energy materials and is currently developing a methodology for printing energy formulas, -which will be a major breakthrough in the additive manufacturing industry,- the company said. In preparation for the Pentagon contract, Supernova launched a new Pulse Production Platform for high-viscosity resins in November 2024. The firm also introduced Viscogels, a proprietary portfolio of photopolymer materials that offer superior mechanical properties compared to competing resins. The new platform includes the Pulse One Viscous Lithography Manufacturing (VLM) 3D printer, Pulse Postprocessing Cell and Pulse Control Center software. This comprehensive manufacturing package is compatible with the company's Viscogels line, which includes twelve different materials spanning four families of photopolymers (rigid composites, plastic materials, rubber and silicone).

Russian propaganda is definitely on steroids: they made up a -murderer- from the 92nd OShBr	In February 2025, Russian Telegram channels began to share a screenshot of an article from the Ukrainian publication Dumka. In this -sensational- news, it was claimed that a serviceman of the 92nd Separate Assault Brigade (OShBr) first killed an employee of the TCC, who mobilized him, and then his relative. Sounds like the script for a cheap thriller, doesn't it? In fact, the original -Opinions- article from February 18, 2025 told about a 42-year-old resident of the village of Manchenki in Kharkiv Oblast, who was found guilty of two murders and robbery. The first crime occurred in 2020, when he killed a pensioner for 6,000 hryvnias, and the second - in 2023, when he killed an acquaintance during a quarrel. There are no mentions of the military, the 92nd OShBr or TCC employees in the article. But for Russian propaganda, such details are trivial. This fake is intended to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the mobilization process. Russian propagandists seek to sow panic and mistrust among Ukrainians, making them doubt their own defenders. But, as practice shows, Ukrainians have long learned to recognize these information leaks. Remember that information hygiene is our joint contribution to defeating the enemy on the information front. Do not allow propagandists to influence your consciousness.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/02/rosijska-propaganda-tochno-na-steroyidah-vygadaly-vbyvczyu-z-92-yi-oshbr/	2025-03-01T20:07:22-08:00

Shooting down UAVs, working with EW devices, pre-medical assistance: how recruits pass BZVP	Colonel Yury Dyachenko, head of the Department of Training Training Centers of the Ground Forces Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told the Ministry of Defense about this. -The fifth edition of the program has been implemented. In this program, we have already increased the practical component. 80% of BZVP is practice, another 20% is theory. 40% of BZVP are warfare tactics. Fire training accounts for 30%, and another 30% for other training subjects,- Yuriy Dyachenko said. The new program also includes special training. Among the innovations of the BZVP are the skills of working with UAVs and EW. -We have the study of EW tools used in the military and the basic skills of working with unmanned aerial vehicles. There is such a system of -Nettles- and the servicemen no longer use paper maps,- said the soldier. According to him, many changes have also been made in fire training. -In the fourth edition of the program, which was still active in November, we had 29 training shooting exercises. Now it's 43,- he said. One of the main areas of the new program is the skills of shooting down unmanned aerial vehicles using anti-drone guns. -Also included in the department's weapons study program. If earlier a serviceman performed exercises only with a submachine gun, now he performs with weapons that are in the department. These are RPK machine guns, PCs, and grenade launchers,- Yuriy Dyachenko explained. In addition, pre-medical care skills training has been increased from 14 to 20 hours. The MOU emphasized that the BZVP is now adapted to modern requirements and threats. From 60% to 95% of instructors at training centers have combat experience. -Why 60%? We have rear, technical specialties, technical specialties where it is not necessary to have combat experience. In order for servicemen to gain this experience, we regularly send them to mission areas. Now there are already somewhere 200-250 people in the areas of execution of tasks, performing combat tasks,- Yuriy Dyachenko said. Within the framework of the -Contrakt 18-24- project, recruits are already undergoing BZVP according to the updated program. As a reminder, -Contrakt 18-24- is a voluntary initiative that allows Ukrainians in the specified age category to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine for one year. The project offers a decent financial reward, professional combat training according to NATO standards and social guarantees that no civilian profession can provide.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/01/zbyttya-bpla-robota-z-zasobamy-reb-domedychna-dopomoga-yak-novobranczi-prohodyat-bzvp/	2025-03-01T09:19:56-08:00

-The army is fighting for the best personnel-. The expert explained the strategic importance of the ...	This opinion was expressed by a lawyer, a serviceman of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko, in a conversation with an ArmyInform correspondent. -I believe that it is a very correct initiative to attract recruits to the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, motivating them, creating very serious conditions that provide both the opportunity to make a career in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and stimulating it with a good social package, the opportunity to receive payments, loans for housing, cars, etc. That is, there is also a stimulus, including a material one. Of course, moral factors are important; this is actually a call to stand up and defend the homeland in a difficult period,- says Oleksandr Musienko. He emphasizes that -the state did not use the method of coercion-, but the method that involves encouragement. According to him, the model of the project -Contract 18-24- was created according to -NATO- standards and provides for the involvement of volunteers through the recruitment system. -This is an opportunity to choose a position, a brigade, a unit where you want to do military service in the future. And this gives the impetus just for Ukrainians who are now choosing their future for themselves and choosing a profession and specialty by joining the ranks of the Armed Forces,- says the expert. In addition, according to Oleksandr Musienko, new recruits can actually get answers to two questions. -The first is the opportunity to get a profession that will be related to the protection of sovereignty, the protection of the motherland. That is, it is about moral encouragement. And this is very important. And we are also talking about financial incentives - I mean the opportunity to build a career and receive a decent reward for it. That is, we are even talking about the actual market component, which is becoming competitive, the army is fighting for the best personnel. That's important.- Musiyenko reminded that since the network of recruiting centers started working in Ukraine, many Ukrainians have been interested in the possibility of joining the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -And it's already working. Our brigades, our Armed Forces need new people in different specialties, because it is strength, stamina, health, it is, in fact, an organism that can be more suitable for physical exertion, etc. Therefore, I believe that this idea is very useful, promising and will certainly give an impetus to improve the composition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and for the future, even for the post-war period, will provide an opportunity to form such a necessary reserve for us and to attract Ukrainians to the Armed Forces of Ukraine,- Oleksandr Musienko summarized. As a reminder, -Contract 18-24- is a voluntary initiative that allows Ukrainians in the specified age category to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine for one year. The project offers a decent financial reward, professional combat training according to NATO standards and social guarantees that no civilian profession can provide. As reported by ArmyInform, within the scope of the -Contract 18-24- project, up to the 28th brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign hundreds of people applied. Dozens of candidates have already passed the military medical board, and some have signed contracts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/01/armiya-boretsya-za-krashhi-kadry-ekspert-poyasnyv-strategichnu-vazhlyvist-proyektu-kontrakt-18-24/	2025-02-28T20:58:47-08:00
The -Panther- is being tamed in the Apennines: Italy will purchase a significant number of KF-51 Pan...	As stated in the editorial of the defense portal The Defense Post, official Rome will allocate about 10 billion euros ($10.4 billion) specifically for the purchase of KF-51 Panther tanks (-Panther- in Ukrainian), which will be equipped according to Italian military decisions, ArmiyaInform reports. At the same time, the Italian defense ministry announced that the program would be -the largest contract in history- for the German industrial partner. In the latest update, Italy said that the entire budget for the purchase of armored vehicles to expand the country's armored fleet over 15 years, which will include 350 Lynx combat vehicles in addition to the Panthers, with exercised options will not exceed 30 billion euros ($31.2 billion). Our editors told in their materials about the Lynx infantry fighting vehicles (BMP) of the new generation. In the order from the government of the Italian Republic for the KF-51 Panther MBT, certain -accents- were made on the national requirements. As experts of the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition emphasize, one of the key elements of the KF-51 Panther is the integration of advanced technologies that increase its effectiveness on the battlefield, in particular in terms of protection and combat capabilities. The most notable feature is the integration of the Active Protection System (APS), in particular the Strike Shield system. This system is designed to detect and neutralize incoming threats, such as anti-tank projectiles and missiles, before they reach a combat vehicle. This active protection mechanism significantly increases the vehicle's survivability on the modern battlefield, where the threat of precision munitions is ubiquitous. The Strike Shield is expected to be a critical component in the successful operation of the KF-51 Panther, enhancing its ability to operate in high-risk environments while minimizing vulnerabilities. In addition to APS, the KF-51 Panther will also be equipped with barrage munitions - unmanned aerial vehicles with an integrated combat load, capable of conducting patrols and destroying found targets. Unmanned munitions, often called -suicide drones,- are capable of remaining in the air for long periods of time, seeking out and striking critical targets such as enemy tanks, air defense systems, and command centers. Deploying these munitions with the KF-51 Panther could give the Italian Army a significant advantage, allowing the tank to not only engage enemy forces directly, but also strike from a distance, thus increasing its overall combat effectiveness. These advances are part of a major effort to modernize the Italian Army's armored vehicle fleet, with the KF-51 Panther being developed in collaboration with Germany. The vehicle will retain the 120 mm main gun, ensuring continuity with current NATO standards, while the integration of modern technologies such as digital systems for C4I (command, control, communications, computing and intelligence) and improved mobility will ensure KF-51 Panther to remain at the forefront of armored warfare. This tank is designed to replace older platforms, providing better protection, lethality and versatility for the Italian Army. The KF-51 Panther is expected to play a key role in future operations both in Europe and beyond, as NATO continues to adapt to new threats. The combination of advanced defense systems, barrage munitions and an emphasis on innovation make the KF-51 Panther a significant asset in the Italian Army's arsenal, contributing to its strategic readiness and defensive capabilities for years to come. The news demonstrates Italy's commitment to keeping its armored forces competitive in NATO and underscores its investment in next-generation military technologies that are shaping the future of warfare. As these developments continue, the KF-51 Panther is likely to become a centerpiece of Italy's military modernization efforts, and its capabilities could influence the future of armored vehicles globally. KF-51 Panther is the future main battle tank of the Italian Army.

Aquanauts, -the shadow fleet and the vessel -Amber-: the spokesman of the Navy on the actions of the...	So, recently in the Baltic Sea in the economic zone of Sweden near the island of Gotland, the Swedish Coast Guard discovered another damage to the cable that runs between Finland and Germany. It is about the C-Lion 1 cable. Such cases happen regularly, and many experts associate these incidents with the passage of ships of either the Russian -shadow fleet- or ships with Russian crews under the flags of various states. Such cable damage is detected immediately, and if you look at the cable map, it is quite dense in the Baltic. Quite a lot of various communications take place there. It is also known that the Russians have special units created specifically for underwater sabotage. Dmytro Pletenchuk, spokesman for the Navy of Ukraine, noted that -We cannot accuse any country without having the relevant evidence. In any case, it will be clear after all the appropriate measures have been taken there. Moreover, Western civilization, in principle, is built on evidence and on the competitiveness of the process. Yes, the Russians have a military unit that has the appropriate equipment for working in the depths and trained personnel. These personnel are called hydronauts, sometimes also aquanauts. And the requirements for this personnel, their qualifications are as high as for cosmonauts. They aim to specifically conduct such events. I am sure that in the Baltic the members of the North Atlantic Alliance member countries can take care of themselves, but in any case, of course, in this situation one should look carefully and pay a lot of attention to the underwater situation. We are more outside observers in this situation, but still this situation is interesting to us, because there are also various communications in the Black Sea. Some experts agree that these incidents are a preparatory stage for aggression. So, in January, the Irish military spotted an -auxiliary- and, in fact, a reconnaissance vessel -Amber-, which has two underwater vehicles among its equipment and may also have the appropriate personnel on board. The Amber vessel was spotted in the Irish Sea, inside Ireland's exclusive economic zone, 5-7 km north of the cables connecting Ireland and Britain. The Irish recorded the crew of a Russian ship operating three drones over Irish waters, apparently conducting surveillance. At the same time, the Russians turned off the ship's transponder, which informs everyone around about the location of the vessel. Some experts agree that the Russians may be preparing for their next aggressive actions in this water area. And in addition to mapping and directly reporting all these communications on their map, they can also resort to, for example, some time-delayed sabotage. Therefore, the damage to underwater cables with the help of special means is a sign of the Russians' preparation for aggressive actions against the EU.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/01/akvanavty-tinovyj-flot-ta-sudno-yantar-rechnyk-vms-pro-diyi-rosiyan-u-baltijskomu-mori/	2025-02-28T20:32:01-08:00
They destroyed the enemy D-30 along with the calculation: gunners of the 30th OMBr on old Acacias -u...	For several weeks, one of the sections of the front, which is defended by the brigade, was actively stormed by Russian troops. We have already told how these assaults helped to repel tankers -30's-. But the efforts of other units were also directed at this. Artillerymen actively supported their infantry. It is important that enemy convoys and assault groups do not even come close to our positions, says battery commander Andrii with the call sign -Uzh-: -We try to destroy them while they are moving. To break their order of battle, to inflict losses. So that as little as possible of their infantry approached our VOPs. The main thing is to knock down their pace of attack. When the order of battle breaks down, they start to panic, go in different directions. No matter what the opponent is, when he sees heavy losses, he already loses the -zeal- to advance.- Andrii has been in the army for 17 years. After studying at the National Academy of Ground Forces, he joined the 30th Brigade, where his friends served. During the period of the large-scale invasion, the entire combat path was completed together with the brigade. According to him, now they can work most effectively on infantry and light armored vehicles. And this is exactly what the enemy uses most often. -Even if the gap is not far away, this technique breaks through fragments and stops. And the personnel of the enemy will suffer losses in it. They attack with everything they have. Light armored vehicles of the MTLB type, various civil vehicles &#8211; -Zhiguli-, different pickups, -loaves-. Everything that goes, that's what they leave on. They often attack on motorcycles. At least 10-20. And there were 30-40 at one time. If the equipment runs out, they advance on foot. But so far, apart from heavy losses, nothing significant has been achieved.- And the enemy's equipment does not reach our positions at all, Andriy adds. Vitaly with the call sign -Pyton- also talks about the high intensity of attacks. He is the platoon leader in this battery. He says that he was on vacation when the first strong -thrusts- occurred. But he constantly monitored the situation. -I look, and the kombat is breaking up here. Because all the guns were working here at once. This usually does not happen. And then here, apparently, every bush was shooting.- The -Uzha- battery works on Soviet 2C3 -Acacia- self-propelled guns of 152 mm caliber. The equipment is not new, but if it is kept in good condition, repaired and serviced on time, it also shows good results, he says. -We have trained repair crews. They know this technique well, know where to get parts, repair quickly. A significant advantage of Western equipment is that it works on 155 caliber. It has more shells. And we have problems with shells. Because this is Soviet caliber. And our supplies are running out, as well as the enemy's, by the way. So we are waiting, maybe someday they will be rearmed.- But -Python- considers -Acacia- to be one of the best in its class. After all, it is very well suited for modern combat conditions. -There are those around who work on tanks (we are talking about the German self-propelled guns PzH 2000, which were transferred to Ukraine by Germany - ed.) and others, but I believe that the 2C3 is one of the best. It is compact and we can hide it. And she hits far. I also see problems with -Dana- and other self-propelled wheeled vehicles. They have to leave. They stand in the open space. And we can open fire at any moment. We are hidden, camouflaged and hit far. For example, if I were given a new 2C3 or a shell, I would choose the 2C3. Also, in my opinion, the self-propelled gun should have a -gooseneck-. Not wheeled. This is what happens here in winter, autumn and spring &#8211; everything gets stuck. Only the -goose- is feeling normal.- However, problems with the ammunition do appear from time to time, continues -Python-. -Give us new shells, so that they have a stable charge and all factory parameters, it will beat absolutely by the book. Very apt. The whole problem lies in projectile charges. Because we have already chosen everything. Vinaigrette is brought from all countries. And give us new shells, it will crack like a shell.- Vitaly -Python- has been fighting since 2022. He once graduated from the military department with an artillery specialty. When he was mobilized, after training he got into the 30th separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Konstantin Ostrozky. He says that most of the personnel of his unit have been fighting since the very beginning of the large-scale invasion. During this time, the war changed fundamentally. It became much more difficult. -Back then, a drone could be found somewhere once a month. And we were not talking about FPV and -Lancet- at all. And we worked from an open area. So now you won't work. Now disguise comes to the fore. And not only masking. We bury ourselves. We bury the car.- With good camouflage and a clear organization of work, it is very difficult to find artillerymen, Vitaly continues. -We can be in one position for a year or two. Drones flew over us for over a year and did not see us. But if they notice, then you have to change your position very quickly. At first, they work as a -barrel- (barrel artillery - ed.). And then -Lancet- takes off. In addition to repelling enemy assaults, gunners are engaged in counter-battery combat. According to the battery commander Andrii, the last thing to be destroyed was the D-30 gun along with the calculation and ammunition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/01/znyshhyly-vorozhu-d-30-razom-z-rozrahunkom-artylerysty-30-ombr-na-starenkyh-akacziyah-rozmotuyut-protyvnyka-pid-soledarom/	2025-02-28T20:18:52-08:00
stories about -non-existent- armed forces brigades: when propaganda crosses the border of absurdity	In their attempts to discredit the Ukrainian volunteer movement, the Russian media spread information that Ukrainians are raising money for military units that do not exist in nature. This statement has no evidence and is another attempt to sow distrust among Ukrainians and the international community. Interestingly, such accusations are often a projection of the Russian side's own actions. For example, as early as 2022, cases of the creation of fake charity sites imitating Ukrainian funds to collect funds to support the occupation forces were recorded. the Russians copied the design of well-known Ukrainian foundations, translated their materials and attributed the collected funds to their -volunteers-. Of course, fraud can happen in any society. For example, pseudo-volunteers were exposed in Kyiv who collected funds allegedly for the needs of the Armed Forces, but spent them on their own needs. However, such cases are isolated and do not reflect the general picture of selfless work of Ukrainian volunteers. The main goal of such fakes is to undermine trust in the volunteer movement and reduce support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. By spreading false information about -non-existent- brigades and fraudulent assemblies, Russian propaganda is trying to demoralize Ukrainian society and sow discord. To avoid becoming a victim of misinformation: Remember that informational hygiene is no less important than physical hygiene. In times when propaganda tries to influence our thoughts and actions, critical thinking and mindfulness are the best defenses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/03/01/rofejky-pro-neisnuyuchi-brygady-zsu-koly-propaganda-perehodyt-mezhi-absurdu/	2025-02-28T20:02:08-08:00

The occupiers demand that schools finance training -cannon fodder-	informs on February 28, the Countering Disinformation Center (CCP) with reference to the Defense Forces of Ukraine. In 2024, prosecutors filed almost 200 such lawsuits, and in most cases the court sided with the state. Schools are required to equip a shooting range, purchase stores for Kalashnikov assault rifles with training cartridges, grenade models, shooting simulators, etc. It is noted that most educational institutions do not have money for this equipment, so they have to save on teaching materials or collect money from parents. As noted in the CPD, the lack of funds is explained by the fact that Moscow is cutting social programs due to huge military expenditures. -For example, the authorities of the Russian city of Irkutsk complain that for the second year in a row they have not received funds from the central budget for critically needed school repairs. But this does not concern the authorities in the Kremlin, their priority is the preparation of -cannon fodder-, the report says. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian occupiers increase informational pressure on the temporarily occupied and deeply controlled frontline territories of the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/okupanty-vymagayut-vid-shkil-finansuvaty-pidgotovku-garmatnogo-myasa/	2025-02-28T10:08:46-08:00
The occupiers handed over 42 children from the Kherson region to Russian families	informs on February 28, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Dmytro Lubinets. According to him, from 2022 to 2024, 42 children from the Kherson region, who were under occupation from the first days of the full-scale invasion, were transferred to Russian families for care. -for a long time, the Russian authorities hid information about children from the Kherson region and ignored the demands of the Ukrainian side to provide data on every deported and forcibly displaced child. In particular, little was known about the pupils of the Kherson Regional Children's Home,- the report says. In 2022, in order to save the children, the employees of the institution hid them in the basement of the church until they were found by FSB officers. Dmytro Lubinets noted that most of these children had parents or other legal representatives. However, the Russians took them to Crimea and placed them in the -Yalinka- children's home, known for its cruel treatment. -Questionnaires of some children later began to appear in the Russian federal adoption data bank. It is claimed that 10 children from Kherson Oblast are still in this children's institution in Crimea, for whom a -new home- is being sought, he said. The Ombudsman emphasized that such actions are a gross violation of international law, the IV Geneva Convention and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. -The deportation of Ukrainian children and their forced transfer to Russian families is a war crime for which the perpetrators must be held accountable!- - he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, at least 1.5 million children from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine have already passed through propaganda processing of the Russian Federation. This is how the aggressor country cultivates potential agents of influence for itself in the theoretically de-occupied territories of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/okupanty-peredaly-42-dytyny-z-hersonshhyny-pid-opiku-v-rosijski-sim%ca%bcyi/	2025-02-28T09:51:37-08:00

Yuriy Syrotyuk, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th assault brigade, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyni telethon. According to him, at first, Russian commanders send those who do not feel sorry for infantry attacks - mostly wounded, with bad ammunition. When the firing positions of the Defense Forces are determined, the occupiers send more trained fighters into endless assaults. Yuriy Syrotyuk noted that, in general, the army of the Russian Federation has changed a lot. -The other day, they saw a sledge being pulled behind them. The Russian army is degrading in technical terms. This is visible to the naked eye. If tanks, then tanks are old, if BMP, then old. But, unfortunately, the ability to send new troops does not degrade. That's why 3-4 -vanyushkas- go and pull the sledges behind them. On those sleds they are pulling some kind of ammunition. We notice them all, destroy them,- he said. As ArmyInform reported, Russians and Koreans are constantly storming the positions of the Defense Forces in the Kursk region.

According to the case materials, the accomplice of the enemy turned out to be a 16-year-old schoolboy from the Zhytomyr region, who was involved in criminal activities by the Russian special services in exchange for money. As the investigation established, a minor terrorist should have left an improvised explosive device (IED) disguised in a backpack on the Alley. -At that moment, the occupiers planned to detonate the explosives remotely together with their agent. In this way, the Russian special service hoped to achieve two goals: to carry out a bloody terrorist attack with a large number of victims, and also to eliminate its agent as an -extra witness-, the report says. SBU counter-intelligence early exposed the enemy's plot and arrested the perpetrator -in the act- when the young man was approaching the site of the planned terrorist attack. -The schoolboy made the SVP himself according to the instructions from the Russian curator. To disguise the explosives, he placed them in a pan, and to enhance the striking effect, he additionally stuffed the explosives with iron screws. Then, instead of going to school, the young man took a taxi to Zhytomyr to prepare for a terrorist attack,- the SBU said. The agent was in constant communication with the Russian intelligence officer throughout the entire drive to the central avenue. After receiving the -report- of arrival at the destination, the occupants had to activate the SVP by calling a mobile phone that was connected to the explosive device. However, thanks to the anticipatory actions of the law enforcement officers, the tragedy was prevented. -Currently, the investigators of the Security Service plan to notify the detainee of the suspicion for h. 1 Art. 14, ch. 2 Art. 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (preparation to commit a terrorist act). The perpetrator faces up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property,- the SBU said.

At $500 per head, our pilots calculated how much one dead occupier costs them	The calculations were published on February 28 on the unit's channel. -Recently, our group closed a round number. You can also talk a little about statistics and costs. During the two weeks of work, the occupier's losses from the -Cartuze- amounted to 101 units of manpower (51 killed and 50 wounded). 17 -Mavik-3--standard, with an average cost of $1,800, were spent on this work. Seven drones were lost in one day due to difficult weather conditions, namely wet snow that stuck the camera and it was impossible to return home. But on this day, the enemy was very active, and it was impossible not to work. Other drones were lost mainly due to powerful communication suppression, and two drones were shot down with small arms. During this time of work, 700 Foot Crusher ammunition were spent, the cost of one is 500 UAH. That is, an average of 7 -bimbs- were spent on one target. Of course, this is not practical data, 65 percent of the ammunition simply did not make it home due to the absence of a target and weather conditions. Also, 3 -Avenger- antennas burned during the snowfall. So, the average cost of one destroyed target was approximately $500, including all expenses,- said the message of -Sharp Kartuzy-.

Poland for $10,000 — a law enforcement officer was detained in Volyn with accomplices who broke a wi...	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on February 28. In January of this year, a law enforcement officer met with a familiar conscript who was looking for ways to travel abroad. He assured that he would be able to ferry him to Poland outside the checkpoint in the territory of the Volyn region. The cost of the service was estimated at $10,000. The law enforcement officer assured that he would take the man directly to the border, bypassing the checkpoints, and help him cross the border. The -client- was ordered to gather the necessary things and wait for the signal. On February 24, he was informed that everything was ready for the transfer and a meeting was scheduled in Lutsk. There, the client gave the accomplice an advance in the amount of $1,000. Then the man was taken closer to the border with Poland. After handing over the rest of the money — $9,000 — the law enforcement officer and his accomplices were detained by the FBI. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/polshha-za-10000-na-volyni-zatrymala-pravoohoronczya-zi-spilnykamy-yaki-prorubaly-vikno-v-yes/	2025-02-28T05:23:22-08:00
The drone coalition announced the third international tender	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Ukrainian companies, as in the series of tenders for interceptor drones and FPV drones, can submit applications. Proposals are accepted until March 17. To view the technical requirements and to participate in the tender, the company must register on the portal of the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain Defence Sourcing Portal and select to apply for a Drone lot Capability Coalition - Tactical Multirotor ISR UAV. The Ministry of Defense reported that the Defense Forces have an urgent need for tactical-level multi-rotor ISR, which is why the Drone Coalition has decided to focus on these drones. Thanks to them, the military can scout the area and increase the situational awareness of their units. -We continue to create an asymmetric advantage thanks to the scaling of drone production both in Ukraine and abroad,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization. According to her, it is important not to lose momentum and increase the capabilities of the Defense Forces so that they can destroy the enemy as much as possible. The MOU recalled that in the previous tender there were two lots - improved FPV and interceptor drones. Then Ukrainian manufacturers were able to participate in the competition for the first time. According to its results, 14 companies were selected for the FPV drone lot, and 5 companies were selected for the interceptor lot. -In January-February, these models were tested in Latvia. Next, the best means will be tested in Ukraine, and in the event of confirmation of the declared characteristics, the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain will conclude contracts for mass procurement at the expense of the Joint Fund of the Drone Coalition,- the message reads. The drone coalition was formed in February 2024 during the 19th Ramstein-format meeting. This idea was proposed by Latvia. Together with Great Britain, they coordinate the work of the initiative. It currently includes 18 countries: Latvia, Great Britain, Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Estonia, Italy, New Zealand, Canada, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Germany, Sweden and Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/koalicziya-droniv-ogolosyla-tretij-mizhnarodnyj-tender/	2025-02-28T05:08:29-08:00
In Sumy Oblast, one and a half centners of explosives were dropped into the air from enemy drones	The National Police reported this on February 28. In the Sumy district, local residents discovered the wreckage of an enemy attack drone. The most dangerous part of the find turned out to be a 50-kilogram warhead that did not detonate when it fell. Police explosives officers conducted a thorough inspection and successfully defused it. At another location, in the middle of the field, experts discovered another downed UAV. Its warhead was almost twice as large as the previous one — 90 kilograms of explosive power. Explosive technicians eliminated the danger, preventing a threat to people. After successful demining, both combat units were taken to a specially designated place and destroyed by controlled detonation.

The video of the incident was released on February 28 on the channel of the Black Swan strike group of the 225th Assault Regiment. The footage shows how the Russian undressed to the waist for some reason and started aiming fire from a machine gun. But it could not hit our drone.

The commander of the brigade of the Russian army was informed of the suspicion of the use of chemica...	This was announced on February 28 by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the investigation, the suspect gave a direct order on the battlefield to use means of warfare prohibited by international law — K-51 and RG-Vo gas hand grenades equipped with tear gas (CS, CN). As a result of the use of these grenades, servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donetsk region received chemical damage. Such facts are not isolated. In December 2024, the suspicion of similar actions was already reported to the lieutenant general, chief of the radiation, chemical and biological defense forces of the Soviet Union. During the investigation, evidence was obtained that he ensured the use of chemical weapons in hostilities against Ukraine. According to the Hague Convention, warring parties do not enjoy an unlimited right to choose the means of inflicting damage on the enemy. International humanitarian law prohibits weapons, projectiles, substances that can cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering. Taras Semkiv, Deputy Head of the Department for Combating Crimes Committed in Conditions of Armed Conflict of the Prosecutor General's Office, reminds that Ukraine and the Russian Federation are full participants in the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, Use of Chemical Weapons, and on Their Destruction. According to p. 5th century I of the Convention, each state party undertakes not to use chemical means of fighting riots as a means of warfare. However, prosecutors, together with SBU investigators, in cooperation with specialized structural units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, constantly record the facts of the use of chemical weapons banned in the Russian Federation as a means of waging war. The prosecutor's office and investigative bodies cooperate closely with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and take samples of chemical weapons, including on the battlefield, in accordance with the relevant protocols of the OPCW. In the future, the OPCW examines the received samples in several separate independent laboratories. -According to one of these facts, a report has already been received from this organization that there was indeed the use of combat poisonous substances, in particular SN gas, during the conduct of hostilities by representatives of the Russian Federation. Moreover, the representatives of the armed forces of the Russian Federation very often flaunt the use of appropriate means of fighting riots on the front line. It is obvious that they do not hide this, such facts are not punished in any way on the territory of Russia, the relevant investigations are not conducted, which indicates the complete connivance of such actions by the top military-political leadership of the Russian Federation,- said Taras Semkiv. As ArmiyaInform reported, it was reported about the suspicion of a major general of the Russian Armed Forces, who was looting the property of the Chornobyl NPP. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/povidomleno-pro-pidozru-komandyru-brygady-armiyi-rf-za-faktom-zastosuvannya-himichnoyi-zbroyi/	2025-02-28T04:07:06-08:00

The Ministry of Defense unified packaging and labeling for material property suppliers	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on February 28. This should optimize logistics processes, reduce unloading time, and reduce the burden on the Armed Forces supply centers. If earlier the requirements for packaging and labeling were assigned separately to each item, now they apply to tangible property in general. -The modern army needs effective logistics. Unification of packaging and labeling requirements is an important step toward systemically improving supply for the military. Clear standards simplify logistics, increase control and ensure fast and accurate shipment of property. We continue to work to ensure that every stage of providing the army is as efficient as possible and meets the real needs of the military,- Hleb Kanevskyi, director of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, emphasized. The document was developed by the Central Department of Material Support Development of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine together with the procurement agency of the DOT, the Central Department of Material Support of the Rear Command of the Logistics Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, joint support centers (OCZ) and SAP implementation experts. -In 2024, while visiting the OCZ, we saw how material property for the Armed Forces was being shipped. Most of the supplies came in bags, the weight of which was too much for the workers of the centers, many of whom were servicemen after being wounded. Manual unloading of such bags not only slowed down the process, but also created an additional burden on the staff. In addition, small markings made it difficult to identify property, and bulk storage took up too much space. In order to make the unloading process faster and more convenient, we, together with representatives of interested units of the Ministry of Defense, have developed a new technical specification for suppliers,- said Viktoriya Vinogradova, director of the tangible property program of the DOT. The updated requirements provide for the facilitation of the unloading process, which is especially important for servicemen who have been injured or wounded. In particular, the new rules apply to: In March, the DOT plans to visit all the unified security centers of Ukraine to assess the effectiveness of the new requirements. Preliminary results indicate a significant improvement in the delivery and labeling process. The Ministry of Defense and the DOT are open to suggestions and continue to analyze feedback from OCZ and suppliers to further improve the system and make changes to the technical specification. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Ministry of Defense was told about the priorities in the field of defense procurement.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/minoborony-unifikuvalo-pakuvannya-j-markuvannya-dlya-postachalnykiv-rechovogo-majna/	2025-02-28T02:56:51-08:00

Drowning during a swamp assault: the Defense Forces said that it will stop enemy armored vehicles	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the -Suspilne.Novyny- broadcast. According to him, the situation there is more difficult than the situation in the Pokrovsky direction, despite the slightly lower number of military clashes. The occupiers have concentrated a lot of forces on the Novopavlovsk region, and the Ukrainians do not have Pokrovsk to rely on as a large base. However, the situation may change dramatically soon. After all, forecasters promise warming. -Warming can change the situation, slightly reducing the effectiveness of attacks, including reducing the effectiveness of the use of armored vehicles. Maybe it will bind them a little, because now the ground is frozen. And if the temperature there will really be in the region of +5+10, then even armored vehicles will not be very comfortable to advance on the dirty off-road, especially under the conditions of effective mining,- said Viktor Tregubov. As reported ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction the invaders are not waiting for reinforcements one or two at a time, but are trying to attack our positions on their own.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/potonuty-pid-chas-bolotyanogo-shturmu-v-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-shho-pryzupynyt-vorozhu-bronetehniku/	2025-02-28T00:04:51-08:00

A couple of suicides — in the Pokrovsky area, the Russians are using unprecedented tactics	Captain Anton Shestakov, head of the operational planning section of the 4th battalion of the Spartan operational brigade, told about this on ArmiyaTV stream. -Very often, one or two go out to attack with weapons, with the intention of seizing a position on their own. Apart from this direction, we have never seen anything like this, we have never encountered anything like this,- shared Anton Shestakov. According to him, Russian attack aircraft have to cover dozens of kilometers on foot to our positions, because our drones are destroying the enemy's equipment. During these transitions, the occupiers are hit by skids and kamikaze drones, the Russians run away, hide in abandoned dugouts, meet the remnants of the previous groups and continue their movement again until complete destruction. As reported by ArmyInform, Spartan drones turn enemy infantry into -targets-. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/parochky-samogubcziv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-rosiyany-zastosovuyut-nebachenu-taktyku/	2025-02-27T22:56:49-08:00

More than a plane: how the Mirage 2000 fighter became one of the symbols of France	In the continuation of this interview, Professor Haruk talked about how engineers and designers from the country of the Gallic Roosters turned the fairy tale into reality and put the Mirage 2000 on the wing. —Andrii Ivanovych, we ended our previous conversation with the fact that the then President of the French Republic, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, receiving the outstanding aircraft designer and Dassault Aviation president Marcel Dasso in the Elysee Palace, emphasized that the country's government would buy only Mirage 2000 single-engine aircraft for the French Air Force. What was this position of the French leadership based on? — The Mirage 2000 aircraft project was conceived by the specialists of the Avion Marcel Dassault company in 1972. as a low-cost alternative, a kind of back-up option in case of abandonment of the complex and expensive ACF -combat aircraft of the future- project, which was being implemented at that time. The calculation turned out to be correct - when in 1975 the program to create the ACF was closed by the decision of the French government, the alternative version of the new combat aircraft came to the fore. ACF's design experience was not lost: for the Mirage 2000, a number of his developments were used, in particular the TRDDF engine SNECMA M53. The aerodynamic design — a tailless with a low-slung delta wing (leading edge sweep of 58°) — was borrowed from its very successful predecessor, the Mirage III fighter. However, thanks to the use of an electric remote control system, the maneuverability and controllability of the new Mirage turned out to be much better than that of its predecessor. Traditional aluminum alloys became the main structural materials for Mirage 2000; along with them, carbon-plastic panels found some use in the construction. - With the design features of this aircraft, everything is more or less clear. And what about the terms of implementing ideas and bringing them to the creation of real prototypes? - The significant commonality of the design with the Mirage III and the use of an already ready engine ensured the implementation of the project in a very short time: from the official start of the program to the flight of the first prototype, which took place on May 10, 1978, only 27 months passed. Half a year later, on September 18, 1978, the second car was tested. In total, five prototypes were produced, the last of which (two-seater) took off for the first time on October 11, 1980. — What leading tasks were significant for the engineers and designers of the French fighter? — During the creation of the Mirage 2000, the functions of a fighter-interceptor were considered a priority. It was this variant under the designation -Mirage 2000C- that was first introduced into serial production, which began at the end of 1982. In total, the French Air Force received 124 such aircraft. The first 37 cars, which belonged to the S1, S2 and S3 series, were equipped with M53-5 engines (thrust at maximum speed / afterburner 5500/8800 kgf), and the following S4 and S5 series - M53-P2 (respectively, 6600/9700 kgf). The aircraft in its standard version was equipped with the Thomson-CSF RDM radar (range 60-70 km). However, the refinement of this radar required time, so the first serial fighters received the RDM-1 radar with limited capabilities - it could not provide the use of air-to-air radar with a semi-active radar GOS. Since 1987, the Mirage 2000S has been equipped with an RDI radar with an increased range of up to 100 km and improved ground target recognition capabilities. The aircraft has a developed EW complex, which includes the Serval radar radiation warning station, the Saber active jamming station and the Eclair false target shooting device (a new Spiral device was installed from the 93rd Mirage 2000C). In the mid-1990s. some of the planes that participated in operations over the Balkans were additionally equipped with -Samir- missile attack warning stations. The Mirage 2000S cabin equipment is primarily represented by traditional analog devices. There is also an indicator on the background of the windshield. —What can you tell us about the Mirage armament?—The built-in armament of the Mirage 2000S consists of two 30-mm DEFA 554 cannons with 125 rounds of ammunition. Suspended weapons with a total weight of up to 6,300 kg are located on nine nodes: five under the fuselage and four under the wings. The center under-fuselage assembly and inboard wing pods are -wet-, meaning additional fuel tanks can be hung from them. The main armament of the air-to-air class is the R.530 medium-range missile (with a semi-active radar or infrared homing system) and the close combat R.550 -Mazhik- (with an infrared homing system). A typical warload variant included two R.530 and two R.550 missiles on underwing assemblies. In the 1990s the Mirage 2000S armament includes a new MICA IR guided missile with an IR homing system (another version of this missile is the MICA EM with an active radar homing system - aircraft of this modification cannot be used). To hit ground targets, the aircraft can use conventional aerial bombs, bomb cartridges, as well as anti-aircraft missiles. The use of KAB and KR with laser guidance is allowed, but the Mirage 2000S onboard equipment does not provide target illumination. Therefore, this function must be performed by another aircraft with the appropriate equipment or by a ground-based aircraft gunner. — As far as is known, the Dassault Aviation company also produced so-called sparks, aircraft for pilot training. Were any features introduced there? — Indeed, the French Air Force also received 30 Mirage 2000B two-seater combat training aircraft. This variant fully corresponds to the Mirage 2000S fighter in terms of the BREO composition and combat capabilities. However, the Mirage 2000B (like all other two-seaters of this family) does not have built-in guns. Instead, it is possible to hang an under-fuselage container SS630 with two 30-mm cannons and ammunition of 300 shells per barrel. —In addition to meeting the needs of their own Air Force, Mirage manufacturers immediately aimed to conquer foreign markets. Did potential foreign buyers have any special wishes? - From the very beginning of the development of the Mirage 2000, its creators hoped that the new machine would be able to repeat the export success of its predecessors, the Mirage III and Mirage F1 fighters. But if the French Air Force could be satisfied with a specialized fighter-interceptor, most foreign buyers needed a multi-purpose aircraft capable of striking ground and surface targets as well. With these requirements in mind, the Mirage 2000E export version was created. It was equipped with an RDM+ radar with advanced capabilities, and could also carry an Atlas II laser range finder-target designator in an outboard container. — And where did France send the premier export aircraft? — Egypt became the first foreign buyer of the Mirage 2000. In 1981, he ordered 20 aircraft - 16 single-seater Mirage 2000EM and four two-seater Mirage 2000VM. As part of the set of aircraft, containers -Atlis II-, -Mazhik- and -Super 530-, -air-surface- AS.30L and PRR -Armat- were ordered. But since the command of the Egyptian Air Force wanted to receive aircraft with M53-R2 engines, their delivery had to wait until 1986. The 82nd Fighter Squadron (Jebel El Mansour Air Base) was equipped with these fighters. As of the beginning of 2023, 17 aircraft remained in its composition - 15 Mirage 2000EM and two Mirage 2000VM. The Indians were more impatient than the Egyptians - in order to speed up the delivery of the Mirage 2000, they agreed that some of the machines would receive M53-5 engines. The Indian Air Force has ordered 40 Mirages - 36 single-seat 2000H and four two-seat 2000TN. Their delivery began in 1985 and was carried out at a very fast pace - all 40 machines were delivered within 12 months. The first 30 aircraft (in particular, all four two-seaters) were equipped with M53-5 engines, the last ten received TRDDF M53-R2. Later, the rest of the fighters were converted with such engines. In March 1986, an additional batch was ordered - six Mirage 2000N and three Mirage 2000TN machines (five were delivered by 1990, and two more in 1992 and 1994), and in September 2000 - ten more aircraft (four single and six double). So, in total, the Indian Air Force received 59 -Mirages-: 46 2000N modifications and 13 - 2000TN. —The first combat use of the Mirage 2000 took place during the multinational Operation Desert Storm. But, as far as is known, the Indians did not only train on these planes - in the Indian Air Force, Mirage 2000 was called -Vajra- - -Lightning-. The 1st, 7th, and 9th squadrons of the 40th wing (Gwalior Air Base, Madhya Pradesh) were armed with such fighters. They received their baptism of fire during the Kargil conflict in 1999. Operating in the conditions of the highlands, -Mirages- made 515 sorties. In 240 of them, they struck ground targets, using not only conventional bombs, but also laser-guided anti-aircraft missiles. In 2011, India entered into an agreement to upgrade its aircraft to the Mirage 2000-5 Mk2 standard. The fighters get the RDY-2 multifunctional radar, the ICMS Mk4 integrated EW complex, the Totem 3000 navigation system, new monitors, a built-in oxygen generator, and the cockpit equipment is adapted to work with night vision goggles. The arsenal of modernized aircraft (the single-seater version was designated -Mirage 2000I-, and the two-seater - 2000TI) includes MISA air-to-air missiles; in addition, the planes are adapted to use Damocles sighting containers. The first two cars (one-seater and two-seater) underwent modernization in France in 2013 and were handed over to the customer in March 2015, the rest were finished in India. As of the beginning of 2023, 38 single-seater Mirage 2000s and 10 two-seaters remained in service, both modernized and non-modernized. In September 2021, India purchased another 24 used aircraft from France - 13 complete (of which 8 are to be restored to flying condition) and 11 partially dismantled. — It seems that these fighters were also delivered across the ocean, to South America? — In 1986, 12 aircraft — ten single-seater Mirage 2000R and two two-seater 2000DP — were received by the Peruvian Air Force. Together with them, they acquired the Mazhik 2 air-to-air missile defense system and a wide range of air-to-surface unguided weapons. The Peruvian Air Force equipped the 412th Fighter Wing (La Jolla Air Base in the south of the country) with Mirage 2000 aircraft. During the conflict with Ecuador in 1995. they carried out combat patrols, but did not manage to achieve any results. Since 1997, the aircraft have undergone limited modernization - they were adapted for the Lizard (Israeli-made) laser-guided KAB suspension, Remora and Caiman EW containers, and also installed devices for shooting down false targets -Spiral-. In 2010-2012 Peruvian Mirage 2000 aircraft were overhauled with the installation of the Totem 3000 navigation system. In 2018, information appeared about plans to modernize six machines, including arming them with MISA missiles, but no data on their implementation was published. It was assumed that the Peruvian Mirage 2000 jets would be in service until 2025, but after the retirement of the MiG-29 fighter jets, this term is likely to be extended. — According to information in the media, the following samples of these aircraft that were sent for export also had certain changes. What did they consist of? — If the planes purchased by Egypt, India and Peru were generally little different from the standard Mirage 2000S/B, then the next two customers — the UAE and Greece — received machines with significant changes in the BREO composition. The UAE (or, more precisely, one of the emirates that are part of this state - Abu Dhabi) in 1983. ordered a total of 36 Mirages: 22 2000EAD single-seat fighters, eight 2000RAD single-seat scouts, and six 2000DAD two-seat combat trainers. At the request of the customer, they were equipped with Italian-made EW equipment, the integration of which with the rest of the BREO delayed the start of deliveries until 1989. Mirage 2000RAD machines are the only specialized reconnaissance aircraft in the entire Mirage 2000 family. They can carry on the under-fuselage assembly one of three variants of the container with reconnaissance equipment: the SLAR 2000 side-viewing radar, the COR 2 photo-reconnaissance container, or the AA-3-38 -Harold- long-range long-range photography equipment. Mirage 2000 aircraft of the UAE Air Force took part in combat operations during Operation Desert Storm, patrolling the airspace. Greece ordered 40 aircraft in 1985 - 36 single-seater Mirage 2000EG and four two-seater Mirage 2000BG. In the mid-1990s. these aircraft underwent modernization under the Talos program - they received the RDM-3 radar, the ICMS Mk1 EW complex, and also acquired the ability to use the Super 530D air-to-air missile defense system and the Exoset AM39 missile defense system. Modernized aircraft received the designation -Mirage 2000EGM- and -Mirage 2000ВGM-.

Genocide of the occupiers, nomadic mortars, battles with the Wagnerites and bags of fire: ArmyInform...	Lawyer, graduated from the National Academy of Internal Affairs of Ukraine and Kyiv University of Intellectual Property and Law of the National University -Odesa Law Academy-. Engaged in business, for some time worked in the rapid response unit of the Court Security Service. Under his leadership, the battery's mortar calculations inflict heavy losses on the enemy near Pokrovsk, preventing him from advancing to the administrative borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region. This section of the front is now one of the hottest. The invaders advance with infantry, supported by drones, artillery and tanks. About the combat work of the mortar unit in the Pokrovsky direction, the battles with the Wagnerites in Bakhmut, the importance of coordination with neighboring units in the battle, how the enemy uses fiber-optic drones and what a -mortar fire bag- is for Russian attack aircraft - in the ArmyInform material. -From the beginning of the formation of the battalion in the position of commander of the mortar battery. We fought in Klishchiivka, Kurdyumivka, and Ozaryanivka, then in Bakhmut itself, in Ivanivsk, in these directions we fought with the -Wagner- PMK, then we were transferred near Siversk - Rozdolivka. We are already destroying the enemy in the Pokrovsk region. At first, we inflicted damage to raschists near the settlement of Vovkove, and now we are killing katsaps in the Kotlynoye district. So combat experience is enough, says Timur. On the armed battery there are 82 mm mortars. This is quite an effective means of defeating the enemy. The small weight and the possibility of disassembling the mortar into its main parts allow it to be transported by any type of transport, and if necessary, to be moved by calculation forces. The firing range is up to 4 km, we use this weapon to destroy or suppress the enemy's manpower and firepower, we hit trenches and trenches. Now we are stopping the advance of small assault groups of the Russian Federation near Pokrovsk with mortar fire. Mine is enough, we are creating hell for the occupiers. After the first hit, the mortar must be adjusted to the target. The type of mines and powders must be taken into account. Wind strength at different altitudes, humidity, air temperature - everything is important in our work. In some areas of the front, even before the mass use of FPV drones, they worked as -nomadic mortars-: they drove along the line through forest plantations, fired three shots, changed position, fired again, quickly rolled up and drove away. Now it is no longer possible. It is necessary to dig in, disguise weapons, install anti-drone nets and trench EW. After firing, stack the mortar and hide it in the dugout so that it is not cut by fragments. What are the enemy tactics near Pokrovsk? the Russians advance in small infantry groups of 8-10 people from different directions. If the aerial reconnaissance has detected the enemy, the coordinates of the targets are reset to us, and then we strike from the mortar weapons in the area of ​​the advance of the enemy groups. Their tactics are predictable. It is to occupy some line of defense, entrench, dig in and then advance and continue the offensive from already established positions. One group goes, we uncoil it, then the second group moves through the field and forest plantations, we also destroy it. Another group generally crosses over the corpses of -their own- and moves on. Russians do not feel sorry for people. They are pressing precisely with numbers and advancement from different directions. There are days when the guys don't move away from the mortars at all, and the gunner has to aim the mortar at the target many times a day. Typically, mortar rounds destroy more than 50 occupiers in one day. And only God knows how many more lay down that we did not see. the Rashists kill themselves with their weapons and grenades. If under Pokrovsk, combat work is more on moving targets in the field and forest plantations, then in Bakhmut, in the urbanized zone, we inflicted mortar strikes on stationary non-moving targets of the Rashists. These were some infantry positions, places of accumulation of manpower and weapons, machine gun and mortar nests in apartment buildings, offices, garages and private houses. The enemy could hide in the city, it is more difficult to knock him out here, unlike in the open area. But also in the field, if the enemy is prepared to survive under mortar fire, it is possible. Therefore, everywhere has its own nuances. There were very intense battles with the -Wagnerians- in Bahmut, they grinded the enemy as efficiently as possible. There were days when up to 100 Russian mercenaries were destroyed. That was the norm back then. The enemy then advanced in whole companies, and now here near Pokrovsk in detachments. I remember that in February 2023, due to the lack of infantrymen at the positions, they picked up a machine gun and met the enemy with fire at the front edge. The situation was very difficult, it was necessary to maintain the defense. After the shooting battle, I go out to see what is behind the trench, I see a picture - the dead bodies of the -Wagnerians- are lying everywhere, it was very cold, frosty and windy then. In general, mortar units operate relatively close to the battle contact line and save our infantry who are even closer to the enemy. Sometimes it happens that we practically stand together with the infantry, 200-300 meters from them. Every 2-3 days, we try to rotate guys in positions. People need to rest and recover. Work at the command and observation post of the battery is carried out around the clock. First of all, this is interaction with air reconnaissance, adjusting the forces and means of both the mortar battery and the units assigned to us from various artillery batteries. It is very important to set up combat work correctly, conduct reconnaissance of firing positions, equip them for mortars, camouflage weapons so that enemy UAVs do not detect them, provide logistics nodes, transport BC, evacuation issues, and so on. For me, there are 4 main aspects to the successful process of destroying an enemy: interaction with neighbors, adjustments, prioritization of targets, and the fire damage itself. Plus, we destroy the enemy and -open up- Russian dugouts not only with 82 mm mortars, we also have a 100-mm Rapira anti-tank gun and a self-made -mini-Grad- RSZV -Partizan- in our battery. In battle, coordination is very important both within the battery's mortar calculations and with neighboring units that are also working in our direction. Hitting the enemy is complex work. Here, not only mortars pile up, FPV drones join in, infantry suppresses with their fire from machine guns and mounted anti-tank grenade launchers plus barrel artillery and neighbor tanks. Mortars work, first of all, in the interests of infantrymen. They are the most difficult, they are the first to meet the enemy and are constantly under fire. Therefore, when the enemy attack aircraft come, mortar calculations are actually the first to support our guys on the front line and suppress the enemy. If our infantry does not enter the battle, it means that the mortars worked successfully. According to the classics of combat use: we are creating a so-called mortar fire bag for Russian assault groups. We attack the area of ​​their concentration with mines, at the same time we lay the mines so that the fragments from the shells catch up with each raschit. We see where the enemy is running, our drone is adjusting from above. In general, the combat work of mortar calculations depends very much on the situation on the front and on the actions of the enemy. I remember fighting against Russian paratroopers near Siversk, they knew how to attack in an organized manner with the support of drones. It was difficult with them. But there are such cases when at night the Russians storm the &#8230; own infantry positions. At some point, the enemy groups lose orientation on the terrain, do not have thermal imagers and go to their trenches. And here the most interesting thing begins: a fight begins, shooting, in this chaos, the Rashists kill each other. We are watching all this with popcorn, because we already know where their advanced infantry positions are. When it gets boring on the KSP, our mortars and strike drones are already connected to the highway, which finish off both enemy attack aircraft and raiders who are fighting off -their own- in the trenches. Behind the assault groups of the Russian Federation are -barrage squads- who shoot at everyone who does not go on the offensive or who abandons -their own- during the assault and turns back. Such radio interceptions occur periodically. This was especially evident in the area of ​​the settlement of Rozdolivka in the Seversky direction, where the occupiers threatened massacre. Then the Rashists committed mass suicides without even reaching our positions. Such is the fate of the Russian occupier. It happened that a platoon of invaders simply hid in the village and sat in the basements, did not go to the assault and did not return, because they were afraid that their people would be shot. Then the Katsap platoon commander was given the command -Go find your men, take them out or zero them right there in the basements.- Can anti-aircraft guns detect mortar fire? Perhaps the enemy is using a serif system and radar. After all, a mortar projectile flies quite high. They will be able to detect the approximate sector where our mortar is located. An enemy reconnaissance UAV takes off and conducts preliminary reconnaissance. But if a small 82 mm mortar is well camouflaged, it will not be visible at all and will be difficult to find in the area. We do some other things that the enemy doesn't know about and that saves the lives and health of mortar crews. The only rule in combat is to change to survive. The enemy improves tactics, we transform. On the contrary, we are making changes, and the Rashists are not sleeping either. If once more artillery hit our mortars, now it is the era of -fpvishok-, drone war. REBs come to the rescue, but not always, the occupiers began to use FPV drones on fiber optics. But I will say this, fiber-optic drones are slow and not maneuverable by their characteristics. Somehow the guys were evacuating from their positions and these -fpvishki- tried to catch up with the car. The car was at a speed of more than 70 km/h and the drone did not catch up with it. If you make a sharp maneuver, the FPV fiber will fly further, so there are options for survival. After all, he has to make a turn in the air, it takes some time. It cannot maneuver quickly like a normal FPV. Therefore, the enemy is increasingly using fiber-optic drones to attack stationary targets. Fortunately, we have not yet had to meet them in our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/genoczyd-okupantiv-kochovi-minomety-boyi-z-vagnerivczyamy-ta-vognevi-mishky-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-02-27T20:28:45-08:00
Propaganda in action: fiction about the lifting of sanctions by South Korea	Russian mass media, including RIA Novosti, reported that on February 28, Seoul allegedly decided to lift restrictions on the export of medical equipment to Russia. They present it as a sign of a reduction in international pressure and a normalization of relations. In fact, South Korea has made changes to the export control procedure that only apply to humanitarian supplies. This means that some medical equipment intended exclusively for humanitarian purposes can now be exported under a simplified procedure. Instead of a full licensing process, suppliers only need to declare the purpose of the shipment. This is another example of how Russian propaganda tries to pass off wishful thinking as reality. They distort the facts to create the illusion of support and lifting of sanctions. But, unfortunately for them, the world is not so naive and easily recognizes these manipulations. In the times of information wars, it is important to critically evaluate the sources of information and not succumb to provocations. Russian propaganda continues its attempts to misinform the world community, but the truth always comes out.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/28/rospropaganda-v-diyi-vygadky-pro-skasuvannya-sankczij-pivdennoyu-koreyeyu/	2025-02-27T20:12:17-08:00
With thanks to betrayal: an ex-policeman from Izyum exchanged his honor for a Russian -isolator-	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, the policeman voluntarily cooperated with the occupation authorities. First, he handed the Russian military letters of thanks from the residents of Izyum for the help of the Armed Forces. This information helped the occupiers identify pro-Ukrainian citizens. Subsequently, the traitor received the position of -head of the detention center for the temporary detention of suspects and accused persons- in the occupation -police-. In this position, he guarded illegally detained Ukrainians and issued documents according to Russian legislation. Before Izyum was released from the ZSU, the collaborator fled to Russia. Currently, the issue of declaring him wanted is being decided. As reported by ArmyInform, a 56-year-old man who publicly justified armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine was exposed in Kharkiv and admired the Russian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/z-podyakoyu-do-zrady-ekspoliczejskyj-z-izyuma-obminyav-chest-na-rosijskyj-yzolyator/	2025-02-27T11:53:11-08:00

The corresponding video was published on the brigade's page. -It's a shame to waste even drones on such attack aircraft - they stop themselves,- the brigade said in a statement. Three Russian soldiers tried to reach Ukrainian positions on motorcycles. But the plan failed: Ukrainian fighters from the BBS unit of the 63rd brigade had only to destroy the abandoned transport. -Guys, don't be sad, walking is healthier!- - added the Ukrainian defenders. As reported by ArmyInform, DBR employees in cooperation with the National Security Service of the National Police and the SBU detained the acting head of Khmelnytskyi of the district administration, which organized a scheme under which conscripts could receive the status of limited fitness for money.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/sami-sebe-zupynyly-rosijski-shturmovyky-osoromylys-pid-chas-sproby-prorvaty-ukrayinski-pozycziyi/	2025-02-27T11:06:47-08:00

According to reports, the Russian military tried to hide in shelters, but this did not save them from Ukrainian mortars. -The enemy mortars and their infantry hid in shelters - in vain. The accurate fire of the 5th Assault Force forced them to cease to exist,- the report said. As reported by ArmiyaInform, in the Kramatorsk area, the fighters of the 5th Kyiv assault brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces effectively use drones to destroy enemy equipment and personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/znyshheni-bez-variantiv-bijczi-syl-oborony-rozgromyly-rosijskyh-minometnykiv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-27T10:46:24-08:00
- Warming up- the occupiers in Toretsk: how the Ukrainian military hunts Russian drones	The video of the combat operation was made public on page 28 of a separate mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign. The enemy's calculation is simple: hide in broken houses, hide drones, and when necessary, call for help. However, the Ukrainian pilots of the Gyurza unit from the Unmanned Systems Battalion of the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade do not give them such an opportunity. Just one signal is enough, and the coordinates are transmitted to the artillery and gunners. It happened this time as well. The occupiers left visible signs of their presence - rags and antennas - hoping for help. But instead of reinforcements, they received a -warm- reception from the Ukrainian defenders: artillery, the 4th rifle battalion and drone operators of the 28th brigade destroyed their positions. As reported by ArmyInform, within the scope of the -Contract 18-24- project, hundreds of people applied to the 28th Brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign. Dozens of candidates have already passed the military medical commission, and some have signed contracts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/zigrivayemo-okupantiv-u-toreczku-yak-ukrayinski-vijskovi-polyuyut-na-rosijskyh-dronariv/	2025-02-27T10:37:05-08:00
- Girl-girl- on ATGM: the story of a defender who destroys enemy equipment	The defender's story was published on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Svetlana did not have a military education, but she owned firearms, had physical training and a psychological education. She was sure: if there is a desire, everything can be learned. -I understood that everything can be mastered if there is motivation. And when a new staff structure appeared in the brigade, I, as a junior sergeant, was appointed commander of the unit,- she says. However, not all her peers accepted her new role. -Guys whom I considered brothers suddenly became hostile,- admits Svetlana. -Not every man can accept a female commander.- Svitlana works with the Ukrainian Stugna-P anti-tank missile system, which allows you to destroy enemy equipment from cover. -I like that you can work from a trench where you are at least a little bit protected. You can aim, think, exhale, and make an accurate shot,- she says. And when the missile hits the target, it is a moment of special emotions. -I immediately edit a small video with motivational music and send it to our group. It energizes the whole team.- Despite the difficulties, Svetlana's motivation remains unchanged. -I have a goal, and it has not faded. I see the light at the end of the tunnel and go towards it. Nothing will affect me.- Her story is yet another proof that war knows no gender boundaries. The main thing is strength of spirit, faith in one's work and boundless love for Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, combat medic Anna with the nickname -Myshka- is a girl who has just turned 19 years old, consciously chose the path of a defender of Ukraine and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/divchynka-divchynka-na-ptrk-istoriya-zahysnyczi-yaka-nyshhyt-vorozhu-tehniku/	2025-02-27T10:26:44-08:00

But the meeting with the drones of -Spartan- does not leave them with any hope of salvation,- the brigade said in a statement. Ukrainian kamikaze drones staged a real -hunt- for Russian infantry, delivering precise strikes with FPV drones and drops. -Precise FPV strikes and drops stop the enemy's attempts to approach the positions of our infantry,- the brigade emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian command continues to demonstrate its -caring- attitude towards the personnel, sending to storm Ukrainian positions, even wounded servicemen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/gojdalky-dlya-okupantiv-yak-drony-spartanu-peretvoryuyut-vorozhu-pihotu-na-misheni/	2025-02-27T10:08:30-08:00
Welcome to the -Russian world-: the occupiers have deployed a new filtration camp on TOT	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. -Filter 'all inclusive' from the occupiers: a check for cooperation with the Armed Forces and a Russian passport as a gift,- the Center of National Resistance ironically commented on the situation. Residents of the occupied territories are forcibly taken to the camp, where they are subjected to interrogations and -checks-. At the same time, everyone is issued a Russian passport, effectively forcing them to become citizens of the aggressor country. -In fact, the Russians are committing genocide and destroying a nation in the heart of Europe right now,- the Center for National Resistance emphasizes. Despite the occupiers' attempts to cover up their crimes, the Center of National Resistance closely monitors camp staff and all those involved in their operation. -We emphasize that crimes against humanity have no time frame for prosecution and no one will escape retribution,- the statement said. The National Resistance Center is urging citizens to submit information that will help bring war criminals to justice at a link on their website.

The Ukrainian military tested the latest fiber optic modules -Shovkopryad-	This is reported by the Command of the Unmanned Systems Forces. This advanced development allows not only to expand the functionality of FPV drones, but also to integrate fiber optic modules into ground robotic complexes (GRC), as well as to provide control of surface and underwater unmanned systems. The developers of -Silkworm- emphasized the maximum simplicity and efficiency of the technological solution, which is critical for use in combat conditions. FPV drones equipped with these modules are light, maneuverable and capable of covering distances of more than 20 km, which gives Ukrainian drones a significant advantage in confrontation with the enemy. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine is actively expanding its capabilities to combat Russian strikes by introducing new technological solutions. One of these innovative steps was the use of FPV drones to destroy Iranian kamikaze drones Shahed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/ukrayinski-vijskovi-vyprobuvaly-novitni-optovolokonni-moduli-shovkopryad/	2025-02-27T09:27:08-08:00
From the occupation to the front: the story of Kherson, which became the eyes of the artillery in th...	The story of the fighter was made public on page 44 of the separate artillery brigade. Not having time to recover, -Kherson- went to the military commissariat. He was given a week to adapt and was sent to the ranks of the 44th Artillery Brigade. The 29-year-old hero in civilian life was a road foreman. He knew army discipline from his military service, and he also trained in ground defense in Kakhovka. In the Ternopil brigade, he serves as an operator-mechanic of the control platoon: he controls drone flights over the front line, guards positions and monitors the enemy from a height. Also ensures communication between units. -My work is dynamic,- Kherson says. — Especially interesting in firing positions. You arrive - and you see how the guys are holding on, how they are shooting.- The geography of the -Kherson- war is mainly the Zaporozhian areas. -At the beginning of the war, we used drones and were better than them,- Kherson recalls. — But time has changed the battlefield. Now EWs - means of electronic warfare - are jamming signals and disrupting plans, both theirs and ours.- According to the signalman, Ukrainian soldiers taught the occupiers to defend themselves. After successful counterattacks, the occupiers drew conclusions. Now they dig in everywhere, set up ambushes, prepare for all possible attacks. At the same time, their tactics have not changed - one can feel the -Sovietness-. -The 'meat assaults' continue,- Kherson says. -The main thing for them is to grab a piece of the city or a forest strip, they just go until they cover everything with their corpses.- The occupiers are constantly -monkeying- Ukrainians, Kherson notes. If they once did not understand each other on drones, now they are launching land-based UAVs, intercepting technologies. Their -Kulibins- find information on the Internet and tinker. -However, we still have the best specialists,- the interlocutor compares. — The boys are improving, making drones of various modifications, studying. Volunteers help, supply equipment. Even with minimal support, our engineers create incredible things.- He speaks about his brothers with special warmth. During the war, units in -Kherson- changed more than once. But I was always surrounded by friendly and sincere people. He still keeps in touch with many of them. Usually the -Kherson- group -flew- every other day. The schedule is the same: coffee at four in the morning, then they gather and go to the positions. From the sixth you can see the sky, the earth, the enemy. Laying down Starlink and waiting for the command - permission to take off. Searching all day. Outputs of enemy artillery, movement. A lot of information was obtained through interception. There were times when the occupiers and Ukrainians were caught intercepting, then guided to their positions. The arrivals were close. -We are more accurate,- Kherson says proudly. - Sometimes even their shells don't explode - a -defective state-. Kherson is motivated by the fact that he was in the occupation, what he saw what they are capable of. -Father remained in the occupation, we hardly spoke, so as not to frame him,- he continues bitterly. — They communicated only when I was on vacation. I knew that he was shocked when the city of Kherson was captured, I was worried for him. And then&#8230; He died. From that day on, no connections with those parts.- For him, this war is not just a front line. It is a personal line between ordinary life and horror. -They do what they want - with women, with children&#8230; No one wants a -second Bucha-. I was under occupation, so I went to the front. Because if they are not stopped, the same will happen to my mother, wife, child.- Kherson's values ​​are simple and indisputable: family and country. -There are many goals,- he says. — But the biggest thing is to be with the family. Everyone needs this. To create the future — for yourself, for your children. The most important thing is that it all ends. I'm doing everything I can.- As reported by ArmyInform, the 48-year-old intelligence officer Ihor from Crimea, for whom the issue of protecting his native land is a matter of principle, shared with his impressions of a recent combat mission.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/z-okupacziyi-na-front-istoriya-hersona-yakyj-stav-ochyma-artyleriyi-na-zaporizkomu-napryamku/	2025-02-27T09:06:21-08:00

- Loaves- burning, - Zhiguli- exploding — our pilots arranged the last trip for the occupiers	The video of combat work was released on February 27 on the battalion channel. The lack of armored vehicles forces the invaders to use civilian vehicles, which the Russians do not even try to protect them from drones. This leads to the fact that the equipment burns beautifully. -On loaves or zhigulys, it will still be a blast,- the battalion commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 110th mechanized brigade named after Corporal General Mark Bezruchko with drones destroyed a bunch of enemy armored vehicles and infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/buhanky-palayut-zhyguli-vybuhayut-nashi-piloty-vlashtuvaly-okupantam-ostannyu-podorozh/	2025-02-27T08:31:28-08:00
The Ministry of Defense spoke about priorities in the field of defense procurement	this was stated by First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavrilyuk, commenting on the key areas of military cooperation with European partners. -Today, more than ever, Europe must show strength in the face of the challenges ahead. It is fair to say that a strong Europe is impossible without a strong Ukraine,- he emphasized. According to Ivan Gavrylyuk, an important factor in increasing the combat capability of the army is the sphere of defense procurement. Key priorities in this direction for 2025 have been identified: improvement of procurement mechanisms, monitoring and control of contract execution, expansion of cooperation with international partners, creation of an effective internal control system. A separate priority is support for Ukrainian defense production. -Over the past three years, Ukraine has made a breakthrough in the development of the defense industry. Every year, about 70% of the budget of the Ministry of Defense, intended for the purchase of anti-aircraft missiles, is directed to the Ukrainian manufacturer,- said Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. At the same time, due to the lack of financial resources, a certain part of the production capacity of the domestic defense industry is currently not loaded. Therefore, it is imperative that Ukrainian allies increase their financial investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. One of the ways to finance defense production is to use the profits from the frozen assets of Russia. Work is underway with European partners on this issue. The MOU said that one part of the funds of the new tranche will be directed to the purchase of defense products in EU member states, the other to the purchase of weapons and equipment from Ukrainian defense and military enterprises. Other sources of funding for the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine are being discussed with allies. -Financial support of European partners is an investment not only in strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, but also in the defense of Europe,- concluded the First Deputy Minister of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, during the year the procurement agency of the Ministry of Defense -State rear operator- concluded 719 contracts for the total amount of UAH 74.6 billion, providing the army with food, ammunition and fuel and lubricants.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/u-minoborony-rozpovily-pro-priorytety-u-sferi-oboronnyh-zakupivel/	2025-02-27T08:14:39-08:00
Circular defense of the Third Assault Division, hunting for Russians in Toretsk: stream from the fro...	The stormtroopers had to maintain a circular defense, as well as fend off drones and withstand the arrival of cluster bombs. In Toretsk, the pilots of the -Gyurza- unit found hiding places of Russian drone operators and gave their coordinates to the fighters of the 28th brigade. According to good tradition, the fighters of the brigade sent warming gifts to the Russians and fired at the occupiers from their positions. Pilots of the Incognito battalion of the 54th brigade eliminated the Russians who went on an assault in a convertible. Instead of using expensive armored vehicles for attacks, the occupiers turned the Soviet -Bukhanka- into a -convertible-. This modification simply made it easier for our pilots. These and other topics are discussed by our hosts - lieutenants Serhiy Lipko and Yevhen Nazarenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/krugova-oborona-tretoyi-shturmovoyi-polyuvannya-na-rosiyan-v-toreczku-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2025-02-27T08:04:34-08:00

Figures and results Food: Material property: PMM: One of the key priorities of DOT is to build a system that makes corruption impossible. Corruption prevention mechanisms are built into all processes of the procurement agency of the Ministry of Defense. Including the process of interaction of employees in the team and the process of interaction of the team with external stakeholders. The agency works according to the approved Anti-corruption program for 2023-2025. In 2024, a three-level control system was introduced. This makes it possible to clearly distinguish three main functions: More than 1,600 business partner checks have also been carried out. To implement international management standards, the State rear operator cooperates with NATO's leading procurement agencies. The DOT will continue to digitize processes, implement new approaches to supplier evaluation, and strengthen transparency through the independent oversight of the Supervisory Board. The work of the DOT demonstrates that, even in wartime, it is possible to create an effective and open rear support system that works in the interests of every serviceman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/zaoshhadyly-163-mlrd-grn-na-zakupivlyah-u-mou-rozpovily-pro-klyuchovi-pokaznyky-roboty-dot-za-rik/	2025-02-27T05:53:33-08:00

- On armored vehicles, which drones fly into - Russian assault roulette in the Novopavlovsk directio...	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the broadcast of -Social News-. According to him, the efficiency is low for several reasons. The main thing is that it is convenient to advance there only along the Mokri Yala River, where settlements follow one after another. It is because of this that the enemy can actually go -from house to house-. In other directions, large spaces begin, which must be overcome by machinery. -On armored vehicles, which drones fly into, or on motorized vehicles, which drones fly into. This is one of the few places where they still walk in armored columns, trying to land an amphibious assault. There were cases when they managed to do it, then this landing party was destroyed. But it happens when they attacked in the direction of the village of Bagatyr. The first few tanks immediately blew up just on the mine barriers, and other drones flew into them,- Viktor Tregubov noted. As ArmyInform reported, the Defense Forces took control of Kotlyna in the Pokrovsk direction. Such counterattacks testify to the effectively built interaction of UAV units with assault and motorized infantry units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/na-bronetehniczi-v-yaku-prylitayut-drony-rosijska-shturmova-ruletka-na-novopavlivskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-27T04:11:49-08:00

Guardian angel from the front: how a 21-year-old medic saves lives on the front	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -Twenty-two families were killed before my eyes. People were kidnapped and tortured. The most active people who went to peaceful rallies were executed in public,- the fighter recalls. After leaving the occupation, the 21-year-old medic joined the 33rd brigade. His first combat appearance took place on June 8, 2023, during the Zaporizhia counteroffensive. -Our Unimog medevac was jammed with ammunition and medical supplies. The offensive began, real chaos. The wounded were evacuated, stabilized and transported to the headquarters in Tavriyske. About forty people were taken out during the day,- says -Malibu-. In a few days, the enemy fired at a medical car, and only a chance saved the medic - a fragment pierced the car exactly where he was sitting a few minutes ago. And near Malaya Tokmachka, he risked his life, pulling out the wounded under mortar fire. -The fighters calmed down when they saw me. One said he would die. I answered: -You will see your wife and children again, we will talk more than once.- Once during the evacuation, the doors of the Unimog opened, and the Malibu had to hold the wounded so that they would not fall out on the move. In another case, during the evacuation of the wounded from Donetsk region, a combat vehicle came under fire and broke down. We had to save our comrades on an ordinary UAZ, where only bulletproof vests and helmets were the only protection. -In the high beam, we run towards them. They honked and we turned off our lights. They arrived, loaded the wounded. Orcs fired mortars in the back, but we managed to escape.- The -Malibu- medic has no doubt what the end of the war should be: -For me, Victory is the return of all Ukrainian territories to the borders of 1991. We don't need someone else's - we need to return our own. And Russia, until it is cleansed, must remain in isolation for many centuries.- As reported by ArmyInform, an unusual soldier serves in the 33rd separate mechanized brigade - a UAV engineer with the call sign -Balu-. Once he dreamed of creating smart homes, and now destroys the invaders with the help of smart FPV drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/angel-ohoronecz-z-peredovoyi-yak-21-richnyj-medyk-ryatuye-zhyttya-na-fronti/	2025-02-27T03:43:41-08:00

A motorcycle equals death - our drones destroyed a bunch of enemy riders	A video of combat work was released on February 27 on the unit's channel. Quite often, our pilots encountered a couple of Russians on motorcycles, which made it possible to double the effectiveness of kamikaze drones. Some of the invaders threw away their motorcycles and tried to escape on foot, but they did not succeed. -From the Pokrovsky direction, we received an order for a video clip about motorized assault troops. The order has been completed in full. We could not miss such a trip to the motor show. They will be moving to other concerts,- the unit commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, in Donetsk, the pilots of the Muramasa unit strike drones destroyed enemy equipment that was delivering ammunition and provisions to Russian troops.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/motoczykl-dorivnyuye-smerti-nashi-dronari-znyshhyly-kupu-vorozhyh-gonshhykiv/	2025-02-27T03:12:44-08:00
A minor is insane - in the Dnipro region, a teenager was exposed for working for the enemy	The Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Prosecutor's Office reported this on February 27.

Policeman on call - in Odesa region, a law enforcement officer who transported evaders went to court	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on February 27. The law enforcement officer decided to organize a transfer scheme last September. He knew the border area and the location of checkpoints well. The man recruited people who wanted to leave Ukraine through social networks, and took $6.5 thousand from each of them for repatriation. Accomplices who were supposed to take men to the border with unrecognized Transnistria helped him to find -clients-. DBR employees detained an official while trying to cross the border with four conscripts. Currently, the law enforcement officer has been dismissed from service and is accused of illegally transporting persons across the state border (Part 3 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the article provides for a punishment of up to 9 years of imprisonment. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/policziyant-za-vyklykom-na-odeshhyni-pid-sud-pishov-pravoohornecz-yakyj-perevozyv-uhylyantiv/	2025-02-27T02:12:07-08:00
Four Russian commanders who organized the large-scale shelling of Kharkiv were identified	This was announced on February 27 by the Prosecutor General's Office. Law enforcement officers identified those involved in the large-scale shelling of Kharkiv on February 28, 2022. Then the troops of the aggressor state carried out an attack with high-explosive cluster unguided rockets from the Smerch anti-aircraft missile system on civilian objects in the Shevchenkiv district of Kharkiv. 8 civilians died, including a 17-year-old boy. One woman also received multiple injuries. &nbsp; Several high-rise buildings were damaged. The school was almost completely destroyed - the examination established that the damage was more than 13 million hryvnias. The kindergarten was also under attack - experts estimated the damage to the amount of almost 2.2 million hryvnias. According to the investigation, on February 24, 2022, in the direction of the Kharkiv region, units of the Zapad group of troops of the Soviet Union of the Russian Federation, formed on the basis of units of the Western Military District, were operating in the direction of the Kharkiv region, which used means of indiscriminate impact, in particular, the Smerch SAM. It was established that the group of fire and nuclear damage of the headquarters of the Western Military District under the direct leadership of the colonel of the Russian Armed Forces - the deputy chief of staff of the military headquarters - prepared a decision to strike with reactive cluster shells from the -Smerch- MLRS. The decision was approved directly by the Colonel-General of the Russian Armed Forces, the commander of the Air Force, and his first deputy, the Lieutenant General of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. In order to carry out the criminal plan of the higher command, realizing that the shelling was aimed exclusively at civilian objects and realizing that the strike would cause a large number of civilian casualties, the colonel of the Russian Federation - the commander of the 79th reactive artillery brigade of the ZVO (military unit 53956, Tver) issued a criminal order to carry out the specified decision and strike at Kharkiv. Prosecutors, together with other law enforcement officers, continue to make maximum efforts to identify Russian military personnel involved in the shelling of Kharkiv region. As ArmiyaInform reported, the SBU in absentia served suspicion on the Kremlin singer-propagandist.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/identyfikuvaly-4-rosijskyh-komandyriv-yaki-organizuvaly-masshtabnyj-obstril-harkova/	2025-02-27T01:57:51-08:00

Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the air of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. According to him, such successful operations are very important. After all, they point out that in the Pokrovsky direction, where the Russians make the greatest efforts and where the largest number of their troops are concentrated, they have the greatest failures. Even Russian propagandists complain about the problems. -There are several factors that the Russians complain about. The first is the dominance of Ukrainian drones, the second is the lack of personnel, which is very fun to hear from Russian military personnel. And thirdly, they cry about the fact that anti-aircraft missiles have become less effective, because it has become more difficult for them to target due to the effective Ukrainian electronic warfare system,- Viktor Tregubov said. This is the view of the enemy, Viktor Tregubov noted. However, it can be stated that in the Pokrovsky direction, a system of interaction of UAVs with motorized infantry and assault units is now really effectively built. The Russians, in addition to everything else, have problems with logistics. They drain resources. -Now they have switched to civilian cars. Because the military is actually ending. Given that they always had problems with the same rubber, it became a little more difficult for them with the premises. And this is during the period when the ground froze a little. Literally, if we believe the forecasters, in five days we will have an actual spring, and then we will see how the Russians will be with logistics in general,- predicted the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. As ArmyInform reported, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, in connection with the intensification of the enemy's actions, worked in our brigades, which are conducting the defense in the Novopavlovsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/ye-kilka-faktoriv-na-yaki-skarzhatsya-rosiyany-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-nevdachi-voroga-bilya-pokrovska/	2025-02-27T01:54:18-08:00

Oleg Chaus, the chief sergeant of the 47th separate mechanized brigade company, told about this on the air of -Social News-. According to him, after the return of winter weather, the assaults continued. First with infantry, then the enemy tried to break through the ranks of the Defense Forces with equipment. And when the BMP and tanks were knocked out - again by infantry. The captives, Chaus notes, say that usually four to five soldiers are launched into the attack, who try to accumulate and slowly advance in sections. -I can say about the morale of the 155th brigade, which committed many war crimes. In their negotiations, we hear how low morale is there. They have no desire to go to the front lines, to go to any assaults on our positions, even to -fortifications-, after some -meat- units enter there. They understand what awaits them,- said the chief sergeant of the company of the 47th separate mechanized brigade. As reported by ArmyInform, in Kurshchyna, enemy drones on optical fiber are used in such quantities, that everything is filled with their fiber.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/vony-ne-mayut-bazhannya-jty-v-kurskij-oblasti-protyvnyk-znaye-shho-jogo-chekaye-pid-chas-shturmu/	2025-02-27T01:42:19-08:00
Tested by war: the Ministry of Defense showed NATO the operation of DELTA, Avengers and UA DRONE ID ...	This was notified in the MOU. A demonstration of the practical application of these advanced developments took place at the NATO TIDE Sprint 2025 conference in Helsinki. -We bring not just concepts, but real combat technologies tested in war conditions. We show how digital products should work on the battlefield — quickly, reliably and taking into account the real needs of the military. The war forces us to develop solutions that are not just innovative, but critically necessary to repel the Russian onslaught,- said Lt. Col. Elizaveta Boyko, head of the Innovation Center department. Representatives of the Ministry of Defense told NATO partners how DELTA overcomes the challenges of war and why constant interaction between developers and the military is important for creating effective solutions. Particular attention was paid to issues of data protection in the system. The Naval Forces of Ukraine demonstrated the work of DELTA in maritime operations. The combat system has already become indispensable for coordinating forces, making operational decisions and managing combat operations on the water. The Ministry of Defense also showed examples of real use of the Avengers AI platform in combat conditions. Ukraine is currently the owner of the largest amount of accurate data on the appearance of the enemy's equipment. This allows you to create innovative tools using artificial intelligence to improve the auto-detection of enemy equipment. NATO representatives noted the high level of Ukrainian technologies and emphasized that DELTA is the most interoperable system even among the Alliance countries, which opens up new opportunities for cooperation and integration. -Modern warfare is not only about weapons, but also about technological superiority. We create solutions that help our military see more, react faster and act more precisely. DELTA and Avengers are not just innovations, but real combat tools that bring us closer to victory every day. Thanks to these technologies, Ukraine maintains its leadership in the field of digital combat systems,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/perevireni-vijnoyu-minoborony-pokazalo-nato-robotu-delta-avengers-ta-ua-drone-id-u-realnyh-bojovyh-umovah/	2025-02-27T01:36:32-08:00
Chatting on enemy attack aircraft - our pilots are on duty in Toretsk	Photos of their work were published on February 27 on the brigade's page. The city was completely destroyed by the Russians. Only dead ruins remained from the high-rise buildings. Sometimes they smoke. It seemed that there could no longer be anything alive here. But Ukrainian drones periodically see groups of local residents on the streets, who have delayed the evacuation to the point where it is practically impossible to carry it out. The main task is to prevent the movement of enemy attack aircraft, which are trying to advance deep into the city. They accumulate in the basements so that they can try to attack Ukrainian positions if there is an opportunity. Often, the occupiers carry EW with them to prevent the tracking of Ukrainian drones.

A Russian arson agent was detained in Kropyvnytskyi	reported this on February 27 Security Service of Ukraine. Employees of the SBU detained the suspect -red handed- when he was conducting additional reconnaissance near the electrical substation that supplies the regional hospital and several units of the Defense Forces.

Two officials who organized a corruption scheme in the capital and Volyn TCC were exposed	This was reported by the State Bureau of Investigation on February 27. In January 2025, the lieutenant colonel told one of the conscripts that he had acquaintances in the TCC and SP of Kyiv. With their -assistance-, he could update his military registration data and enter the necessary information into the -Oberig- register. The cost of such -services- was $4,000. After going through the entire necessary procedure for updating the military registration data, the official received the amount stipulated by him. Later, during meetings with other conscripts, the lieutenant colonel said that he had another set-up mechanism for updating military registration data through one of the TCC and SP of the Volyn region and could help do it for a monetary reward. He explained that his supervisor, the colonel of the command, is the former regional military commissar of the indicated region, and has relevant connections. The lieutenant colonel emphasized that -clients- do not even need to go to the Volyn region. He assured that he would independently fill out the necessary applications, draw up a fictitious lease agreement for the residence of -clients- in the territory of the region, and pass the VLK for them, but the cost of such services was already $9,000. In February 2025, a colonel from the command of one of the branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine contacted acting the head of one of the TCCs and SPs of the Volyn region and asked him to help his subordinate for the appropriate monetary reward. During this time, the scheme was used by three conscripts who handed over the monetary reward in two parts of 9 and 13 thousand US dollars. Law enforcement officers detained the accused while receiving the third part of the bribe. The officials were notified of the suspicion based on the signs of a criminal offense provided for in part. 5th century 27, ch. 3 Art. 368 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of deprivation of liberty for a term of up to ten years of imprisonment. Currently, investigative actions are ongoing with the aim of reporting the suspicion to other officials of one of the TCCs and SPs of the city. of Kyiv and one of the TCC and SP of the Volyn region, who acted in collusion with those involved. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/vykryto-dvoh-posadovcziv-yaki-organizuvav-korupczijnu-shemu-u-stolychnomu-ta-volynskomu-tczk/	2025-02-26T23:57:49-08:00
Normal pay -for greatness- — the Navy of the Armed Forces predicts whether the Russians will have a ...	Captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about this on the broadcast of the Yedyny Novyny telethon . According to him, earlier the eastern coast of the Russian Federation was actually a distant sea zone for the Defense Forces, and only Crimea fell into the zone of direct damage. Now, various -events- are taking place already in the part that is extremely important for the Russians. Precisely from the point of view of export capabilities. -Of course, I cannot provide any information about these cases or confirm what happened there. Because there is always the possibility that the Russians will bomb themselves. In fact, we see that periodically something happens at the terminals, at the oil depots. And you need to understand a few things. First, oil is a weapon for the Russians, and a weapon in every sense: both military and economic. -Oil is the blood that allows the military machine to work,- said the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy. It is too early to make predictions. However, it is likely that the -events- on the east coast will continue. And, Dmytro Pletenchuk admits, given the revitalization, there will be no holiday season there this year. Not in Tuapse, not in Anapa, not in Sochi. -Because there is an explosion here on one side, and oil is being thrown onto the coast from the other. Therefore, I am sure, there is nothing for the locals to worry about. It doesn't smell much, of course, sometimes people die from it, but, in principle, for Russians, -for greatness- is a normal fee,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. As reported ArmyInform, units of the Unmanned Systems Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Main Intelligence Directorate, in cooperation with other components of the Defense Forces, at night on February 26, 2025, they struck a number of strategic objects of the Russian invaders in the Krasnodar Territory of the Russian Federation and on the temporarily occupied territory of the Ukrainian Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/normalna-plata-za-vyelichiye-u-vms-zsu-prognozuyut-chy-bude-kurortnyj-sezon-u-rosiyan/	2025-02-26T23:55:35-08:00

-Speed ​​allows you to avoid enemy FPV-: how the French AMX-10 155 mech brigades stop the enemy near...	French AMX-10 tanks were transferred to the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the Anna Kyivska Armed Forces last year. After training in France, tank crews have been fighting in the Pokrovsky direction for more than two months. Together with other units of the brigade and adjacent units of the Armed Forces, they untangle the enemy and prevent him from advancing to the Pavlograd-Pokrovsk highway. In order to get to the combat vehicles, it is necessary to overcome broken dirt roads and populated areas of Donetsk region destroyed by enemy anti-tank missiles and artillery. There are hidden and well-camouflaged AMX-10 tanks in the forest. Let's get to know the crew: the tank commander, the driver-mechanic, the gunner and the loader. Tank commander Petro with the call sign -Yellow- from Uzhgorod, in the Armed Forces since August last year. He says that the French tank is very maneuverable and fast. -The tank is very mobile, it can turn around 360 degrees on the spot. Perfectly overcomes small obstacles and swampy roads. Hard-to-reach areas of the terrain are difficult for him, since he is wheeled and weighs almost 17 tons. On the track, it develops a speed of up to 80 km/h. It can go up to 30 km/h in reverse during rollback. In Soviet tanks, the reverse speed does not exceed 5 km/h,- says Petro. The gearbox is automatic, the tires have an inflation system. Interestingly, a hydropneumatic suspension is installed on the tank, which allows the AMX-10 to change ground clearance and pitch. This helps a lot during combat missions: the car can -squat-, which increases the angle of the gun's shot, you can reduce the silhouette of the car, fire from behind cover, using terrain and other objects. The tank is lightly armored, the armor is 20 mm, it can withstand fire from large-caliber machine guns, it is additionally equipped with an anti-drone net and a grill against UAV strikes. Its main purpose is to quickly move to the line of fire, support the infantry with fire, make targeted strikes on the enemy, and just as quickly leave the position. So that the enemy could not detect the AMX-10. The tank has a smoke screen system and the ability to protect against means of mass destruction. The combat vehicle is armed with a 105-mm cannon with a firing range of up to 3 km depending on the type of projectile, ammunition of 38 shells and two 7.62 mm machine guns. One machine gun is placed on the armor from above, the other is mounted in the middle of the car. The fire control system is a very cool thing. It allows the crew to adjust shots, set ballistic corrections, projectile corrections, target distance, powder charge temperature, weather conditions, and the like. A laser range finder is installed for measuring the range to targets using the optical location method, in addition, there is a thermal imager for shooting at night. And most importantly, with the help of this system, the crew from the first shot accurately hits the target at a distance of 2 km from the enemy. We impress both moving and non-moving targets. Now, in this direction, we are destroying the advance of small enemy assault groups. We deliver targeted strikes on places of concentration, shelters and dugouts. How it happens: moved into position, the fire control system set the distance to the target, aimed the gun, then fired, the target was hit. We use 4 types of shells: cumulative, armor-piercing, high-explosive and smoke. We did not hit the enemy more than 2 km away, we usually shoot up to 1 km and a little more. We go on combat missions accompanied by our UAVs, which adjust fire from the air. A few days ago, we were reset the coordinates of the concentration of raschits. Conventional afforestation. The enemy was gathering there, planning to attack our infantry positions. The video showed a large and long dugout. There were probably more than 20-25 Russians there. The first 105 mm projectile flew from us, in parallel, the strike drones were dropping. They worked then to their credit, it's a pity that only the trees were damaged by fragments. Some injured racers crawled away from the affected area, but our FPV drone calculations finished them off. After the rollback, our tank began to be shelled with mortars. But due to the high speed, the crew safely left the combat mission area and returned to their -hideout-. By the way, the tank's high-speed capabilities allow us to avoid meeting enemy -fpvishkas- as well. In terms of armor, we do not use tank weapons. For this, the brigade uses other, more powerful means of destruction. And the enemy now very rarely uses heavy or lightly armored vehicles in our direction. Can the French AMX-10 tank be compared with classic tracked tanks of Soviet or foreign production? No, you can't. It is actually a light wheeled tank or combat vehicle with heavy weapons. In terms of combat capabilities, weapons and armor protection, the AMX-10 is significantly inferior to, for example, T-64 or T-72 tanks. Therefore, in a tank duel, a classic tank will, of course, win over a French tank. The 105-mm gun is not a serious argument in the fight against enemy battle tanks. Plus, this gun does not have stabilization, so it will not be able to fire while moving, instead, ordinary tracked tanks fire both on the spot and while moving, - noted the tank commander Petro. -I read that there are a lot of experts on the Internet who criticized and continue to criticize our training both in France and Ukraine. They talk about us, they say, we are not motivated, we don't know how to shoot, and so on. It is easy to engage in criticism while lying on sofas in warm apartments. We are here at the front, beating the invaders, and you are at home. Feel the difference? - Vasyl, the mechanic-driver of the tank, tells. A man from Lviv, in the 1990s served a term of service in the BMP. So he has experience driving and operating combat vehicles. -The training in France was very serious. We were taught by French instructors for two months. Theory, study of tank characteristics, repair of equipment, driving on roads, fields and swamps. Choosing a position for fire, masking a tank in forested areas and in an urbanized area. Well, and of course, shooting at targets, both from tank weapons and machine guns. Hitting targets from different distances, day and night. A lot of things were useful,- says Vasyl. Other crew members had never served in the army at all, so they were learning from scratch. The boys are charged, with each day of combat work they become more experienced.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/shvydkist-dozvolyaye-unykaty-vorozhyh-fpv-yak-franczuzki-amx-10-155-mehbrygady-zupynyayut-voroga-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-02-26T21:04:32-08:00
Expanding technical expansion: known for tanks, missiles and artillery systems, the arms manufacture...	According to Seoul-based news agency Yonhap News, the deal worth US$93.7 million is to be implemented by Korea Aerospace Industries KAI between 2025 and March 2029, with a corresponding logistics package and practical training for Iraqi forces. pilots, ArmiyaInform reports. By chance, local media recalled that, in addition to official Baghdad, interest in helicopters from the Republic of Korea was expressed at different times by the Philippines and Vietnam. In addition to Surion helicopters, the South Korean company KAI is trying to expand exports of aircraft equipment, in particular the T-50 and FA-50 training and combat aircraft, which are actively progress to international markets and have already been ordered by Iraq. Today, the active customer of these aircraft is Poland, which, in addition to their purchase, plans to become a service center for these aircraft in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. While researching these projects, experts of the Ukrainian defense portal IKK Defense Express (DE) emphasized two aspects - South Korea is selling its helicopters for export for the first time, and in addition, we are talking about machines for which the technologies were purchased in Europe. To be more specific, work on the KUH-1 Surion started in the summer of 2006 after a tender was held, the winner of which was the Eurocopter company. This fact, among other things, may explain why the South Korean KUH-1 Surion is visually somewhat similar to the NH90, about its creation and operational features we repeatedly told in our materials. At the same time, DE analysts claim that the value of this tender was the equivalent of $1.7 billion at 2017 prices. There is also information that Eurocopter specialists helped KAI, in particular, in the development of the power transmission, the main gearbox, the automatic flight control system and some other components. Powered by two Hanwha Techwin T700-701K turbocharged engines, the Surion maintains a maximum take-off weight of 8,709 kilograms, a flight range of 828 kilometers and a cruising speed of 251 kilometers per hour. It has advanced avionics, including GPS, radar warning systems and digital mapping capabilities, as well as safety features such as a bulletproof airframe and crash-resistant fuel tanks. The helicopter is designed for multi-purpose use, allowing it to perform both military and civilian missions in a variety of operational environments. In the Republic of Korea, Surion is used by the Army (ROKA) and various government agencies, including the Korea Forestry Service, the National Fire Agency, and the Coast Guard. Its functions include troop transport, firefighting, medical evacuation and search and rescue operations. Options include the Marineon for amphibious operations, firefighting models with 2,500 liter water tanks and night vision equipment, as well as mine-laying helicopters currently under development. The first flight of the South Korean KUH-1 Surion took place in March 2010. KUH 1 Surion multipurpose helicopters have been in service with the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan since 2012. At the beginning of 2024, according to data The Military Balance 2024, the South Korean Army Air Force had at its disposal about 200 KUH-1 Surions, another 27 such helicopters in the amphibious version are the aviation of the Marine Corps of the Navy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. KUH-1 Surion Basic Features: In December 2024, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) also entered into an agreement to assemble two KUH-1 Surion helicopters, specially designed for firefighting, with delivery expected by March 2029. By 2024, in total, more than 300 units of Surion and its variants have been produced and deployed, which demonstrates the universal application of this helicopter in various sectors of life.

A directed video about the -atrocities- of the Ukrainian military: propaganda descends into outright...	Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Kremlin -directors- regularly release videos of -horror- allegedly committed by the Armed Forces. Indeed, each new fake becomes a more blatant insult to the intelligence of even their own audience. This time we were shown a scene where -Ukrainian military- torture and kill -defenseless civilians-. The camera shoots comfortable angles, the light is exposed as in a cheap action movie, and the actors overplay in such a way that even second-rate cop series look more realistic. However, there is one -but- - their -Ukrainian military- speak Russian with a characteristic accent, and some -victims- have symbols of racist groups on their hands. It is not the first time that the occupiers have tried to pass off their crimes as the actions of the Armed Forces. Remember at least the story with Bucha, where at first they bragged about the purges, and then, when the world saw the bodies of tortured civilians, they started crying for a -stage-. Now the scheme is similar - they arrange show executions themselves, record them themselves, and then try to convince the world that Ukrainians did it. But there is one problem: unlike the Russian mass media, which eats any abomination from the hands of propagandists, the world community knows how to check the facts. And while the Moscow Telegram channels happily savor the new fake, independent journalists have already found a lot of inconsistencies: from geolocation to personnel analysis. The Kremlin continues to play in its genre, but every time it looks more and more pathetic. It seems that the propagandists have run out of ideas, and now they just run the same gum over and over again, adding a few new special effects. But here's the problem: even their own audience is beginning to doubt it. Because when you talk about -cruel Ukrainians- for ten years, and then your soldiers return home without limbs, some people start asking questions. And while they are shooting new -blockbusters-, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are working on a reality where the Russian invaders will forever remain in the past.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/27/zrezhysovane-video-pro-zvirstva-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh-rospropaganda-skochuyetsya-do-vidvertoyi-mayachni/	2025-02-26T20:07:35-08:00
Drones destroyed a Russian tank with an average cost of $2.2 million	They published a video of combat work on their channel. -The tank is a well-protected assault vehicle with high firepower and maneuverability. It is able to break through defenses and maintain fire superiority at the right moment,- the statement said. It is noted that the enemy most often uses the T-80 and its modifications equipped with combined armor, or so-called -sheds- (when the tank body is sheathed with metal sheets). -They are armed with a 125-mm 2A46 smoothbore gun with with a firing range of up to 10 km. Its average cost is $2.2 million. Under ideal conditions and road surfaces, such a tank can reach a speed of up to 70 km/h, but this instance did not manage to escape,- the defenders noted. Our fighters eliminated the driver-mechanic together with the equipment. The rest of the crew managed to escape, but ran towards the drone of neighboring Ukrainian units, where they were overtaken by -explosive gifts-. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the 412th Nemesis regiment in Luhansk region destroyed the anti-aircraft missile system Strela-10M4 (9K35M4) is one of the most modern modifications of the Soviet Strela-10 air defense system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/dronari-znyshhyly-rosijskyj-tank-serednoyu-vartistyu-22-mln/	2025-02-26T11:56:23-08:00

It is important for me and all of us in the world that America's aid is not stopped,- the President said. He also had a conversation with the Prime Minister of Portugal. -We coordinate all our efforts with the widest possible range of partners. Europeans should be a part of all diplomatic efforts concerning Europe, and this issue is not simply about what is now, it should always be exactly this practice: Europe should never be somewhere behind - second or third-rate,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. He thanked Portugal for its continued support, and the two sides agreed on further contacts. Also, the President signed decrees to honor the defenders of Ukraine. -In particular, Iryna Tsybukh, a combat medic, a very famous person, unfortunately, was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.

Maksym comes from the Kupyan district in the Kharkiv region. His village was under occupation in the first days of a full-scale invasion. Mother and brother remained under the oppression of the occupiers. -We wrote mass reports to the east, but there was a command that all graduates had to serve a year on the western border,- says Maksym. According to the distribution, the young officer got to the Chernivtsi border detachment. After serving the mandatory minimum, Maksym applied to join the combat unit. He went to defend Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar. Before leaving, according to the well-known formula: -what you call a ship, so it will sail-, Maxim chose the nickname Lucky for himself. -I wanted to be lucky so that both the bullets passed and the KAB nearby did not fall,- adds the border guard with a smile. Pseudo did not disappoint. Lucky came out of Bahmut whole and unscathed. Then there was a rotation in Vovchansk. The enemy felt for weak points for assault actions. The positions of the border guards were shelled from barrel artillery and mortars. Frequent guests were sabotage and reconnaissance groups of the enemy. -In Vovchansk, he participated in defensive battles. Repulsed the attacks of the enemy who tried to penetrate the position. Their main task was to take prisoners. And we detected and destroyed them in time,- says Lucky. In the -Hart- brigade, Maksym defends his native Kharkiv region, continues to perform combat missions in the Vovchansk direction. It works at the forefront here. Organizes the service and directly participates in the conduct of defensive battles. The direction is familiar, and most importantly, native. -When my little Motherland was occupied, I was far away and powerless, now I was able to prevent this from happening again,- says the border guard. Maksym is convinced that his land must be defended with weapons in his hands. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Zaporizhzhia area, a mobile anti-aircraft fire group, which includes Oleksandr with the call sign -Kropa-, Artem with the call sign -Tourist- and Andriy with the call sign -Maly-, has been successfully performing the task of destroying enemy drones for over a year. During this time they destroyed about two dozen enemy UAVs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/hotilosya-buty-shhaslyvchykom-prykordonnyk-z-pozyvnym-laki-pro-boyi-za-vovchansk/	2025-02-26T10:32:06-08:00

National resistance: what is the role of resistance movement participants in the restoration of Ukra...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine spoke about the essence of the resistance movement, its importance in the liberation struggle, key functions and main risks for the participants The resistance movement is a form of resistance to the Russian occupation that combines effectiveness with almost complete invisibility to the enemy. Underground people operate according to the principles of a strict conspiracy, which allows them to successfully carry out their tasks despite the constant threat of exposure. -Ukrainians have been bravely resisting Russian aggression behind enemy lines for eleven years. Acting inconspicuously and under constant threat, they significantly help the Defense Forces to hit the enemy, destroy his logistics and liberate the occupied territories,- said Yuriy Yelenych, head of the national resistance policy department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. What is the resistance movement? The resistance movement is a system of military, information and special measures aimed at restoring state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is an important component of national resistance. The activity of the resistance movement is regulated by the legislative framework, in particular the Laws of Ukraine -On the Basics of National Resistance-, -On the Legal Regime of Martial Law-, as well as relevant government resolutions and orders of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. What is the importance of the resistance movement in the fight against the aggressor? The history of the Ukrainian resistance movement begins in 2014, when Russia occupied Crimea and part of Donbas. Even then, the patriots in the captured territories launched active underground activities, from organizing protest actions to gathering intelligence and conducting sabotage operations. Over the course of eight years, the resistance transformed into a powerful force that significantly made life difficult for the occupiers. Underground members disrupted pseudo-referendums, sabotaged the work of collaborators, and established effective interaction with the Ukrainian military. With the beginning of the large-scale invasion in 2022, the resistance movement became one of the important factors in the liberation of the territories of Kyiv Oblast, Sumy Oblast, Chernihiv Oblast, Kharkiv Oblast, and Kherson Oblast. From the first day, the underground operatives actively destroyed enemy equipment, carried out sabotage at important facilities and destroyed the logistics chains of the invaders. Today, the Ukrainian underground continues to operate in temporarily occupied territories. The state supports the resistance movement, but emphasizes the need for caution and coordinated cooperation. Who directs the movement of the resistance? The leadership of the movement of the resistance is carried out by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the commander of the Special Operations Forces. It is the SSO that is responsible for organizing and coordinating the activities of the underground network in the occupied territories. Information about the direct leadership of the resistance movement is protected by state secrecy. What tasks are assigned to the resistance movement? The main tasks of the resistance movement include the formation of a resistance network, conducting special operations and creating obstacles to the actions of the occupiers. An important function is to carry out informational and psychological operations and to carry out intelligence activities. The Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine organize the formation of resistance movement centers and ensure that they acquire the necessary capabilities. They also coordinate the participation of underground people in special operations and prepare Ukrainian citizens for activities in the resistance movement. Specific work methods are protected by state secrets. What methods does the resistance movement use? Guerrilla warfare has become one of the most effective tools of the resistance movement. The underground carries out systematic strikes on enemy communications, destroys military equipment and disrupts the supply chains of the occupying forces. Sabotage operations are aimed at destroying critical infrastructure for the enemy. Members of the resistance movement disable railway tracks, bridges, ammunition and fuel depots, which significantly limits the combat capability of the occupying forces. Informational resistance plays an equally important role. The underground collects and transmits intelligence on the movement of enemy troops, disseminates true information about the course of the war among the local population, and conducts psychological operations aimed at demoralizing the occupiers. What challenges does the resistance movement face? The activities of the resistance movement are associated with a constant risk to the lives of its members. The occupiers brutally persecute the underground, using torture, illegal imprisonment, and even execution of identified patriots of Ukraine. The necessity of a strict conspiracy requires members of the resistance movement to be extremely careful in their communication and movement. The slightest mistake can lead to the failure of the entire network, so the underground is forced to scrutinize their every move. Work in the conditions of occupation is greatly complicated by limited access to the necessary resources. Members of the resistance movement have to show considerable ingenuity to compensate for the lack of special equipment and materials for operations. We emphasize that participation in the resistance movement requires careful preparation and coordination of actions.

-Heavenly harvest-: SBU soldiers destroyed 1,676 enemy drones	The video was published on the SBU page. -The cost of each of these reconnaissance drones is more than 100 thousand. dollars However, we have developed an fpv aircraft with a cost of $700 and more, which effectively destroys such drones,- said the Head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, at the forum -Ukraine. 2025.- These words are not just statistics, but evidence of the effectiveness of Ukrainian developments. FPV drones created by Ukrainian engineers turned out to be hundreds of times cheaper and no less effective than enemy counterparts. The destruction of 1,676 drones is not only an impressive number, but also 1,676 times when the enemy failed to adjust artillery, transmit coordinates for missile strikes, and destroy our positions. These are 1,676 times when Ukrainian soldiers stopped death carried by Russian drones. As reported by ArmyInform, special forces from the 2nd separate detachment of the Omega CSP continue to demonstrate high the drone's level of skill, hinting that their sorties could well be the basis for a video game.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/nebesna-zhnyva-voyiny-sbu-znyshhyly-1676-vorozhyh-bezpilotnykiv/	2025-02-26T09:53:29-08:00

-We had to beat the enemy non-stop-: how -Gran- and his comrades defended Toretsk for 77 days	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -Gran- is an ordinary Ukrainian man who before the war was fond of fishing and football. He graduated from an agricultural university and worked by profession growing grain crops. However, when the time came, he did not shy away from service and stood up for the defense of his country. After training and adaptation, Oleg went on his first combat mission to Toretsk. -Gran- stayed in the positions for 77 days, where he demonstrated heroism and courage every day. -All this time, Valer's brother nicknamed -Livsha-, whom we met at the educational center, was next to me. Later, we -picked up- another soldier Oleksandr on the pseudo -Carp- with 150 OMBr, Oleg says, -We had to beat the enemy non-stop. Because if not you, then you.- The most difficult test was the loss of a brother who died in his arms. However, -Gran- continued to fight and fulfill its duty. Oleg also remembers how he had to provide medical aid to his comrades who were injured during shelling. -Some of the boys started festering from small fragments that got into their bodies during the shelling. He took a knife, sharpened the blade well, and there were hydrogen peroxide and dressing material in the first-aid kits. — In a word, I learned to deal with that misfortune — -patients- from neighboring positions were already in line -for an appointment- with me. After returning from a 77-day deployment, the first thing Gran did was call his family to let them know he was alive. And then&#8230; sat down on YouTube - until the very early morning I watched reviews of key football matches that I missed during these 77 days! When asked what helped him survive all the trials, -Gran- answers: -The first thing that helped was thoughts about the children - there was a great desire to endure everything, to return and hug them. And prayer saved. Even those who never knew even the -Our Father- suddenly -remembered- everything and began to pray very fervently. By Decree of the President of Ukraine No. 122/2025 of February 23, 2025, Junior Sergeant Oleh Volodymyrovych Grankivskyi was awarded the III degree -For Courage- Order.

-A tank 20 meters away is more invigorating than coffee-: a scout from Crimea told about two days of...	The story of the fighter was made public on page 32 of a separate mechanized brigade. -I went to intelligence on my own, voluntarily. At first, they did not want to take it, because they saw that it was already old. But he insisted. I will still give a head start to many young people,- says Igor. According to him, during the last mission, a group of six scouts went out to clear the enemy position. -There were six of us. They left at 5 in the morning. They moved covertly through thickets. In the night vision device, I noticed enemy infantrymen moving along the landing. We opened fire. Worked out. And nearby there were already trenches that had to be cleared. What did my trio do. The second was closing,- the scout recalls. According to him, clearing the trenches happens like this: first you throw a grenade, then you shoot the exit from the dugout and the passages, and in this way you advance along the trench. -When the position was completely ours again, we concentrated at certain points and observed each of our own perimeters. We fought off enemy counterattacks for two days, until we were replaced by infantry. This is how we work in intelligence,- Igor says. According to him, the strongest impression on him during the war was made by a tank that was coming at them 20 meters away. -When a tank is coming at you 20 meters away, it's more invigorating than coffee,- he says. Igor emphasized that the issue of protecting and liberating his native land from the occupiers is a matter of principle for him, which is why he volunteered for intelligence. As reported by ArmyInform, war changes people, but there are those who return to it again and again. Platoon Sergeant Dmytro from the 32nd Separate Mechanized Brigade joined the army for the third time. Completed his military service, fought in 2014, and since March 2022 has been holding back a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/tank-za-20-metriv-badoryt-krashhe-za-kavu-rozvidnyk-z-krymu-rozpoviv-pro-dva-dni-vidbyttya-vorozhyh-kontratak/	2025-02-26T08:47:11-08:00
-Zero-: how two Ukrainian soldiers survived the death sentence and escaped from Russian captivity	The story of the fighters was made public in a video on the brigade's page. The task of the Ukrainian military was clear: to strengthen the dugout after shelling and hand it over to the next group. They reached their destination, but instead of the expected support from their side, they saw dead Russian soldiers. When they came closer, the soldiers found themselves in a trap: two invaders suddenly rose from under the bodies of the Russians with machine guns. After a short conversation, the occupiers transmitted information about the prisoners to the headquarters. The answer came instantly: -Zero!-. At that moment, the Ukrainians realized that there was no time. The captives were tied up and prepared for execution, but one of them, Svyatoslav, quickly got his bearings and told the occupiers that they had a radio station through which they could contact the headquarters. This made the Russians pause. They took a pause, then changed the decision: instead of immediate execution, the prisoners were ordered to be taken to another point. On the way along the power line, the Ukrainians were led under surveillance, warning that any attempt to escape would end in death. But Svyatoslav, whose hands were tied with a tie, was able to break it and helped the two brothers to free themselves. Now their only hope was coordination with Ukrainian troops. Thanks to radio communication, the soldiers were able to contact the command and request artillery support. The Ukrainian military opened fire on the positions of the occupiers, creating chaos in their ranks. This gave the captives a chance to break free and run across the field. In addition to artillery, drones also intervened - drone operators guided our fighters, giving them landmarks on a safe route. When the Ukrainian soldiers heard on the radio: -A box is coming for you!-, they understood that their return home was assured. -I realized for the first time how important communication is. This piece of plastic, the walkie-talkie, saved our lives. Without her, we would just be shot,- says one of the fighters. This story ended happily, but such cases are an exception. The Ukrainian military urges: do not lose vigilance, do not give the enemy a chance and remember - communication, coordination and instant decisions can be the key to survival. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 46th Airborne Assault Brigade Army forces captured a Russian attack aircraft, who said that he had no choice: to go to war or not.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/obnulyajte-yak-dvoye-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-perezhyly-vyrok-smerti-ta-vtekly-z-rosijskogo-polonu/	2025-02-26T08:33:27-08:00

The video of combat work was published on the channel of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Fighters of the 8th regiment of the SSO worked in the Kurakhiv direction, performing tasks of reconnaissance and countering the enemy. They were monitoring the area, the UAV, when the situation changed dramatically. The enemy intensified attacks, began to use kamikaze drones and guided aerial bombs. One of these attacks on the positions of the Ukrainian military was an enemy aerial bomb of the KAB. As a result of the explosion, the building in which the marines were located collapsed, turning into a pile of debris. All fighters who were in the shelter received severe contusions, and one serviceman was wounded. Despite the constant threat of repeated strikes, a group of SSO fighters immediately went to the rescue. Arriving at the scene, they found that the marines were in a critical condition: disoriented, contused, and the wounded needed immediate help. The group commander, callsign -Ghost-, contacted his trapped comrades through the vent, assessing their condition. The task was complicated by the fact that the evacuation process was under constant surveillance by enemy drones. Another blow could come at any moment. SSO fighters cleared the debris to get the wounded man. Due to the considerable weight of the fighter, caused by a full set of combat equipment, it was necessary to improvise: a path was made of boards and debris to quickly pull him out. The wounded man was promptly taken to a safer place, and later evacuated to a medical center. During this rescue operation, every second could become fatal. The military acted in a clear and coordinated manner, aware of the threat of repeated attacks. Despite the danger, the mission was successfully completed - all marines were evacuated, and the wounded man received the necessary medical attention. According to -Ghost-, in difficult situations, the military should not be divided by the type of troops - fraternity and mutual support on the battlefield is the highest priority. He is sure that at a critical moment any unit of the Defense Forces of Ukraine will come to the rescue. In addition to the military, another -fighter- was rescued during this mission - a small puppy that was left among the ruins. It was named -Kabik- - in honor of the guided aerial bomb that almost took the lives of Ukrainian defenders, but in the end became an occasion to discover the true fighting brotherhood. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the 3rd Regiment of the Special Operations Forces destroyed approximately a platoon of Russian military during a raid on an industrial complex in the Donetsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/kab-rozirvav-budivlyu-ale-ne-braterstvo-yak-bijczi-sso-vyrvaly-morskyh-pihotyncziv-z-lap-smerti/	2025-02-26T08:27:22-08:00
A simplified algorithm for returning from the SZH until March 1: the Ministry of Defense reminds you...	About informs Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Only in the last week, about 300 reports for return to service passed through Army+. The journey from in-app report creation to in-service renewal to in-service renewal takes less than a week. -Thanks to Army+, we reduced the time to return to service to a few days without the need for extra contacts or personal reporting. With your smartphone services, we give you the opportunity not only to renew, but also to take control of your service and find a place where you can bring maximum benefit,- says Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. Military personnel who completed the SZH before November 29 can return to service until March 1, 2025, according to a simplified algorithm, and renew their service within three days. To do this, the following steps should be taken: After March 1, you can also return to service, but not according to this simplified algorithm through Army+. In this case, it may take several months to restore the service. And until this moment, the financial security and other guarantees are not returned. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published step-by-step instructions for the return of servicemen after the voluntary abandonment of a unit (SZCh).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/sproshhenyj-algorytm-povernennya-z-szch-do-1-bereznya-minoborony-nagaduye-yak-cze-zrobyty/	2025-02-26T08:19:24-08:00
Ukraine uses FPV drones to destroy Shaheds and is preparing to export drones	Colonel Vadim Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about this in an interview with LIGA.net a -chess game- with the enemy, constantly improving their technologies and tactics. According to Vadym Sukharevskyi, attacks on Russian military infrastructure are not random or chaotic. They are carefully planned and calculated taking into account intelligence and technical capabilities. -What we see in the news about the next fires on the territory of the Russian Federation is the result of serious planning and mathematical calculations. Hundreds of experienced officers, as well as civilians and international specialists, are working on it,- Vadym Sukharevskyi emphasized. War forces both sides to improve their tactics and technology. Ukraine quickly adapts to new challenges. For example, when Russia began to use -shahedis- on a massive scale, the Armed Forces quickly created thousands of mobile fire groups, which showed high efficiency. However, the enemy adapts: it changes tactics, flight altitudes and routes. -We responded by starting to shoot down &#8220;martyrs&#8221; FPV drones. And it already gives real results. This is a constant technological pursuit,- he added. Ukraine's military experience in using unmanned technologies is invaluable to allies. The heads of the US and European defense ministries have already expressed interest in Ukrainian developments. But is Ukraine ready for their export? -I think so. But you need to have a state and economic approach. We don't have to give away our best products for free, but we can competently approach exports,- explained Vadym Sukharevskyi. He suggests using a system similar to NATO's approach, where there are three categories of military products: 1. Products for non-allies - limited options. 2. Products for allies - access to 70% of the functionality. 3. Products for internal use - full access. As reported by ArmyInform, in the six months since the creation of the Unmanned Systems Forces, more than 220 operations have been carried out with deep damage on the territory the aggressor state — both independently and in cooperation with other components of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/ukrayina-vykorystovuye-fpv-drony-dlya-znyshhennya-shahediv-ta-gotuyetsya-do-eksportu-bezpilotnykiv/	2025-02-26T08:09:46-08:00

Oleksandr Syrskyi and Anthony Radakin discussed the situation at the front and Ukrainian-British coo...	This is stated in a message on Facebook page of the Commander-in-Chief. -He personally thanked the admiral, and also conveyed his words of deep gratitude to the government and the entire British people for consistent support of our country in the struggle for independence and military assistance to the Defense Forces of Ukraine,- said Oleksandr Syrskyi. He noted the recently announced package of military aid to Ukraine in the amount of 150 million pounds, which included air defense systems, armored vehicles and artillery systems. -He shared an assessment of the situation in the areas of hostilities, as well as ways to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of the use of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He discussed the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in terms of weapons, military equipment, ammunition, material resources, as well as personnel training,- said Oleksandr Syrskyi. Oleksandr Syrskyi and Anthony Radakin jointly assessed the possibilities of developing Ukrainian-British military cooperation for the protection of Ukraine and strengthening the security of Europe. &#8220;I received confirmation from the Chief of the Defense Staff of the United Kingdom that the British side is ready to continue supporting the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Admiral Sir Anthony Radakin once again assured me of the readiness of the United Kingdom to provide military assistance to the Defense Forces of Ukraine. In this difficult time, loyal partners and allies remain with us in the struggle for the freedom and independence of Ukraine, including Great Britain,- concluded Oleksandr Syrskyi.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/oleksandr-syrskyj-ta-entoni-radakin-obgovoryly-sytuacziyu-na-fronti-ta-ukrai%cc%88nsko-brytanske-spivrobitnycztvo/	2025-02-26T02:13:43-08:00
No secrets: military engineers shared an analysis of the guts of the downed Russian UAV SuperCam	It should be noted right away that the equipment of the spy drone, which was -under autopsy-, did not impress Ukrainian specialists in the field of flying unmanned systems with any unique innovations. Ukrainian soldiers have repeatedly shot down similar enemy aerial scouts in different areas of the front, as our editorial office reported. As for the studied example of -enemy electronic eyes in the sky-, among the optional -suspensions- with which the enemy equipped this UAV were two cameras with different extensions. One is very simple, like primitive FPV drones. The other is more complicated. And as the research engineer noted in a comment during the analysis of that device, this optical device, although it came into his hands somewhat damaged, interested him and was quite suitable for further study. As for the electronic components, inside the -SuperKam- body, according to the Ukrainian researcher, the Russian assemblers placed a computing unit, which was connected by a separate wire loop to the common board. In addition, a video signal transmission unit was installed there via radio channels. The built-in standard antenna was responsible for communication with the base station. Also, the circuit of the electronic equipment of the enemy air spy was supplemented with a video transmitter module, to which a connector for data exchange was connected. Another conclusion from the research published by our military specialists can be the fact that all the component blocks of the downed UAV were marked with stickers with inscriptions in Russian. However, as repeatedly researchers of enemy electronic devices told, the enterprises of terrorist countries were never able to fully establish the production of high-tech components, such as the same chips, and try their best to purchase them through -gray- schemes both in Asian countries and through intermediaries from well-known Western manufacturers. It should be recalled that the manufacturer of SuperCam drones is the Russian company -Unmanned Systems- from Izhevsk. Specialists of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine identified four subspecies from the family of these reconnaissance drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/bez-sekretiv-vijskovi-inzhenery-podilylysya-analizom-nutroshhiv-zbytogo-rosijskogo-bpla-supercam/	2025-02-26T02:12:59-08:00
Three people were detained who, on the order of the Russian Federation, adjusted missile strikes in ...	This was informed in the SBU. According to the results of the special operation, three Russian agents were detained, who were preparing coordinates for fire damage to Ukrainian objects. The enemy's priority targets were military airfields, reserve command posts and training centers of Ukrainian defenders, as well as factories for repairing armored vehicles and UAVs. To carry out the enemy's task, the FSB remotely recruited local unemployed people aged 23, 34 and 40 who were looking for -quick earnings- on Telegram channels. All of them were spread over three regions of Ukraine, but had a common Russian curator - a staff member of the FSB's Black Sea Fleet. Cyber ​​specialists of the SBU have already established his identity. Thus, one of the agents was -seconded- to Lviv by a Russian special service agent. To gather intelligence, the traitor got a job as a freight forwarder at a local construction company that performed contracts for military units. Another figure is a resident of Kyiv region, who traveled around the region, where he tried to identify the main and operational airfields with combat aircraft of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Another traitor is a resident of Kharkiv, who monitored the places of the largest concentration of personnel and military equipment of the Defense Forces in the front-line city. He also -darkly- asked his acquaintances about local enterprises that restore the combat characteristics of Ukrainian military equipment. All three agents were promptly exposed by security services, documented their crimes, and caught red-handed while each was conducting reconnaissance near potential targets. Mobile phones with anonymous chats in the messenger, which they used to communicate with the FSB, were seized from the detainees. The SBU investigators informed them about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrators are in custody. They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/zatrymaly-troh-osib-yaki-na-zamovlennya-rf-koryguvaly-raketni-udary-po-regionah-ukrai%cc%88ny/	2025-02-26T02:03:07-08:00
Rustem Umerov: We have not come to terms with the occupation. We are fighting on the front lines, in...	The statement published on the minister's Facebook page. Rustem Umyerov recalled that 11 years ago, on February 26, 2014, Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians in Simferopol held a large-scale rally in support of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. On these dates, 11 years ago, Russia began aggression, a war against Ukraine — with the temporary occupation of Crimea. -The Kremlin challenged not only Ukraine, but also the whole world, turning Crimea into a military base and endangering the security of the entire Black Sea. But our resistance also began 11 years ago. Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars were the first to defend their land, initially through non-violent resistance,- he said. The minister emphasized that all these 11 years the Kremlin has been persecuting and throwing behind bars everyone who does not agree with the occupation - Crimean Tatars, Ukrainian activists, journalists. As a result, today 221 citizens of Ukraine, political prisoners, are illegally detained in Russian prisons. 134 of them are Crimean Tatars. Political prisoners of Crimea are tortured, tried on fabricated cases and kept in terrible conditions. But neither repressions nor prisons could break their will — they remain symbols of Crimea's indomitability. -We have not come to terms with the occupation. We are fighting on the front lines, in the rear and in Crimea itself. Ukraine remembers each of its citizens who remained on the peninsula, and is doing everything possible to liberate them from the new -prison of nations,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine added that the only language the aggressor understands is the language of force. Ukraine has changed the balance of power in the Black Sea: our long-range missiles and naval drones destroy the military potential of the occupiers in Crimea every day, and dozens of enemy ships are already lying on the bottom, including the flagship cruiser -Moskva-. -Crimea, my home, is Ukraine! We will return him home,- said Rustem Umyerov.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/rustem-umyerov-my-ne-zmyrylysya-z-okupacziyeyu-my-boremosya-na-peredovij-u-tylu-ta-v-samomu-krymu/	2025-02-26T01:49:33-08:00

The Day of Resistance in our Crimea is a day of respect for honesty, for Ukraine: the President	The text of the appeal was published on February 26. -Today is the day of courage and honesty of all those who did not close their eyes to Russia's occupation of our Crimea. These days, 11 years ago, the Russian aggression against Ukraine began - precisely with the illegal, vile seizure of Crimea. But the day of February 26 showed that there will be opposition — opposition to Crimea, opposition to all of Ukraine. This day showed that there are and will be people who will not accept lies and will not surrender their home. The following years after the occupation of Crimea brought a lot of grief and cynicism. Many people in the world did not want to understand what was really happening,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote. According to him, Ukraine managed to return the issue of the liberation of Crimea to the world agenda. -We founded the Crimean platform. We do not give Russia the opportunity to -normalize- the occupation. We are freeing Crimean prisoners. We continue the struggle for the right to a normal life and guarantees of security and stable peace for all of Ukraine. Territorial integrity, sovereignty and security of Ukraine are not and will not be the subject of any compromises. The Day of Resistance in our Crimea is a day of respect for honesty, for Ukraine. And I thank everyone who supports!- - said the President.

Why it is profitable to create a joint European force: an expert's comment	This opinion was expressed by a lawyer, a military officer of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko, answering the question of the ArmiyaInform correspondent about what positions Ukraine is currently in in the negotiation processes and what role is assigned to European partners in security issues. -As far as our negotiating positions are concerned, Ukraine's position is clear, understandable and well-founded, as emphasized by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the President of Ukraine. It consists in the fact that we need peace through force and that Putin can only be forced to do something by force. Voluntarily, there will be no agreements - only through force, and this is exactly what our Defense and Security Forces are proving on the battlefield, destroying Russian troops,- says Oleksandr Musienko. The second component of power that can bring about peace is security guarantees. -When Putin will understand that Ukraine is so strong that Russian troops have no chance to attack, then he will stop his aggressive actions.- Commenting on the role of Europe and the West on the current geopolitical map of the world, Musienko recalls the -very correct initiative- of the President of Ukraine to create a united army of Europe. -That idea, which was communicated in one way or another in European countries, but was not implemented, is now coming to life with new colors. Because Europe is actually in such a state of shock that the United States may reduce its military presence or withdraw from Europe altogether. And this means that, in fact, as of today, Europeans have a choice: either learn the Russian language (as the Secretary General of NATO said, because Russia will certainly take advantage of a weak developed Europe), or unite around Ukraine, creating a powerful united force of Europe. That's it for today's selection. And that's why Ukraine offers it,- says Oleksandr Musienko. He added that Europe is important in that it has financial and defense-industrial potential, etc. -And that's why she is able to actually mobilize. But for us here now, the fact that they realize this is fundamentally important. Because, in principle, by jointly creating the Joint Forces of Europe, we can actually become a powerful entity. Ukraine is already a subject, and Europe together can become one,- the interlocutor emphasized. Oleksandr Musienko emphasized that Europe, by investing more in the defense-industrial complex, can invest in the defense of Ukraine. -We can invest in the defense-industrial complex of Ukraine, jointly produce missiles, drones, jointly produce what we need for our common security. Thus, Europe will become a serious subject with which the whole world will be reckoned. Europeans, in principle, have this resource. This is what Ukraine is now calling for,- Oleksandr Musienko summarized. As ArmyInform wrote, recently President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the military contingent in Ukraine can become the first platform for the creation of the future armed forces of Europe, which are in the sky, on water and on land, with the help of drones and artificial intelligence, will be able to respond in the event of an attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/chomu-vygidno-stvoryuvaty-obyednani-syly-yevropy-komentar-eksperta/	2025-02-25T20:56:21-08:00
Cheap, effective and effective: Israeli gunsmiths presented a portable system to counter kamikaze dr...	According to the experts of the defense portal Breaking Defense, based on the statements of the authors of the product, the complex is designed to protect against threats posed by drones and can be used both on the ground and on various platforms, including manned and unmanned ground or sea-based vehicles, ArmyInform reports. At the heart of SMASH DOME's kinetic response is the SMASH Hopper, a lightweight remotely controlled fire station (LRCWS) equipped with an assault rifle and a ballistically calculated fire control system (FCS). Designed for high-precision engagement of unmanned aerial vehicles, regardless of their communication channels or models, the SMASH Hopper can be integrated with a command and control (C2) system for automatic detection and tracking of UAV targets. It provides operators with calculated ballistic solutions in real time and can use different types of weapons and munitions to kinetically intercept various UAV threats. SMASH Hopper can integrate with control systems such as ATAK to automatically detect, track and calculate trajectories. Complementing the SMASH Hopper, the SMASH DOME includes both active RF radar and passive optical surveillance systems to classify and track UAS targets. With a detection range of up to 1-2 km (depending on sensor type), these devices continuously transmit target data to SMARTSHOOTER's proprietary tracking system, providing real-time monitoring and readiness to intercept. SMASH DOME is intended for deployment on manned and unmanned vehicles and platforms, as well as for ground use along borders and at strategic sites. Michal Mohr, CEO of SMARTSHOOTER, said that the SMASH DOME, based on SMASH technology, offers a cost-effective and accurate solution to the growing threat of enemy drones disrupting critical areas and putting them at risk. -SMASH DOME's deep integration with existing command and control (C2) systems makes it a versatile asset that serves as both an autonomous defense system and an important 'insurance policy' for passive C-UAS solutions,- the entrepreneur added. -Minimizing the use of munitions and providing effective interception of both small UAVs and large drones, SMASH DOME exemplifies SMARTSHOOTER's commitment to protecting forces and critical infrastructure from emerging threats from the air,- MARTSHOOTER said. One of the advantages of Smash Dome, according to the developer, is the possibility of -manual control- of the complex. Through the fire control interface, operators can visually confirm targets and initiate intercepts with a simple command. According to the creators of this weapon, this approach minimizes collateral damage and increases the overall effectiveness of operations, especially in densely populated areas. What will be the cost of the new complex has not yet been announced. Meanwhile, the developer claims that this tool is one of the most advanced in terms of price-performance.

-How to drive to Klishchiivka-, or -Lick it up, Moskalyka, you've already arrived-: incredible stori...	Why did they come up with a motor on his FH-70 gun? But is it possible to destroy the enemy 2C7 -Peony- with a direct hit? The gunner told our correspondent about it. -I'm from Zhytomyr. I first entered the army in 2018. It was a training session: the training of a reserve tank brigade. That's where I actually started learning how to use artillery. And on February 25, 2022, I called the TCC and found out if there were vacancies in the 26th artillery brigade. They said there was. And in the evening I was already there. We are currently working on the FH-70. These are -trailers-, but they are motorized (155-mm towed self-propelled howitzer - ed.). I am the fire platoon leader. The FH-70 is a gun that was developed in the late 1960s and adopted for service in the 1970s by three countries: Great Britain, Germany and Italy. Its barrel is English, the breech part is German, the engine in this gun, so that it can drive itself into the firing position, is from Volkswagen. It is in service in many countries. Overall, the gun is pretty good. And the idea for the motor is this: so that it can move independently, at a low speed of up to 15-20 kilometers per hour. It's quite convenient. That is, he left, hitched to a tractor and drove on four wheels. It's the same way back: I unhooked it, she drove in by herself, spun around on the hood, got up as she should. And that's it. This is great. If our gun was still new, it would be possible to hit the target continuously from the second or third shot. And sometimes that's how it works for us. It also depends on the ammunition. Therefore, it is now possible to hit the target with about five or six shots. Currently, one of our tasks is counter-battery fighting. That is, when repelling an assault, we shoot at either enemy mortars or cannons. And earlier we worked on both equipment and tanks. But we have not seen this technique from the enemy for several months. As an exception, yesterday we fired at the enemy's RBU-6000 system when it moved to a position to open fire. This is a home-made marine-type MLRS. We missed a bit. If there had been a shot three seconds later, maybe, they would have been hit. There was literally a gap in front of her. But the main target for us right now is the infantry. There was more than one time when we hit and destroyed a landing party after knocking out BMD or BMP. First of all, it should be said that the team with which we cooperate gives us goals. It depends on the brigade, on its management style, who will adjust the fire: either us or them. As a rule, we help repulse assaults even at distant approaches, when personnel are accumulating and they are already starting to advance for an assault. As a rule, we see streams where our work is visible. And after each shooting, we conduct an analysis: how was the shooting, what was the shooting and how to improve it in the future? Maybe you need to change the detonator or something else. Each case has its own nuances that need to be taken into account. The -fattest- target we had was the 2S7 -Peony-. Direct hit. It was in the Bakhmut district. At that time, we did not work for infantry brigades, our brigade gave us targets. The only thing is that during that hit there was no detonation of the BC, because it (-Pion- - ed.) was probably empty. It was the year 2023. Also in the 23rd year, we started working with the 93rd brigade. We supported them when they repelled enemy assaults. According to Klishchiivka, it was. We still scared the enemy with tapes on the distant approaches, or we hit the assault groups directly. There were three to five to seven people in each. On the landings, they went to the dam, piled up there and then stormed. And somehow two such groups gathered in the landing. And I have already played two cassettes on them. And I was so lucky that I then hit this cluster with the tape. At least 10 Muscovites were there. But then two of them got up and ran away. I remember one more case. In the summer of last year, I was on duty, and we chased an enemy turtle tank (an informal name for Russian tanks with massive improvised superstructures - ed.) in the Klishchiivka area. We didn't hit then. But we chased him for about an hour at a time. Then something strange happened. I saw that the FPV drone hit that tank. But he drove on. Then he stopped near our M-113. Muscovites don't have one. I followed her, and another tank followed them, so I realized that it was ours. Because it was already on the channel. I didn't follow it further because there were no streams. And in the morning, I read on the Internet that the 22nd brigade captured an enemy tank in that place and captured the crew. It's a good thing I didn't hit that tank then. And his crew, by the way, stopped by our M-113 to ask how to get to Klishchiivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/26/yak-proyihaty-na-klishhiyivku-abo-vylizaj-moskalyku-ty-vzhe-pryyihav-nejmovirni-istoriyi-vid-artylerysta-26-yi-brygady/	2025-02-25T20:08:25-08:00
-The shaman who sang in the wrong place-: the SBU in absentia handed suspicion to the Kremlin singer...	The SBU informs about this. According to the case materials, this performer with a light heart and a heavy repertoire long ago turned into a media weapon of the aggressor country. He systematically participates in activities that support the Putin regime and occupation forces, and also openly justifies the Russian Federation's full-scale war against Ukraine. Among the most famous -hits- of the propagandist is a video message recorded in 2022, in which he glorifies the Russian invaders and calls for support for their aggression. And already in February 2023, Dronov toured the temporarily occupied territory of the left-bank Kherson region, performing his compositions at the request of Kremlin curators. A linguistic examination initiated by the Security Service of Ukraine confirmed that Shaman is not just a singer, but a full-fledged element of Russian information and subversive activities. Taking into account the collected evidence, the investigators informed him in absentia about the suspicion under part. 3 Art. 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — denial of temporary occupation, justification of armed aggression and glorification of the Russian military, carried out repeatedly and with the use of mass media. The official status of a suspect in crimes against national security is, perhaps, the most serious -reward- in Dronov's career, which he will definitely not be able to receive personally. Currently, comprehensive measures are underway to bring him to justice, and the investigation is being conducted under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office. It is obvious that -Shaman- miscalculated with the repertoire, because even the most fervently performed odes to the Kremlin regime are not exempt from responsibility. Now he will have to face the consequences of his -creativity-, even if in absentia. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian actor Dmytro Pevtsov, known for his role in the series -Banditsky Petersburg-, has now played the main role in a new production - Ukrainian court verdict. The Security Service of Ukraine gathered enough evidence for Pevtsov to receive 10 years in prison in absentia for war propaganda and calls for the seizure of Ukrainian territories.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/shaman-yakyj-zaspivav-ne-tudy-sbu-zaochno-vruchyla-pidozru-kremlivskomu-spivaku-propagandystu/	2025-02-25T11:53:16-08:00

15 years for treason: an FSB agent received a fair punishment in Donetsk region	informs the SBU about this. In January 2024, the woman was arrested, and now the court sentenced her to 15 years in prison with confiscation of property. The investigation established that the FSB agent transmitted to the enemy the geolocation of fortified areas, checkpoints and artillery positions of the Ukrainian troops on the hottest direction of the front — Pokrovsky. To collect information, the traitor traveled hundreds of kilometers by taxi in the districts of Kurakhovo, Mirnograd, Novogrodivka, Selidovo, and Mykhailivka, where she secretly recorded the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and transmitted their coordinates to her Russian curator via messenger. The identity of this curator has already been established by the SBU. It is documented how the woman sent agency -reports- in the form of marks on electronic maps with the names of objects. During the search of the residence of the FSB agent, a mobile phone with an anonymous chat, which she used to communicate with the enemy, was seized. The investigation revealed that the woman came into the view of the occupiers in the fall of 2023, when she published anti-Ukrainian comments on Telegram channels. After one of these -posts-, she was contacted by an FSB staff member in a messenger and offered cooperation in exchange for -privileges-, which he promised her in the event of the capture of the region. The court found the agent guilty of h. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The investigation was conducted by SBU employees in Donetsk and Luhansk regions under the procedural guidance of the Donetsk regional prosecutor's office. As reported by ArmyInform, in Zakarpattia, a man who agreed to set fire to military and volunteer cars for money was sentenced to 5 years in prison will.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/15-rokiv-za-zradu-na-donechchyni-agentka-fsb-otrymala-spravedlyve-pokarannya/	2025-02-25T10:58:20-08:00

The fighter with the call sign -Jimmy- says: -I was a monolith. Worked with marble and granite. But in 2023, everything changed. At first I was a drone operator, then I went through training, and now I have been commanding the department for several months now.- Vampire is not just a kamikaze drone. It can strike enemy warehouses, equipment, and personnel, as well as transport cargo. According to -Jimmy-, drone operators play a key role in supporting the infantry: -The area was mined tonight, the enemy left - and three -three hundred- at once. It saved our boys. We not only destroy the occupiers, but also protect our infantry.- Controlling a drone is one thing, but bringing it to the target in the conditions of Russian electronic warfare systems is quite another. -The worst thing is to lose the board because of the mufflers. But if everything goes according to plan, there is job satisfaction. When you hit it exactly, you know that minus the enemy, and they won't come to us anymore,- adds the fighter. Life at the front is constant tension. -Getting used to war is difficult. When they shoot, when they fly - it is not the case that you are completely calm. This is war. But over time, you already understand your task, what they want from you, and you just work,- says -Jimi-. Family support is also important. -It's good that there are phones, you can call directly from the dugout.

The Verkhovna Rada adopted a number of laws for the military	This is in a message on the page of the Parliament of Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada adopted as a basis and as a whole the project Law No. 12333 on the release of persons who were in places of detention as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine from paying an administrative fee for issuing a citizen's passport of Ukraine. The law is aimed at protecting the rights of both military servicemen and civilians who returned after captivity to the territory controlled by Ukraine. It is important that the state not only grants the right to obtain a passport of a citizen of Ukraine free of charge, but also ensures its quick receipt — no later than three working days from the date of filing the application form. The Verkhovna Rada also adopted Law No. 10160 on the provision of rehabilitation services to military personnel in special educational institutions. -It allows special institutions of general secondary education to provide rehabilitation services to persons with special educational needs and other persons with visual and/or hearing impairments, in particular from among military personnel, persons released from military service, war veterans, persons who have special merits to the Motherland,- the message reads. The law is aimed at providing access for a wider range of persons to such services on the basis of special institutions of general secondary education and further implementation of international standards in the field of protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. In addition, the Verkhovna Rada adopted Law No.12378 on the issue of sending units of the Armed Forces to other states, taking into account the proposals of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi. It provides that during the period of martial law, the union, military units and units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine may be sent to other states to ensure national security, repel and deter armed aggression, protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as exercise the right to self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. In addition, as Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced, the Cabinet of Ministers extended until March 31 the postponement of reserved employees. -In this way, businesses will have time to confirm critical status according to the updated criteria, as well as to rebook their staff,- he said.

Her Heart Beats to the Rhythm of War: The Story of a Combat Medic Who Combines a White Coat with a P...	The story of the defender was made public on page 101 of the separate security brigade of the State Military Academy named after Colonel-General Gennady Vorobyov. -I saw an announcement about vacancies in our brigade and my heart told me to act immediately,- says Anna. At first, she hid her decision from her parents and confessed to them only on the eve of leaving for the training center, where she was the only girl among all the recruits. Relatives, of course, were worried, but later understood and supported her choice. Anna is from Zhytomyr Oblast and graduated from the military lyceum in Pereyaslav. -In her heart, she was a -warrior of good- from childhood and wanted to save this world, help people,- the girl shares. Her vacillation between the medic's white coat and the pixel uniform of the military combined harmoniously in the position of a combat medic. In February 2022, when the full-scale invasion began, Anna and her family found themselves under occupation in Chernihiv Oblast. Their shelter was a strong basement built by their grandfather, a World War II veteran. -Our saviors turned out to be the soldiers of the 72nd Brigade, who were defending the neighborhood,- Anna recalls. It was they who helped them survive and provided them with the necessary medicine. Having survived the difficult period of occupation and received burns on her body, Anna became even stronger in her desire to help people. Because of her small leg size, she received the nickname -Princess-, which later changed to -Mouse- - that's how her mother gently called her. With the beginning of the enemy's offensive on Kharkiv Oblast, real medical practice in extreme conditions began for Anna. -Constant assaults and shelling. I had to work around the clock, sometimes without sleep for several days,- says -Myshka-. She had to help wounded soldiers, tamponize wounds, apply bandages and maintain their fighting spirit. The hardest thing for Anna is the realization of the loss of her siblings. -It's impossible to get used to,- she admits. However, even in the most difficult situations, -Mouse- does not lose optimism and finds the strength to help others. Even in short moments of rest, Anna finds time for creativity and cooking. Her culinary masterpieces at the positions are always popular among her peers. And she also has a good heart for animals - once, together with her siblings, she saved a kitten whose mother blew herself up on me. Once, returning from the shower, Anna came under fire. Despite the danger, she did not hesitate to run to her brothers to provide them with medical help. -I didn't think about my own life at all. I was only afraid that I wouldn't have time to save my siblings,- the girl admits. Anna does not part with her first aid kit even during vacations. Once she witnessed an accident and provided first aid to the injured driver. Anna met her love in her brigade. Her future husband noticed a picture she was drawing - a pixelated cat with a machine gun and wings. The loved one made the proposal at the landfill, presenting a grenade ring instead of an engagement ring. Today, -Mouse- serves in another unit, but continues to support his previous one by organizing volunteer assistance. -I don't care what the enemy IPSO says. I saw how our lions fight bravely and I have no doubt that they will overcome the enemy,- Anna is convinced. She dreams of the day of victory, when she can gather with her brothers in her favorite restaurant and celebrate this long-awaited day. While the struggle for Ukraine continues, Myshka remains true to its principles and continues to contribute to the common victory. As ArmiyaInform reported, there is no room for error at Ukrainian airfields. Every cog, every check, every movement matters, because the cost of any mistake can be the pilot's life. For Valery, an aviation technician of the tactical aviation brigade, this truth is not just a professional rule, it is a personal challenge.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/yiyi-sercze-byetsya-v-rytmi-vijny-istoriya-bojovoyi-medykyni-yaka-poyednala-bilyj-halat-iz-pikselnoyu-formoyu/	2025-02-25T09:48:14-08:00

The filigree work of the UAV operators in the video selection from the brigade speaks for itself: The filigree work of UAV operators in the video sample from the brigade speaks for itself: Escape to nowhere. Several occupiers decided to hide in a drainage pipe, but our drones proved that utility lines are not bomb shelters. A good hit - and the pipe together with its -inhabitants- turns into a sad memory. Boomerang for operators. Enemy drone operators chose to operate stealthily from their positions, but our scouts proved that there are professionals working in the sky. After a series of targeted strikes, their equipment was scrapped, and the Rashists themselves another entry on the casualty list. Basement minus one. Russian infantry tried to set up a shelter in the basement after crossing the Oskil. But she did not take into account one nuance - Ukrainian drones do not forgive. The building, along with its unexpected guests, disappeared from the map. Fiery salute for the tank. Our fighters with special -warmth- greeted the enemy tank with 20-kilogram ammunition. The result is smoke, flames and another metal monument to the Russian invasion.

A taxi driver from Donetsk region went to court for transporting evaders	This was reported on February 25 by the prosecutor's office of the Donetsk region. In September 2024, a taxi driver from Slovyansk organized a criminal scheme to transport men of military age to EU countries. During a conversation with an acquaintance of the city, the accused promised to take him to Vinnytsia, and from there acquaintances of the organizer would take him to a settlement near the border with Moldova. After paying $5,000, the so-called evader had to force the river. After some time, the businessman adjusted the scheme, foreseeing the delivery of the man to Odessa, and from there to Moldova. At the same time, the latter had to pay already $15,500. On October 30, the organizer received $17,700, including the fee for the petitioner's transportation across Ukraine and the purchase of fuel. On the same day, he was detained by law enforcement officers. Prosecutors of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office sent the indictment to the court on the fact of illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine (Part 3 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

We all, men and women alike, have an equal duty to defend our country. But I have tremendous respect for the choice of those who chose to serve for the sake of victory,- she says. Each evacuation trip is a meeting with the wounded, with his pain, fears and memories. -The hardest thing for me mentally is the road to the hospital. You go with a fighter, you have to talk to him, maintain his level of consciousness. He tells you stories that sometimes break your heart. But then&#8230; you forget them. Not names are feelings. Because if I memorized everything, I wouldn't be able to stand it,- admits Nastya. She heard different things: about seven children waiting for their father at home, about dreams that were cut short by the war, about the fear of not living until tomorrow. And each story leaves a scar on her heart. -Some part of you just dies with each such story. But you have no right to stop,- she says. The girl gave her youth to the war, but does not regret it. -For me, the words 'to victory' are not just a phrase. This is a question for myself: will I be able to see the result? I'm ready to work as long as it takes,- Nastya firmly declares. She does not seek fame, does not expect thanks. Just doing her job, the one she chose on purpose.

It includes the Defense Forces, Ministries, other government bodies, state and private manufacturers, incubators and accelerators, institutes and universities, volunteers and foundations. These are 800 manufacturers, more than 1000 teams working on innovative solutions. And now all the weapons produced by this ecosystem in Ukraine, we will call WEAPONS.- The English version of the ZBROYA brand aims to attract international partners to support the production of Ukrainian weapons and to spread information about the phenomenon of the development of the Ukrainian defense industry during a full-scale invasion. The visual elements of the -WEAPONS- brand will be used to apply the logo to OVT products, the unification of state services for OVT manufacturers, media publications and other manifestations of communication about the Ukrainian defense industry. This brand should convey to the world that the Ukrainian -WEAPON- is a smart force hardened by the real battlefield, it is a sign of quality. The Ukrainian defense industry is modern, flexible and fast, it responds to the challenges of war and is constantly improving. She represents the free people who create new generation weapons to defend their land and build the Arsenal of the free world. After all, Ukraine has become the flagship of the production of the latest weapons thanks to the unique experience of modern warfare during these three years of full-scale invasion.

The all-powerful TikTok: how the Ministry of Defense builds communication campaigns for recruiting	Recruiters met to summarize their own experience and consider future areas of activity in the Ministry of Defense system. One of the speakers at the Forum was the head of the operational communications department of the Department of Mass Information of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lt. Col. The Ministry of Defense is on those social networks where our potential recruits are. That is, we are where our audience is. Any communication campaign, if it does not have information support, is doomed to fail to achieve its main goal,- said Volodymyr Fityo. &nbsp; According to him, this is why the resources of the Ministry of Defense are represented in all social networks: -Our resources are Army TV, Army FM and ArmyInform. They continuously provide information on digital television networks, on the radio and, accordingly, ArmyInform, as an information agency, publishes military and surrounding military news on its website.- The officer clarified that thanks to social networks, where the listed military mass media are also represented - especially due to TikTok, which has a young audience - campaigns on the -Contract 18-24-, -Be yourself- projects, campaigns on recruiting and mobilization are supported. -On average, about 30 promotional videos of the Army media brand are released per week in all popular social media, which popularize the military service, the Armed Forces and encourage potential recruits and potential candidates to join the Defense Forces,- emphasized the head of the operational communications department of the Department of Mass Information of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lt.

He held the bridgehead in conditions of collapsed logistics and dozens of KABs per day: the story of...	The story of the fighter was published by the Southern Air Command. He started his military career in 2019. He said that he was lucky because he had time to prepare for a full-scale invasion. According to him, the longest in his life were four kilometers, when he carried his comrades under fire under heavy enemy fire, and the greatest joy was when he survived. And the understanding of what true brotherhood is when, after the landmine landed, he heard the voice of his brother: -Hold on, brother!-, who was pulling him to a safe place by his bulletproof vest. After rehabilitation, Roman continues to serve in his native anti-aircraft brigade. -We just have to fight. Each of the Ukrainians is in his place. Otherwise, piece by piece, everything will be taken from us. I have reported three times for a business trip to the Combined Rifle Brigade of the Air Force. Someone said: -You have a little son.- But this is my main motivation. Of course, no one threw us into battle,- the fighter said. At first, Roman underwent long-term training, after which he was sent to resupply the marine infantry brigade. In the summer of 2023, he fought in the Avdiiv region, where fierce battles were fought at that time. -It was difficult, but we held our positions. When Comrade Serhii was wounded in the leg, we, together with the soldier, dragged him to the place of medical assistance. It was really long kilometers, enemy shelling continued, but we didn't even think about the danger,- the man recalled. Now the rescued fellow wears the call sign -Fartovy-. Roman had to understand what real brotherhood is by his own example. In November 2023, a man heard the characteristic whistle of the 120th mine in Kherson Oblast. He managed to duck down, saw a flash and felt a piercing pain from a shell fragment. -I didn't have time to think something pessimistic, as brother Ivan with the call sign -Major- already dragged him a little further away from the shelling into the basement of the building and provided first aid. The fighting in Krynk was more than active, so I spent several days in that basement. Periodically, shooting battles between Ukrainian soldiers and the occupiers even took place in the same building with me, on the basement floor. But the rioters were chased away, and I was evacuated,- said Roman. Despite being wounded, he continues his service and passes on his combat experience to younger soldiers. -Three years have passed&#8230; War has changed and evolved. One thing has remained unchanged - the understanding that we have no other way out than to fight for our own,- the fighter assured. For personal bravery, Roman Mosezhny was awarded the Cross of Valor and the Golden Cross badge. As reported by ArmyInform, a story appeared on the page of the State Border Service of Ukraine about the first assault of a young border guard with the call sign -Wise.- The boy, who was a cadet last year, now commands a platoon of border guards of the -Steel Border- brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/utrymuvav-placzdarm-v-umovah-obvalenoyi-logistyky-ta-desyatkiv-kabiv-na-den-istoriya-bijczya-romana/	2025-02-25T07:09:59-08:00

-Contract 18‒24- and development strategy: achievements and prospects of recruiting to the Defense F...	The event was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, recruiting centers of the Ukrainian Army and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, recruiting structures of military units, TCCs and joint ventures, public organizations, foreign representatives and online platforms that are platforms for disseminating information about vacancies in the Defense Forces. At the Forum, a strategy for attracting, developing and maintaining human capital in the Defense Forces for the period until 2027 was presented of the year, presented an experimental project of military service by citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 25 and summed up and outlined prospects for the development of the network of recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army. Participants discussed the results and prospects of recruiting foreigners and stateless persons, the place and role of online platforms for searching for military vacancies and communication, and online tools for the promotion of military service. Also during the work The Forum summed up the activities of the Recruiting Centers for 2024 and awarded the best recruiters, partners and units (institutions) based on the results of the 2024 recruiting campaign. The priority areas of the Strategy for the attraction, development and retention of human capital in the Defense Forces of Ukraine for the period until 2027 were outlined by the Deputy Head of the Department of Coordination of Human Capital Management Projects and the Implementation of Changes Colonel Dmytro Zubovskyi of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The strategy approved by the Ministry of Defense in January 2025 deals with the principles of systemic transformations in the field of military recruitment, modern standards of education and training, as well as clear mechanisms for the career and professional growth of servicemen. -Since last year, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has started comprehensive work on rethinking the approach to working with human capital. Today, there is a clear understanding of the importance of man as the central subject of achieving any success on the battlefield. This is the most valuable thing that is in Ukraine. A policy was developed to attract, develop and maintain human capital in the Defense Forces, the logical continuation of which was a strategy that detailed all the elements, defined specific stages and tasks that should be faced. The Ministry of Defense acts in this matter as the architect of all components of the Defense Forces, since according to the provisions of the regulatory founding acts, we set a general policy for all subjects of the defense sector, which fall under the concept of military personnel,- said Dmytro Zubovskyi. The strategy covers all components of the Defense Forces and defines clear deadlines by which the innovations provided for in the strategy must be implemented. Its philosophy consists in the development of a people-oriented system of attracting, developing and maintaining human capital in the defense sector. In particular, the Strategy refers to the creation of a fundamentally new recruiting and staffing system, which will provide for the predictability of military service in the chosen specialty when citizens enter military service. In particular, it provides for the transformation of the system of military education and personnel training, the introduction of transparent and a clear policy for determining suitability based on health status, the possibility for recruits to choose their future career path in the army. An important aspect of the Strategy is the rethinking of the elements of the social package as a motivating incentive for citizens to join the army on a voluntary basis. -The purpose of the strategy is to create a coherent and coordinated system of attracting, developing and maintaining human capital in the Defense Forces. When we developed this strategic document, a three-stage logic was laid in it, which was supposed to follow the entire life cycle of a serviceman, since it is impossible to work with human capital, fragmenting the process of passing through the stages of a military career,- said the representative of the Ministry of Defense. Implementation of the Strategy will allow the Defense Forces to be fully staffed with motivated personnel to perform all combat and non-combat tasks with the aim of defending sovereignty and of the territorial integrity of the state. -Our activity has an institutional nature, it allows us to make deep changes in the field of work with human capital, and not just create a certain informational noise around this topic-, - emphasized Dmytro Zubovsky. The head of the Department of Coordination and Direction of Recruiting Centers characterized the historical experience, current state and prospective directions of development of recruiting activities in the system of the Ministry of Defense colonel Serhiy Krylov. The first attempts to reform the archaic system of staffing the Armed Forces, which Ukraine inherited from Soviet times, date back to the 2000s. At that time, the process of professionalization of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was started, which was carried out by recruiting citizens of Ukraine for military service under a contract. The first successful results were achieved during the implementation in 2004‒2007 of pilot projects aimed at reforming the recruitment system by activating the network of military commissariats. During this time, it was possible to almost completely staff several experimental units and units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with contractors. -On the basis of the 30th brigade, 7th aviation brigade, 36th separate coastal defense brigade and the large landing ship -Kostyantyn Olshansky-, a practical experiment was conducted that made it possible to staff these units almost 100% with contract servicemen,- said Colonel Serhiy Krylov. At the same time, the experiment revealed that recruiting through the system of military commissariats is not effective enough due to the overload of military commissars with other tasks. With this in mind, a decision was made in 2008 to create a network of 25 specialized recruiting units in the Armed Forces, separated from the military commissariats and directly subordinated to the General Staff. -The idea of ​​creating such recruiting units was borrowed from the experience of the armies of the leading NATO countries, which at that time helped us in creating this recruiting system. She has been working since 2008 and has shown very interesting results — from the number of people selected by recruiters, only 4% of the staff left in three years. It was a victory that no one could even hope for,- Serhiy Krylov assessed the results of the measures taken at the time. At that time, the average rate of effectiveness of a recruiter's work was 50 people per year, while the best recruiters selected from 120 to 150 future military personnel. At the same time, the annual task of a recruiter in individual NATO countries is 10 people during the year. Unfortunately, this promising system, which gave the first positive results, was completely destroyed in 2012, almost on the eve of the beginning of the open armed aggression of the Russian Federation. As a result, after 2014, it was necessary to restore the processes of professionalization of the Armed Forces of Ukraine almost from scratch. The next push for urgent transformations of the order of involvement in military service was a large-scale invasion. Today, the system of recruiting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine is divided into two functional components - military and civilian. The military component includes 6 recruiting centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 380 recruiting units of combat brigades, regiments and separate battalions, as well as 500 recruiting units that remain in the system of territorial recruitment and social support centers. The issue of activity planning and interaction of the recruiting units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was highlighted by the deputy head of management, head of the recruitment organization and development department of the General Staff, Colonel Dmytro Larin. Today there are 6 recruiting centers of branches and types of troops — Ground Forces, Airborne Assault Forces, Unmanned Systems Forces, Territorial Defense Forces, Special Operations Forces, Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Appeals to them are one of the most effective structures for attracting citizens to the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Appropriate structures have been created in the command of the Ground Forces and four operational commands of the Ground Forces, which are engaged in accompanying recruiting activities, planning their activities and distributing tasks. Interaction between recruiting centers and military units has been established. Military recruiters are being trained on the basis of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny, and the possibilities of such training are being considered for certain categories of personnel of recruiting units on the basis of the National Defense University of Ukraine and the Military Institute of Kyiv National University. An important direction is the digitization of the recruiting process, which is stated in Resolution No. 1170 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine -On the implementation of an experimental project on recruiting citizens of Ukraine in electronic form- dated October 15, 2024. The most extensive recruiting system currently exists in the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Colonel Mykola Kachanenko, head of the personnel department of the headquarters of the Land Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, focused on the activities of the network of recruiting units of the Ground Forces, the achievements and prospects of reforming and optimizing the staffing and recruiting system. In addition to the First Recruiting Center of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which began its activities on September 1, 2024, the recruiting network of the Ground Forces includes units recruiting from the structure of TCC and JV. Recruiting groups have also been created in each military unit. Recruiting units at military units were only created at the end of last year, so they have not yet had time to fully form and acquire the appropriate capabilities. However, even in the first two months of their existence, they have already managed to win the trust of the population and show the first results. -Citizens respond positively to the creation of this system and to the fact that representatives of military units work with them directly - they explain something, provide information about the procedure for completing military service, about the motivational factors that exist at the moment,- said Mykola Kachanenko. The military emphasized the positive difference between the recruiting system and system of compulsory mobilization, because thanks to it the Armed Forces and the Defense Forces as a whole receive highly motivated personnel who came to the service not under compulsion, but by their own choice. Among the active means of informing citizens and involving them in military service, the officer gave examples of information activities that are currently being conducted - from live broadcasts on television, materials in the mass media, outdoor advertising to meetings in educational institutions and recruiting using the capabilities of the Internet. -Currently, virtually every military unit, every brigade has its own website, which you can go to by simply typing the name of that brigade into the search engine. This is one of the ways for our military units to achieve success,- the military officer noted. Speaking about the prospects for reforming and optimizing the recruitment and recruitment system, Mykola Kachanenko emphasized the need to intensify cooperation between military recruiters and representatives of the civilian sector. In particular, this can happen on the basis of making changes to the legislative framework, which will stimulate the desire of the heads of institutions and organizations to provide comprehensive assistance and support to military recruiters. Finally, the officer emphasized the need to separate the recruiting function from the functional sphere of territorial recruitment and social support centers and create a network of regional recruiting centers in the Armed Forces. Unlike TCCs and JVs, which are overburdened with other functions, and recruiting centers would be able to focus their activities precisely on conducting active recruiting activities. Concluding the work of the first panel Lieutenant Colonel Petro Avramich highlighted the activities and achievements of the Fourth Recruiting Center of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the authorized representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on recruiting issues, Senior Lieutenant Oleksiy Bezhevets, presented the activities, work results and prospects for the development of the network Recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army. There are currently 47 recruiting centers for the Defense Forces throughout Ukraine, as well as 1 online center. In addition to the function of informing and responding to the requests of interested citizens, their recruiters proactively contact those who are looking for work with offers of relevant vacancies. The experimental project of the contract for military service by citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 25 was presented by the deputy director of the personnel policy department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Colonel Ruslan Rusetskyi. -It is no secret that today we have combat units The Armed Forces of Ukraine are experiencing a personnel shortage. In view of this, the military-political leadership of the state considered the possibility of enlisting motivated citizens aged 18 to 25 for military service under a contract,- the officer noted. The project concerns citizens of Ukraine who are not subject to conscription for military service upon mobilization and the enlistment of citizens of 1824 to the defense of Ukraine thanks to the system of increasing motivational factors on the part of the state. In no case can it be considered a veiled mobilization, because the conclusion of the contract takes place exclusively on a voluntary basis. Currently, the project is being implemented on the basis of six brigades designated by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. These are the 10th separate Edelweiss mountain assault brigade, the 28th separate mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, the 38th separate marine infantry brigade, the 72nd separate mechanized brigade named after the Black Zaporozhets, the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, and the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade of the Polish Brigade. up to 25 years before service in the Defense Forces should be scalable. In the near future, it is planned to increase the number of brigades participating in the experimental project, as well as to expand the list of combat positions in which it will be possible to serve under its conditions. During the implementation of the project, it is planned to recruit up to 10 thousand citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 25 for military service, despite the fact that there are 800 thousand people of this age in Ukraine in total. The experimental project provides for a number of motivational factors before concluding a contract. In addition to the payment of monetary compensation in the total amount of UAH 1 million, this also includes: The military unit will receive 200,000 UAH for the enhanced military training of each recruit involved in this project. UAH., which will be directed to the improvement of the educational and material base. The first part is when a citizen comes to a military unit and puts his signature on the contract. The first tranche of this payment will be made within 5 working days. The Department of Finance and the Department of Social Security of the Ministry of Defense reported that a reserve of money has already been formed for the payment of this first tranche of the reward for signing the first contract,- Ruslan Rusetskyi said. The second tranche will be received by servicemen of this age who signed the contract after completing military training, arriving in the unit and engaging in tasks. It will amount to 300,000. UAH Before dismissal, if the terms of the contract are fulfilled, the third tranche in the amount of 500 thousand is paid. hryvnias. In addition, during the service, the contractor will be able to receive standard financial support in the amount of about 20,000 UAH. UAH, reward 100,000 UAH per month for participating in hostilities, additional remuneration in the amount of 70,000 UAH. hryvnias for the total number of days of participation in hostilities and payments for the destruction of enemy weapons and military equipment. Financial motives are important, as 40% of citizens aged 18‒24 who submitted applications for concluding a contract indicated that they were the reason for concluding a contract. Another 43% cited patriotic considerations as the main motive. -We are where our potential recruits are- Also, during the Defense Forces Recruiters Forum, practical experience of the recruiting projects -Drone Force- and -Victory Drones-, 28 separate mechanized brigades named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign and 47 separate mechanized brigades of -Magura- were presented.

A father's hands are a son's wings: how an aviation technician prepares a fighter for his pilot son	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Valeriy checks the technical serviceability of the MiG-29 combat fighter every day. It is these machines, controlled by Ukrainian aces, that hunt in the sky for strike drones and cruise missiles, cover the hostilities of fellow fighters and inflict devastating blows on the occupiers. -Aviation technicians treat airplanes as if they were living creatures,- Valery says. — We know their -characters-, follow the smallest changes in the systems' operation, prepare them for hard service in the sky. Inspection of flight systems, diagnostics, refueling - technicians work regardless of the time of day or weather. Only after all thorough checks can they hand the fighter over to the pilot, report readiness, shake hands and wait for his return. For Valery, this work gained even more meaning when his son was in the cockpit of one of the planes. He is an experienced fighter pilot with over 200 sorties to his credit. Its mission is to destroy enemy positions on the ground and in the air, to use the latest weapons that help Ukraine fight for freedom. -Preparing my son's plane for departure is an excitement that cannot be expressed in words,- Valery shares. — You do your work even more carefully, because you know: not only the success of the task depends on you, but also the life of the most precious person. After each sortie, the pilot returns to the airfield, and the technician again takes care of the maintenance of his aircraft. It is a ritual that never loses its importance. For a father, this is more than a duty, it is his contribution to future victory. - I am proud of my son. He fights in heaven, I support him on earth. Together, we are approaching the day when the Ukrainian sky will be finally free. This story is another proof that the war in Ukraine is not just a struggle of weapons, but also a struggle in which different generations forge victory together.

War criminals are massively involved in the -education- of children at the TOT of Ukraine	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. Andrii Samoylov, a -deputy- of the fake -LNR- parliament, was appointed to be responsible for this shameful -mentoring-. This Russian posipaka was given the task of organizing the presence of at least two so-called -his- heroes in every educational institution in a short period of time. Their goal is to -instill- love for Russia and Putin in children. This process is not new.

They developed a fiber-optic Internet transmission system that allowed units to stay in touch with command. -We spent a lot of time mastering optical communication, because we had not worked with it before. But in the end, everything worked out. -We have a very strong interaction: everyone works according to their capabilities and knowledge, and officers are connected where special expertise is needed,- the fighters say.

-We are not just a crew - we are a family-: the story of brothers who fight together	The story of the fighters was published on the brigade's page. Before the full-scale invasion, the brothers worked in civilian occupations: one was a dental technician, the other had his own business. However, when Ukraine called, they came to the Military Commissariat and got into the tank unit. -Immediately they saw a tanker in me. They approached, they said: will you be our mechanic? I answer: no questions, just let me have another brother with me,- says -Yeroma-. He disproves the common myth that tankers should be short, because modern tanks allow even those taller than 180 cm to work comfortably. Everyone in the crew has a role, and everyone's life depends on harmony. -When you go into battle, all arguments fall away. We become one. If one person panics, it threatens the entire crew,- explains the soldier. The main enemy of tankers is not only enemy vehicles, but also FPV drones and Lancets. They are faster than a 40-ton armored vehicle and are able to hit it in the most vulnerable places. However, Ukrainian tankers are learning to counter new threats: they use radio-electronic warfare systems, quickly camouflage equipment, and sometimes repair damage right in the field. The first battle of -Yeroma- took place in September 2022 in the Golden Niva region of Donetsk region. -We didn't know how to properly drive in, clear the road, bypass crossings. At first, the gunner could not see the target because of a small tree, he had to knock it down with a tank. After a few shots, the fire system failed, but a quick repair allowed us to come back and finish the job,- he recalls. Subsequently, the crew had to restrain the enemy, working almost without rest. During one of the sorties, they destroyed four targets, including a building with twenty occupants. -We worked so clearly that the enemy didn't even want to go back there,- says the fighter. Despite exhausting battles, -Yeroma- does not lose optimism. He dreams of victory and a return to a peaceful life. -I was a dentist, I made prostheses. And now a tank mechanic. After the victory, I would like to return to my work,- he says. But while the war continues, the crew does not leave their combat positions. Their tank is not just an armored vehicle, but an extension of themselves. -We are the machine, and the machine is us,- says -Yeroma,- with the confidence of a warrior who knows his crew will go through fire and iron, but return home alive. As reported by ArmyInform, Gostomel. February 24, 2022. The sky is cut by the roar of Ka-52 attack helicopters. There are six of them, they fly low, covered by the folds of the terrain.

In Odesa, an agent was detained who was preparing caches for terrorist attacks	reported this on February 25 Security Service of Ukraine According to the case file, the suspect is a 32-year-old Odesa woman who was remotely recruited by a staff member of the special operations forces of the Russian military at the end of last year. It was established that on his instructions, the traitor set fire to the relay cabinet of the signal installation and the transformer substation on the local railway line. Then the agent received a new task — to arrange a cache with components for an improvised explosive device (IED) near the port. For this purpose, the woman traveled to Dnipro, where, following the coordinates of her Russian curator, she took an explosive element disguised as a pack of cigarettes from the hiding place. After returning to Odesa, the traitor tried to put the components for SVP in a previously prepared hiding place near the port infrastructure. At this stage, SBU counter-intelligence agents caught the agent red-handed and seized part of an explosive device from her. It was also established that the next component of the stash was firearms, which the defendant had to take from another front-line city.

Are believers allowed to fight, or myths in which Ukrainian Christians can still believe	You must have often heard -Believers cannot fight-, -War is a punishment from God-? So we offer to find out if the Bible really interprets everything that way. Isn't the most widespread myth the one that claims that Christians should not fight. So, maybe it's worth looking at the biblical texts? What do they tell us there? And it turns out that the Bible does not forbid fighting for justice: -Book of the prophet Isaiah 1 17 Learn to do good; seek the truth, defend the oppressed, defend the orphan, intercede for the widow!- -Exodus 22 1 -When a thief is caught breaking in, and beaten so that he dies, there is no crime of blood.- Next myth: pray for peace, not victory. Well, let's see how the Bible actually interprets this thesis. If you read carefully, you can make sure that peace is not the absence of war, but the result of the victory of truth: -PSALM 2 Prophecy about the Kingdom of the Son of God 8 Ask of Me, and I will give Your people are Your inheritance, Your possession is to the end of the earth! 9 You will kill them with an iron rod, you will crush them like a potter's vessel. 10 And now - be wise, kings, learn, you judges of the earth: 11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling! 12 Respect the Son, so that He does not become angry, and so that you do not perish on the way, [3] because His anger will soon be kindled. Blessed are all who trust in Him!-. Another no less widespread myth is that, they say, the war &#8211; it is God's punishment for our sins. So we read the Bible again: what is written about it there. And they write that everyone who does good will always have enemies: -The First Council Message of St. of the apostle Peter, chapter 4 ⁴ They are therefore surprised that you do not partake of the debauchery with them, and they despise it. The next myth: if you believe in God, you will not be affected by war. If you take the Bible in your hands, you can learn that God tests our faith precisely through the war: -The Cathedral Message of St. Apostle James 2 Have full joy, my brothers, when you fall into all kinds of trials. So, as you can see, everyone who denies Ukraine's right to defend itself is working – consciously or unconsciously – in the interests of the enemy. Therefore, it is advisable to always treat with caution any information that aims to stop us on the way to resisting the aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/chy-dozvoleno-viryanam-voyuvaty-abo-mify-u-yaki-dosi-mozhut-viryty-hrystyyany-ukrayiny/	2025-02-25T00:54:46-08:00

Andriy Rubtsov, head of the communications department of the 116th separate mechanized brigade, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti- . According to him, the brigade controls the defined boundaries. If a few months ago there were powerful -rollings- of tanks and various armored vehicles, now the situation has changed. For the most part, assaults take place without the involvement of -armor-. -One of the factors that can potentially influence the fact that the enemy uses armored vehicles less is the efficiency of our units. As soon as they see enemy activity, for example, a column of enemy vehicles advancing, our bombers, FPV pilots, immediately begin to take off. And they destroy it,- said the head of the communications department of the 116th separate mechanized brigade.

The exhibition project -Lutyy: the edges of indomitability- is being exhibited in the capital	It was in February that key events in Ukraine's recent history took place: the victory of the Revolution of Dignity and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2014, and then the beginning of Russia's large-scale aggression against our country in February 2022. The exposition of the exhibition project details the chronology of events that developed around the heart of Ukraine - Kyiv. The end of February 2022 marked the beginning of a large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv, the heart of the Revolution of Dignity, became an outpost of powerful resistance to the occupiers. The battle for Kyiv turned Moscow's ambitious plans to capture Kyiv in three days into a defeat for the Russians and completely shattered the illusions of the -second army of the world- and prevented them from carrying out their next blitzkrieg, which they managed to implement in the past in Budapest (1956), Prague (1968) and Kabul (1979). Emphasizing these historical parallels, the exhibition reveals the current stage of the formation of the Ukrainian nation, the process of hardening its character in the victorious struggle against the background of the fateful trials of the Ukrainian people. The Center for Researching the Military History of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the National Memorial Complex of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred - the Museum of the Revolution of Dignity, and the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance joined the implementation of the exhibition project -Fierce: Faces of Invincibility-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/u-stolyczi-eksponuyetsya-vystavkovyj-proyekt-lyutyj-grani-nezlamnosti/	2025-02-25T00:34:42-08:00

Russian medicines were traded in Ukraine - a criminal group was exposed	This was announced on February 25 by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the investigation, two foreign citizens, with the participation of two pharmacists, established the activities of pharmacies that specialized in the sale of unregistered medicinal products in Ukraine, in particular those manufactured in the Russian Federation. Also, expensive oncological drugs with signs of falsification were illegally sold there, endangering the lives and health of citizens. Medicines, in particular antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulators and stimulants of mental activity, arrived from the territory of the aggressor state to Moldova by regular buses. After that, the suspects personally or with the help of drivers transported them to Ukraine, avoiding customs control. According to preliminary estimates, as a result of such activities from the Russian Federation, more than 1.5 million UAH were transferred to the current accounts of the network of Russian pharmacies, part of which was later paid in the form of taxes and fees to the federal budget of the Russian Federation. During the authorized searches in the network of pharmacies, as well as at the places of residence of the suspects, more than 100 names of foreign drugs were seized, including more than 30 - manufactured in the Russian Federation, mobile phones and computer equipment with evidence of illegal activity. The State Service of Medicines and Narcotics Control of Ukraine was informed of the facts of the detected illegal activity, as a result of which the controlling body made a decision to cancel the license of the -entrepreneurs- to carry out business activities in the retail and wholesale trade of medicinal products. The suspects are charged with economic activity in cooperation with the aggressor state, committed as part of an organized group (part 3 of article 28, part 4 of article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). At present, the issue of selecting preventive measures for them is being resolved. As reported by ArmyInform, the director of an online casino, whose owners are citizens of the Russian Federation, was detained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/torguvaly-v-ukrayini-rosijskymy-likamy-vykryto-zlochynnu-grupu/	2025-02-25T00:03:03-08:00

It has its own positive practical experience of effective rehabilitation, its own protocols, recommendations. — I am very impressed that the boys like us, like in the meme: so cozy, homely, sometimes they joke (smiles). After completing the rehabilitation course, many guys choose our department for a repeat course. We are happy to meet them. The clinical cases that our department focuses on require periodic rehabilitation, normalization and correction of functional physical and mental states. These are mostly amputations, severe skeletal injuries, severe fractures that require rehabilitation not only for a month, but sometimes for years. For example, it is physiological that the stumps change over time, and the military appeals to us again. It is important that there is a department like ours: there is somewhere to turn, the military feels cared for, it is important that you are not alone, says Khrystyna Ivanovna. The process of prosthetics for a military man is a complex and energy-consuming journey that he must go through. During this period, a military serviceman is focused on multi-vector interaction: both with prosthetic centers, and at the same time active work with physical therapists and the psychologist of the department. — At one time, I thought that working with amputated limbs was quite simple: a leg was amputated, after the tissues had healed, specialists would prepare a prosthesis, and the person quickly got on this prosthesis and went on living his life. And in fact, only pre-prosthetic preparation takes several months. In the best case, up to a month, provided the amputation is not complicated, and provided there are no complications, if the stump heals normally, up to a month. Our most striking case is when we put a patient on training prostheses and started the process of learning to walk in just under 4 months. The patient had an amputation of all four limbs. During the 3 months that the patient was in the department, the rehabilitation specialists prepared the stumps in a high-quality manner and began the process of learning how to use prostheses, says Hrystyna Tabakar. - This is an incredibly strong, courageous soldier. He went to war deliberately, received a severe wound in March 2024 in both upper limbs, lower limbs, brain injury, frostbite of both hands and a foot with the development of gangrene. Later, the limbs had to be amputated. At the age of 54, the soldier first had to learn to do seemingly simple, but at the same time so difficult things - walk, eat with the help of prostheses. A real fighter worked very hard, and his faithful wife was always with him. Oleksiy and Elena&#8230; they are for us as a single whole, as an example of extraordinary courage, strength of the human spirit and body&#8230; — the department tells. The post-acute and long-term rehabilitation department works closely with a number of prosthetic centers: both state and non-state. In total - with about 15 prosthetic centers. These are the Prosthetics Center -Without Limits-, Stetsenko Clinic, ProtezFoundation, Ukrprotez. Also, according to Khrystyna Tabakar, they work with prosthetic centers that are not very well-known yet, but have proven themselves very well: -Orto-Pro- or Antis-Orto. — Military personnel are given the opportunity to visit various prosthetic centers, she notes. - It is their legal right to choose the best services. As a rule, the selection criterion is the speed and quality of obtaining a prosthesis. In fairly well-known prosthetic centers, there is a very long queue: 1.5-2 thousand people. That is, it's about half a year, you have to wait until it's your turn to come for a fitting. On the other hand, prosthetic centers, which are not very well-known, immediately do a fitting and immediately prepare components. There, boys can get an educational prosthesis in just a month. And this is very often the selection criterion for our military. Can this prosthetics industry handle the influx of injured people? Khrystyna Tabakar answers in the negative: - Can't cope. And the direction must be strengthened somehow. Nowadays, there are many prosthetic centers. The problem is that each case is individual and requires different components. There are none in Ukraine, we do not produce them, we have to wait from abroad: Germany, the USA, etc. In Ukraine, the company -Olbionics- recently appeared, it is very young, they have just started work. They will make bionic prostheses for the boys. It is important that these are bionic prostheses of the upper limbs. Because if the lower limbs are made by almost all prosthetic centers, and such prosthetics has a lot of world experience, then with the upper limbs it is very, very difficult. Yes, there are prosthetic centers in the world that make upper limbs, but the world simply hasn't faced the same challenges as we have - they don't have them. It is usually a combat pathology of the upper limbs&#8230; Therefore, in the context of this experience, Ukraine can give any other country a head start. But, unfortunately, this way&#8230; According to Khrystyna Tabakar, foreign patients (Spanish and English-speaking, in particular) go to the psychologist with greater friendliness. - They perform all exercises with great understanding. We have such a psychologist in our department that she is so open, sincere and so easy to communicate with that she can find an approach to everyone. She can joke with one, with another she can find the words he wants to hear at that moment. This is probably such a gift, talent&#8230; You can feel sorry for someone, you can stand up for someone's mother, and you can also find the necessary words of motivation for those who are confused or feel despair. I will tell you about one of the unusual cases that clearly demonstrates the need for the professional help of a psychologist. A year ago, a patient who had been in a wheelchair for about a year came to us, and his rehabilitation process came to a dead end. He had one leg amputated and the other broken. — As our psychologist discovered, this patient had a false belief that his other non-amputated limb would not be able to heal in any way, and that if he stood on this leg, it would break again. That is, with a normal stump, already ready to walk on a prosthesis, it was the unprocessed false beliefs at the psychological level that made further physical rehabilitation impossible. The patient was convinced that he would never be able to stand on the prosthesis again, and if he did, the bone of the second leg would collapse. He came to the department with the idea that his whole future life is a wheelchair. Mrs. Khrystyna continues: — During the conversation, our psychologist asked: -What or who do you think will help you stand upright and get up from the chair?- The patient answered: -There was only one person, she was a midwife in Makarov, I always went to her, and she helped me in difficult life situations. But now she is probably no longer alive. My life is already full. All good things are over forever.- The psychologist consulted with the doctor, told about her unusual tactics for working out the false beliefs of the patient, who agreed. Then our psychologist said that she had a relative with such a gift, and that she was taking courses as a biotherapist. She offered to -charm- above the leg in the style of -ahalai mahalai-, twirled her hands, said that she has strong energy, and assured: -That's it, now you can try.- And he tried. And put on a prosthesis. At most, he became a good motivator for the other guys in the ward. He became an example of strength for them, says Ms. Khrystyna about this -healing story-. This, he says, is another proof that people change after working with a psychologist. There is another story - also about the result. — Military, low amputation of the upper limb. One eye is missing, the other has also been hit by a bullet, its vision is rapidly declining and a cataract is forming. Military man is married, has a daughter. But the wife did not choose the path of always being next to her husband, but left him. It caused depression, he struggled with betrayal&#8230; But our psychologist found an approach to him - and he was able to -digest- and let go of this story. Now he is an example of strength and courage for others, has an unparalleled sense of humor, supports others, is determined to further treat his eye, works with his limb, received a training prosthesis, and works with it. Khrystyna Tabakar states that life after life in the rehabilitation department for military personnel can be somewhat more difficult. — According to the military, it is much more difficult to live outside a medical institution. There is a reality in which there are no smooth asphalt roads and on which it is very difficult to walk with prostheses, there are no ramps, equipped elevators, social support, where it is difficult to find a job, and sometimes there is no simple human understanding of the needs of people with disabilities, inclusive culture. And these are the questions that our society will face in the future. And we will have to work on this problem, because today nothing has been resolved, says the department. Mrs. Khrystyna tells the story of three servicemen who lost both upper limbs during the Russian-Ukrainian war. Two of them are under 30 years old. — They are both from Donetsk region: Avdiyivka, Mariupol. Both have nowhere to return. And the question arises: both of them have prostheses, one of them closed all questions, was released from military service, sent documents to obtain a disability group, and where now?... Where to discharge him? He has nowhere to go and is absolutely, 100% dependent on outside help. He is still with us, now the question is being resolved about him&#8230; There are people who found him an apartment, and there is a person who has the ability to pay for that apartment for a year. But he still needs a person to help him put on that prosthesis, go to the toilet in the morning, drink water, lock the door with a key, and so on. But this is a temporary solution to one person's problem. In my opinion, it is necessary to develop social support, support programs for veterans at the state level. They protected us, I think it would be fair for the state to take care of them and create new opportunities for their self-realization. These guys are capable of great things.

Repelling banzai attacks -Storm Z- on motorcycles under a swarm of drones and an onslaught of KABs: ...	Now attacks happen almost every day. The brigade uses all available means to destroy enemy assault groups. Among those who actively cover their infantry are princely tankmen... ... Frosty sunny morning. There is not a single cloud in the sky. Perfect weather for drones. But not for those they hunt. We are heading to the position of the -30- tankers. This is what its fighters call the brigade among themselves. Already at the entrance, it becomes clear that today the enemy is also trying to storm - artillery is working regularly. They did not have time to reach their positions when the command: -take cover!- is heard. An enemy FPV drone is flying nearby. Our work has increased recently, says tank commander Dmytro. He is 24 years old. In the Armed Forces since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, and for the last almost one and a half years in the tank battalion of the 30th OMBr. He works on a trophy T-72 captured during the Kharkiv counteroffensive. It was quieter before that. They tried to attack from time to time, but they were beaten and kept quiet. And it became something more active. -Storm Z- units are storming. They try to slip by on motorcycles, buggies, cars. Once a group of several dozen motorcyclists attacked. But they didn't get there. Our FPVers did a good job and drones with resets. They also periodically attack MTLB and shed tanks,- &#8211; says Dmytro. Most often now they have to work on enemy infantry, Dmytro continues, adding that for them it doesn't matter what to work on - equipment, infantry or dugouts. Ready for anything. -If a tank or a self-propelled guns appear, then of course they will go after them. What is important is accurate shooting. The tank thing is accurate. But it all depends on the crew. If the crew is coordinated, then the tank is a killer machine. We destroyed both tanks and infantry fighting vehicles.- They work most often from closed positions. After all, it is safer in modern conditions. Although sometimes they leave for direct fire. Depends on the situation. The other day, the task was to work with direct fire, says the commander of another tank Serhii with the call sign -Hetman-: -But we were noticed. Artillery began to work. The commander of one of the tanks was wounded in the leg. I had to quickly change the point. And we managed to move in time. Because as we later learned from intelligence, 10 FPV drones flew after us at once. That is, they are ready to launch a whole swarm of drones even on one tank-. FPV-drones, -Lancets- and reconnaissance drones are the main problem for tankers now, says tank commander Dmytro. -Now the main problem is drones. FPV drones, also -Orlans-. Because they give the target indication of the day of -Krasnopol-. They have such an installation. And it is very accurate. -Maviks- still. Because if they noticed you, the arta will not let go of you. Will constantly have -nightmares-. But the main problem &#8211; FPV drones. It's just a slipper. There are a lot of them. You could already see for yourself. If they notice us, the whole swarm flies out immediately. It was somehow easier at the beginning of the war. Because there was almost none of this. And now -zest-. They also began to use KAB very often. This year, like a rush. Several events each day. Villages and positions are destroyed.- Our tankers counter this with camouflage, additional protection and speed, says tank commander Serhii -Hetman-: -We are making special frames, strengthening protection against FPV and skidding. Well, we try to practice as quickly as possible. To shoot back and immediately hide in a hole.- Sergiu is also 24 years old. He has been in 30 OMBr for 4 years. At first, he did his military service here, and then signed a contract and became a tanker driver. Went with the brigade all its combat path from the beginning of the large-scale invasion. He says that he is used to this work: -I am used to my profession. I know everything. I don't want anything else. I know that if there is a team, the crew and I are already leaving and working. How everything is happening. We are called by the company. Shows the route, how it is better to get there, where it is better to retreat, or detour. Shows targets where you need to practice. The number of the enemy. Are there armored vehicles or not? We are preparing the tank for departure and, following the command, we are leaving for the specified area.- The workhorse of the -Hetman- is the T-64 BV tank. Although the machine is old and periodically needs repairs, it continues to perform its functions and destroy the enemy. -Would I like to work on Western equipment? But I don't want to. I'm already used to our 64. I know her better. Here, by the way, the gun is very accurate. And the best stabilization of the gun... If you need to work on a different type of machine, then I can sit for the commander. But for a gunner or a mechanic-driver, it is more difficult here. The machines are still different. You need to know the nuances. And what is the commander's business? Constantly on the walkie-talkie. Give target indication to the gunner. And to monitor the situation.- Dmytro, unlike Serhiy, does not mind working on Western equipment. He says that he has heard many good reviews about her: -There are acquaintances who serve on Leopards and Abrams. I asked them. What they say is worth it. But we have what we have-. Both commanders could have remained in civilian life for their age, but chose the path of struggle. They say that the level of motivation has fallen a little over the years, but the main thing remains the same - not to let the enemy pass any further. So that he does not reach their homes...	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/vidbyttya-banzaj-atak-shtorm-z-na-motoczyklah-pid-royem-droniv-ta-navaloyu-kabiv-armiyainform-na-gostynah-u-30-yi-ombr/	2025-02-24T20:33:36-08:00

Ukrainians are not terrorizing Europe: the Kremlin is trying to convince the world of its parallel r...	the Russian propaganda machine works according to a well-known pattern: The latest -spell- about -terrorists from Ukraine- appeared in the Russian media after a series of criminal incidents in Europe in which Ukrainians were allegedly involved. There is no evidence, of course, just hearsay and manipulation. Speaking of threats to Europe, it is worth mentioning the hundreds of detained Russian agents, spies and provocateurs in various countries. It is the citizens of the Russian Federation who regularly appear in scandals related to destabilization attempts. In addition, the Russian mafia has long been known in the EU for its -exploits- in the field of smuggling, cyber fraud and arms trafficking. But, of course, Russian propaganda is not interested in this. The simple answer: Ukrainians not only survived the war, but also continue to fight, help their country and defend their dignity. the Kremlin wants to create the image of a -dangerous Ukrainian- so that: But, unfortunately for Russian propagandists, their fables fall apart at the first inspection. Ukrainians are not terrorizing Europe - they are fighting for their freedom, and the Kremlin is once again trying to convince the world of its parallel reality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/25/ukrayinczi-ne-teroryzuyut-yevropu-kreml-namagayetsya-perekonaty-svit-u-svoyij-paralelnij-realnosti/	2025-02-24T20:15:12-08:00

-Battle of the brave loves-: the story of the soldier Rostyslav, who met his beloved after being wou...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -My meeting with my wife in the hospital, where I was admitted after being wounded, reminds me of the final scene from the movie -Strong Peanut-, but in a Ukrainian interpretation,- says Rostyslav. — -She bursts into my ward, and I'm sitting there, on a wheelchair, bloodied and with a cigarette in my teeth. And then hugs and my phrase: -Hello, wife!-. In that moment, I felt relieved, we are together again, so everything will be fine.- This meeting became for Rostislav a symbol of returning to a normal life after months of separation and struggle for survival. He is grateful to his wife for the support and love that helps him overcome all difficulties. Rostislav also tells about how the commander saved him. -He was injured - I was taking him out, I was injured - he was taking me out. So when I returned to the formation, the first thing I did was shake his hand and say 1:1,- the soldier recalls. This example of fraternal mutual aid is another evidence that in war people become not just comrades for each other, but also true friends, ready to come to the rescue in any situation. 22-year-old Rostislav is a native of Lysychansk, he devoted three years of his life to military service. During this time, he had to go through many trials, but he did not lose his optimism and sense of humor. -It seems that I was ironed by everyone: arta was flying, KABs were exploding. But my boys knew that if I went, I would one hundred percent take the wounded and bring something back,- Rostyslav says about his work in transporting the necessary supplies and evacuating wounded comrades.

Another children's military propaganda action was held by the enemy at the TOT of Luhansk region	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. On the day of the so-called -defender-, the Russians conducted a series of propaganda activities involving children who are planned to be trained to participate in Russia's war of aggression.

The children were forced to hold the unfurled banner -army of Russia- and thank the Russian terrorists for -protection- in the cold for several hours. The occupiers of the TOT of Ukraine are not ashamed to purposefully use children to impose their own ideology. Propaganda reaches even the youngest schoolchildren: first-graders are drawn into drawing contests on politicized topics, forced to study distorted history, and imposed values ​​that contradict their national identity.

-In the war he learned to fly-: the story of the scout -Barbera-	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. A year ago he was a hairdresser, and today he is a UAV operator performing important reconnaissance missions. His path to technology was quite difficult, but it was military service and the new demands of war that prompted him to master a new field. -We have to move forward, we can only win this war with intelligence - otherwise it will not work,- says -Barber-. And if the mind is the key to victory, then the drone control panel became his tool. It all started with a simple desire to learn. -The main thing is to want to learn, develop and mow down orcs,- he jokes, emphasizing the importance of motivation and the desire to improve. A week after he first picked up a drone remote control, Barber started flying FPV drones. Today, he knows how to fly a variety of models, from Mavics to Wings, and is capable of working with all the equipment that comes into his hands. Own initiative and the desire to develop - this is what became the basis for success. -If a person wants to learn, if they have the will, they can learn any technique,- he says, adding that even those with no previous experience with the technique can become excellent drone operators. -Personally, I've only been cutting people's hair a year ago, and I never thought I'd be able to fly drones,- Barber admits. Now he works in intelligence, and drones have become an indispensable tool for completing tasks. According to him, without technical innovations such as drones, victory in the war would be impossible. Every day, he realizes that the development and technical equipment of the fighters of the 141st brigade is not just an important aspect, but a necessity for achieving results. -With such a team working together with me, there are no impossible tasks,- he adds, emphasizing the cohesion, strength and indomitability of his crew. As reported by ArmyInform, Gostomel. February 24, 2022. The sky is cut by the roar of the propellers of Ka-52 attack helicopters. There are six of them, they fly low, covered by the folds of the terrain. Russian airborne troops are preparing to land at the Antonov airfield. But they are already waiting for them on the ground.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/na-vijni-vin-navchyvsya-litaty-istoriya-rozvidnyka-barbera/	2025-02-24T10:54:30-08:00
Museums in the occupied territories have become a weapon in the hands of the Russians: the FSB contr...	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. To centralize propaganda in the captured museums, the Russians appointed curators from the FSB to each of them. Now self-appointed directors have to coordinate exhibitions with Kremlin officials. In addition, the FSB employees will determine the personnel policy of the museum and check the scenarios of excursions so that they take place in the right tone of the Kremlin. The National Resistance Center calls for continued reporting of enemy actions with the goal of effectively destroying the occupiers and their accomplices. This fact is another evidence that the Russian occupiers use culture and history as a tool of propaganda and disinformation. They are trying to rewrite history in their own way, impose their own ideology and destroy Ukrainian identity. As reported by ArmyInform, on the Day of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred in the Kyiv Palace of Children and Youth (KPDU) with the support of the Department of Science and Education of the City of Kyiv opened an exhibition dedicated to the Hero of Ukraine Andriy Pilshchikov, a fighter pilot with the callsign -Jus-, and educator Badri Lolashvili, who defended the country since 2014 and died during the defense of Kyiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/muzeyi-na-okupovanyh-terytoriyah-staly-zbroyeyu-v-rukah-rosiyan-fsb-kontrolyuye-vsi-vystavky-ta-ekskursiyi/	2025-02-24T10:47:27-08:00

Rustem Umerov: Ukraine and Denmark are taking the defense partnership to a new level	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. This step is a logical continuation of the successful -Danish model- of funding, which has already proven its effectiveness. Denmark is one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, having provided more than €7 billion in military aid since the start of the full-scale invasion. Thanks to joint efforts, the Ukrainian defense-industrial complex (ODC) is receiving a powerful push for development. Almost 600 million euros have already been raised within the framework of the -Danish model-, and another 1.5 billion euros are planned to be invested in 2025. Denmark undertakes to allocate 2.2 billion euros annually for the period of 2025-2028 to support the Defense Forces of Ukraine. In addition to financial assistance, Denmark actively helps with the supply and maintenance of modern F-16 fighters, and also trains Ukrainian pilots and technical personnel. During the meeting, the ministers discussed the current security situation and enemy plans. The Air Force Commander, Brigadier General Oleh Zakharchuk, spoke about the important role of the F-16 in protecting Ukrainian skies. Ukraine highly appreciates Denmark's leadership in the process of transferring these modern combat aircraft. Rustem Umyerov thanked Troels Lund Poulsen and the Danish parliamentarians for their visit and support. He emphasized that Denmark remains a reliable ally of Ukraine, and cooperation between the countries will only deepen. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umyerov, said that in the past three years, Ukraine not only stood up against the Russian aggressor, but also strengthened.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/rustem-umyerov-ukrayina-ta-daniya-vyvodyat-oboronne-partnerstvo-na-novyj-riven/	2025-02-24T10:10:49-08:00

Strike UAVs -Omega Wings- once again prove their effectiveness in the fight against Russian invaders. Kamikaze drone pilots skillfully detect and destroy the enemy, inflicting significant losses on them. The video shows how our drones attack a group of Russian soldiers, inflicting fatal injuries on them. The enemy has no chance to save himself, because every blow is accurate and deadly. As reported by ArmyInform, snipers of the 3rd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center Omega neutralized Russian infantrymen who were moving in the water in the Kherson region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/kryla-omegy-prodovzhuyut-nyshhyty-voroga-udarni-bpla-efektyvno-vrazhayut-skupchennya-zhyvoyi-syly-protyvnyka/	2025-02-24T09:57:08-08:00
-His own director-: how a Ukrainian was looking for adventure on the border, but found mines, wolves...	informs DPSU about this. Two days of wandering through the forests between Zhytomyr Region and Rivne Region could be his last. The man not only came across a minefield, but also met a pack of wolves. Twice he miraculously did not drown in the swamps, and fierce night frosts could easily turn his adventure into an icy drama. -Don't try to cross the border illegally, especially in the northern direction. This is very dangerous,- the head of one of the border guard units, in whose area the violator was found, commented on the incident. This story could be the plot of an adventure film, if it were not so real and dangerous. Fortunately, thanks to the vigilance of the border guards, everything ended well. However, this case should serve as a lesson to those who take their own safety lightly and think they can circumvent the law. A border is not a place for games, and a minefield is not a backdrop for selfies. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/sam-sobi-rezhyser-yak-ukrayinecz-shukav-prygod-na-kordoni-ale-znajshov-miny-vovkiv-ta-bolota/	2025-02-24T09:42:02-08:00
Infantry, drones, rescue: how Nestor from the Rubizh brigade helps his brothers at the front	The story of the fighter was made public on page 4 of the operational assignment brigade -Rubizh- of NSU. Nestor guarded critical infrastructure facilities for two years, but then decided to join the -Rubizh- Brigade as an infantryman, underwent training and coordination at the training ground, and received his first combat assignment - the defense of frontiers in the village of Stelmakhivka, Luhansk region. However, during missions in combat positions, Nestor became interested in drones, so when the opportunity arose to become a UAV operator, he took it. — I have an acquaintance who went into drone flying, he flies on Heavy shot — these are large shock drones. He said that this is a very interesting and promising direction. When I was in the infantry and watching drones, I knew I wanted to try it, too, he says. Now Nestor is not only a drone operator, but also saves the lives of his brothers as a medic. After serving in the infantry, he well understands the importance of drones for covering Ukrainian positions: — If you are an infantryman, you need support from the sky. When you sit in the landing, you see only the ground. But you need to know what is happening from above. Without drones, the guys cannot cope, so we are constantly working at full capacity. Ahead of the national guard are new challenges and tasks. For those who want to join the army, but hesitate, Nestor advises not to be afraid: - You need to act, because until you test yourself, you will not know. If there is a desire, everything will work out. As reported by ArmyInform, for Andrii, call sign -Cold-, the war began on February 24, 2022. In his peaceful life, he worked in the banking sector, but, like thousands of Ukrainians, he could not stay away. He joined the Territorial Defense Forces, defended Kyiv region, went through the hell of Irpen and Buchi.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/pihota-drony-poryatunok-yak-nestor-z-brygady-rubizh-dopomagaye-pobratymam-na-fronti/	2025-02-24T09:26:59-08:00
Traitors got what they deserved: the court sentenced four militants who fought against Ukraine	informs the SBU about this. Among the convicts there is also a colorful personality - the militant Lee Won Chol, a Ukrainian of Korean origin, known under the pseudonym Herman Prokopiv. Back in 2014, he helped install Russian flags in Luhansk and fought against ATO forces. With the beginning of a full-scale invasion, the traitor did not change his -convictions- and helped the invaders attack Ukrainian cities. However, his -career- ended in 2024 when he was captured by the Defense Forces during the fighting for Spirne in Donetsk. In addition to him, three more traitors who fought on the side of the occupiers in different areas of the Eastern Front were convicted. One of them, a resident of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region, -served- in the 4th motorized rifle brigade of the Russian Federation, where he was involved in the evacuation of wounded Russian soldiers. Another set up firing positions and fortifications for the 7th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the occupiers. Both of them were captured by Ukrainian defenders during the fighting in 2024. The fourth convict is a native of Kharkiv region, who lived in Russia for a long time, where he was mobilized to the 59th tank regiment of the Russian Federation. After a short -training-, he was thrown into an assault on the positions of Ukrainian troops near the village of Terny in Donetsk region, where his unit was destroyed, and he himself was taken prisoner. The court found the perpetrators guilty under four articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: treason, collaborative activity, encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine, and participation in the activities of armed groups not provided for by law. As reported by ArmyInform,The Security Service of Ukraine records a significant activation of Russian special services in conducting information and psychological special operations in Ukraine, in particular, the number of information sabotage aimed at dividing society and artificially spreading protest sentiments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/zradnyky-otrymaly-po-zasluzi-sud-vynis-vyroky-chotyrom-bojovykam-yaki-voyuvaly-proty-ukrayiny/	2025-02-24T09:03:36-08:00
-An educated nation is invincible-: the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces addressed sch...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The lesson, organized by the Apparatus of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, gathered more than 27,000 pupils and students from all over the country. Lieutenant General Anatoliy Barhylevych emphasized the unity of the Ukrainian people in the fight against the aggressor, noting that this is what allowed Ukraine to endure and continue the fight, despite the enemy's superiority in weaponry. He mentioned the successful operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, such as the liberation of Kyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, Kharkiv region and Kherson, stressing that this was possible thanks to the joint efforts of the military and civilians. According to the chief of the General Staff, the losses of the Russian army in 2024 amounted to almost 434 thousand people, and in total for three years of the war - almost 900 thousand. He thanked the pupils and students for their support, recalling that since the first days of the war, they had helped the army in various ways: from direct participation in hostilities to volunteering and the development of new technologies. Lieutenant General Anatoliy Barhylevych emphasized that today the Armed Forces of Ukraine are switching to high-tech systems, and high-quality education is the key to successfully mastering these technologies and creating their own developments. He called on pupils and students to continue their studies, despite the war, because their knowledge is an investment in the country's future. -An educated nation that believes in freedom and loves its country cannot be conquered,- he stressed. As reported by ArmyInform, on the night of February 24, the Defense Forces of Ukraine struck the Ryazan Oil Refinery plant in the Ryazan region, which is involved in the provision of the occupation army of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/osvichena-nacziya-neperemozhna-nachalnyk-genshtabu-zsu-zvernuvsya-do-shkolyariv-ta-studentiv-u-richnyczyu-povnomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya/	2025-02-24T08:54:57-08:00

Every shot is minus the occupier. The Russians now have a new position - -extras in the survival game-. Only survival in this game is not foreseen for them. Drones have turned the war into an intellectual duel, where Ukraine leads the party cold-bloodedly and accurately, and the Russians can only hope for a -gesture of goodwill.- As reported by ArmyInform, the operator of the UAV under the pseudonym -Puma- became a real terror for the Russian military, during its service more than 300 occupants.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/syly-oborony-demonstruyut-yuvelirnu-robotu-fpv-dronamy-kozhen-udar-tochno-v-czil/	2025-02-24T08:38:44-08:00

The hunter for -Alligators-: the fighter -Rubezh- told how he shot down the first Russian Ka-52 over...	Serhiy Falatiuk, a fighter of the 4th brigade of operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Fara-, stands with the portable anti-aircraft missile system -Igla-. In his hands is a chance to change the course of events. The story of the fighter was made public in an interview on the brigade's page. -It was sent over the radio that our aircraft would be operating. I went out to have a look. But I heard the sound of propellers in the sky,- Fara recalls. Ka-52s appeared on the horizon. These are Russian modern attack helicopters. -Then it became clear: with what intention they were flying,- says the fighter. -I took the rocket, launched it on the first one. He gave the command: -Fire at enemy aircraft!-- he recalls. The missile hit a block of unguided missiles, and the Ka-52 made an emergency landing. In a few hours, photos of the downed -Alligator- appeared on the Internet, next to which local residents posed. Later it became known that the commander of the Russian brigade could be on board. He shot down the second -Farah- helicopter without any chance of rescue - it exploded in the air. According to the soldier, the destruction of the Ka-52 prevented the Russian military from quickly landing an amphibious assault. -If we hadn't opened fire, they would have gone in much faster,- he explains. The attack continued. Soldiers of -Rubezh- together with units of the Armed Forces destroyed the enemy, moving between shelters. But the main thing has already happened - the Ukrainian military did not allow the enemy to gain a foothold. -The Pskov landing party was destroyed. Artillery of the 72nd Brigade leveled them to the ground,- the fighter recalls. After Gostomel, -Farah- shot down two more Su-25s, continuing its struggle with Russian aviation. But warfare is changing, and now the main threat is drones. -Russians learn from their mistakes. Their aircraft do not come close, they work from high altitudes,- he explains. That is why Ukrainian forces are switching to new methods of struggle. -We use FPV drones to destroy enemy reconnaissance drones. It's cheaper and more efficient,- Farah says. The Ukrainian army proves that even the most powerful enemy can be defeated not by quantity, but by skill and innovation. For a fighter, the most difficult thing was not the battle itself, but the realization that it was only the beginning. -On the first day of the war, I thought: if only I wouldn't die. Because I understood that it would take a long time,- he says. The story of Fara is the story of those who changed the course of the war. Who did not allow the enemy to capture the capital in a matter of hours. Who became a real nightmare for Russian aviation. As reported by ArmyInform, a story about the first assault of a young border guard with the call sign -Wise-. The guy, who was a cadet just last year, now commands a platoon of border guards of the brigade -Steel border-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/myslyvecz-za-aligatoramy-boyecz-rubezhu-rozpoviv-yak-zbyv-pershi-rosijski-ka-52-nad-gostomelem/	2025-02-24T08:19:26-08:00
UAH 7 million of suspended payments were returned to the military — Ministry of Defense	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Thus, it was established that six servicemen who were undergoing treatment abroad stopped receiving payments due to late submission of documents by the officials of the military unit for conducting a remote medical examination of the VLK. In addition, 46 servicemen did not pass a military medical examination (MCU) for two months and remained at the disposal of the unit commander without finding out the reasons for the lengthy medical examination. This led to a significant reduction in their payments. The Ministry of Defense quickly intervened in the situation - the Central Department for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights sent relevant requests to the military unit, the command of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the military hospital. As a result, the military unit prepared all the necessary documents, which made it possible to conduct remote medical examinations and resume payments. -This situation has become an example of how timely response and control over compliance with laws allows the rights of servicemen to be restored. Thanks to the investigation and interaction with the command, the payment to the military was returned. We will continue to monitor these issues to ensure adequate funding for our defenders. The military should fight, not fight the bureaucracy,- said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhii Melnyk. As of today, according to the Ministry of Defense, 3.9 million hryvnias have already been paid to the military, the rest - almost 3 million hryvnias - will be paid during March.

- Luhansk character - with a machine gun: how children are prepared for war in the occupied Luhansk ...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. The occupiers believe that the involvement of militants in classes will contribute to the development of a -sense of collectivism- in children. Simply put, young Ukrainians are forced to get used to the military presence and ideology of the -Russian world- from an early age. However, -educational- work with children is not limited to lessons and dividing them into groups. Militarization of young men in the -LNR- is also carried out under the guise of -labor training-. The Luhansk Economic and Legal Lyceum has a military-historical class, where students learn information warfare and drone control skills in the -Fundamentals of Homeland Security and Defense- classes. The occupying power has developed a long-term strategy for training personnel for its army in the occupied territories. Children are -zombified- with propaganda from an early age, preparing them for the fact that war is -normal- and service in the army is an -honorable duty.- Of course, one can laugh ironically at this, saying, -what kind of -education- can there be if the -educators- are people armed to the teeth who came to a foreign land to kill and destroy.- But in reality the situation is dire. The Russians want to destroy the identity of Ukrainian children, turning them into obedient soldiers of their army. As reported by ArmyInform, the leader of the so-called lnr launched the regional personnel program -Heroes of Luhansk Region-, which provides that the new the governing elite of the -republic- will be formed from representatives of the Russian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/luganskyj-harakter-z-avtomatom-yak-na-okupovanij-luganshhyni-ditej-gotuyut-do-vijny/	2025-02-24T07:23:53-08:00

Among the objects of sanctions are manufacturers and suppliers of machine tools, electronics and dual-purpose goods for the Russian military, including microprocessors used in weapons systems. They are based in a number of third countries, including Central Asian countries, Turkey, Thailand, India and China, which is the largest supplier of critical goods to the Russian military. North Korean Defense Minister Noh Kwang-chol and other North Korean generals and high-ranking officials involved in the deployment of more than 11,000 North Korean troops in Russia were also sanctioned. The list included 13 Russian citizens and companies, including Grant-Trade LLC, its owner Marat Mustafayev and his sister Dinara Mustafayev, who used the company to supply advanced European technology to Russia to support its illegal war. For the first time, Britain used new powers to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that support the Russian military machine. It is about OJSC -Keremet Bank-, based in Kyrgyzstan. The new sanctions also extend to 40 more -shadow fleet- ships carrying Russian oil. Only in the last six months, these ships together transported more than $5 billion worth of Russian oil and oil products. -We are imposing sanctions on 14 -new kleptocrats-, some of whom are engaged in the creation of strategic sectors of the Russian economy. Among them is Roman Trotsenko, one of the richest people in Russia, whose fortune is 2.2 billion pounds,- the statement said.

-Contract 18-24-: clear term of service, travel abroad and mortgage at 0%	In the previous material, we considered in detail the financial opportunities offered to volunteers. Today we will consider other incentives offered by the state to Ukrainians aged 18 to 24 for a year of service. A contract for Ukrainians aged 18 to 24 is not compulsory. It is only signed on a voluntary basis. And it includes what most servicemen dream of - a clear term of service. The contract is for 1 year. Approximately 2.5 months are allocated to it for training (45 days of general, 2 weeks of professional and up to 14 more days for coordination in the unit). That is, you can try your hand at it. And if you don't like it, leave at the end of the contract. After the contract expires, if the volunteer decides not to stay in the army, he will not be mobilized for 12 months. This will be possible only with their consent. Such volunteers will also be able to travel abroad. For this, you will need a military registration document, as well as a certificate from the military unit, or TCC and SP, which will confirm the completion of service under this contract. Here we are talking about the -eOselya- program, which has been operating for many years. But if in it mortgages are issued at 7% for combatants and 3% for contract servicemen, then for volunteers under the -contract 18-24- project, the interest rate is 0% per annum. Of course, issuing such a mortgage requires some time and effort. But it is unlikely that you can find other options with such conditions. You can read more about this mortgage lending program here One of the conditions of this contract is to participate in hostilities for 6 months. That is, after serving such a contract, the volunteer will receive the status of a participant in hostilities. This status provides a significant number of benefits. One of them is education. In particular, there are options for obtaining higher education at the expense of the state budget - there are quotas that are allocated specifically for beneficiaries. You can read more about it here. In general, Ukrainian legislation provides many benefits for UBD. And although some of them are already somewhat outdated, such as telephone lines or free internet in libraries, there are still a lot of such benefits that work and give you the opportunity to save. These include benefits for travel, utilities and medical care. We have already written about most of them, so you can get acquainted here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/kontrakt-18-24-chitkyj-termin-sluzhby-vyyizd-za-kordon-ta-ipoteka-pid-0/	2025-02-24T06:38:47-08:00
70% die on the way to assaults - the enemy has a huge number of -irrational- losses	Andriy Otchenash, commander of the crew of the Kara nebesna 4th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, said on the Espresso broadcast . According to him, approximately 70-80 percent of all such groups are destroyed on the way to the battle line. Another part is already directly at the storage points. However, it cannot be said that the enemy is acting without success. -Obviously, they will definitely have certain advances of several tens to hundreds of meters with a huge number of assault actions. But if you look at the number of losses among the enemy's personnel, and the amount received, then these are irrational costs that do not bring them any tactical gains,- the commander of the -Kara Nebesna- UAVs told the crew. A large amount of work is currently being done by enemy drones. A large number of fiber-optic drones is especially harmful to the Defense Forces. -Of course, it complicates the work of logistics and the movement of personnel. That is, they try to extinguish all our defense methods with drones and artillery fire as much as possible, and then they try to release the infantry. We see that there is logic in their actions. The enemy does not manage to get any achievements, thanks to the heroism of our fighters,- noted Andriy Otchenash. As ArmyInform reported, in the Pokrovsk direction, the enemy does not abandon its intentions to surround the Defense Forces in the area of ​​the city itself. However, after the counterattacks of the Defense Forces, the enemy somewhat reduced its activity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/70-gynut-dorogoyu-na-shturmy-u-voroga-velychezna-kilkist-neraczionalnyh-vtrat/	2025-02-24T06:31:07-08:00
The GUR reported the details of the explosion in the office of the traitor-border guard	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 24. Podsudevskiy is a traitor to Ukraine, a collaborator, a former high-ranking official of the Border Service of Ukraine who fled to occupied Crimea in 2015. There, for some time, he served the Gauleiter Aksyonov, nicknamed -Goblin- and began cooperation with the Chekists of the so-called -FSB Department for the Republic of Crimea-. Between this administration of the enemy's special service in the temporarily occupied Crimea and another clan of the FSB of the Russian Federation, internal enmity continues over the flow of money in the captured territories of the Zaporizhzhia region. In fact, the explosion in Podsudevsky's office in occupied Primorsk was organized by the Fesbeshniks from Moscow, and it became another manifestation of the grudge between the Chekists for Deriban. In this way, the Fesbeshniks from Lubyanka sent a signal to the collaborator Podsudevsky and his patrons about the need to curb their appetites and be more accommodating to the -elder brother-. The incident with the explosion became known to the top leaders of the FSB, now the Chekists are conducting checks inside the special service. The GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reminds that even humble and diligent service to the occupying power does not guarantee protection from liquidation by greedy Muscovite corruptors. As reported by ArmyInform, a Russian war criminal was eliminated in Berdyansk. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/gur-rozpoviv-podrobyczi-vybuhu-v-kabineti-zradnyka-prykordonnyka/	2025-02-24T06:23:19-08:00

Denmark announced a new package of military aid to Ukraine	This is stated in a message on the site of the Danish government. The money will be used for ammunition for Ukrainian servicemen and the development of the Ukrainian brigade together with the countries of Northern Europe and the Baltic States. Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen said that for three years, Ukrainians fought heroically, defending themselves from the large-scale invasion of Russia. -Putin's military machine carries out brutal attacks on the civilian population, shelling schools and children's hospitals. Russia is responsible for years of deaths and destruction,- she emphasized.

A propagandist who admired the Russian army was exposed in Kharkiv Oblast	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, the unemployed man from Kharkiv was an active participant in anti-Ukrainian Telegram channels, where he left comments in support of the Russian occupiers. He supported the Russian army in every possible way, emphasized its successes and humiliated the Ukrainian defenders. In particular, the propagandist wrote: -I'm a Ukrainian, it's true, but I transferred money to subordinate units of the Russian Federation.- He also claimed that the Russian military has never bombed Ukrainian cities, and that their strikes are aimed only at -reconnaissance targets.- In addition, the resident of Kharkiv admired Putin and praised his actions. In one of his comments, he urged the -second army of the world- not to shell Kyiv, because it is a -Russian city that will still be useful.- As for Kharkiv, the propagandist believed that the Ukrainian authorities should accept Russia's conditions, and then the region would automatically become part of the -brotherly country-. Law enforcement officers exposed a fan of -Russian world-. He faces five to eight years in prison. A pre-trial investigation is currently underway. As reported by ArmyInform, the Kharkiv Court of Appeal confirmed the sentence of a 50-year-old associate professor of one of the Kharkiv vyshiv, who was found guilty of treason and sentenced to 15 years in prison with confiscation of property.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/na-harkivshhyni-vykryto-propagandysta-yakyj-zahoplyuvavsya-rosijskoyu-armiyeyu/	2025-02-24T05:43:55-08:00

A conference was held for dentists of the Defense Forces	It was organized and conducted by the public organization -Dental Front- with the support of the command of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is one of the few events that managed to gather dentists from the security forces during Russia's large-scale aggression against independent Ukraine. As Marianna Bilyk, head of the NGO -Dental Front- noted, the task of the conference is to improve the quality of providing dental care and medical documentation in dentistry, to establish horizontal connections between doctors: -The problem is that when fighters are on the front line not for three months, not for four, but for a year or two, the situation with teeth becomes catastrophic. Teeth cannot regenerate or heal themselves, so specialist intervention is required. And here is the question that with dental caries we have sanitary losses, we actually have a loss of a fighter. The oral cavity is the entrance to the entire body. And when we have problems in the oral cavity, we immediately get problems in the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system suffers, complications also arise, and this is the head, and if the inflammation goes to the brain, it can even be life-threatening. And that is why it is very important here that the planned treatment of dental diseases is carried out. We have to get this process right and we can set an example for the whole world in building dental care, especially on the front line.- Dmytro Samofalov, major of the medical service, head of the advanced surgical department of the military medical clinical center of the Southern region, noted that -this conference is incredibly important, because there is a great need for military personnel in dental care. Our advanced surgical department is located near the contact line in the southern direction, we have a mobile dental office that is seconded to my department, and doctors work every day without a day off. At the same time, these same dentists are actively involved in helping the wounded, because they have quite a lot of facial injuries. We have one dentist and one maxillofacial surgeon, and they provide care for a wide variety of facial injuries, injuries not only to the dental part, but also to the cheekbones, and they are even actively involved in providing care for head injuries, because, in principle, there is no neurosurgeon on the front line in the surgical department.- Senior lieutenant of the medical service Volodymyr, head of the dental office of one of the airborne assault brigades, temporarily acting as the commander of the medical company, said that -such a conference is very important, because practicing dentists should communicate in order to teach each other something. Today, unfortunately, military dentists are isolated from each other. They hardly communicate, well, or infrequently. Every time I changed my location, I tried to find some dentists within a radius of several kilometers or several tens of kilometers to get to know each other. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/vidbulas-konferencziya-dlya-stomatologiv-syl-oborony/	2025-02-24T05:19:10-08:00
February 24 is not a holiday, but a struggle: how SSO operator Price celebrates his birthday in the ...	The story of the fighter was made public on page 73 of the special purpose naval center named after the port captain Antin Holovaty. -He has not celebrated his birthday for several years since he joined the service. Says: -I associate this date not with a holiday, but primarily with war. When it ends, then I will celebrate,- says the message on the center's page. Price joined the Special Operations Forces after a full-scale Russian invasion began. Before that, he had nothing to do with the army, worked abroad and returned to Ukraine on the eve of the invasion. At the time, he thought it was temporary, but the war is still going on. He was the only one of the hundred mobilized cadets who answered -yes- to the question of the recruiter of the 73 center: -Who is not afraid of water?-. Thus began his path to the special purpose group. Together with his comrades, he studied, gained experience and performed tasks on the islands of the Kherson region, in Krynk, where he personally saved several wounded boys. -There are a lot of people in our ranks who, like Price, learned about war after the start of a full-scale invasion. There are also those who have taken up arms against the Russians and their oppressors since 2014. We all have two things in common: love for one's Motherland and hatred for our enemies,- the 73rd center of the SSO notes. February 24, 2022 became the point of no return for many Ukrainians, because they understood that Russia's goal is to seize Ukraine, destroy the unconquered and turn the rest into slaves. But Ukrainians resisted and continue to fight for their freedom. On this day, it is important to honor the memory of everyone who died defending their land, and to support those who continue to fight for every Ukrainian. Price turns 27 today. As reported by ArmyInform, an interesting publication about equipment appeared on the page of the 73 naval center of special purpose named after the basket commander Antin Holovaty operators The device that fighters use for demining attracts special attention.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/24-lyutogo-ne-svyato-a-borotba-yak-operator-sso-prajs-zustrichaye-svij-den-narodzhennya-na-vijni/	2025-02-24T05:09:20-08:00
The President presented the Battle Flag to the 115th Separate Mechanized Brigade	The brigade deserved it in the tough battles with the Russian occupiers. As the head of the communications department of the 115th brigade, Lieutenant Yevhen, told ArmyInform, the brigade was created back in March 2022. Considering the intensity of hostilities, the military leadership made a decision to immediately involve units of the newly formed 115 separate mechanized brigade to repulse the enemy offensive on one of the most difficult directions. For this purpose, the military unit was moved to certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to perform assigned tasks. -Since the beginning of April 2022, units of the 115th separate mechanized brigade were involved in repelling the enemy offensive in the defense zone near the settlement of Severodonetsk, where, despite the enemy's significant superiority in weapons and manpower, they held the defense for almost 2 months - until the end of May 2022. From June to mid-July 2022, the 115th separate mechanized brigade restrained the onslaught of enemy troops near the settlement of Lysychansk,- said Yevhen. -After a short-term recovery, servicemen of the 115th separate mechanized brigade from mid-August to mid-November 2022 performed their assigned combat tasks in the Donetsk region, in the defense zone near the Donetsk airport. After conducting active hostilities in the Donetsk direction, the brigade was withdrawn for recovery. After the restoration of the servicemen of the brigade, they were sent to the Sumy region, where they performed combat tasks related to border protection from January 2023 to May 2023. In the period from June 2023 to August 2023, the 115th separate mechanized brigade took part in active combat operations in the Donetsk region near the settlements of Toretsk and New York, after which it was relocated, and from mid-August 2023 it performed combat missions in the Kharkiv direction near the settlement of Kupyansk. Since 2024, 115 separate mechanized brigades have been performing combat missions in the eastern regions of Ukraine. For the heroism and courage shown in the battles to protect the state sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, fidelity to the Military Oath, 579 servicemen of the brigade were awarded state awards, among them: the Order of -Bohdan Khmelnytskyi- - 19; Order -For Courage- - 336; medal -For military service to Ukraine- - 106; Medal -For Saved Life- - 2; -Defender of the Fatherland- medal - 113; award of the President of Ukraine -For the Defense of Ukraine- — 3. 115 separate mechanized brigade continues to perform combat tasks in the Donetsk region in the fight against the Russian aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/prezydent-vruchyv-bojovyj-prapor-115-okremij-mehanizovanij-brygadi/	2025-02-24T05:01:27-08:00
-Contract 18‒24-: comments of combat brigade recruiters	Recruiters of combat brigades commented to ArmiyaInform about the experimental project of the contract for citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 25 regarding military service. Head of the recruiting department of the headquarters of the 28th separate mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, senior sergeant Denys Shvydky: - I am positive about the project, because it is a transition to contract service. Boys and girls will relieve tension at the front and help those who are fighting from 2022. They will be able to learn from senior fighters. In general, we see only positives in this. We will also be able to show our fellow citizens how much the army has changed since 2022. How much higher quality training has become, how much material support has improved, what are the relations within the military team. I hope that in the future many of those who will sign a one-year contract will decide to continue their military service and choose a military career. Chief of the personnel section of the headquarters of the 13th operational assignment brigade-Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine, Lt. Col. Pavlo Popadynets: - This is a very necessary initiative, because we have many people from 18 to 24 years old who want to serve and who only lacked a push before that. This boost, with the benefits, benefits and security they will have, is extremely important. Based on this, it can be evaluated positively. Unfortunately, this practice does not apply to everyone. This practice applies exclusively to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but not to the Defense Forces as a whole. In particular, it is absent in the National Guard of Ukraine. We are also at war, we also perform combat tasks, and we need this category of citizens. Because these are motivated people, they are those who can defend our state. This practice needs to be scaled up and extended to all the Defense Forces of Ukraine, in particular to the combat brigades of the National Guard of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/kontrakt-18%e2%80%9224-komentari-rekruteriv-bojovyh-brygad/	2025-02-24T04:57:37-08:00
More than 700 representatives of the Criminal Enforcement Service are fighting at the front	Also during the event, the memory of the fallen representatives of the DKVS of Ukraine was honored, who held the line until the last and did not retreat in front of a strong and ruthless enemy. -We honor those who forever became our heavenly guardians. Each hero's story, his fate, is unique. Our job is to preserve these stories. More than 40 of our comrades made their heads, honorably fulfilling their honorable mission as a Soldier and a Citizen,- the Deputy Minister noted. The official noted that the State Criminal Enforcement Service of Ukraine will take responsibility for all those who sacrificed themselves for the sake of the Motherland. And this is the least that can be done for those who defend Ukraine every day. Each family of the fallen defenders whose bravery and sacrifice was honored today in the department, whose history of courage and conscientious service was remembered in general, was given the kind of help they needed. It is very symbolic that the wife of Volodymyr Mirza, the storekeeper of the quartermaster and economic support department of the state institution -Odesa Detention Center-, who died in March 2022 in a fierce battle in the village of Terny in Donetsk region, asked to purchase a named drone for the front-line unit of the DPSU. -Mavik- will bear the name of master sergeant Mirza and will perform combat tasks in the interests of border guards. After all, in recent years a mobilized employee of the pre-trial detention center served in the ranks of the defenders of our borders. The hero's wife, Yana Igorivna, is also an active serviceman of the State Security Service of Ukraine, chief sergeant. She remembers her husband with warmth and gratitude for the years lived in harmony and love. -I asked to buy a Mavik to hand it over to our guys, who fearlessly and bravely fight in the same trenches with the army. This will be the best gift in memory of my husband and his brothers, who gave the most valuable in this war,- said Yana Mirza.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/ponad-700-predstavnykiv-kryminalno-vykonavchoyi-sluzhby-voyuyut-na-fronti/	2025-02-24T04:52:42-08:00

No one in the world believes the Russian lies about our state and our people — the President	The text of the speech was published on February 24 on the President's website. -No one in the world believes Russian lies about our state and our people. And even those who, unfortunately, became an accomplice of Russia in the war, who lie along with it, all of them understand whom and what they support. They can take various steps, they can earn some money from their relations with Russia now, but they will never gain respect,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He thanked the Ukrainian allies. -And our respect now - to Ukrainian men and women, as well as millions of people around the world - our respect to all of you. And to such leaders and peoples as yours. Which have been with us since the beginning. Which helped save thousands of lives. Which help us protect our skies and maintain our positions at the front. Who are building weapons production together with us to fill both our and their arsenals. Who sheltered Ukrainians when it was so necessary. Who are not silent when the world needs to hear what is happening. And who — we really, really appreciate it — support strong diplomacy for the sake of peace,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Ukrainian military chaplains completed a leadership course in Great Britain	This is reported by the Eastern Air Command. Training in foggy Albion was a continuation of the professional training of military chaplains. The program provided for the acquisition of competencies in the basics of spiritual leadership, styles and examples of mentoring, the formation of mutual trust, sustainable motivation and the cohesion of combat-ready teams. -These topics are critical to the work of a military chaplain, as they play a key role in maintaining the military's morale, providing spiritual care and becoming role models,- says Chaplain Stanislav Skorokhod. One of the important elements of the leadership course were field trips to the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, where British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Princes William and Harry of Wales once studied leadership. During training on leadership courses, military chaplains had the opportunity to meet with Ukrainian Ambassador to Great Britain Valery Zaluzhny and other high-ranking officials. As reported by ArmyInform, candidates for the positions of military chaplains will now have six months instead of three to conclude a contract for military service from the moment of receiving the mandate.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/ukrayinski-vijskovi-kapelany-projshly-kurs-liderstva-u-velykij-brytaniyi/	2025-02-24T04:23:32-08:00

-Iron brothers-: how tracked drones help border guards on the front lines	The video of the combat operation of ground drones was published on the DPSU page. Due to their tracked design, ground drones have increased mobility and can overcome difficult terrain. Their capabilities range from demining and evacuating the wounded to delivering ammunition, provisions and other necessary resources to the positions.

- Cold War: the story of a military medic who saved dozens of lives	The story of the fighter was published on page 58 of the separate motorized infantry brigade named after Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky. Later, Andriy became part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and in the summer of 2023 - a serviceman of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Hetman Ivan Vyhovskyi. He studied in Poland and became a combat medic. In fierce battles, he commanded the detachment, was the chief sergeant of the platoon. One of the most vivid memories for him was the evacuation of a wounded comrade near Prechistivka. -We dragged him 80 meters across open terrain, under heavy fire. I still don't know how we managed to cross that field alive,- the fighter recalls. Andriy not only saved lives physically, but also helped his brothers psychologically. -The main thing is your own example. When you see that a fighter is threatening, you stand next to him and start shooting. He sees what to do and returns to the fight,- says the warrior. Andriy learned to overcome his fear, and at some point he realized that he got rid of it altogether. -I stepped over a fallen FPV drone knowing it could explode at any moment. But I didn't care,- the fighter shares. That is why the commander decided to transfer him to another position. During the three years of the war, he lost many comrades, but he remembers everyone. After the victory, the first thing he will do is visit the graves of his fallen friends. Because the real -Cold- is not about the absence of fear, but about memory and devotion.

The EU approved the 16th package of sanctions against Russia: -shadow fleet-, banks and trade	This is stated in the message Council of the EU. -The package affects vital sectors of the Russian economy, further weakening the regime's ability to wage an illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine,- the statement said. Individual lists The Council approved the sanctions list, which includes 48 individuals and 35 organizations responsible for actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. In addition, the Council established two new criteria that will allow the EU to impose restrictive measures on individuals and legal entities that own or operate vessels in Putin's shadow fleet; and those who support or benefit from the Russian military-industrial complex. Shadow fleet One more vessel has been added to the list of vessels that are prohibited from accessing the port and providing a wide range of services related to maritime transport. The measure targets non-EU tankers that are part of Putin's shadow fleet that circumvents the oil price cap mechanism, supports Russia's energy sector, or vessels responsible for transporting military equipment for Russia or stolen Ukrainian grain. In total, 153 vessels are already under sanctions. Finance and Banking For the first time, the EU is introducing a ban on transactions with credit or financial institutions based outside of Russia that use the Central Bank of Russia's Financial Reporting System (SPFS). SPFS is a specialized financial messaging service developed by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to neutralize the effects of restrictive measures. In addition, the Council of the EU decided to extend the ban on the provision of specialized financial messaging services to 13 regional banks, which are considered important for the Russian financial and banking systems. Trade The EU Council also added 53 new entities to the list of those who directly support Russia's military-industrial complex in its war of aggression against Ukraine. They are subject to stricter export restrictions on dual-use goods and technologies, as well as goods and technologies that can contribute to the technological improvement of Russia's defense and security sector. A third of these organizations are Russian, while others are located in third countries (China, including Hong Kong, India, Kazakhstan, Singapore, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan) and have been involved in circumventing trade restrictions or involved in the procurement of goods needed, for example, for UAVs and missiles used for Russian military operations. In addition, today's decision expands the list of prohibited goods that contribute to the technological advancement of Russia's defense and security sector by adding items for the development and production of Russian military systems, such as: chemical precursors for chloropicrin and other anti-riot agents, software related to numerically controlled machines, chromium compounds, and controllers used to control UAVs. In addition, the EU imposed further restrictions on the export of goods that contribute to the increase of Russian industrial potential (chemicals, some plastics and rubber) and their transit through Russia, as well as further restrictions on the import of primary aluminum, which generates significant revenues for Russia. Broadcast ban Today, the Council of the EU decided to suspend the EU broadcasting licenses of eight Russian mass media, which are under the constant control of the Russian leadership, and to ban them from broadcasting their content. These are: EADaily / Eurasia Daily, Fondsk, Lenta, NewsFront, RuBaltic, SouthFront, Strategic Culture Foundation, Krasnaya zvezda/TV Zvezda. These mass media have played an important role in promoting and supporting Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine, as well as in destabilizing neighboring countries, as well as the EU and its member states. Seaports The EU prohibits any transactions with certain listed ports, gateways and airports in Russia that are used to transfer UAVs, missiles and related technology and components to Russia, or to circumvent oil price caps or other restrictive measures by vessels engaged in irregular and high-risk shipping. This includes access to their facilities and the provision of any services to ships and aircraft. Transports In order to ensure the effectiveness of EU restrictive measures aimed at the aviation sector, the Council of the EU decided to extend the ban on flights in the EU to listed air carriers that operate domestic flights within Russia or export aircraft or other aviation goods and technology to Russian air carriers and their controlled entities. In addition, the EU strengthens the current ban on the transportation of goods by road through the territory of the EU, in particular transit, by EU operators that are 25% or more owned by Russian individuals or legal entities. The new provision prohibits any changes in the capital structure of motor vehicle enterprises, which will lead to an increase in the ownership share of a Russian natural or legal entity by more than 25%. Energy The package agreed today imposes additional restrictions on the export of goods and technologies, including software related to oil and gas exploration, with the aim of further limiting Russia's exploration and production capacity. In addition, it extends the ban on the provision of goods, technology and services for the completion of crude oil projects in Russia, such as the Vostok oil project, similar to the completion of LNG projects currently in operation. The Council of the EU also prohibits the temporary storage of Russian crude oil and petroleum products on the territory of the EU, regardless of the purchase price of the oil and the final destination of these products. Other The EU bans the provision of construction services, including engineering, extending an approach already in place in illegally occupied parts of Ukraine. To combat the illegal re-export of EU goods subject to sanctions, EU operators selling sensitive goods to third countries other than partner countries should implement due diligence mechanisms capable of identifying, assessing and mitigating the risks of such re-exports to Russia. The Commission will help business entities to facilitate their compliance with the requirements, in particular with respect to these requirements. Belarus Today's package includes further restrictive measures against Belarus that reflect trade-related sanctions agreed against the Russian Federation, as well as other measures such as restrictions on the sale or provision of services and software, deposits and wallets of cryptocurrency assets, and transportation. In addition, the Council of the EU introduced a new listing criterion aimed at individuals, organizations or bodies that support or benefit from the military-industrial complex of Belarus. Crimea and Sevastopol, as well as some non-government-controlled territories of Ukraine Today, the Council of the EU introduced new restrictions in Crimea and Sevastopol, as well as in non-government-controlled territories of Ukraine in the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions with the aim of preventing their integration into the Russian Federation and preventing the circumvention of EU sanctions. As ArmyInform reported, the Australian government introduced additional targeted financial sanctions and an entry ban for 70 individuals, as well as targeted financial sanctions for 79 legal entities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/yes-zatverdyv-16-j-paket-sankczij-proty-rosiyi-tinovyj-flot-banky-i-torgivlya/	2025-02-24T00:59:07-08:00

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces wrote about this on his page. -Today, February 24, marks three years since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine. This was a new stage of the war for Independence, which Russia unleashed against our country in these same February days 11 years ago,- noted Oleksandr Syrskyi. He reminded that the world did not believe that we would stand, but the Ukrainian people decently resisted the enemy's blows. -We defeated the Russian offensive group, pushed back the invaders from Kyiv, liberated the north of Ukraine, Kharkiv Oblast and Kherson. The Defense Forces of Ukraine returned more than 50% of the territory occupied by the Russians after February 24, 2022, conducted a number of effective defensive and offensive operations.- According to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, our ability to act asymmetrically is one of the defining features of this war.

She prevented an enemy attack on Sumy region and Kharkiv region. -For the first time in 11 years, we have moved large-scale military operations to enemy territory and continue to hold hundreds of square kilometers of Kurshchyna,- Oleksandr Syrskyi recalled. Advancement in the east comes at a high cost to the occupiers. Over the course of three years, the enemy lost almost 870,000 soldiers and officers (of which 250,000 were irreversible Russian losses), more than 10,100 tanks, 21.1 thousand armored fighting vehicles, 23.3 thousand art system And this list of enemy casualties can be continued. -We also hit the enemy deep into his territory with Deep Strike means. We are systematically destroying weapons depots, airfields, military and fuel enterprises in the Russian Federation, depriving the aggressor of resources to continue the war. How to evaluate our results? Compare them with the enemy's plans. Kyiv, which the Russians sought to conquer -in three days-, is still standing three years later. In 2022, the aggressor wanted to cut us off from the sea, was preparing an amphibious landing near Odessa. And today, the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation actually ceased to exist - we drove its remains into the bays of Novorossiysk. With the support of Western partners and our own efforts, we are strengthening our defense capabilities, while continuing the defense operation, we are reorganizing the Armed Forces to increase their effectiveness. Ukrainian engineers and IT specialists wrote a new page in the history of military art. This war was the first where drones played a key role, and we were the first in the world to create an Unmanned Systems Force. With their skills and resilience, our soldiers hold back the enemy, who exceeds us in numbers and resources. I am proud of everyone who defends our country! I am honored to be the Commander-in-Chief of such soldiers at such a time. My sincere thanks to the citizens of Ukraine who support the Defense Forces by donation or volunteering. Together with you, we are proving to the whole world what Ukrainian unity is. And the fact that the main ally of the Ukrainian people is its Armed Forces. I sincerely thank our partners and allies who support the struggle of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for independence in the eastern outpost of the free world. On this day, I want to remember all those who gave their lives for the freedom of Ukraine. Eternal memory and glory to them! A low bow to every Ukrainian family that lost a son or father, daughter or mother, brother or sister in the war with the Russian invaders. We will avenge them. The Ukrainian people survived two world wars, collectivization, the Holodomor, occupations and repressions only during the 20th century...

He fought for DAP and blew up the bridge in Shchasta: the broken story of the Hero of Ukraine Oleg M...	Hero of Ukraine Oleg Moroz could share this and retell it in detail. But a few months after this risky operation, the soldier died. 29 years forever. Oleg Moroz is from Mykolaiv. He served in the 79th separate airborne assault brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He was the chief sergeant of the engineering and sapper platoon. A contract worker of the Armed Forces since 2013 - that's when he decided to become a paratrooper. Strong and strong, in love with sports: he adored weightlifting and strength exercises. He took part in the war since 2014. On his account is the release of Lyman from the Russians in the spring of 2014. And already in the summer of 2014, Oleg's department also took part in battles at the famous Bravo height. Next was Donetsk airport. During these battles, Moroz was seriously wounded by a shot from an enemy tank. Doctors saved his leg, after long rehabilitation he stubbornly returned to the army. With a full-scale Russian invasion, Moroz's unit was in the East. Oleg's brother-in-law tells why the platoon chief sergeant received the Gold Star of the Hero of Ukraine. He blew up the bridge in Shchasta - the operation was risky and successful, for which he received the title of Hero of Ukraine. -We went with Oleg to the Shchastyn bridge - there was a command to blow it up. The main charge did not work for us because the lines were cut. And then the commanders made a decision to take the Ural car, put explosives in the car, and it had to go to the bridge. Oleg himself volunteered to drive the car to the bridge. He prepared everything, and under heavy enemy artillery fire drove this car onto the bridge. Returned to a safe distance to shelter and blew up the bridge. For this operation, he received the title of Hero of Ukraine,- said a soldier of the 79th Brigade who served with Oleg. Another colleague from Moroz's unit remembers his fallen brother like this: -When we went on a mission, I felt calmer with him. I trusted him. He never refused anyone anything, he shared his knowledge like a sapper was a professional in his field. It was much easier with Oleg, he was a very positive person. Experienced and professional, looked at things from his angle. When we went on a combat mission, he was very worried about us. He wanted us to take everything seriously.- Then there was a continuation of combat missions. The unit moved from Luhansk region to Donetsk region. On June 10, 2022, Oleg died in the battle near Sloviansk. Two days after his birthday, June 8. Survived by parents and sister. On June 24, 2022, he was buried in Lviv at the Lychakiv cemetery. On July 1, 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Order -For Courage- III degree. He also received the rank of chief sergeant posthumously.

Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the bodies of 757 fallen Ukrainian soldiers were returned to Ukraine as a result of the repatriation measures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/u-koordshtabi-nazvaly-kilkist-zvilnenyh-z-polonu-ta-repatrijovanyh-za-try-roky-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya/	2025-02-23T20:36:14-08:00
Silence, invisibility and modularity: the British presented a new tactical vehicle for special force...	The Pioneer X's most exciting feature is a claimed range of 7,000 km, which can be achieved with a 60 kW multi-fuel or hydrogen generator and four batteries that provide up to 80 km of silent driving using only the vehicle's electric motors and batteries. -The generator can run on any heavy fuel, such as diesel, even vegetable oil,- Ben Scott-Geddes, technical director of Fering, comments on his project. The motors and battery are supported by a multi-fuel generator that increases the vehicle's range and is powered by a 470 liter fuel tank. The generator also provides external power for other systems such as UAVs, combat control systems and radios. It can even be used to charge electric off-road motorcycles and other vehicle-borne platforms. The Pioneer X is powered by two electric motors, one on each axle, providing a total of 600Nm of torque. The battery chemistry is -Lithium Titanate Oxide-, which is commonly used in marine installations. The vehicle is equipped with four batteries that are charged by the generator. The construction uses aluminum and carbon fiber to reduce weight. Overall length of -Pioneer- is 5526 mm, width - 2000 mm, height - 1974 mm in standard suspension position with ground clearance of 435 mm. When driving off-road, the ground clearance can be increased to 800 mm, when driving on roads with a hard surface, it can be reduced to 300 mm. High passability is achieved through the use of wheel reducers and 22.5-inch cargo wheels, -shod- in high-profile tires. The developers claim that the Pioneer will be able to climb a 60 percent slope and move over an obstacle up to half a meter high. Additional Claimed Performance: The Pioneer's claimed curb weight, as noted above, is just over 1.5t and payload is also 1.5t. In the form of an option, a three-axle modification with additional usable area and greater load capacity will be offered. Instead of a biodiesel diesel engine, any other motor can be used as a generator, including a hydrogen electrochemical generator. The price of the Pioneer, and a civilian version for extremes has also been released, will be about 150,000 pounds (about $184.7) and will depend heavily on the specific configuration: on the one hand, it is a car for special forces and special services, on the other - an SUV for traveling around the world. Saturating the army with such vehicles with a long range and minimal costs for logistics operations in long-range special forces missions is extremely important. A sequential hybrid, with a multi-fuel diesel, with a full electric drive, the ability to increase ground clearance and the ability to provide -trench 220 V- is a clear consideration of the combat experience of current wars. A fairly light platform with excellent mobility, the ability to charge and scout e-bikes, and all the equipment, communication, drones, tools. For the tactics of small groups, the machine is almost perfect. And this tactic is quite effective for many combat options. Possibly the best expedition vehicle for special forces today: Fering Pioneer X.

Third anniversary of the large-scale invasion: ArmyInform about the main events	Three years have passed since the beginning of the full-scale aggressive war that the Russian Federation unleashed and is waging against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in gross violation of the norms of international law, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. In fact, the Russian-Ukrainian war has been going on for eleven years, over 4,000 days, since February 2014, from the first acts of armed aggression against civilians in the center of the Ukrainian capital and the first recorded crossing of the state border of Ukraine by Russian armed forces through the Kerch Strait on February 20, 2014. For eight years, the Armed Forces of Ukraine together with numerous volunteer formations effectively restrained this attack, stopping the advance of the Moscow invaders and liberating most of the territories captured by them at that time. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the city of Sevastopol, and part of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions remained occupied. On February 24, 2022, everything changed. the Russian Federation launched an offensive at once from several directions: northern (Kyiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions), eastern (Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv) and southern (from the occupied Crimea to Kherson — Mykolaiv — Zaporizhzhia — Mariupol).

-20 thousand mythical fugitives-: The fiction of the Russian Federation crashed against strict facts	Russian propagandists, not having time to properly recover from the story with -war mosquitoes- and -Ukrainian biolaboratories-, decided to launch another narrative: they say, Ukrainian military -fled- en masse for rehabilitation across the border, using forged documents. The figure of 20,000 appears to be the classic propagandist method of taking a number from the ceiling, flipping a coin to determine whether it is -Nazis-, -deserters- or -corruptors- and presenting it as -incriminating material-. In fact, there are rehabilitation programs for Ukrainian military personnel in Europe. But they are official, under the control of state authorities and international partners. The number of Ukrainian servicemen undergoing treatment and rehabilitation abroad is much smaller and has nothing to do with -mass escape- schemes. As for the -corrupt component-, Russia, which is building its army on bribes, kickbacks and -smearing so as not to be sent to the front-, decided to project its own realities onto Ukraine. I just forgot that our military is people who fight for their country, not for the opportunity to -move away-. Such disinformation has a clear goal of undermining confidence in the Ukrainian army and discrediting partners who help our wounded soldiers. After all, if you follow the -logic- of Russian propagandists, then all international missions are -corruption projects-, and any help to Ukrainians is -conspiracies of the West-. The truth is that while the Kremlin is inventing -20,000 corrupt people-, real Russian soldiers are treated at best with improvised means in the trenches, and at worst never return home. And it's not a fake anymore. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/24/20-tysyach-mifichnyh-vtikachiv-vygadka-rf-rozbylas-ob-suvori-fakty/	2025-02-23T20:05:06-08:00

Your house will not be demolished now: the occupiers are nationalizing the abandoned dwelling	This was reported by the head of Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. According to him, the occupiers are acting according to the legislative norms of the Russian Federation, which allow property to be recognized as ownerless if the owner has not declared his rights within a certain period. In many cases, people did not even know that they needed to make such a statement. Many appeals against similar decisions have already accumulated. The list of -nobody's- property includes not only the homes of evacuees, but also the homes of those who simply live at another address or in a neighboring city. In some cases, people find out about the -nationalization- of their apartments when new -owners- are discovered there. In this way, the occupation authorities continue to demonstrate their attitude towards basic human rights: your home is no longer yours if you leave it for your own life. As reported by ArmyInform, there is an acute shortage of qualified personnel in the temporarily occupied territories of the Luhansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/vasha-hata-teper-ne-skrayu-okupanty-naczionalizuyut-pokynute-zhytlo/	2025-02-23T10:05:13-08:00

The father, Vasyl Yosypovych, was the first to join the army voluntarily, having just learned about the start of a full-scale invasion. On February 25, 2022, he was already in the ranks of the brigade. -In civilian life, I was a sole farmer. I had a horse, a tractor, a combine harvester - cultivated 15 hectares of land, - says Mr. Vasyl, - But when I learned about the -great war-, I immediately understood - I had to leave the farm and devote myself to the defense of the Motherland. Because when the orcs come to my native Volhynia, it will be too late. In the summer of last year, the son Serhiy took an example from his father. The young man worked as a long-distance truck driver, constantly traveling abroad. But when the time came to join the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, even a thought should not have evaded the fulfillment of the constitutional duty. -Of course, my father helped me adapt to the army faster. And later, all my siblings became family to me - my boys and I are now like one family,- Serhii admits. At home in Volyn, father and son are waiting for their wife, two daughters, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. One of the most dramatic memories of the war for father and son is the wounding of Serhii: -They had time to report that I was the -three hundredth- to the command post - and then the communication was cut off. Later, they said that for the next three hours, my father simply couldn't find a place for himself due to the unknown, - says -Grey-, - My lip was torn, my head was bandaged - it was extremely difficult to speak. However, I constantly tried to -explain- to the boys - they said, contact dad so that he does not worry.

President: There will be an opportunity to use the 18-24 contract for the previously mobilized	President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this at a press conference on Sunday. -I asked to deal with the moment when boys aged 18-24 left since the beginning of the war as volunteers, and they were not given a contract. They will deal with it, they promised me,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He noted that separate teams are currently involved in the project, which have a specific platform for proper training. -I'm not saying that others don't have it, it was the military's choice. We agreed that it would last for two months. After that, I'm sure we'll solve 18-24 for everyone. Other brigades will be opened. We will solve this issue,- added the head of state. As reported by ArmyInform, 72 separate mechanized brigades named after the Black Zaporozhets already have the first contract workers under the new project Ministry of Defense.

This ground drone, purchased with the funds of the Norwegian charitable foundation HMM Helsehjelp Ukraina, is intended to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders on the battlefield. -Volya-E- is a real breakthrough in military medicine.

The footage shows how a Russian soldier, allegedly -punishing- his brother, ties him to a tree right on the battlefield. According to information from radio intercepts, the occupiers call it a -babe yagye victim- - that's what they call Ukrainian heavy strike drones. This cynical act shows that the Russian military not only does not value the lives of its soldiers, but also uses them as -human shields- against Ukrainian drones. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian invaders tried to hide from the Ukrainian military underground, but thanks to the aerial reconnaissance work of the Defense Forces they were discovered and destroyed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/zhertva-babye-yagye-rosijski-soldaty-pryvyazuyut-svoyih-pobratymiv-do-derev-na-poli-boyu/	2025-02-23T04:06:57-08:00

Next, combat -birds- of the command and artillery reconnaissance battery (BUAR, Flint crew) go into the attack. They destroy an enemy car hidden in the forest and destroy the occupants' cube in the captured house. Finally, the crews of the -Sarmat- group of the self-propelled artillery division of the -Acacia- howitzers first hit the shelter of the Rashists who had just entered there. And then, in another position, they give a killer -like- to the Russian -artists- who trampled a huge self-portrait on the snow. As reported by ArmyInform, in the dark they silently sneak up to the target, bringing death to the occupants. Heavy bombers, universal Maviks and maneuverable FPV drones are the arsenal of unmanned forces of the 3rd separate tank Iron Brigade, which turns the invaders' positions into hell around the clock.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/za-vita-i-za-ukrayinu-drony-zaliznoyi-brygady-znyshhuyut-okupantiv-na-harkivshhyni/	2025-02-23T03:54:26-08:00

Father and Son at War: The Story of Two Generations of Defense Forces Soldiers	The story of the fighters was made public on page 128 of the separate Transcarpathian mountain assault brigade. Dmytro's first unit was radio engineering troops, but a year later he was transferred to the 128th separate mountain assault brigade. After the first contract, he returned to civilian life, but lasted only a year and eight months - and was again in the army. In May 2022, his regular contract ended, but due to the full-scale war, he continued his service. Dmytro serves as a driver and over the years of the war managed to master various types of transport, from volunteer pickups to American Humvees and trophy Russian Urals. He well remembers the first combat contact in Zaporozhye: the enemy surrounded the village, and his tanks approached almost silently through rubberized -goosebumps-. Then two of Dmytro's comrades were killed under enemy fire, and the unit had to fight its way back more than 40 kilometers. Dmitry's father is 52 years old. He once served as a conscript in the Soviet army, and before the war he worked as a combine harvester. For many years he insisted that he wanted to mobilize, but Dmytro dissuaded him. In the end, the father could not stand it and joined his son's unit. Currently, he serves in the same battalion, repairs equipment. Due to constant combat missions, they and their son cannot see each other every day, but they are always in touch. According to Dmitry, the most difficult thing is to know that a loved one is also on the front line. Dmytro's mother had a hard time surviving his father's decision to join the Armed Forces. She stayed at home with her youngest son, who is only 12 years old. Dmitri and her father try to calm her down, although they know that each of their calls to her is a moment of relief, but also of anxiety. A girl is waiting for Dmytro at home. If it were not for the war, he would probably be married by now. But for now, personal life is on hold. New battles, new challenges ahead. And the main thing is the belief in victory and the return home with the whole family. As reported by ArmyInform, on the front lines of the Russian-Ukrainian war, 25-year-old Nazar, chief sergeant of the 128th UAV platoon of a separate mountain assault brigade, performs combat tasks every day. Its main weapon is FPV drones, which destroy enemy positions, disrupt enemy logistics chains and inflict heavy casualties on the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/batko-j-syn-na-vijni-istoriya-dvoh-pokolin-bijcziv-syl-oborony/	2025-02-23T02:07:24-08:00

In the course of the battle, Ukrainian defenders eliminated five occupiers and captured one. The detainee said that he came to Saratov to get an education, but the Russian reality made its adjustments: he was mobilized and sent to fight for the Kremlin's imperial ambitions. The man was not too delighted with such a career turn, and even less with the combat reality, which ended for him in Ukrainian captivity. Despite everything, the Ukrainian military provided him with the necessary medical care, fed and watered him. Grateful for his life, the African thanked his rescuers sincerely. Further, his case will be dealt with by relevant services.

The occupiers in Luhansk region taxed even toilets with foundations: -Corrections,- they say	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. According to him, the occupation authorities introduced a tax on baths, barns, greenhouses and other commercial buildings, if they have a foundation. The tax amount will depend on the cadastral value of the object. -The invaders note that this was done to -adjust the tax burden on objects that were previously outside the scope of property taxation,- Artem Lysogor noted. The occupiers explain their decision by -concern- about replenishing the budget and -fair- distribution of the tax burden. However, the local population is unlikely to appreciate such -generosity- of the invaders, especially considering the fact that many have lost their homes and property due to the war.

At sea, where Ukraine is defeating the enemy, thanks to the Maritime Capability Coalition, the supply of the Defense Forces of Ukraine with the necessary naval weapons is constantly increasing. A lot has been done within the borders of the maritime coalition and new measures are being planned to promote the defense of Ukraine at sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/agresor-trymaye-raketonosij-u-chornomu-mori-ye-zagroza-udaru-3/	2025-02-22T21:09:34-08:00
Maritime coalition: how the West is arming Ukraine for war at sea.	At the same time, it is important to understand to what extent Ukraine is equipped with the necessary forces and means to defeat the enemy at sea and liberate Crimea? What is the role of the Maritime Capability Coalition in this? How and in what volumes is foreign aid provided to develop the capabilities of the Defense Forces of Ukraine to carry out tasks at sea? Military expert, retired captain 1st rank, candidate of military sciences, associate professor Stepan Yakymyak told ArmiyaInform about this and other important issues in the activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. — Ukraine, according to leading foreign and domestic experts, is defeating the enemy at sea, has pushed its main forces to the eastern part of the Black Sea. However, for the development of success, it is necessary to build up forces and means, including taking into account the help of foreign states and the created coalitions. What are the main results of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities and how do they affect actions at sea? - Everyone knows that foreign aid plays a very important role in the defense of Ukraine in the war with the Russian Federation, in particular at sea. The acquisition of Harpoon missile systems, other means, and intelligence at the beginning of the Russian Federation's large-scale military invasion of Ukraine ensured the stability of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, increased strike capabilities, and the ability to effectively counter the enemy. However, since December 2023, since the formation of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities on the initiative of Great Britain and Norway, the development of the maritime capabilities of the Defense Forces of Ukraine has become systematic and planned. According to the results of the first year of the coalition, the commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during a meeting with partners on December 11, 2024 stated that it significantly contributed to the achievement of the main goals in the war at sea. Thus, during 2024, the safety of navigation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea was ensured, the export of Ukrainian products by sea was restored, and the enemy was forced to withdraw forces from Crimea to the eastern part of the sea. In 2025, it is expected that the efficiency of the foreign road will increase, because the activity of planning the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and their provision, taking into account foreign resources, is improving. The achieved level of purposefulness in the functioning of the coalitions, in particular the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, is confirmed by the adoption of the road maps of the coalitions during the meeting of the contact group on defense issues of Ukraine on January 9, 2025. — How powerful is the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities and what areas of its activity are identified as priorities for 2025? — The Maritime Coalition is one of the most powerful among the eight currently existing coalitions to support the defense of Ukraine. It unites 19 states, twelve of which have already officially signed the instrument of accession. The following countries are known to be operating within the coalition of maritime capabilities: Great Britain, Norway, Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, the USA, France, Sweden, Portugal, Poland, Romania and Turkey. In addition, several states (Canada, Iceland, Finland) provide their means to build up Ukraine's naval capabilities, but do not join the coalition. Also, several countries, including Australia and Japan, are studying possible areas of cooperation with the coalition. Note that, in addition to the Coalition of Naval Capabilities, the following coalitions are currently functioning: aviation, integrated air and missile defense, artillery, armored vehicles and maneuverability, drones, information technologies, demining. In addition, it is possible that the number of coalitions will increase, because on December 6, 2024, Ukrainian-French associations appealed to the President of France regarding the creation of a coalition of military instructors in Ukraine. The largest today remains the demining coalition, which includes twenty-one countries. The priorities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities are determined by the nature of operations at sea and the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. At the moment, the primary task is, of course, to build up the strike capabilities necessary for the task of defeating those enemy forces that operate most effectively on and from the sea. The importance of the development of strike capabilities was emphasized by the commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during a meeting with foreign coalition partners in December 2024. In addition, the capabilities necessary to protect ports and the created -sea corridor- have been prioritized. It is quite obvious that the specified priorities are determined on the basis of their importance for Ukraine in the war with the Russian Federation. After all, successful defense of the state at sea and from the sea is impossible without destroying the enemy's capabilities. At the same time, the protection of maritime exports is critical to building up Ukraine's economic capabilities in the war. When considering the priorities of the maritime coalition for 2025, it is advisable to take into account another important and particularly relevant factor today - the formation of a security package of forces and means of conditions for the start of peace negotiations. In the event of a cessation of hostilities everywhere, including at sea, there will be a need for the formation of capabilities to contain the Russian Federation and countermeasures in the event of a repeated Russian attack on Ukraine. Are and what kind of naval capabilities are necessary for this? The answer to this question is relevant in the activities of the leadership of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the leadership of the national navy and the leadership of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities already now. - How effectively and systematically, in your opinion, does the international Coalition of Maritime Capabilities operate in today's conditions? - You touched on a very important aspect in your question! The fact is that in the conditions when the war becomes long-term, it is precisely the comprehensively formed and implemented measures that ensure stability and the necessary result. In view of this, it is important to what extent the coalition's capability development strategy takes into account medium- and long-term projections of changes in the environment. The answer to the question can be found in the report on the results of the meeting of the leadership of the maritime coalition, which took place at the end of 2024. As it was emphasized, the road map of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities is formed for the period until 2035. This proves that the naval coalition is working with the long-term goals of the development of the national military fleet in mind. Therefore, the activity of the maritime coalition has a high level of validity, systematicity and consistency. This is a considerable advantage, and perhaps the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities is the leader among all coalitions in this indicator. This positive experience can be used by other coalitions. - How can you assess the pace and scope of activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities at the present time? - Since the creation of the maritime coalition in December 2023, the planned activities have been implemented at a fairly high pace. And could it be otherwise in the conditions when hostilities are intensifying, gaining scale and ferocity? To the credit of our partners, they not only work proactively, but also sometimes anticipate the emerging situation. They use a strategic and far-sighted approach to cooperation and assistance to Ukraine. On the other hand, it is clear that each state has its own characteristics and a certain bureaucracy. However, it should be emphasized that the current pace of cooperation within all coalitions is impressive in terms of dynamics and coverage of Ukraine's defense issues! Regarding the amount of aid provided by coalitions, of course, each state is guided by its capabilities. Within the borders of the Coalition of Naval Capabilities, the creation (procurement), supply and maintenance of a significant number of samples of naval weapons and military equipment is carried out. Examples of the provision of coastal anti-ship missile systems and Harpoon missiles to the members of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, at least more than 70 combat boats, of which the SV90 type boats are the most powerful in terms of combat potential, and dozens of marine robotic complexes of various purposes can testify to the volume of the provided weapons. In general, according to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, within the borders of the maritime coalition, Ukraine receives: ships, boats, naval strike weapons, surveillance and intelligence equipment, anti-mine systems, and others. Technical support for the operation and deployment of assets, strengthening of amphibious capabilities, training of crews and system operators, training of marines and flotilla personnel is also carried out. In order to increase mine countermeasures, the Netherlands and Belgium will provide three Alkmaar-type mine countermeasures ships, which, together with the two minesweepers already received from Great Britain, will form the basis of a mine countermeasures joint to combat the mine danger in the Black Sea after the end of hostilities. A naval training center has been established in Romania to train marines. —What else can be expected from the naval coalition? In your opinion, which projects in the activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities are the most significant and promising? — In the near future, within the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, a significant increase in dynamics is expected to provide Ukraine with the latest means of combat at sea. It is enough to recall the statement of the leader of the coalition - Great Britain on October 22, 2024, in which the provision of 120 million pounds sterling (150 million US dollars) was announced. In addition, it was stated that Great Britain together with Norway plan to find an additional 100 million pounds to finance the coalition. The United Kingdom is also working to find resources to co-finance the delivery of hundreds of unmanned maritime vehicles and other equipment to the forces protecting the Ukrainian maritime grain corridor. It is possible that it is about unmanned surface complexes of the Snapper (-Perch-) and Wasp (-Wasp-) type, which were mentioned in his speech on January 29, 2025 by the British Defense Minister John Healy. In the context of promising projects, it will be appropriate to mention that, according to the information of the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain, on January 22, 2025, a meeting of potential manufacturers was to be held in London regarding the creation of a small unmanned combat ship (boat) under the COOKSON project. It is assumed that it will be a multi-purpose stealthy high-speed marine platform that can be a carrier of anti-ship missiles and be transported by land transport. Here it should be recalled that as early as 2021, an agreement was signed on the construction of eight missile boats by Great Britain for Ukraine. If we are talking about this variant of the implementation of this agreement, then we can expect another revolution in military affairs at sea! After all, robotic flotillas with powerful missile weapons and drones on board can radically change the course of not only any future war at sea. They can provide a decisive advantage to one of the parties in the resolution of the most crises and conflicts between the world's leading powers in any part of the world ocean or on any of the continents. - Tell me, in your opinion, what other directions and measures of joint activity within the borders of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities could ensure increased efficiency in achieving its goals? Sharing with partners such experiences definitely happens. Exchange rates are increasing. For example, on February 17, 2025, the first joint structure of Ukraine and NATO - the Joint Analysis, Training and Education Center (JATEC) - officially began functioning in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz. One of the important functions of the center is to organize the exchange of war experiences. In view of the above, it would be very appropriate to have a separate package of activities for the joint study of the experience of warfare at sea among the priorities of the Maritime Capability Coalition. Within the limits of this package, it would also be useful to provide for the conduct of exploratory naval games and the development of scenarios for future actions at sea. Such work with the use of brainstorming methods is a productive means of developing effective strategies to fight the enemy and ensure victory at sea. In addition, thanks to these measures, our foreign partners would get more motivation to work together and increase interoperability with the armed forces of NATO member states. - What areas of activity of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, in your opinion, could be expanded in view of the growing interdependence of the security of Ukraine, the countries of Eastern Europe and other states in the context of the hybrid war unleashed by Russia in different parts of the world? Common threats require a common response. So it is obvious that already today and in the future, the leading manufacturers of naval weapons could, in cooperation with the Coalition of Naval Capabilities, expand the arsenal of combat capabilities not only of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also of the defense structures of their countries. In view of the priority directions for the development of capabilities in the ongoing war on the Black Sea, it would be rational to involve the world's leading developers of naval weapons in these directions. Thus, the Norwegian company KDA (Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace), which is a developer of NSM (Naval Strike Missile) and one of the flagships of this industry, could make a significant contribution to the development of strike capabilities. In the context of the development of underwater technologies and systems, it would be appropriate to involve the French company Naval Group, as well as the American Raytheon and the British Kraken Technology Group. The development of naval mine weapons could be facilitated by RWM Italia S.p.A., and the development of automated control systems for combat platforms by Germany's Atlas Elektronik. All the above companies and other leading manufacturers of forward-looking weapons would be very interested in testing their latest developments in the Black Sea and together with the Ukrainians create innovative technologies necessary for victories at sea. — How do you assess the effectiveness of work on the organization of the activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities? — As is known, in April 2024, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine established the Coalition Support Office in order to improve the coordination of actions in working with partners. One of the important functions of this structure is also the planning of work within each of the coalitions. Therefore, we should expect a balancing of the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and the resources that can be provided by foreign partners. At the same time, during the improvement of the activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, one of the promising directions, as can be seen, is the clarification of the goals and tasks of international cooperation, taking into account the ones already concluded by Ukraine in 2023-2024. security agreements with a number of foreign countries. Based on the goals and measures laid down in the agreements, it is possible to focus the attention of partners on the resources most expected by Ukraine. It is also important to emphasize the order of distribution of resources accumulated by the coalition. It is advisable to prioritize spending on short-term projects. After all, the absolute priority is the protection of the independence of Ukraine already now, in the conditions of the ongoing war. According to experts, in this context, the ratio in the allocation of measures and costs in the provision of assistance by other states can be: measures to ensure actions now and victory in the war - 70-95%, for medium-term and long-term projects - 5-30%. Under such conditions, we can count on focusing our efforts on the main task of repelling aggression and protecting Ukraine's national interests at sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/morska-koalicziya-yak-zahid-ozbroyuye-ukrayinu-dlya-vijny-na-mori/	2025-02-22T20:56:09-08:00
Hot air balloonists return to the military: a payload delivery system launched from a balloon was in...	As stated on the official portal of this Canadian company located in the province of Alberta, this innovative system called Eagle (translated from English as -eagle-) is the world's first high-altitude military glider launched with the help of a balloon, ArmyInform reports. -The Eagle system combines stealth, versatility and high performance for modern military operations,- its creators emphasize. According to technical specifications, the advanced payload delivery system is capable of reaching stratospheric heights. The Eagle is designed to deliver -precise payloads hundreds of miles- regardless of operational complexity. Recent tests have confirmed its performance in extreme environmental conditions, -underscoring its reliability and ability to adapt to harsh real-world scenarios,- according to analysts of the Dutch defense research portal Army Recognition. It is worth recalling that the stratosphere is the second layer of the Earth's atmosphere located above the troposphere. It begins at an altitude of about 8-20 kilometers from the surface and extends to an altitude of about 50 kilometers. According to Defense Industry Europe's publication, the Eagle APDS was designed to -reimagine high-altitude, long-range military aerospace capabilities.- Its innovative variable airfoil provides a smooth transition between supersonic speeds and low barrage speeds, guaranteeing adaptability to different tasks. The system allows you to combine the possibility of both controlled operators and fully autonomous flights. -The key point in the Eagle's design is its stealth and survivability. With a minimal radar signature and resistance to EW equipment interference, the complex can operate deep in the enemy's rear,- the portal clarifies. If we delve into the history of aeronautics, in 1783 the brothers Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier raised a balloon to a height of more than 1,000 meters. This was the first public demonstration of a balloon. The French scientist-physicist Jacques Alexandre César Charles also worked on the creation of an airship. In 1783, he made a ball, which he filled with hydrogen gas. Depending on the different ways of filling the balloons, they received different names. The spheres filled with warm air were called -montgolfiers- and those filled with hydrogen were called -charliers-. The first -Charlier- was launched from the Field of Mars in Paris in 1783. The idea of ​​launching military reconnaissance probes is not new either. As our agency informed, in February 2023 the Russian invaders decided to use weapons that had not yet been used against the Defense Forces of Ukraine formerly balloons. Over our territory, in some places, the Ukrainian military noticed numerous balloons with corner reflectors launched by the aggressors. At the same time, everyone probably remembers the sudden vulnerability of the USA to the appearance of such objects over its territory. Shooting down such an object in the stratosphere is an extremely difficult task, and barrage from such a height will allow you to bypass the enemy's air defense positions. In general, balloons have been used for military purposes since the middle of the 19th century. In 1849, the Austrian general Franz von Uchatius proposed during the siege of Venice to release several dozen bullets with incendiary bombs towards the city. The attempt was not too successful - the city was practically not damaged, and some of the bullets were carried by the wind to the positions of the Austrians. Later, balloons began to be used in military affairs quite widely, but rarely as bombers. The main advantage of the modern Canadian Eagle is its ability to carry a wide range of payloads, including equipment for gathering intelligence, surveillance or high-precision munitions. This capability enhances its role in military operations, providing commanders with a versatile tool that can be quickly adapted to meet changing mission needs. The system's ability to operate in environments where traditional GPS guidance systems may be compromised or unavailable further emphasizes its tactical importance. The design and technology of the Eagle is designed to support a range of mission types, including intelligence gathering, electronic warfare and precision strikes, while operating in a variety of TVD environments from arctic to desert environments.

The new -masterpiece- of the Kremlin fantasists about -medical experiments- in Ukraine: what did the...	Any information campaign of the Russian Federation works according to a proven scheme: loud accusations, no real evidence and maximum fear-mongering. This was the case with -crucified boys-, -NATO war geese-, -secret biolabs- and -war mosquitoes-. Now it is the turn of the medical field. It is interesting that none of these -experiments- have been documented by independent sources, no witnesses have been able to confirm such cases, and, the funniest thing, there are no secret laboratories in Ukrainian hospitals where doctors -atrocize-. On the contrary, Ukrainian military hospitals work according to the best world standards, rescuing wounded soldiers, and civilian hospitals heroically extract victims from Russian shelling. the Russian army is deliberately destroying the Ukrainian medical infrastructure. Hospitals and emergency rooms are targeted for their attacks. They attack maternity hospitals, children's wards, civilian medical facilities - and all this is documented by international organizations. Therefore, when Moscow tries to accuse Ukraine of unethical treatment of the wounded, it is not just cynicism, it is a desire to hide its own war crimes. The goal is obvious: to demonize Ukraine, to create an image for the domestic Russian consumer to justify the war and its own crimes. The more absurd and the more terrifying the lie, the easier it is to manipulate. A person who believed in -Ukrainian Nazis- will easily believe in -medical experiments.- Ukrainian doctors are people who save lives in conditions of constant threat. And Russian propagandists are people who invent fairy tales for those who are not capable of critical thinking. So, once again, we are dealing not with an investigation or the truth, but with a primitive information dump, which is calculated on irrational fear and hatred. Now tell me honestly: maybe next time they will invent something about -Ukrainian sorcerers- resurrecting the military? Because, it seems, the fantasy of propaganda has long gone beyond common sense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/novyj-shedevr-kremlivskyh-fantazeriv-pro-medychni-eksperymenty-v-ukrayini-shho-vygadaly-czogo-razu/	2025-02-22T20:05:57-08:00

-Paradox- from M113: about the rescue of -wounded- -Emka- 2 of the International Legion	-Paradox- told ArmyInform about the tasks and advantages of the legendary -emka- during the evacuation of the wounded, as well as the story of the rescue of an armored personnel carrier damaged during one of the evacuation trips. — The call sign -Paradox- came to me somehow spontaneously. At first, I thought about the nickname -Veles-, I wanted to be called as an ancient pagan god. And then I wanted -Paradox- - that's how it caught on, - the military man jokes about his call sign. By education, Paradox is a chef, he also studied in Lviv at the college of restaurant, hotel and tourism business. In civilian life, he worked in the field of Internet access services. He spent a lot of time in Europe, but, he admits, he always wanted to go home to his native Lviv. The man joined the Armed Forces for the first time in 2017, when he served his military service. He then signed a contract that expired in 2021, about a year before the full-scale invasion began. — Literally 11 months after the end of the contract, a full-scale war began and on February 28, 2022, I returned to service. And in 2023, I was lucky enough to be transferred to the 2nd International Legion, where I serve to this day, the man says. Paradox serves as a sanitary instructor and commander of M113, an armored personnel carrier used to evacuate wounded soldiers to the nearest rear for providing them with medical assistance at a stabilization point. - I am responsible for this car and everything related to it. I am her driver and the one who carries out the evacuation of the wounded, he explains. -Emka-, emphasizes -Paradox-, can do a lot. In addition to the primary task of evacuating the wounded, M113s help to conduct rotations, provide logistics, and pull out equipment stuck on the road. -In principle, these are exactly the tasks for which this armored personnel carrier was created as a combat tracked armored vehicle of increased cross-country ability,- Paradox emphasizes. You can learn to drive the M113 in 3‒4 hours — Driving the M113 is not difficult at all. We were given two weeks to study and even finished everything a little earlier, because the -beerka- - combat order - came and we had to leave. And in general, you can learn to drive it literally in 3-4 hours, there is absolutely nothing difficult there, - assures the soldier. -Paradox- is satisfied with American equipment because of its reliability, functionality, unpretentiousness and ease of use. — This is an American technique that does almost everything for you. There is an automatic transmission and a steering wheel - everything is simple, as in cars with an -automatic-. By and large, it is not significantly different. If you do everything with a cold mind, this car is just perfect, notes -Paradox-. According to him, neither the weight, nor the dimensions, nor the crawler base pose any problems for beginners. It is enough to be attentive - and in a few hours you can get used to everything. The intensity of work of -emka- on the front line depends on many factors. Occasionally there may be a day without a single departure, on average there are 5-6 such departures per day, but there may be more. When it comes to rotation or cargo delivery, they are planned in advance and carried out mainly in the dark. When it is necessary to evacuate a wounded person, everything depends on his condition. — If the -three hundredth- is light and can wait until dark, then we evacuate it -by gray.- If the -three hundredth- is difficult, then we have no way out - we have to go after it, because we understand that every minute, as they say, is worth its weight in gold. Then we go if it's light and even when enemy drones are flying. Then we have no way out, because these are our brothers and we must get them out, the health instructor emphasizes. In such situations, when you have to take risks, -Paradox- relies entirely on its own skills and experience, as well as on the unique qualities of the M113 - speed, maneuverability, maneuverability and, above all, security. — There is no way to -flash- it with a machine gun or a machine gun. A direct hit by a mine, if it's an -eighty-, for example, I think it will take it easy. -Emka- withstands hitting an anti-tank mine as well. It breaks down, but the crew remains alive and without serious injuries, the military assures. Of course, the M113 armor cannot withstand a direct hit from a tank gun, but there are few chances of -running into- an enemy tank. On the other hand, FPV drone strikes with cumulative charges are much more dangerous. However, the protective grilles additionally installed on the armored personnel carrier help a lot. — We worked with the previous brigade in Chasovoy Yar, then their -emka- left the battlefield on its own after 13 FPVs flew into it. At the same time, she had literally the same as ours - welded-on grids, nothing more. They really help, Paradox explains. The M113, which we are reviewing, arrived at the 2nd International Legion without any protective structures, so they had to be installed on site. Thanks to this, the armored car, protected on all sides by grills, has a formidable, bristling appearance. There should always be two fighters in the crew of an evacuation -emka- - a driver and a paramedic who provides assistance, helps to load the wounded and monitors his condition while driving. - The lightly wounded can get into the armored personnel carrier independently through the door, for the -severe- we lower the apparatus. But the fighters must be warned not to approach the machine until the apron is completely lowered, says the medical instructor. A half-ton harness can indeed be dangerous if handled carelessly, but it's extremely handy when you need to get a casualty in quickly. It is necessary to do this as soon as possible, because during the slightest delay, the enemy can detect the armored vehicle and strike at it. - We try to fit in 30 seconds - this is the optimal download time. After 30 seconds, the enemy is able to calculate the target and deal fire damage. That is, it is highly undesirable to stand for longer, the military officer emphasizes. ILLUSTRATION 09 CAPTION: Photo by Ruslan Tarasov / ArmiyaInform No special medical equipment is provided in the evacuation -emka-, because it is impossible to provide assistance to the wounded while moving - the armored vehicle jerks in all directions at speed. The main thing is to deliver the -three hundredth- to the stabilization point as soon as possible. - During movement, absolutely nothing can be done, because you are constantly thrown left and right and back and forth, it is impossible to take any stable position. The best thing we can do is to drive quickly without stopping, explains the health instructor. First aid was already provided to the wounded before the arrival of the evacuation team, so the task of the M113 crew was to maintain the existing stable condition of the soldier and ensure his speedy delivery to the stabilization point. — This is an evacuation from the front point to the -stabik-, because, in fact, you will do absolutely nothing on the move. You just have time, and you try to drive as fast as possible during that time and deliver it to the stabilization point, -Paradox- describes the task of the emka crew. Emka left even with a damaged track Although the M113 is a reliable helper in rescuing the wounded, sometimes the -Emka- itself needs help due to the damage it received. Then the armored personnel carrier itself has to be evacuated from the battlefield. -Paradox- tells about the case when the M113 caterpillar ran over an anti-personnel mine. For some time, the armored personnel carrier was still able to continue moving, but in the end it -dislodged- and had to be towed out. — We continued moving, managed to bog down the heavy -three hundredth-, turned around and even drove a kilometer away from the position - and even then the track broke. I had to leave the car and find shelter in the landing next to it, because the -Emka- began to be fired upon, - says -Paradox-. In the evening of the same day, they tried to evacuate the emka with the help of an Oshkosh tractor, but could only move it 800 meters, because the -Oshkosh- ran out of power on the steep climb. However, this movement saved M113 - the enemy lost sight of the evacuation armored personnel carrier. The rescue of the armored personnel carrier was continued with the help of a -motoliga-, and when it did not cope, even a tank was involved in the evacuation. Special cables had to be found for it, and on the second attempt, the heavy battleship eventually managed. — We found the tank with our neighbors. Drove in at dusk, got caught in the cables. The first ones broke because the -bucket- sunk into the ground, and we had to drag it down the hill. Then they found special tank cables and were able to bring our car to the nearest village, Paradox recalls. From there, the further evacuation of the armored personnel carrier went more smoothly and soon the repaired M113 was able to return to service to continue to help save the lives of the wounded. The now-repaired -emka- is a reliable assistant and fast armored warhorse of the Medical Service of the International Legion 2.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/paradoks-iz-m113-pro-poryatunok-poranenoyi-emky-2-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-02-21T20:53:59-08:00

Combat digitized -earth-moving machine-: an Asian company supplied the Singaporean army with the lat...	As the defense portal Asian Military Review informs, the new machine called Hunter Armored Engineer Vehicle (HT-AEV) is equipped with a backhoe boom and a front loading system and a gripping lever, which makes it ideal for clearing obstacles in various combat and natural environments. ArmyInform notes. The HT-AEV, developed jointly with Singapore's Defense Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and local company ST Engineering, is to replace the British combat engineer tractor FV180 (CET) which has been in use since the 1990s. According to the weapons market researchers from the Netherlands portal Army Recognition (AR), the Hunter Engineer Armored Vehicle (HT-AEV) is based on the Hunter Armored Fighting Vehicle (HT-AFV) platform, designed to provide mobility, protection and digitized operations. One of the key features of the HT-AEV is the presence of an all-round camera system, which allows the crew to operate with closed hatches, which minimizes the need for a large number of personnel and increases effectiveness in combat conditions. The machine is operated by a crew of two people: a mechanic-driver and an operator. The HT-AEV is part of the broader Hunter platform family, which also includes vehicles such as the Hunter Recovery Vehicle (HT-HRV) and the Hunter Armored Vehicle-Launched Bridge (HT-AVLB). Each of them is designed to perform specific tasks within engineering and combat operations. The technical characteristics of the HT-AEV and HT-AVLB have not been disclosed, although it is known that the base model Hunter AFV measures 6.9 m in length and 3.4 m in width and has a combat weight of approximately 29 tons. Launched in February 2022, the HT-HRV is equipped with a 360-degree telescopic jib crane and a 25,500 kg pull winch. This makes it an effective tool for restoring armored vehicles and other vehicles. Entered into service in November 2022, the HT-AVLB deploys modular bridges and replaces older designs based on the SM-1, which greatly increases troop mobility and maneuverability. Development of the Hunter platform began in 2006 as a collaboration between DSTA, ST Engineering and the Singapore Army to replace the Ultra M113 armored personnel carriers of the 1970s. Entered into service in 2019, the Hunter AFV was the Singapore Army's first fully digitized armored platform. Variants such as HT-HRV, HT-AVLB and HT-AEV were later added. The platform integrates the Army's tactical information system (ARTEMIS) for real-time mission planning and coordination, and its modular design supports roles such as combat, recovery, guidance bridges and engineering tasks. An integrated combat cockpit provides joint control between crew members, and a system for monitoring the functioning of mechanisms and aggregates helps in maintenance. As AR analysts point out, the transition of the Singapore Army to advanced systems such as the HT-AEV reflects the changing requirements for engineering vehicles in modern military operations.

Ground unmanned complexes: - Predators of heights - already use robots on the front	How robotic ground complexes are used against the occupiers, about the specifics of their combat work and tasks, the commander of the -Predators of Heights- battalion, Major Maxim with the call sign -Condor-, told ArmiyaInform. -In addition to the unmanned aircraft component, we use ground unmanned complexes in everyday combat activities. We are moving towards improving our capabilities and combat operations. In this context, our main task is not to win the war at any cost, but to defeat the enemy while preserving our personnel. For us, every Ukrainian life is a great value, unlike Russians. The concept of the Unmanned Systems Forces is that unmanned systems should be the main component of an assault of any type. It used to be a human, a stormtrooper. Now we are trying to make the attack aircraft an additional component for unmanned components in the conduct of assault operations. Plus, we have to make sure that, thanks to the use of unmanned technologies, the danger is diverted from the soldier who is on the line of battle. At the forefront, we use FPV drones, Mavic, and Autel, and heavy bombers, and reconnaissance UAVs, and plus ground robotic complexes. In such a symbiosis of various unmanned systems on the battlefield, it is much easier and more efficient for a simple attack aircraft to do its job. In general, robotic ground complexes can be assigned the tasks of fire damage, demining, demining and performing kamikaze missions, logistical operations, in particular evacuation. That is, the set of tasks is actually very large. Here, in Donetsk region, in conditions of intense hostilities, we actively use these ground complexes for various combat tasks. For example, kamikaze machines with 30 kg of explosives on board overcome the path to the enemy's shelter, enter the dugout from above and successfully detonate the ramparts. No wooden shelter can withstand such an explosion. How it happens: the crews of the machine itself and the Mavik UAV work in pairs. The operator of the machine looks at the monitor of the broadcast conducted by the drone, because the complex does not have its own camera. From above in the air, the machine is accompanied to the target by the -Mavik- pilot. Before that, we do reconnaissance of the route, see if there are any obstacles and impassable sections. When the ground complex reaches the target, the machine operator remotely detonates the explosives. That's it, the enemy is destroyed! In addition to the kamikaze machine, we can also make a reset from the UAV in order to fix the result for sure. That is, we perform tasks in a complex. There are machines that are engaged in purely mining the paths of probable advance of assault groups or enemy armored vehicles. That is, it is no longer necessary for military personnel to do it themselves and be exposed to danger. Robots go there, with the help of special mining systems, lay various types of mines on the terrain and return back. They make various mine obstacles. We mainly use changers at a distance of 5-8 km. Depending on the training of the crew, they can also be used at night. Again, work in tandem with the Mavika operator. For example, we can see where the tank-dangerous areas are. The machine reached that road, at a specific point the operator pressed a button on the control panel and unloaded the mine. If it is necessary to lay a mine somewhere else, the machine leaves 20-30 meters away and does it again. In general, one machine-changer can transport 4 anti-tank mines and deploy them. After that, the ground complex turns back. There are ground complexes that provide logistics for our front-line units. Provisions, water, BC, medicines are delivered. In short, we can provide everything that the guys on the front line need. When I was still the commander of the first infantry battalion of the 59th brigade, we in the unit began to actively use ground complexes during combat missions two years ago. I remember that it was quite difficult with logistics in the Pisky settlement area. These machines really helped us out then. There was one position that was difficult to get into. In two walks, cars brought food, BC, batteries for the radio station and medical preparations for the boys who were there for a very long time. During the second walk, the enemy saw the machine and began to inflict fire damage on it. Yes, it was destroyed, but it fulfilled its mission. Our infantry continued to defend the area and destroy the invaders. The use of these machines actually saved the infantry. Ground complexes should become an important element of any military operations. The enemy does not stand still. It is also evolving. In some units in our direction, the enemy began to use robotic ground systems, but in small numbers. First of all, to ensure logistics. Somehow, we discovered the operation of the Katsap complex. The reaction was immediate. The enemy machine was destroyed by various means of defeat, which are in the arsenal of the -Predators of Heights- battalion. It did not even reach the Russian attack aircraft, which were in the forest plantation and were waiting for the replenishment of the BC.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/nazemni-bezpilotni-kompleksy-hyzhaky-vysot-vzhe-vykorystovuyut-robotiv-na-fronti/	2025-02-21T20:25:11-08:00
A parade of lies until February 23: Russia is again -defending itself- against fictitious terrorist ...	The Russian media are already actively spreading statements that the -Kyiv regime- (that's right, because the Kremlin has long refused to call Ukraine a state) is allegedly planning explosions in Moscow, Belgorod and even in Crimea. As always, -from reliable sources- that no one has ever seen or verified. And to reinforce horror stories, they add photos from the archive or unknown videos, which usually turn out to be staged. It is interesting that such -throwaways- always appear just before domestic political dates. The goal is to rally Russians around the mythical image of the -enemy-, raise the rating of the army and justify new repressions against their own citizens. After all, every -terrorist attack- that did not happen is a great opportunity for the FSB to show off its -brilliant- work. The most interesting thing is that some of these fakes have a peculiarity - they often become self-fulfilling prophecies. Explosions, arsons and attacks attributed to Ukraine suddenly happen, but their perpetrators turn out to be not Ukrainians at all, but -indifferent- citizens of the Russian Federation. In the best traditions of the genre, Russian security forces sometimes -neutralize- conditional -saboteurs- or catch -Ukrainian spies- with incredibly theatrical sets of physical evidence - from tridents to SBU agents' certificates marked -secret-. During the analysis of such information leaks, it becomes obvious: the goal is to divert the attention of the population from real problems. And if last year they shouted about -Ukrainian terrorist attacks- in February, then in April - about a -nuclear threat-, and in August - about -attacks on the energy system-. The content does not change, only the date changes. Each such fake is part of a large information war, where Russia is not only trying to create a -terrorist state- out of Ukraine in the eyes of its own population, but also to divert the attention of the international community from its war crimes. Therefore, it is important to expose such manipulations, sort them out and show the reality: it is Russia that engages in terrorist attacks, provocations, and war, not its victims. So don't be surprised if, a year before February 23, you hear again about the -terrible Ukrainian plan to destroy Russia.- After all, the main thing for the Kremlin is not reality, but the creation of another pretext for repression and mobilization. And while the Russian Federation itself is afraid of -fictional terrorists-, Ukraine continues to fight against a real aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/parad-brehni-do-23-lyutogo-rosiya-znovu-zahyshhayetsya-vid-vygadanyh-teraktiv/	2025-02-21T20:04:19-08:00
Botfarms and fakes: the special services of the Russian Federation conduct information sabotage	The SBU informs about this on February 21. -For provocations, the Russian special services have used the full potential of their bot farms and massively use controlled groups and fake accounts in popular messengers and social networks, most actively in TikTok and Telegram,- the report says.

Payment only for verified food: MOU implements digital control of products for the Armed Forces	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense on February 21. According to the new rules, the supplier creates an invoice in the system before shipping the products, indicating the corresponding number of the test report. If this number is not entered, the special database in the DOT-Chain IT system will not allow the invoice to be generated, which will make it impossible to supply products without laboratory control. The introduction of new control mechanisms was a response to discovered abuses by unscrupulous suppliers. The head of the Central Department of Quality Control of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Ihor Leshchenko, said that during the inspections, it was found that the amount of canned products sent to the Armed Forces significantly exceeds the amount checked by veterinary laboratories. -Because of this, there have been questions about the quality of the products. Therefore, we have decided to change the very monitoring system for the supply of such products to ensure transparency and strengthen control,- he noted. Therefore, all laboratory test reports are now sent to the State Frontline Operator (DOT), which enters them into the DOT-Chain. It contains detailed information about the products: test report number, date of manufacture, manufacturer, lot size, etc. -DoT continues to digitize more and more processes in the field of food supply to the Armed Forces. The implementation of a joint initiative with the Central Department of Quality Control of the Ministry of Education and Culture is another example of how modern solutions allow us to quickly and promptly respond to violations,- noted Volodymyr Chugai, head of the Department of Product Management of the DOT. According to him, from now on, not only military units will be able to form online complaints about the quality of products in DOT-Chain, but the system itself will be able to proactively detect potential threats. The system analyzes the invoices daily, comparing them with the database of test reports. If the supply limit is exceeded, the violation is automatically recorded, and the supplier must provide an explanation. If the violation is confirmed, the company will pay a significant fine, and excess products will be prohibited from being issued and will be sent for laboratory testing. Thus, thanks to the DOT-Chain system, the supplier receives payment only for verified products, which should exclude financial interest for fraud. The control system is already in operation and is constantly being improved for even more effective monitoring and prevention of the risk of supplying dangerous or low-quality products to the Armed Forces. As reported by ArmyInform, feeding of the military is carried out in accordance with state norms that ensure a complete daily ration. In the field, military personnel are provided with individual rations, and during a stationary stay, three or four meals a day, depending on the standard of provision.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/plata-lyshe-za-perevireni-harchi-mou-vprovadzhuye-czyfrovyj-kontrol-produkcziyi-dlya-zsu/	2025-02-21T06:09:05-08:00

How to react to an attack and survive, what should be the reaction to the situation under stressful conditions and the way to make a decision at a decisive moment when the threat is close, literally in front of your eyes, how to act in trenches, dugouts, in an urban area - all this can be practiced during training in knife fights. It is preliminarily planned that knife fighting should become an element of tactical and fire training.

In the Kyiv region, Russian agents were detained with a fire extinguisher-bomb	This was reported on February 21 by the Security Service of Ukraine. The main targets of the enemy were the bases of local police units, the TCC and the prosecutor's office. As the investigation established, the agents had the right to choose the first -object- to blow up among them. However, thanks to the anticipatory actions of the SBU, the terrorist attack was prevented. According to the case file, the occupiers remotely recruited two unemployed people from the Kyiv region - a 27-year-old drug addict and his roommate, who were looking for -easy- money on Telegram channels - to carry out the enemy's mission. According to the instructions of the FSB, the agents settled in a hostel near Kyiv, where they began to secretly manufacture an improvised explosive device (IED). To make it, those involved purchased chemical components for the synthesis of an explosive substance, as well as striking elements in the form of metal bolts, nails and aluminum shavings. Next, the attackers prepared a fire extinguisher, which was supposed to be a container for disguising the SVP. After making the explosives, they planned to -report- to the FSB about their readiness to commit a crime and obtain geolocation for its establishment. SBU employees exposed the agents in advance, documented their contacts with the Russian special services and preparations for terrorist attacks. At the final stage of the special operation, both involved were caught red-handed when they were making explosive components for the SVP. During the search, the following were seized from them: — 2 kg of explosives; — a fire extinguisher that was converted into a -container- for explosives; — striking elements for SVP. In addition, the detainees were found to have mobile phones with evidence of communication with the FSB, as well as a video recorder on which they were supposed to record the planned terrorist attack. So far, the persons involved have been notified of their suspicion under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: — ch. 1 Art. 14, ch. 2 Art. 258 (preparation to commit a terrorist act by prior conspiracy by a group of persons); — ch. 2 Art. 263-1 (illegal manufacture of explosive substances and explosive devices). The perpetrators are in custody. They face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, 7 more arsonists were arrested, who face a minimum of 8 years in prison.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/na-kyyivshhyni-zatrymaly-rosijskyh-agentiv-z-vognegasnykom-bomboyu/	2025-02-21T00:47:23-08:00

The fantasy world of the Russian Federation: a fake about the mass return of Ukrainian women for mob...	This time, the Russian disinformation machine released another masterpiece: Ukrainian women are allegedly being deported en masse from Europe in order to&#8230; forcibly sent to the front. According to the Kremlin's methods, the scenario looks something like this: Of course, there is zero evidence for this. But who has that ever stopped? The fake about the -mass return of Ukrainian women for mobilization- is as real as -NATO combat mosquitoes-. The reasons are traditional: When the Kremlin runs out of arguments, the fake machine is turned on. She spits out into the world incredible stories about Ukrainian women who for some reason do not want -liberation- from Russia and instead voluntarily fight for their country. But the problem is that the truth is always stronger than a lie, and Ukrainians have long learned to recognize the Kremlin's delusions. And if Russia is really afraid of Ukrainian women, then it has reason to be afraid. Because our women not only fight back at the front, but also shatter all their false myths.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/svit-fantazij-rf-fejk-pro-masove-povernennya-ukrayinok-dlya-mobilizacziyi/	2025-02-20T21:04:58-08:00
The ghostly story of the Mirages: how the famous French fighters were created	About the Mirage, the ArmyInform reporter asked Andrii Haruk, a military historian, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petr Sahaydachny. — I immediately warn those who tuned in to a story in the style of the birth of the F-16 -Combat Falcon- - with a competition of hunting and bombing mafias, secret intrigues and open competitions. No, this will not be in our conversation, but it will be about the leisurely evening conversations of the two presidents in the Elysee Palace, it will be about marketing calculations and banal accounting calculations&#8230; - Andriy Ivanovych, after all, what was the basis for the creation of -Mirages-? - In the 60s of the last century, the company -Avion Marcel Dassault- experienced a real boom. Its -deltas- - tailless fighter planes with a triangular wing - collected contract after contract. The Mirage III fighter was a worthy competition for American and Soviet machines. A simplified version of it, Mirage 5, was created especially for export, and it was successfully sold on four continents. The Mirage IV strategic bomber, although it had no chance of becoming mass production, was an extremely prestigious product, because it became one of the components of the French strategic nuclear triad. But the managers and designers of AMD - as the company was called for short - did not relax. The arms market demanded new products - without this, the threat of losing the conquered positions became real. There was no need to worry about the domestic consumer - already in the 60s, AMD actually became a monopoly in France in the field of creation and production of combat aircraft. But foreign buyers wanted something new&#8230; Therefore, after the French Air Force abandoned the development of the Mirage F2 and Mirage F3 projects - two-seater fighters, in which AMD designers abandoned the -delta- and applied a high-flying scheme with a swept wing and a normal tail (this term is called classic plumage with a keel and a stabilizer), - the company invested its own funds in the cheaper and simpler Mirage F1 single-seat fighter. — And how did their competitors react to such a policy of French aircraft designers? The same creators of the F-16 from General Dynamics? After all, this kind of -intraspecies- struggle for the sales markets of combat aircraft has never stopped? - Indeed, the competition there was serious. And -Mirage F1- was considered as a competitor of F-16 in the fight for the markets of four European NATO countries. And although the -contest of the century- -Mirage F1- lost, the investment fully paid for itself. Such aircraft were not only exported to one and a half dozen countries, but were also purchased by the French Air Force as a -transitional option-. - And what, at least for a certain time, did the officials in the department, which is now called the Ministry of the Armed Forces of the French Republic, stop their choice? - Another aircraft was to be the -final option- for France - the Mirage G8, in which the popular on the frontier was implemented 60-70s scheme with a wing of variable geometry. The American F-111 and F-14, the Soviet MiG-23, Su-24, and the Western European Tornado were built according to this scheme. And this is not to mention the strategic missile carriers B-1, Tu-22M and Tu-160. The French, although they brought the Mirage G8 program to the stage of prototype testing, in 1975 they finally closed it due to the increase in development costs. - Such! And in what direction did the French develop their combat aviation further? — In parallel with the Mirage G8 program, the ACF (Avion Combat de Futur) program, initiated by the General Staff of the French Air Force, has been developing since mid-1972. It envisaged the creation of a twin-engine single-seat fighter of the same class as the American F-15. At this stage, the aircraft was designed under the designation -Super Mirage-. However, this program was also stopped. The reasons are purely commercial: the excessive cost of the project and the lack of interest among potential foreign buyers. At that time, aircraft of a similar class - the F-15 and the Tornado - were already presented on the market, so the chances of the Super Mirage to win customers abroad were considered slim. It even got to the point that the French Air Force seriously considered the possibility of buying American fighters. — And what about the famous French patriotism? — In April 1976 a delegation of French military aviators visited the American Edwards Air Force Base, where they got acquainted with the F-15. Interestingly, French rondels were even painted on the plane! However, the matter did not come to the purchase of -Igliv-. The French preferred their own project, but in a different, lighter class. - And in which one exactly? Immerse our readers in the details, Mr. Professor! — In the 70s of the last century, air combat fighters could be conventionally divided into two classes - ten-ton and twenty-ton. The Mirage III and Mirage F1 aircraft belonged to the first of them. The USA, before the appearance of the F-16, did not have a worthy competitor to the French machines - the Northrop F-5A/E aircraft were typical -hunters for the poor-, with lower flight characteristics and more modest combat capabilities. But the creation of the -Fighting Falcon- threatened the position of French aircraft in the world arms market. Therefore, AMD-BA (the company had this abbreviation since December 1971, after the takeover of Breguet Aviation) back in 1973. initiated the program to create two new fighters with the triangular wing traditional for Mirages and the new two-circuit SNECMA M53 engines — the single-engine Mini Mirage (MIMI; the future Mirage 2000) and the twin-engine Maxi Mirage (MAMI; the future Mirage 4000). The following year, Marcel Dasso decided to use it on new aircraft electric remote control system — for the first time in the practice of French aircraft construction. These proposals were presented at the highest level, and on November 4, 1974, French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing sent a letter to AMD-BA President Marcel Dassault in which he approved the continuation of the ACF program and emphasized that the defense of France could not be guaranteed without a twin-engine fighter. And how much did it affect the project? - Surprisingly, the position of the president of the republic was questioned by one of the government officials - the ministerial delegate for arms affairs. In a lengthy briefing note, he noted: yes, a twin-engine fighter is needed for France, but having invested in its development, we will not have the funds to design a single-engine machine, and this will lead to a loss of position in the world market&#8230; After several rounds of consultations between the two presidents, on December 18, 1975, the Defense Council, chaired by the French president, finally decided to abandon twin-engine ACF fighter in favor of purchasing a single-engine machine. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, receiving Marcel Dassault at the Elysée Palace, emphasized that the government would support the potential export of the Mirage 4000, but would only purchase the single-engine Mirage 2000 for the French Air Force. Thus began the history of the aircraft that entered service half a century later of the Air Force of Ukraine&#8230; Next will be...	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/neprymarna-istoriya-mirazhiv-yak-stvoryuvalysya-znamenyti-franczuzki-vynyshhuvachi/	2025-02-20T20:53:08-08:00
Contract 18-24: how much volunteers will be paid	So this is exactly what ArmyInform tells in more detail. One of the main bonuses of such a contract is the payment of 1 million hryvnias in cash assistance. It must be paid in three stages: 200 thousand hryvnias - at the very beginning of the service. Within 5 days after signing the contract and starting to perform duties. 300,000 hryvnias already after completing training (45 days of general training, 14 days of specialized training and up to 14 days directly in the unit) and involvement in combat missions. That is, half a million hryvnias can be received within the first 2.5 months of service. 500,000 hryvnias are paid on the day of exclusion from the lists of the military unit at the end of this contract. One of the key conditions for the payment of the third part of the financial aid is direct participation in hostilities within 6 months. If for some reason it turned out to be less, the payment will also be smaller - it will be calculated proportionally from the calculation of 1/6 of 500,000 hryvnias for every 30 days of direct participation in hostilities calculated in total. The payment will be calculated according to the same formula if martial law is canceled during the service and it is simply not physically possible to fulfill the condition of participation in hostilities. If the contract is terminated prematurely due to health (due to injuries or illnesses related to the defense of the Motherland), or the term of the contract expires, but due to illness or injury the volunteer cannot fulfill the condition of direct participation in hostilities for 6 months, he will still receive the third part of the payment in full. If the serviceman systematically does not fulfill the terms of the contract, he will not only not be paid the third part of the allowance, but will also have to return the previously received 200,000 and 300,000 hryvnias. The payment of one million hryvnias for signing a contract is only part of the payments that a volunteer aged 18 to 24 will receive after joining the Defense Forces. Also, no one cancels the main and additional types of financial support that every Ukrainian military receives: You can read more details about how all these payments are calculated in 2025 here. There is also a list of benefits and compensations. Those who will sign a contract 18-24 can also count on them: All these payments are fixed by Ukrainian legislation, and are also additionally prescribed in contract, which will be signed by citizens aged 18 to 24.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/kontrakt-18-24-skilky-platytymut-dobrovolczyam/	2025-02-20T20:43:57-08:00
The realities of war through a photographic lens: portraitist Valentyn Kuzan talked about the image ...	- Tell me about your combat path, about the brigade, about the people with whom you had to serve. - I joined the 72nd OMBr in the fall of 2023. Before that, he traveled with many Ukrainian mass media to the de-occupied parts of Ukraine - cities, villages, photographed destroyed cultural and scientific objects. This is how I spent the first year and a half of full-scale. When a vacancy appeared in the press service of the 72nd, I joined this unit. At first I just took pictures, and then I also recorded short interviews so that there was a comment under the photo: who is depicted, what is the combat path of this person, and in general some interesting biographical facts. - And in general, how much did you manage to record while in the brigade, people, events? - I had an ambitious goal to make a portrait of every soldier in the brigade. I served in the brigade for a year and a half, but I realized that I did not come close to this goal. For various reasons. One of them is that not everyone likes and wants to be photographed. Some said they did not want to remember anything about this war. So I did not photograph everyone in the crew, after all, there are thousands of people, but still quite a lot, because the shooting was both portrait and reportage, when more people got into the picture at once during some events. It's hard to estimate, but surely hundreds. Perhaps a quarter or a third of the brigade was photographed, but it is very difficult to estimate. I will continue to do it, but as a civilian photographer. Those who are veterans of the 72nd will be filmed here on the spot, and I intend to come to those who are still serving as a civilian. If there is an opportunity, I want to continue this work. —I remember when you went to the army, when you were drafted, you said: -You will be able to do what you have been doing. Well, I will learn to dig, of course. And they promised to show which side to hold the weapon.- Were these expectations met? Was it difficult? - I was very lucky with the command and with my direct from the communications department and with the brigade command. Because it actually happened. Photography has remained my main activity, although many things have changed. It is clear that an army is an army. It is impossible to limit myself to one thing, but I really spent most of my time taking pictures. - What did you see in the war that you will never forget? - Death. — Many acquaintances have died? — From time to time news emerges. Some of those whom I photographed died, others died, some were injured. Once I photographed a person in the place where he lives, then they took portraits of people, talked with them, and recorded some stories about their lives. Then I come to take his picture on the -stabika-, we sit there - silence. The evening comes and a bunch of soldiers arrive with various injuries. And including the military man whose portrait I did recently. I took a portrait of him when he was completely intact and here I am taking a portrait of him - I still have this image in front of my eyes: a face cut with small stones or shrapnel, a swollen neck. And the vision is so blurred after an acubarotrauma (injury due to the effect of an acoustic blast wave - ed.), or a contusion&#8230; However, the most impressive, of course, is death. I saw her, fortunately, not so much. There were more mentions that some people we worked with had died. But, for example, worked with the team dealing with the fallen. I was filming the evacuation from the battlefield and there was a soldier who was burned. I don't think it's even worth describing this picture. It's a steep sight. These are really terrible shots, but it was important to make them because, on the one hand, they show the realities of war, and on the other hand, the work of the team that deals with it. And this is very important. —You have your own business, you are engaged in photography. And at some point he decided to go to war. How did your family, friends, and surroundings perceive this step of yours? - Colleagues received it with respect. I didn't think about it at the time, but I was one of the first photographers in my circle of friends to join the army. There were already precedents before me, of course, during all this time, but there were still no corresponding positions in the press services. Most of them were somewhere in the media teams, but most of them were not. And as soon as they started to appear, I was one of the first to leave. I still have some colleagues say respect, it's very, very nice. Then there was, of course, a complex of certain reasons. One of them was my conclusion that the only chance to stand against such a great enemy is if everyone who can is involved in one way or another in the Defense Forces. How did I come to this conclusion? Photographing soldiers on the battlefield, when asked by reporters what you want to say on this occasion - said a lot - change us. I also took it at my expense. Of course, I did not serve in the infantry, because then the infantrymen, of course, said that in the first place. But here, too, I felt a duty. Firstly, it was such a logical sequence that since I think so, then it is necessary to start with myself. And secondly, as a photographer, what could be more important for me to photograph right now than these events and all that is connected with them? I once had the motivation to start a project about Ukrainian artists. It was already after 2014. I felt that Ukrainian artists should be highlighted. Especially at a time of such a threat from katsaps, who destroyed the flower of the Ukrainian intelligentsia during the time of the sovka and even before that. And then they went to war against us again. And these people form nation-building narratives. And when I mobilized, I decided that now it is necessary to highlight the people who are fighting, to tell their stories, to show their faces. I myself was very interested in forming this composite portrait in my head: who is this person who is fighting for his country? - Is the work of a photographer in a brigade and the work of a civilian photographer different conceptually? - They are different, because over the years of photographic practice I am used to people writing to me, calling me, signing up for shootings and coming already prepared for this process. And when I joined the army, I met such a beautiful phenomenon as -healthy fig-: you come, the same as everyone else, do something or rest, have a drink, talk to someone. On the one hand, it seems to be indifferent to each other. And at the same time, the atmosphere of a very close community. I haven't been in the army long and haven't been to many places to compare different units. Is this a feature in our brigade, or in the armed forces in general, or is it my optics as a photographer who has chosen the environment where he will go in the army. Because there are different cases. But I had and still have a sense of the army as a community. If you see someone in the same shape as you, then your communication is immediately fraternal. And it's a very high feeling. Apart from what I said about death, I will not forget this feeling of brotherhood. For example, it happened that the wheel was punctured. A moment - and there is already a queue of those who want to help you. More precisely, some started asking if everything was fine, others, others. Such moments are very pleasant. I saw a military man on crutches, somewhere in Donetsk region, stopped, talked on the road while he gave me a ride. Something like family. And there is also dignity - also an unforgettable feeling that you are in these historical events, also a person in shape, participating in the defense of the country. It is clear that my work is not combat, but there was a sense of importance of what I was doing. Of course, this contribution is minimal, it does not affect whether this position in defense will be stronger. But someone died and you think: it's good that I managed to take a series of photos for him. The photos reflect the level of that person, the level of courage of that person, their personality. In this regard, the photograph, the quality of the photograph, is not in the technical parameters, but in the extent to which it captures the person as he is. So that this memory remains for posterity&#8230; Our work is generally about writing a visual story. But it becomes relevant after dozens of years: a person used to be like that, but now he looks completely different, life has changed, or, God forbid, someone has already left. A month ago I was photographing people. And yesterday, our brother from the communications department told me that there was a tragedy, an explosion, at the shooting location. And we do not know for sure which of those in the photo was injured, what happened to whom. There are dead, there are wounded. And it's a slipper&#8230; - Actually capturing events is extremely important. When you look at the photos from the perspective of time, only thanks to the skill of the photographer can you feel the pulse of the era. — I was at the exhibition of Oleksandr Glyadyelov back in 2022. There were pictures of destroyed Kyiv, shopping centers in ruins, broken roads, a tank on fire on the road. And then it was perceived one at a time. It was still very much alive then, but now it is history. Only two years have passed. And what will happen in 50? - You are now returning to civilian life. Do you already have any projects that you plan to work on? What prompted you to change the format of your work? - I have four children. Therefore, the main motive is to be more with the children, to take care of them more than I could at a distance. In a year and a half, I saw very few of them. Physical presence is important to them and it's important to me to be with them for my mental health after what I've seen there. Psychologically tired. This is, of course, incomparable to many other cases. But if we talk specifically about ourselves, then it is clear that the time spent in Donetsk, when we lived close to the battle line and worked in very different places, in Vugledar, in particular, we came under fire, we fell nearby, we saw death&#8230; There was not a single night in Donetsk while they were there that explosions were not heard. Moreover, you get used to a certain level of noise, then - once, somewhere closer, it even throws up on a folding table. Over time, sleep worsens and so on. Psychologically, it is by no means easy. You understand that you are doing some valuable work, and it lasts. There are people waiting at home, this is also an extremely big support. But still, time passes, and you feel that you are drowning little by little in all this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/realiyi-vijny-kriz-fotoobyektyv-portretyst-valentyn-kuzan-rozpoviv-pro-obraz-yakyj-dosi-stoyit-pered-ochyma/	2025-02-20T20:25:24-08:00
-Hot tours- to Kursk: how steppe warriors -roast- invaders on their own land	The video, published on the brigade's page, demonstrates a master class on -frying- enemy equipment and manpower. -Hunting- for the occupiers was successful. Steppe warriors, using kamikaze drones and other -goodies-, turned enemy cars into flaming torches, destroyed EW and caused losses to enemy infantry hiding in shelters. But the -highlight- of the program was a burning Russian tank. According to the fighters, it was -dessert- for the occupiers. The spectacle, it must be admitted, is impressive. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 61st Mechanized Steppe Brigade repelled an enemy attack on 3 BMP with landing forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/garyachi-tury-do-kurska-yak-stepovi-voyiny-smazhat-okupantiv-na-yihnij-zhe-zemli/	2025-02-20T11:54:56-08:00
The column of -Urals- will turn into scrap metal in a few minutes: -Send- knows how to do it	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -I love good anecdotes, but most of all - ministurms of the enemy,- says -Poshly-. According to him, the occupiers often go to positions without proper weapons and protection, which makes them an easy target for Ukrainian fighters. -They go as if for a walk - two or three at a time, with anti-tank mines in their hands, without armor and automatic weapons. And it is at this moment that the boys and I get down to work,- he adds. -Poshly- and its counterparts use -Stugna-P- - a universal anti-tank missile complex that effectively destroys enemy manpower, armored vehicles and fortifications. -Stugna- is not afraid of EW and drones, and the ability to choose between cumulative and high-explosive charges allows it to adapt to any target. -Once we hit a motorcyclist, and a rocket flew into a farm with enemy ammunition. The explosion was loud. The motorcyclist was left without a partner, and we were left without one more enemy,- recalls -Send- one of the cases. Fighters of the 59th OShBr work especially effectively against enemy equipment. -If we see a column moving along a familiar route, we immediately calculate the landmarks. The enemy often goes on the attack on -Soviet rags- - -Urals-, -UAZs- and even awning trucks. We destroy the equipment, and our FPV pilots finish off the infantry,- says -Send-. According to him, their work is non-stop, without a standardized schedule. -It is important to be fast and coordinated: load the rocket correctly, drop the tube quickly,- he explains. The biggest danger for them is enemy -mavics-, because they operate close to infantry and are often hit by drones. -There are cases of injuries after dropping VOGs and grenades. The best insurance is camouflage. -Fall less,- says our commander,- adds Send. -Mechanic- and -Rex- serve along with -Send-. -Mechanic- is reliable and calm, and -Rex- is a brat, but the main thing is that they know what they are fighting for. -We are fighting for Ukraine, which our children will be proud of. They will build it, and we have to defend it,- concludes -Send-. As reported by ArmyInform, Dmitry with the call sign -Neo-, combat medic of the 100th separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, celebrated his 24th birthday not at a festive table, but repelling an enemy assault near Toretsk. This day, which could have been special for him, turned into a fierce battle that was forever etched in his memory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/kolona-uraliv-peretvorytsya-na-metalobruht-za-kilka-hvylyn-poshlyj-znaye-yak-cze-zrobyty/	2025-02-20T11:39:26-08:00

-Estonian- from the Marines: -Ukraine became my second Motherland-	The soldier's story was made public on the battalion page. Friendship with Ukrainians who fought in the ATO changed his life. When one of them died after a full-scale invasion, -Estonian- decided to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -Father asked only one thing: -I hope not on the side of Russia?-. -No, on the side of Ukraine.- 'Be careful,'- he recalls. In Ukraine, -Estonets- joined the armed forces, underwent combat baptism in Donetsk region, where his unit suffered losses for the first time. Later joined the Marine Corps. -The Marines are an elite branch of the military. I am honored to be among these warriors,- says the scout. His unit conducts reconnaissance, ensures the advance of infantry and destroys the enemy. There are no casualties in war. His friend, combat medic Martin, despite being seriously wounded, helped his comrades. When the enemy broke into the trench, he used the last charge for himself. -His death broke me. I returned to Estonia, but I could not sit in the warmth while my brothers were fighting. Back,- says the warrior. Not all relatives support his choice. -I communicate only with my father. Others are zombified by Russian propaganda. I say to them: come and see the destroyed cities and the killed children. Despite the war, the -Estonian- dreams of a family. -If I find my place here, I will stay. Ukraine has become my second Motherland.- For his service, he was awarded the -Golden Cross- of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the award of the President of Ukraine and the badge of the Military Academy. As reported by ArmyInform, on the page of the State Border Service of Ukraine there appeared a story about the first assault of a young border guard with the call sign -Wise-. The boy, who was a cadet last year, now commands a platoon of border guards of the -Steel Border- brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/estonecz-z-morskoyi-pihoty-ukrayina-stala-moyeyu-drugoyu-batkivshhynoyu/	2025-02-20T11:03:26-08:00

-Staff shortage- in -LNR-: Russia is looking for -guest workers- for the occupied Luhansk region	As reported the head of the Luhansk OVA Artem Lysohor, this is a consequence of the forced mobilization carried out by the occupiers. Because of this, the so-called -LNR- was forced to turn to Russia for help. Agreements were signed with several regions of the Russian Federation regarding the invitation of specialists to the occupied Luhansk region. Now, -specialists- will be sought for work in the -LNR- as far as Altai, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kalmykia, North Ossetia-Alania and the Chechen Republic. This fact shows that the Russian occupiers have serious problems with the equipment of their -state- structures on the TOT. Forced mobilization not only deprived enterprises and institutions of qualified workers, but also created an artificial -personnel famine-, which they are now trying to solve with the help of -guest workers- from the Russian Federation. As reported by ArmyInform, the leader of the so-called LNR launched the regional personnel program -Heroes of Luhansk region-, which provides that new the governing elite of the -republic- will be formed from representatives of the Russian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/kadrovyj-golod-v-lnr-rosiya-shukaye-gastrobajteriv-dlya-okupovanoyi-luganshhyny/	2025-02-20T09:53:32-08:00

The star of Banditsky Petersburg got a role in the new TV series: 10 years in absentia	informs the SBU about this. A deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, who is part of the circle of Kremlin propagandists, actively used his recognition to spread anti-Ukrainian narratives. Pevtsov repeatedly spoke at mass events together with Putin, where he supported a full-scale invasion. In addition, on the airs of Russian TV channels, he called for the annexation of Ukrainian territories and denied war crimes committed by the Russian Federation, in particular in Mariupol. The Ukrainian court found him guilty under three articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: For these crimes, Pevtsov was sentenced to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. However, for now he remains on the territory of the Russian Federation, so the actual execution of the sentence will depend on further events. The case was investigated by SBU employees in Vinnytsia region under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office. The court verdict became another signal for all those who promote aggression against Ukraine: even if it seems that the law can be circumvented, justice does not forget. As reported by ArmyInform, The Security Service of Ukraine prevented a terrorist attack in Dnipro - they detained an enemy intelligence group that, on the order the Russian Federation tried to blow up a former law enforcement officer from the regional center.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/zirka-bandytskogo-peterburga-otrymav-rol-u-novomu-seriali-10-rokiv-zaochno/	2025-02-20T09:48:46-08:00
The dog apprehended a smuggler of drug evaders who was trying to escape from the court abroad	informs about this on February 20. The man was moving towards the border on the outskirts of the city of Chop when he was stopped by the soldiers of the -Solomonovo- department. The detainee turned out to be a local resident who was engaged in illegal smuggling of people across the Ukrainian-Hungarian border. -In the past, he was repeatedly detained for attempts to illegally cross the border and for transporting people of draft age on the territory of the same unit. When the case came to the court, the man was afraid of the real deadline and decided to cross the border,- the report says. During the detention, the man tried to escape from the law enforcement officers, but he was stopped with the help of a service dog and taken to the border unit. -The violator was brought to administrative responsibility under Article 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Currently, the issue of changing the preventive measure chosen for him by the court from house arrest to detention is being resolved,- the State Security Service of Ukraine said.

Two against five: how Ukrainian soldiers captured a group of Russian invaders	The story of the fighters was made public on the brigade channel with a link to material of journalist Nadiya Sukhoi. -They walked on the roof and next to it,- recalls one of the defenders. Ukrainian soldiers acted clearly: -I was inside, I could only take cover and shoot in the direction of the window.- Command of the operation took place with the help of drones: -The commander coordinated our every move through the drones.- At a critical moment, -Frank- and -Rupor- stepped forward. One went forward, the other covered from the side. To the sound of explosions and gunfire, the fighters captured the first two Russians. But a message came over the radio: three more are hiding in the same position. -Like a ball — a total of five came out. One asked: -Guys, don't kill!-, says the Ukrainian fighter. The captives were led out with their hands and feet tied so that they would not become targets for drones. The captives were shocked - they did not expect such resistance. -They thought there was no one here, that they should just go in and wait for reinforcements.- But the approach of the occupiers turned out to be a failure: instead of rapidly capturing the territory, they ended up in Ukrainian captivity. The prisoners asked for water and cigarettes. -Behaved humanely,- says one of the soldiers. Soon, experienced fighters arrived at the position and once again checked the prisoners before transporting them. Two wounded Ukrainian soldiers are in hospital. One of them, -Rumin-, left the position on his own, leaning on a machine gun. The other, -Pam,- has already undergone multiple surgeries. As reported by ArmyInform, a story appeared on the page of the State Border Service of Ukraine about the first assault of a young border guard with the call sign -Wise.- The boy, who was a cadet last year, now commands a platoon of border guards of the -Steel Border- brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/dvoye-proty-pyatoh-yak-ukrayinski-voyiny-vzyaly-v-polon-grupu-rosijskyh-okupantiv/	2025-02-20T09:14:25-08:00
Hunting for EW: how Ukrainian drones - smoke out - the enemy's means of radio-electronic warfare	The video of combat work was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The footage shows how the brigade's aerial reconnaissance detects a camouflaged EW and other technical means of the occupiers among the many television and radio antennas on the roof of the building. After that, attack FPV drones are launched, which destroy enemy equipment with jewel-like precision. -The most effective way to disable an enemy's EW is to destroy it. This is exactly what the pilots of the 126th separate brigade do,- says the comment on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, the 126th separate territorial defense brigade demonstrated the high efficiency of using UAVs to destroy enemy targets. This time, an enemy observation post, which was causing significant damage to our troops, came under the crosshairs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/polyuvannya-na-reb-yak-ukrayinski-dronari-vykuryuyut-vorozhi-zasoby-radioelektronnoyi-borotby/	2025-02-20T09:05:40-08:00

-Licking frost from a stick-: 19-year-old Russian, abandoned by the command under the rubble, told h...	The video of the interrogation of a Russian prisoner was made public on the page of the social project, with a link to the telethon -Edyni Novyni-. The boy, wounded and abandoned by his command under the rubble of a destroyed building, fought for survival for eight days before he was found by the Ukrainian military. Sergey, like many other Russian soldiers, became a victim of deception and blackmail by the command. To make up for the losses at the front, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation managed to force the boys to sign a contract, promising them more money and not being sent to the front. -Two people are needed for a day to sign a contract for a -youth-. It turns out that if they don't do this, they will be sent away, and they don't want to. And they want to seem the best - many people sign contracts with us,- says Serhiy. Soon, five young soldiers, including Serhiy, found themselves thousands of kilometers from their native Amur region, in Ukraine. Four of them died, and Serhiy miraculously survived. He spent more than a week without food or water, licking frost from a stick in the morning to at least quench his thirst. Due to the frostbite of both feet, Serhiy is at risk of amputation. He could have returned home a long time ago under the procedure for the repatriation of seriously wounded prisoners of war, but Russia continues to sabotage the launch of the joint medical commissions. It is not known how much longer the boy will remain in captivity, waiting for an exchange. This story is yet another evidence of how the Russian command callously throws its soldiers to certain death, not caring about their lives and health. The -I want to live- project calls on parents of Russian conscripts not to believe the promises of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and to ask for help to save their children from war. -All autumn, we warned the parents of Russian conscripts that their children in the army would be sent to war. How many more of these guys have to disappear before the Russians realize that they are dying not for something -big-, but simply because someone needs to -fulfill a plan-? - says the message of the -I want to live- project. We would like to remind you that the -I want to live- chatbot has dialogue branches for relatives of Russian military personnel who can ask for help and save their loved ones from death. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian conscripts who were captured talk about the conditions of service and the -reward- they received for their participation in combat operations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/zlyzuyuchy-inij-z-palyczi-19-richnyj-rosiyanyn-kynutyj-komanduvannyam-pid-zavalamy-rozpoviv-svoyu-istoriyu-polonu/	2025-02-20T08:41:46-08:00

Rustem Umyerov presented a new model of providing drones for the Ukrainian army	He wrote about this on his Facebook page on February 20. Rustem Umyerov held a meeting with representatives of more than 200 Ukrainian companies engaged in the production of drones. He emphasized the importance of these technologies for modern warfare, as they help destroy enemy equipment, personnel, shoot down helicopters, conduct reconnaissance and provide logistics. The key innovation is the introduction of the DOT-Chain system, which has already proven its effectiveness in non-lethal procurement. This system will allow: The DOT-Chain Defense System gives teams the ability to independently determine which drones they need based on the situation on the battlefield. At the same time, producers get a clear picture of demand and can plan their work more efficiently. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is interested in ensuring that no military personnel wait weeks or months for the necessary equipment. The agency is open to dialogue and cooperation with manufacturers to achieve this goal. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov, together with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, visited Turkey, where he held important negotiations with Defense Minister Yasar Güler and Commander of the Turkish Ground Forces General Selcuk Bayraktaroglu.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/rustem-umyerov-predstavyv-novu-model-zabezpechennya-bezpilotnykiv-dlya-ukrayinskoyi-armiyi/	2025-02-20T08:10:21-08:00

-First among equals-: The Presidential Brigade received an updated arm badge	This is discussed in posts on the brigade page. The new armband contains deep symbolism, each element of which has its own meaning. A golden image of -Serdyutskaya Zora- with a trident in the center is placed in a crimson shield decorated with gold edging. On the diagonals of the shield are two golden crossed divers. Above the shield is a crimson motto ribbon with the gold inscription -First Among Equals-. The crimson color used in the sign is the traditional color of the Ukrainian Cossacks, symbolizing nobility, chivalry, victory and courage. It was the crimson flags that were flown by the Zaporizhia-Sichovites, and there was also the cloth of the 1st -Bohdaniv- regiment, in honor of which the brigade has an honorary name. This color is also the color of the flags and standards of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The -Serdyutska Zorya- depicted on the sign is the cockade of the Serdyutka Division, which included the Bohdaniv Regiment. The divisions were named -Serdyutky- in memory of the Serdyutsky regiments of the Zaporizhzhya Army, who bravely fought against the Muscovites and almost all of them died during the siege of Baturin in 1708. The pirnach depicted on the sign is a type of mace that was used to deliver heavy blows and break through enemy armor. Over time, the pyrnach became a symbol of power and management, one of the symbols of the Ukrainian Cossack chieftainship. For the Separate Presidential Brigade, this symbol reflects its dual task: fighting the enemy on the front line and providing ceremonial and accompanying events with the participation of the state's top military and political leadership. The separate presidential brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi is one of the largest in the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the only one without a number in the name. From the first days of the full-scale invasion, the brigade has been engaged in combat, defending the capital and striking the enemy in the east of the country. The brigade also performs important ceremonial functions, accompanying the first persons of the state at solemn events and being the first to meet foreign delegations. -We stand in the front lines on the Ukrainian front and beat the enemy on its territory. We continue the tradition of the First Cossack Regiment named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi - the first Hetman of free Ukraine!- - says the message of the brigade. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 3rd mechanized battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi prevented the Russians from advancing in the Vremivsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/pershi-sered-rivnyh-prezydentska-brygada-otrymala-onovlenyj-narukavnyj-znak/	2025-02-20T07:54:27-08:00

Particular attention was paid to the Russian Federation's cooperation with China, Iran and North Korea. Serhiy Boyev emphasized Ukraine's constant needs for air defense and anti-missile systems and interceptor missiles for them, heavy armored vehicles, ammunition and investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. The deputy minister noted that Ukrainian defense companies have a production potential of $35 billion by 2025, which may not be fully utilized due to a lack of funding. He emphasized the importance of increasing defense spending in the next UK budget. Also among the proposals was the prospect of joint production of drones, because Ukraine has the expertise and experience for this. Serhii Boev informed the British parliamentarians that Russia continues to increase the volume of production of its own defense industry, develop recruiting and personnel training. There are no signs of the aggressor's readiness to cease hostilities, the deputy minister emphasized. Phil Breakell and David Taylor assured that Great Britain understands all the threats and risks, so it continues to stand by Ukraine in this battle: -Our relationship is unique and we will continue to support you. We can't waste time, we need to build up our own capabilities, including in Europe.- Representatives of the Labor Party assured of defending Ukrainian interests within the Parliament of Great Britain and in relations with other European partners.

An exhibition was opened in the capital to mark the anniversary of the Russian Federation's large-sc...	Together with the mothers of the Heroes, the teachers of the CPSU organized the personal belongings of Andrii and Badri so that the visitors could feel the pain of losing such bright, devoted defenders, and at the same time pride for the soldiers who gave their lives for the independence of Ukraine. A mobile exhibition created by specialists of the National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine and a photo exhibition dedicated to episodes of the Russian-Ukrainian war, which has been ongoing since 2014, are also presented. The exposition is timed to the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation and the eleventh anniversary of the beginning of Russia's war against Ukraine. This is an event for all those affected by the tragedy that has come to our land. This is gratitude to everyone who protects our state every day, every hour, every minute, who protects our present. Addressing the audience, the director of the Kyiv Palace of Children and Youth, Oksana Dobrovolska, said: - We are opening a very touching, patriotic exhibition in support of those boys who are protecting our country today. Such projects form the historical memory of our people. Today is a very difficult time for our country. The incurable pain of lost lives, the broken destinies of Ukrainians, the difficult traumatic experience of whole generations of Ukrainians are our realities today. But our entire team supports our state every minute, every day, in every circle, at events, because you and I are strong. We believe that victory will be ours. The mother of the Hero of Ukraine Andrii Pilshchikov, associate professor of the Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics, Liliya Averyanova, spoke about who we should look up to in a world that changes wildly every day, where every day we must gather our strength to continue fighting for the future. By the way, Andriy Pilshchikov has been to the aerospace center of the CPSU several times. And thanks to his mother, a museum has been created there today. Therefore, future pilots have someone to take an example from. - You see how fast our life is going, and we understand that the life of our state depends on how smart we are, how we are determined to fight, how we are ready to respond to these changes. No matter how dark the present is, we must first of all push back from the mission that our Heroes carried out. Because they went ahead, they went beyond what we imagined for an individual. And it is they who teach us by their example, and that is why we tried to collect as many interesting things as possible, so that through these exhibits, through this exposition, you will understand as much as possible what you should be like now. Because this is a question of our life, our survival, - noted Liliya Averyanova. And the mother of educator Badri Lalashvili, Larisa Lalashvili, who today works in the Palace and continues her son's work, said: - I am very grateful to everyone that you remember, that you honor the memory of our hero. I thank educators, friends, colleagues who continue his work, his work. His dreams, as he wanted, they come true. And Heroes are alive. As long as we remember them. We will always remember them. The exhibition, created by specialists of the National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine, is a unique format and project that allows you to see up close the irrefutable evidence of Russia's war crimes: fragments of deadly weapons used by the aggressor to destroy Ukrainian cities and villages, draw attention to the crimes of the Russian Federation and the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people, see with your own eyes real evidence of the war and realize the scale of the destruction caused by the occupier. The Deputy Director of the National Military Historical Museum of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Yury Koshel talked about the work of the museum and its ongoing projects. - Today we are presenting an exhibition that reminds us of how the historical events that we are witnessing today began. The National Military Historical Museum collects artifacts so that people know about the causes of these events, their consequences, emphasizes the role of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the role of all Defense Forces in heroic resistance. Of course, our largest exhibition is in our museum. This is only a part of the work that we constantly carry out, - emphasized Yuriy Koshel. Also present at the opening of the exhibition were brothers of -Jusa- and priest Kostyantyn Panteley, a junior lieutenant of the chaplaincy service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who, before mobilization, served at the Askold grave, where the body of the hero-aviator rests, whose photos and personal belongings are displayed in the exhibition. - I had the privilege of being at the service when we said goodbye to Hero Andrii Pilshchikov. When we say the word Hero, it means that this person has absorbed in his life, sometimes very short, all the traits that every civilization on earth, every generation, every person considers to be the highest valor or the highest virtue that defines the human race. Sometimes we work our whole lives to cultivate at least one such virtue. The heroes have these virtues, the best traits that we want to imitate, as if crystallized over many generations, the military chaplain emphasized. These words are especially symbolic today, on the Day of Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred, who were the first to fall in our war for Independence.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/u-stolyczi-vidkryly-vystavku-do-rokovyn-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya-rf-v-ukrayinu/	2025-02-20T06:33:49-08:00

About this informs the GUR of the IOU with a link to commentary of its representative Andrii Yusov for -RBC-Ukraine-. -Of course, these are fakes,- Andriy Yusov emphasized. He emphasized that such statements are a direct threat to destabilize the situation in other countries, because -Putin's special services are good at organizing various provocations and terrorist attacks, including against their own citizens.- The representative of the GUR noted that the world is aware of the absurdity of these accusations, but the propaganda machine of the Russian Federation needs constant feeding of such fakes. -The whole world understands the absurdity of these statements, but propaganda tasks require certain actions, even if they absolutely do not stand up to any criticism,- he explained. This is not the first such fake from the Russian special services. Previously, they spread lies about Ukraine allegedly preparing attacks on representatives of the so-called Russian opposition abroad.

-Deputy head- burned at the workplace: a Russian war criminal was eliminated in Berdyansk	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. As reported by the GUR, Yevgeny Bogdanov, a Russian war criminal who served as the so-called -deputy head- of the occupation administration of Berdyansk, was in the passenger compartment of the burning car.

However, as noted in the GUR, Bogdanov was not just a collaborator, but also a war criminal who repeatedly committed crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine. The traitor was born in the Russian city of Pikalyovo, in the Leningrad region. He arrived in Berdyansk immediately after the capture of the city by Russian troops in 2022 and was appointed to his -post- on the instructions of the Russian special services.

-They show with their hands where to go-: order transmitters are attached to them to command North K...	told this on the -Social News- broadcast by the chief sergeant of the 47th separate mechanized brigade under the call sign -Azimuth-. According to him, a few days ago in the Kursk region, the fighters of the brigade defeated a group of attack aircraft from the DPRK. 14 North Koreans were killed or seriously wounded. They walked across the field in a large group without any connection. -It is very strange that they walked alone, without a radio station. We understand that they had some kind of map before leaving. It was explained to them where they should gather, where they should wait. And when our pilots saw that up to 12 Koreans were gathering in one place in a dugout or a trench, it was a great goal for us,- Azimut said. Now, according to the chief sergeant of the 47th brigade, 2-3 servicemen from the Russian Federation are being added to the group of Koreans. They work as transmitters of orders. -They do not understand each other very well, although there is a connection with other units that command these North Koreans. But if military personnel do not understand each other, then there will be chaos. They can show them with their hands where to go, what to do, but in general there is no understanding as such,- said the chief sergeant of the company of the 47th separate mechanized brigade. As ArmyInform reported, in the Serebryan forest, on the border of Luhansk region and Donetsk region, hostilities continue with high intensity Artillery, mortars, drones work non-stop.

Our soldiers in an armored car quickly reached the enemy and forced him to hide underground. After that, the Russians placed an anti-tank mine on the dugout and retreated.

- I see a blanket hanging that was not here. I went there - a grenade-: the story of a fighter who d...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Dmytro was a truck driver in civilian life, and at the front he became a guide who leads his comrades to positions and returns them back. And, as he himself says, a little -crazy-. One night, for the third time in a shift, Dmytro led a group of fighters to an observation post. The path lay through abandoned trenches. When they jumped into the trench, the shooting began. At first it seemed that it was fire from his own people, but moving forward a little, Dmytro noticed a blanket at the crossing, which was not there a few hours ago. Hiding, they overheard the Russians' talks on the walkie-talkie. The reaction was instantaneous - a grenade, automatic fire, comrades pulled up, and the enemy was destroyed. Three occupiers escaped, but were eliminated by drones. War does not divide into -own- and -foreign-. When the neighboring brigade could not pick up the injured 26-year-old girl for four days, Dmytro went to help. He knows that he is responsible for each fighter, because -someone is waiting for each of them at home.- Before each mission, Dmitry studies the terrain, memorizing every tree and ditch. When leading groups, never take more than three people - a large crowd becomes an easy target for enemy drones and artillery. The longest way to the positions, which had to be covered on foot, is 8 km. Dmytro has two wounds, not including contusions. He was last hit by a mortar fragment while on a mission, but he managed to mine the area with the engineers. The best way to avoid being hit by an FPV, in his opinion, is to hide. -In the bush, in the pit - the main thing is that the drone loses sight of you.- Once they sat in a hole for four hours while enemy drones exploded around them. One of the most difficult moments is the evacuation of a fighter who could not move on his own. For nine hours, Dmytro helped pull him out of the shelling, overcoming fatigue and danger. Brothers from a neighboring brigade helped to complete the mission. In addition to weapons, a bulletproof vest and EW devices, Dmitry has one more personal amulet - three icons and a photo of his wife. -Effective since 2014,- smiles the warrior. As reported by ArmyInform, who would have thought that a former waiter and carpenter would become one of the best UAV operators in the Armed Forces?

He jokes that -the geography has now been significantly expanded.- But he seriously adds that he was lucky to work, and most importantly, to survive in the Kherson, Zaporizhzhya, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk directions. Although he serves in the combined rifle brigade -Coyote- by profession - he holds the position of deputy chief of communications, during this time he also mastered several additional specialties - rifleman, machine gunner, grenade launcher, driver, paramedic. His task as a communicator includes not only providing coverage, setting up the communication system, flashing stations, programming, working with telecommunications, intercom devices. It is often necessary to directly transport the means of communication to the positions and configure them on the spot. -And it just sounds simple. Because the most difficult thing is to get into a position and get out of it intact. It is at such moments that the greatest losses occur. We were met with everything: artillery, mortars, drones, KABs, helicopters&#8230; My boys and I repeatedly came under fire,- he said. However, according to him, there are not enough people at the front, so it is necessary to help in every possible way. -It doesn't matter in which type or branch of the army you serve - we all fulfill the same duty, because it is clear what is at stake. I won't hide it: here, on the front line, it's difficult. Maybe even harder than we all expected. We are holding on, we are not losing heart, we are fighting back - every day minus the Russian cannon fodder,- -Coyote- assured. -Coyote- fought on many fronts. I had to experience moments of success on the battlefield, as well as failures and losses of comrades. -Somehow, our boys missed a bit and got into a position towards the Rashists. It is a dark night in the yard, they are with flashlights, and also with water and food. They reached the enemy dugout and heard: -Stop! Who's an idiot?- You can't confuse racism with anything here, they realized that they were in serious trouble,- he recalled. After assessing the situation, the fighters realized that there was no other option but to run from there. -They ran so fast that even professional sprinters would be envious. Even water was not left for the occupiers! In the morning, thanks to our spontaneous -improvised reconnaissance- (with a happy ending), as well as an accurate drop from a drone, -two hundred- orcs were -two hundred- in this Russian dugout,- the man reported. It is noted that Oleksandr Zavhorodnyi was in the Vovchanskyi direction, where the Russians already traditionally use scorched earth tactics. -A few days after our conversation, an order came to transfer the Coyote to one of the brigades of the airborne assault troops,- the Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces noted. -Coyote- noted that the distance to the enemy is currently calculated in meters. -Despite all the trials right now, I and my brothers are absolutely sure that we are where they are needed the most! And we are not at all concerned with titles, career growth, finances. - emphasized the fighter under the pseudonym -Coyote-. As reported by ArmyInform, two Ukrainian soldiers - -Vyshnya- and -Kolomiya- - spent 45 days surrounded, resisting the Russians invaders and eventually making a bold breakthrough to their fellows. Their story is proof of the courage, resilience and indomitable spirit of Ukrainian soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/u-vorozhomu-blindazhi-zadvohsotyly-z-desyatok-orkiv-yak-nashi-bijczi-vypadkovo-natrapyly-na-pozycziyu-rf/	2025-02-20T03:09:19-08:00

Kursk children of corn: the Russians attack, hiding in fields with cobs	told this on the air -Suspilne.Novyny- by the chief sergeant of the 47th separate mechanized brigade company with the call sign -Azimuth-. According to him, anti-aircraft guns and artillery always work before an enemy assault on the positions of the Defense Forces. Then small infantry groups go. -If our boys build themselves some dugouts, our boys build themselves some shelters, some loopholes - everything is destroyed by anti-tank missiles and self-propelled guns.

From time to time they are -rolled- by armored vehicles. -They tried to come to us in a large convoy. It should have been two columns. But we destroyed their first column, there were three tanks and three armored personnel carriers. When their infantry dispersed, they did not make a second assault. They began to look for some workarounds. Probably one of the problems in this area is that there are large cornfields that are very difficult to burn. And their fighters can pass through these cornfields one at a time,- Azimut noted. As ArmyInform reported, in the Serebryan forest, on the border of Luhansk region and Donetsk region, hostilities continue with high intensity Artillery, mortars, drones work non-stop.

1.2 million veterans in Ukraine: how a system of comprehensive support and adaptation is created	About this told the head of one of the successful veteran projects of the NGO -Space of Opportunities- Oksana Christmas carol Today, there are already more than 1.2 million veterans, active military personnel and those released from service in Ukraine. -The first requests for assistance to veterans began to arrive in 2015, when I was in military service during the active phase of hostilities. It was about the issues of rehabilitation, social benefits, processing of documents. In particular, we managed to create a whole support system that is expanding and becoming more effective,- Oksana Kolyada noted. According to her, the experience is being scaled up, and now the initiative covers not only the issue of rehabilitation, but also the career development of veterans. -We strive for every veteran to be able to realize his potential. It can be employment, entrepreneurship or social activity. Foreigners study because they see our model as effective,- said Oksana Kolyada. She noted that in recent years, public perception of soldiers who returned from the front has changed significantly. If earlier there were certain stereotypes, now veterans receive more support and recognition. At the same time, after the end of active hostilities, the level of attention to this category of citizens may change, so it is important to work on long-term programs for their integration. -At the level of communities and local self-government, work with veterans is often organized more effectively than at the national level. In particular, it was possible to involve local leaders in the support process, because they know the needs of their residents better,- said Oksana Kolyada.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/12-mln-veteraniv-v-ukrayini-yak-stvoryuyetsya-systema-kompleksnoyi-pidtrymky-ta-adaptacziyi/	2025-02-19T23:16:45-08:00

There are over 1.2 million veterans in Ukraine: civil society helps the state in their adaptation an...	Oksana Kolyada, head of one of the successful veteran projects of the NGO -Space of Opportunities-, told about this. Vacancies, business, rehabilitation, health restoration needs - all this is part of the system of supporting veterans, which should work from the moment of their return to their full integration into society. Veterans receive social, professional and psychological support that helps them adapt to peaceful life. The state, local communities and civil society are working on solving these issues. The latter, in order to better coordinate their work, united in the public union -Coalition of Veteran Spaces- - 26 organizations working in the field. These are veteran spaces that provide services and support to both veterans and their families. And on the basis of veterans' spaces, veterans' support specialists are now working. They assess the needs of each and every person returning from war and provide access to resources to meet that need. It is about restoring health, rehabilitation, as well as socio-economic reintegration: education, business, etc. -According to the register of the Ministry of Veterans, there is currently information on more than 1.2 million veterans in Ukraine. As for data on the number of veterans serving in the Defense Forces, only the military has such information,- Oksana Kolyada said. Support specialists must plan the process: from health restoration to implementation in the economic sphere. -Accompaniment of a veteran is a lifelong story. Because a person covers his primary needs in six months to a year. But further on, there may be a need for health restoration, or continuing education or professional development. Therefore, support specialists will keep in touch on a permanent basis,- Oksana Kolyada stressed. -The first requests for assistance to veterans began to arrive in 2015, when I was in military service during the active phase of hostilities. It was about the issues of rehabilitation, social benefits, processing of documents. In particular, it was possible to create a whole support system that is expanding and becoming more effective,- said Oksana Kolyada, head of the -Space of Possibilities- GO. According to her, the experience is being scaled up, and now the initiative covers not only the issue of rehabilitation, but also the career development of veterans. -We strive for every veteran to be able to realize his potential. It can be employment, entrepreneurship or social activity. Foreigners study because they see our model as effective,- said Oksana Kolyada. In recent years, the public perception of soldiers who have returned from the front has changed significantly. If earlier there were certain stereotypes, now veterans receive more support and recognition. At the same time, after the end of active hostilities, the level of attention to this category of citizens may change, so it is important to work on long-term programs for their integration. -At the level of communities and local self-government, work with veterans is often organized more effectively than at the national level. In particular, it was possible to involve local leaders in the support process, because they know the needs of their residents better,- said Oksana Kolyada. Adaptation of veterans to peaceful life includes physical and psychological rehabilitation, finding work or opportunities for professional development. Support for families is also an important aspect, because the immediate environment is the first to help military personnel in their transition to a peaceful life. -We work not only with veterans, but also with their families. It is important that the family is ready to accept a person with new experience, understand and support him. In particular, it was possible to implement a number of educational programs for military families,- says Kolyada. According to the head of the -Space of Opportunities- project, one of the effective tools of assistance are veteran spaces - places where informational, psychological and professional support is provided. They operate across the country and offer a wide range of services, from advice to training programs and career opportunities. -Veteran spaces are not just meeting places. These are hubs where people can get help, find like-minded people and plan their future. The experience is being scaled up, and we see how similar initiatives are beginning to develop in other countries,- she said. Veterans and their families can contact specialized organizations and public initiatives working in this field. Contacts, addresses of centers and current news can be found on relevant resources in social networks or official websites. -It is important that every veteran knows that there is support and that the state and public initiatives are working for them. Foreigners study, because our model of an integrated approach can be applied in other countries,- said Oksana Kolyada. Supporting veterans remains an important aspect of public life. The quality of their adaptation and the opportunity to realize themselves in a peaceful life depends on the availability of effective programs and long-term initiatives. Successful integration of veterans is a task that requires a systematic approach and constant attention. Veterans can get the necessary information at the following information resources:	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/v-ukrayini-ponad-12-mln-veteraniv-gromadyanske-suspilstvo-dopomagaye-derzhavi-v-yih-adaptacziyi-ta-praczevlashtuvanni-oksana-kolyada/	2025-02-19T12:47:47-08:00

Colombians in position and - massacre - face to face with the enemy FPV: the story of the mortar - R...	He is 27 years old, he has been in the war since he was 19. Today we tell his story. Junior sergeant Roman with the call sign -Romario- is a mortar commander of a mortar calculation in the ranks of the 23rd separate mechanized brigade. When he turned 19 in 2017, he joined the ATO, on a contract with the 92nd brigade. There he was a senior gunner of -Gvozdyky-, they worked in the Maryinka and Avdiyivka area. After demobilization, he served in the Military Commissariat. Then - civilian life, he was an auto mechanic-welder at one of the country's large metallurgical enterprises. With the beginning of the large-scale invasion, he was initially in the infantry. He was 25 years old in 2022. The soldier recounts the details of his work: -First we go, we choose a position so that there is a normal place, more trees for camouflage. Then the next day we drive in, set up our mortar. The main plus is that we have Starlink. We are working on the -Zelenka-: we got a call, -to the battle-, we quickly ran out, started up, threw a mine and shot,- the military man recounts deliciously. He talks warmly about his brothers. For example, about a 60-year-old fighter with the call sign -Dobro-. -Could have quit - but stayed, signed a contract for a year, continues to serve with us. And you can't say that he is 60 years old: he runs better than a young man.- -Romario- and his team work accurately and effectively, even the battalion commander praised. During the execution of combat missions, he destroyed 15 units of the enemy's manpower with small arms. One of the difficult combat points on the battle map of our interlocutor is Chasiv Yar. They lived in cellars, not in dugouts. -There was a lot of FPV&#8230; And the dances worked. And in general, everything was fine,- says the army man. And tells about one of the cases involving enemy FPV. -Once we were in position in the dugout. They hung a camouflage net and an efpivishka flew in: it got tangled up, but did not explode. The battery began to -spit-. I got so sick of this sound that I just got out, disconnected it and then handed it over to our pilot guys. The projectile remained there, did not explode, we then disconnected it and threw it as far as possible. The drone was simply entangled in the camouflage net.- And once there was a case, he recalls, when a Colombian infantryman went to Ukrainian positions, it was a little over a month ago. -We are standing in a position - and we hear a foreign language nearby. We came out with automatics. We were told something like: -Yours, don't shoot.- And then they started speaking in Spanish. It was not clear to us, we started communicating through an online translator. He said that their car was broken into, he didn't know where to go - he came out on us. We called his superiors, they advised us what to do. Then we took him to their commander and everything ended well.- At the moment when it was possible to communicate with -Romario-, his unit went out of combat. A week off - and back in action.

Less than a second per target: an Indian company tested its own air defense system to combat swarms ...	The Indian press praised the development of local gunsmiths in a typical Asian manner with the use of superlatives. In particular, reporters from Times of India magazine said that -Nagpur-based Solar Group has developed the world's first manned drone system to combat drones. micro-missiles,- ArmiyaInform notes. In turn, the authors of the portal Bharat Shakti informed that the two-day practical field tests were held at the Gopalpur Seaward training grounds. The system is claimed to have successfully engaged designated virtual targets at a distance of over 2.5 km. -The Bhargavastra complex is equipped with advanced capabilities, including detection of even small UAVs at a distance of more than 6 kilometers. It neutralizes threats with guided micromunitions, ensuring precision and effectiveness,- the publication says. It is noted that the anti-aircraft missile installation can be placed on a mobile platform for rapid deployment. In its statement, the development company Economic Explosives Ltd claims that its air defense system can destroy enemy UAVs with destructive means -at an affordable price.- -The system can also be integrated into the existing network of the armed forces for network-centric warfare,- the Indian arms makers said in a statement. In turn, researchers from the defense site The Defense post reported some technical characteristics of the Indian air defense system. Bhargavastra can monitor the airspace with the help of an on-board radar system equipped with 4 radars at an angle of 90 degrees, providing coverage of 360 degrees. The Bhargavastra radar has a range of 10 kilometers (6.21 mi) and can detect micro-drones up to 6 kilometers (3.7 mi). In addition, the system uses electro-optical infrared sensors for effective target identification in different lighting conditions and artificial intelligence for improved threat detection and analysis. The optical system integrated into the complex also provides accurate detection of targets with low radar visibility. The Bhargavastra complex can reportedly engage 64 targets simultaneously and be integrated with existing military networks. At the same time, each of the minimissiles can be launched with an interval of less than one second. According to the developers, the system is particularly effective against swarms of autonomous drones resistant to traditional methods of jamming by EW stations. Experts of the Ukrainian military-analytical portal IKK Defense Express (DE) assume that the most likely presented Indian complex uses a system of remote control of anti-aircraft missiles (so-called -target illumination-) in order to reduce their price. After all, missiles with a homing head are too expensive, and therefore are a bad option for fighting much cheaper drones. -And although according to the announced characteristics, the Bhargavastra is a very interesting and, as it seems, conceptually correct anti-drone complex, its true effectiveness against a swarm of drones still depends on the real number of targets it can simultaneously destroy,- DE analysts add. The complex can be installed on a number of mobile platforms for rapid deployment and work in a variety of climatic conditions. Together with the sensor mast and the future soft-kill option, the multi-level system can be integrated into a 7.5-tonne all-terrain vehicle on a 4x4 chassis. At the same time, according to the conclusions of researchers from Defense Express, such a system has a limited channel, and nothing is known about the existence of systems that can fire at dozens of targets at once. A possible explanation is that multi-channel is achieved due to the placement of 4 radars at once, which are directed in four directions. And the clarification about the one-second pause between launches is also about the reserve of time that the missile needs to hit the target at a distance of 2.5 km. This complex was specially designed to meet the operational needs of the Indian Armed Forces. However, as its manufacturers note, this air defense system will be presented to potential foreign buyers. Bhargavastra anti-aircraft missile system presentation.

Ukraine commemorates the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred	It was then that the Ukrainian Revolution turned into a war of national liberation, which continues to this day and will be able to end only after the destruction of the -colossus on clay feet-, which is now called the Russian Federation. — Already at that time, in Mariinsky Park, the Russian terrorist Khyrkin faced the guys who chased him like a dog from Slovyansk in a few months. And the GRUshniks -Petrov- and -Boshirov- under the guise of Russian nationalists registered in Maidanovka. Even then, not just the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred went to heaven, but the soldiers of the Russian-Ukrainian war, - recalls the author of the term Revolution of Dignity, then a People's Deputy of Ukraine, and now the chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th Armored Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yuriy Syrotyuk. The Revolutionary Maidan in February 2014 is the latest sign of Ukrainian statehood. The Heavenly Hundred are the knights of light, as well as the Krutyans, who showed with their blood what the Ukrainian people are worth. We well remember the coffins that floated through the sea of ​​weeping people on the Independence Square to the sound of -The Duck Floats along the Tysyn-. This memorial service on February 21, 2014, for the fallen heroes of the Revolution of Dignity in the symbolism of the formation of our state, became one with the mass funerals of the heroes who fell in the Battle of Kruty, which took place on March 19, 1918. During the funeral of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred over the Maidan, despite the rain, a swan flew low, directly over the burned-out Trade Union Building, where the headquarters and hospital were located. It was a symbol of eternity and immortality. So their glory and grateful memory of them will live forever among the people, with our freedom together. Obsessed with the idea of ​​reconstruction of the -USSR-2-, the Kremlin maniac, from whom the revolution took away fully controlled Ukraine, finally went crazy and began a military invasion of our country. Already a year later, the Russian offspring felt for themselves what happens to those who come to our land with weapons and slogans of -Russian peace- during the heroic resistance of the Debaltsivka ledge. But everything was just beginning&#8230; Many brothers have joined the heavenly host over the years. There is no longer one Heavenly Hundred, but several Heavenly Brigades. And we, those on earth, keep our lines stronger. The second Koliivshchyna has been going on in Ukraine for three years now. The fury of our people is so terrible that a dozen orcs are destroyed for every brother. And no Trump and no -Saudi conspiracy- will be able to stop this just revenge. It should end only with the just punishment of criminals - whether on the battlefield or in the courtroom, at the second Nuremberg Tribunal. No, these are not empty pathetic words. For many, revenge against racist criminals has already become a matter of life. And it will not end when, ignoring the victim, the policeman and the criminal put their autographs on some piece of paper. It is well known that agreements with Russia are not even worth the paper they are written on. We have to do our own thing&#8230; We survived then, during the Revolution of Dignity.

Fantasies of Kremlin propagandists about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant: another absurdity from t...	It would seem that this is too much even for Russian fantasists, but no. They are seriously trying to convince the world that Kyiv is interested in re-transforming the exclusion zone into an apocalypse zone. 1. Why should Ukraine arrange a nuclear disaster at home? It is obvious that any damage to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant will cause radiation emissions, which will primarily affect Ukraine and neighboring countries. If we follow the -logic- of Kremlin propagandists, then Kyiv voluntarily wants to get a second Pripyat. Well, of course. 2. The Chernobyl zone is already under Ukrainian control. Since the spring of 2022, there have been no Russian occupiers there, so even a hypothetical -attack- looks somewhat ridiculous. We are not Russians to shell our own positions, passing it off as -successes-. 3. The world community is already tired of Russian fabrications, the Kremlin regularly stamps such -sensations-, and then cannot confirm them in any way. From the series: -NATO combat geese are working in Ukraine-, -Kyiv is developing a dirty bomb-, -Ukrainian special forces blew up the Kremlin-&#8230; Now the -attack on Chernobyl- has been added to this list. 4. Russia itself creates nuclear threats While Moscow talks about the -Ukrainian threat-, it itself occupied the Zaporizhia NPP, shelled its territory and threatens the world with nuclear blackmail. So, as they say, who would say&#8230; It's simple: another attempt to divert attention from one's own crimes. While the Kremlin is spreading delusions about Chernobyl, the situation on the front is not the best. So it is necessary to come up with some kind of -sensation- to intimidate the West and somehow justify its aggression. But there is one problem: no one will believe it anymore. Even the most ardent fans of Russian propaganda channels understand that they are fed not just lies, but some psychedelic visions. The Kremlin proves once again that its propaganda machine works on the principle -the stupider the fake, the better.- But Ukraine, like the entire civilized world, knows one thing: the only real threat comes from Russia. And if there is a danger of a new nuclear catastrophe, it is due to the actions of the Russian military, which, it seems, does not know what to do next.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/fantaziyi-kremlivskyh-propagandystiv-pro-chornobylsku-aes-chergovyj-absurd-vid-rf/	2025-02-19T20:14:04-08:00
There are more than 1.3 million veterans in Ukraine: civil society helps the state in their adaptati...	Oksana Kolyada, head of one of the successful veteran projects of the NGO &#8220;Space of Opportunities&#8221;, told about this. Vacancies, business, rehabilitation, health restoration needs - all this is part of the system of supporting veterans, which should work from the moment of their return to their full integration into society. Veterans receive social, professional and psychological support that helps them adapt to peaceful life. The state, local communities and civil society are working on solving these issues. The latter, in order to better coordinate their work, united in an association. -The first requests for assistance to veterans began to arrive during the active phase of hostilities. It was about the issues of rehabilitation, social benefits, processing of documents. In particular, it was possible to create an entire support system that is expanding and becoming more effective,- said Oksana Kolyada, head of the -Space of Possibilities- organization. According to her, the experience is being scaled up, and now the initiative covers not only the issue of rehabilitation, but also the career development of veterans. -We strive for every veteran to be able to realize his potential. It can be employment, entrepreneurship or social activity. Foreigners study because they see our model as effective,- said Oksana Kolyada. In recent years, public perception of soldiers who returned from the front has changed significantly. If earlier there were certain stereotypes, now veterans receive more support and recognition. At the same time, after the end of active hostilities, the level of attention to this category of citizens may change, so it is important to work on long-term programs for their integration. -At the level of communities and local self-government, work with veterans is often organized more effectively than at the national level. In particular, it was possible to involve local leaders in the support process, because they know the needs of their residents better,- said Oksana Kolyada. Adaptation of veterans to peaceful life includes physical and psychological rehabilitation, finding work or opportunities for professional development. Also, an important aspect is the support of families, because it is the immediate environment that first helps military personnel in their transition to a peaceful life. -We work not only with veterans, but also with their families. It is important that the family is ready to accept a person with a new experience, understand and support him. In particular, it was possible to implement a number of educational programs for military families,- says Kolyada. According to the head of the -Space of Possibilities- project, one of the effective tools of assistance are veteran spaces - places where informational, psychological and professional support is provided. They operate across the country and offer a wide range of services, from advice to training programs and career opportunities. -Veteran spaces are not just meeting places. These are hubs where people can get help, find like-minded people and plan their future. The experience is being scaled up, and we see how similar initiatives are beginning to develop in other countries,- she said. Veterans and their families can contact specialized organizations and public initiatives working in this field. Contacts, addresses of centers and current news can be found on relevant resources in social networks or official websites. -It is important that every veteran knows that there is support and that the state and public initiatives are working for them. Foreigners study, because our model of an integrated approach can be applied in other countries,- Oksana Kolyada noted. Supporting veterans remains an important aspect of public life. The quality of their adaptation and the opportunity to realize themselves in a peaceful life depends on the availability of effective programs and long-term initiatives. Successful integration of veterans is a task that requires a systematic approach and constant attention.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/v-ukrayini-ponad-13-mln-veteraniv-gromadyanske-suspilstvo-dopomagaye-derzhavi-v-yih-adaptacziyi-ta-praczevlashtuvanni-oksana-kolyada/	2025-02-19T12:47:47-08:00

-Master of Marines: The Story of a Support Regiment Sergeant Major	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. His military career began in the National Guard of Ukraine, then he served for a long time in the Ground Forces. In 2021, he signed another contract and decided to continue his service in the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -There was a desire to try my hand at the Marine Corps. I had friends there, and on their recommendation, I got into the family of marines,- -Master- recalls. The Marine Corps has its own personnel requirements. Among the most important are competence and continuous personal development. Each Marine, depending on the role and place in the unit, must have a thorough knowledge and command of the tools and techniques that ensure the accomplishment of the assigned tasks. -The competence and training of a Marine comes first. Constant training is mandatory for fighters. This personnel is helped by commanders who, by their own example, thus build the trust of their subordinates in themselves. Mentoring is the cornerstone of success in training personnel,- said Master Sgt. The position of regimental chief sergeant is responsible and requires attention and professionalism. Training personnel, providing servicemen with material means and tools, creating and maintaining discipline and a healthy microclimate in the unit - this is far from an exhaustive list of the -Master's- duties. -First of all, you must always be a person, look for an individual approach to each fighter. My subordinates should feel cared for and cared for. They know they're not alone with their problems,- the Marine smiles softly. It is thanks to the daily and persistent work of people like -The Master- that Marine Corps units are able to develop, improve and be ready for combat missions in any environment. As reported by ArmyInform, two Ukrainian soldiers - -Vyshnya- and -Kolomiya- - spent 45 days surrounded, resisting the Russians invaders and eventually making a bold breakthrough to their fellows. Their story is proof of the courage, resilience and indomitable spirit of Ukrainian soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/majster-morskoyi-pihoty-istoriya-golovnogo-serzhanta-polku-pidtrymky/	2025-02-19T11:53:22-08:00

-Secret- assistant of naval special forces: which is in the backpack of the SSO operator	The use of the minesweeper by SSO operators was reported on page 73 of the SSO Maritime Center. The photos published by the SSO center show a mine detector, a common item for combat groups. However, this model has an interesting feature - it can be used both on land and in water. After all, danger in the form of mines can lie in wait for soldiers anywhere. This minesweeper meets several important criteria that are defining for a special agent. -We use it to detect mines, engineering barriers, while traversing minefields. First comes an engineer with a minesweeper, he -breaks through- the path and the main group comes behind him, which at the same time covers him,- the soldiers of the 73rd SSO center say. In use, this device is quite simple, so, if necessary, it can be used by any of the operators of the group. -We use it all the time. And during training, we also practice working with a minesweeper,- the commandos note. As reported by ArmyInform, in modern combat, where it is often necessary to operate in conditions of limited visibility, a flashlight on a weapon is a critically important item of equipment. Operators of the 73rd Special Purpose Marine Center shared their experience using different types of lights and their importance for the success of operations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/sekretnyj-pomichnyk-morskyh-speczpryznachencziv-shho-znahodytsya-v-ryukzaku-operatora-sso/	2025-02-19T11:07:28-08:00

About the little secrets of this profession told a soldier of the GUR special unit of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Artan- with the call sign -Korean-. The main -ritual- for a sniper, according to the -Korean-, is full concentration on the task. The success of the task depends on how thoroughly the fighter has prepared for it. -Before doing anything, snipers always analyze all available information. If further investigation is required, we conduct it. We study the area. Ways of entry, exit, various backup options. If you study everything, you get the confidence that you can do it,- shares the -Korean-. An important stage of preparation is also arranging the position. -If there is an opportunity, we go out and prepare a position. Because if something starts, and you don't have a prepared position, you're not ready to execute it,- says the fighter of the Artan special forces. He also adds that snipers always plan in advance where they will take positions and, if possible, prepare them in advance. This allows you to be ready for any development and to successfully complete the task. As ArmyInform reported, -If you want to win, fight!- — this is exactly the principle that warriors of -Artan- operate, turning these words into the daily reality of the Ukrainian resistance. New exclusive footage captures how the coordinated work of scouts, stormtroopers, gunners and FPV drone operators translates into precision strikes that inflict heavy losses on the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/konczentracziya-ponad-use-boyecz-speczpidrozdilu-gur-rozkryv-sekrety-uspihu-snajperiv/	2025-02-19T10:56:18-08:00

He is a versatile soldier who is equally good with weapons and medical skills. On his shoulders is a heavy burden of responsibility. -Pale- not only performs combat tasks, but also saves his comrades by evacuating them from under fire and providing first aid. -You need to understand what is really necessary for yourself and for your brothers,- he notes. Sometimes his gear weighs more than his own weight, but that doesn't stop him. Adrenaline is his loyal ally that helps him do superhuman things. -Pale- is not only a professional, but also a person with a big heart. Once he had to save a wounded occupier. -I wasn't happy about it, but I treated him like a man to a man,- he recalls. This episode shows that even in a war where cruelty and hatred reign, there is still room for mercy and compassion. The story of The Pale One is the story of an ordinary guy who became a hero.

-Not for cakes when the enemy storms-: how the fighter -Neo- celebrated his 24th birthday on the fro...	The story of the soldier was published on the website of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 was not just a tragic date for Dmytro, but also the day when he decided to defend his country. -Neo- joined the army on the second anniversary of the start of the war, leaving behind a peaceful life and plans for the future. He received his call sign -Neo- while studying in Great Britain. Instructors noted his ability to deftly dodge fire, comparing him to the hero of the famous movie -The Matrix-. This call sign became for him not just a name in the war, but also a symbol of his indomitability and ingenuity. Dmytro celebrated his 24th birthday in Turkey, where he was studying. -At that time, I was not interested in cakes or candles,- he recalls. However, the command congratulated him on the radio, which was a pleasant surprise for the soldier and gave him strength in a difficult time. The most memorable battle for -Neo- was the assault that took place in the summer of 2024 in the village of Zalizne. Early in the morning, the enemy attacked the positions of the Ukrainian defenders. -We were a bit out of position and we successfully fought him off,- says -Neo-. In this battle, he and his two comrades were helped not only by their own courage and training, but also by the support of comrades from FPV drones. -The job was to kill them so they wouldn't kill us,- Neo says of that fight. He does not hide that it was scary, because fear is a natural human reaction to danger. However, the main thing, according to him, is not to panic and to control your fear. -When it's just fear and it's under control, it's possible to fend off an assault with it and continue to fight,- the fighter is convinced. -Neo- considers it his duty to protect his people and his country. He is one of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who risk their lives every day for the sake of victory. His story is a story of courage, devotion and indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people. As ArmiyaInform reported, a year ago David was an ordinary guy from Trostianets, Sumy Oblast. He liked to read, was fond of playing Counter-Strike and occasionally watched his favorite cartoon -Kung Fu Panda. But in the fall of 2024, he voluntarily joined the ranks of the 100th separate mechanized brigade, which is fighting fiercely for the freedom of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/ne-do-tortiv-koly-vorog-shturmuye-yak-boyecz-neo-zustriv-svij-24-j-den-narodzhennya-na-peredovij/	2025-02-19T09:53:06-08:00
Almost drowned in the Tisza, froze, got tangled in barbed wire: border guards rescued the violator	was informed about this on February 19 in DPSU. A 27-year-old resident of the Ivano-Frankivsk region was discovered at midnight today by a border squad from the -Business- department of the Mukachiv detachment. The man was calling for help. He, frozen and with cut hands, was found 10 meters from the state border. -The Carpathian became entangled in inconspicuous barriers when he got out of the water and decided to return back to Ukraine. The man could barely speak due to hypothermia. He was quickly brought to the unit, given the opportunity to change clothes and given hot tea,- the report said. The violator told the border guards that he intended to enter Romania illegally. For this, he found shippers who promised to help him for $9,000. Dilki assured that crossing the border would be as safe as possible, although they did not hide that the new boy would have to cross the infamous Tisza. While overcoming the barrier fence, the man cut his hands, but continued to move towards the river. -Despite not being able to swim, he still climbed into the water, because in the dark he could not assess the real danger of such a decision. The rapid current instantly knocked him off his feet, picked him up and carried him in an unknown direction. In this way, the man swam 50 meters and, fortunately, was able to get to the shore,- the DPSU noted. In the dark, he got into a barricade, from which he could not get out on his own. So far, the border guards have already identified the persons involved in transporting the Carpathians across the border. Criminal liability awaits them. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/led-ne-vtopyvsya-v-tysi-zamerz-zaplutavsya-u-kolyuchomu-droti-prykordonnyky-vryatuvaly-porushnyka/	2025-02-19T09:44:08-08:00

This is reported by 3 separate assault brigade on its Facebook page. -We are implementing technologies that are changing the course of war, and each one needs to be thoroughly tested in real-world conditions,- the brigade said in a statement. NRK operators from the -NOVA- unit conducted a full range of tests - from the chassis to the communication systems. They successfully delivered the cargo in the field and practiced communication among themselves, improving their logistics skills. The use of unmanned technologies is critical to reducing the risk to warfighter lives while delivering essential resources to the frontline. The 3rd Assault Brigade actively implements modern technologies to improve the efficiency and security of its operations. -We work technologically: we test NRK to save lives,- the 3rd Assault Brigade emphasizes.

-Kep- from -Mainland-: how six soldier-aviators destroyed a platoon of Russians and several units of...	The story of the fighter was published on the page of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Cap- joined the battalion three months ago of his own free will. Together with his subordinates, he holds positions and inflicts significant losses on the occupants. -We have everyone motivated. The main thing for a warrior is motivation. We will teach him, show him, tell him the rest,- says the commander. Fighters of the battalion recently repelled another enemy assault, destroying up to 30 occupants and two armored vehicles. The enemy tried to attack on the equipment, but fell into a carefully prepared trap - the enemy transport was blown up on a mine barrier, and the -Mainland- fighters completed the operation by means of fire, using drones, machine guns and grenade launchers. -The enemy did not expect that we have everything prepared here. Only six or seven of our guys took part in the battle, but we defeated much larger enemy forces,- says -Kep-. Modern warfare is impossible without drones, which conduct 24-hour reconnaissance and monitor enemy movements. -Drones hover constantly, preventing the occupants from leaving or moving. In such conditions, it is important to act quickly and inconspicuously,- the commander notes. However, even with high activity of enemy drones, Ukrainian soldiers find ways to defend themselves effectively. Once the weather conditions (fog and rain) allowed the fighters to act more freely, which helped to successfully repulse the attack. Despite all the difficulties, the Ukrainian military steadfastly stands in defense of the state. -It's hard work, sometimes mentally, sometimes physically. But if we don't stop the enemy here, tomorrow he will be in our houses,- Cap emphasizes. The commander also shared his personal motives for fighting: -My father is fighting, I am fighting. But I don't want my child to see war.- As reported by ArmyInform, the chief sergeant of the unit with the call sign -Puzzle- is one of those who does not hesitate for a minute when it is necessary to go into battle or save fellow citizens. His story is a story of courage, bravery and iron will, which became the basis of the battles for Krynky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/kep-z-materyka-yak-shestero-voyiniv-aviatoriv-znyshhyly-vzvod-rosiyan-ta-kilka-odynycz-bronetehniky/	2025-02-19T09:26:48-08:00
Recruits prisoners to fight against Ukraine: a colonel of the internal service of the DNR is suspect...	The Donetsk regional prosecutor's office informed about this on February 19. -In 2014, the man stayed in occupied Makiivka and got a job in the -penitentiary service- of the quasi-republic. After the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, he continued to build a -career,- the report says. For conscientious service to the enemy, he was awarded the fake rank of colonel of the internal service. In addition, they were appointed to the position of -deputy head of the main department of the Federal Penitentiary Service of the DNR-. He mobilizes convicted citizens in places of imprisonment and recruits them to sign contracts for military service. In addition, he holds meetings with children of specialized children's institutions, where he idealizes the Kremlin regime. -Under the procedural leadership of the Donetsk regional prosecutor's office, the citizen was informed of the suspicion of treason (Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine),- the DBR employees said, ArmyInform reported. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/perebizhchyk-praczyuvav-na-okupantiv-ta-led-ne-potrapyv-na-sluzhbu-v-zsu-sudytymut-cholovika/->completed a pre-trial investigation regarding a resident of Kherson, who during the occupation of the city worked for the invaders in the captured colony, and then barely did not get into the service of the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/verbuye-vyazniv-voyuvaty-proty-ukrayiny-pidozryuyut-polkovnyka-vnutrishnoyi-sluzhby-dnr/	2025-02-19T09:03:14-08:00
Manipulations and fakes about TCC: how Russian propaganda incites enmity in Ukrainian society	This is reported by Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with reference to material of the Institute of Mass Information. As noted in IMI, individual posts do not simply question the need for mobilization measures. They openly provoke aggression, sow enmity and incite confrontation between civilian and military Ukrainians. The fact that some resources resort to outright distortion of the context is particularly worrying. By replacing the word -military serviceman- with -employee- or -employee-, they are trying to artificially separate the TCC from the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the entire defense system of the country. Thus, the attack on an employee of the TCC is presented not as an attack on a military person in a warring country, but as a separate incident unrelated to the general struggle against Russian aggression. This information campaign aimed at discrediting the TCC and the military is part of a broader Russian propaganda strategy. Its goal is to sow discord within Ukrainian society, undermine confidence in the authorities and the Armed Forces, as well as disrupt mobilization measures, which are critical for success in the war against the Russian invaders. It is important to note that such information attacks are not new. Russian propaganda has long been using similar methods to achieve its goals. However, against the background of war and growing tension in society, such manipulations can have particularly devastating consequences. As reported by ArmyInform, from the moment of entry into force of the changes related to the mobilization policy as a whole, in accordance with the Law of Ukraine -On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine Regarding Certain Issues of Military Service, Mobilization, and Military Registration-, a number of significant changes were made that relate to the procedure for conscripting citizens for military service during mobilization, for a special period that was specified by Resolution No. 560 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated May 16, 2024.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/manipulyacziyi-ta-fejky-pro-tczk-yak-rosijska-propaganda-rozpalyuye-vorozhnechu-v-ukrayinskomu-suspilstvi/	2025-02-19T08:56:58-08:00

The fairy tale - Three Little Pigs - in a modern way: a Ukrainian wolf destroyed enemy pigs with an ...	This is discussed in publications on page 110 of the separate mechanized brigade named after Corporal General Mark Bezruchka. In a modern interpretation of the well-known fairy tale, three little pigs, Nifnifov, Nafnafov and Nufnufov, turned out to be invaders who took over someone else's brick house. They sat there talking about the -Ukrainian wolf- who, for some reason, did not like the foreign piglets. However, their plans were destroyed by the -Ukrainian wolf- - a fighter of the 110th separate mechanized brigade, who launched an FPV drone and discovered the location of the enemy. In a few minutes, the drone was already flying around the hut, looking for the best place to hit. Finding the perfect moment, the drone flew into the building and the ammunition detonated. The pigs died on the spot, victims of their own aggression and greed. -These three pigs will no longer spoil other people's homes on Ukrainian soil with their presence,- the brigade's message reads. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of such -pigs-, so the -wolf- is forced to continue its struggle, day by day reducing their herd. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 110th mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka recorded a mass escape of the invaders from the positions they captured a few days ago.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/kazka-troye-porosyat-na-suchasnyj-lad-ukrayinskyj-vovk-znyshhyv-vorozhyh-svynej-fpv-dronom/	2025-02-19T08:24:55-08:00

As the investigation established, the judges made notoriously falsified decisions, which gave the petitioners grounds for going abroad under the pretext of sole care of the child. The cost of such a -service- was $3.5 thousand. from a potential conscript. At the same time, the court made relevant decisions en masse without the actual presence of the parties in the meeting hall. To find clients, lawyers and their assistants were involved, who offered on social networks an allegedly legal way of traveling abroad for conscripts. For the purpose of the conspiracy, those involved held -business- meetings with potential conscripts in the office of a local law firm. There, they discussed the mechanisms for unjustified postponement of mobilization and the amount of payment for the services of an organized group. During the searches in the administrative building of the court, as well as in the private offices of the defendants and at their residential addresses, documents, mobile phones and computers with evidence of equipment were found. On the basis of documented facts, the law enforcement officers notified the head of the court, seven of his henchmen and other involved persons of suspicion under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: — Art. 114-1 (obstructing the legal activity of the Armed Forces); — Art. 332 (organization of illegal border crossing); — Art. 368 (obtaining unlawful benefit); — Art. 369 (provision of unlawful benefit); — Art. 376-1 (illegal interference in the work of automated justice systems).

-Contract 18-24-: Pavlo Palisa on the principle of selecting teams for the project and the first res...	Colonel Pavlo Palisa, deputy head of the President's Office, told TSN about this in an interview. According to him, the -18-24 contract- is a new project, which involves six brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: one Marine Corps, one Air Force and four Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is done in order to test all elements of the system in different directions and under different conditions. -Why six? In order to test all elements in each direction, in each brigade, from the moment a citizen applies to the moment when he enters the military unit, receives the first payments, becomes eligible for all types of security, and begins his own training. We plan to monitor all moments throughout the entire contract so that, if we make mistakes somewhere in preparation, organization, provision, payments, so that we have the opportunity to complete and correct all these things, relatively speaking, because it is certainly easier to do it with six brigades than with hundreds,- Pavlo Palisa explained. The brigades to participate in the pilot project were chosen based on the principle of their ability to conduct high-quality combat training on their material and technical base. Three brigades organize combat training independently, the other three with the help of a training center. This is done to compare the quality of training and to choose the best option for the future. -I believe that the best training for a fighter can be provided by those commanders and instructors with whom he will later perform combat missions. This makes it possible to immediately prepare recruits for real conditions, taking into account the specifics of the terrain and the intensity of hostilities,- noted Pavlo Palisa. As reported by ArmyInform, the mobile application -Rezerv+- continues to receive applications from young people aged 18-24 who expressed a desire to sign a voluntary contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/kontrakt-18-24-pavlo-palisa-pro-prynczyp-vidboru-brygad-dlya-proyektu-ta-pershi-rezultaty/	2025-02-19T07:06:33-08:00

The document plans to provide clear terms of service depending on when the soldier was mobilized. -Citizens of Ukraine who were mobilized in 2023, having signed the contract, will be able to be released after 9-10 months, relatively speaking. Those who were mobilized in 2024, having signed a contract, will also be able to leave after a slightly longer period,- he said. At the same time, Pavlo Palisa emphasized that this will become possible only after certain conditions are created. -We cannot expose the front and deprive the combat element of the ability to perform the task,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, an updated version of the application -Rezerv+- was released with the possibility to apply for concluding a voluntary one-year contract for citizens up to 25 years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/v-ofisi-prezydenta-rozpovily-pro-rozrobku-kontraktiv-dlya-mobilizovanyh-z-terminamy-sluzhby/	2025-02-19T06:53:48-08:00

Styles and genres are different - from classical art, such as the works of Volodymyr Gurin, to the works of Serhiy Gerasimenko, who works in the style of modern art. And, for example, Serhiy Smetankin's paintings are painted on boxes made from shells, said Olena Kotlyar. The exhibition also features works by Roman Kravchuk, Ihor Talalai, Serhiy Burbelo, Viktor Solovar, Volodymyr Vakulenko, Vasyl Telychko-Evert, Artem Shevchenko, and Mykola Medinskyi. In total, there are more than 40 works in various genres — painting, graphics, installation, art objects. The exposition opens with an icon of St. Severinus, placed on the lid of a shell box — on a base designed by an eight-year-old boy. This is the work of military chaplain Mykola Medinsky with the symbolic title -Ukraine will win-, which was proposed by the young son of the Defender of Ukraine. — This is the icon of the Holy Martyr Severin, which I painted for the child of one of our soldiers, who serves in the GUR. His father is now at the front, in the war. The icon itself is small, so I decided to put it on the lid to give it a larger shape. And then the little one says: -Can I write a message for my father on this board?-. And he wrote: -Ukraine will win!- and drew the Ukrainian flag and coat of arms, - said Mykola Medynskyi. The chaplain decided to leave the icon with this design, so the words of the little boy became a true slogan for the entire exhibition. — When you enter the hall, this exhibition opens with a work by Mr. Medinsky with a symbolic title expressed by a child: -Ukraine will win!-. And I think it's very symbolic, very powerful, very life-affirming. Ukraine will really win, Olena Kotlyar emphasized during the opening ceremony. Another of the works presented at the exhibition — a painting by Serhiy Smetankin — is called -Sviatohirsk during the Kharkiv Offensive.- It depicts real events during the famous Slobozhan offensive operation in the fall of 2022, as a result of which it was possible to liberate most of the Kharkiv region from the Russian invaders. — We are very pleased that today's works include the work of Serhiy Smetankin, who in 2024 was recognized as the laureate of the Bohdan Khmelnytskyi Award competition for the best coverage of military themes in works of literature and art, which is awarded annually by the Ministry of Defense for the best coverage of military themes in works of literature and art, — the deputy head of the department, head of the department of planning and organization of humanitarian support emphasized in a comment to ArmiyaInform of humanitarian support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Sergienko. Serhii Smetankin won a well-deserved victory in the nomination -Works of fine art on a military theme- for a series of fine art works -Thanks- that the author drew on blackboards from boxes for cartridges and on fragments of rockets. — We can see by the quality, by the content of these works, by their fullness, what spiritual power these paintings carry. Additionally, this effect is enhanced by the fact that these works were created at the front, in the trenches, in the dugouts. They have an extremely strong emotional effect, - stressed Oleksiy Sergienko. He noted that all works submitted for the Bohdan Khmelnytsky Prize are extremely powerful, and the acceptance of works for the 2025 competition, which will last until August 1, has already begun. — Creativity became a certain psychological reliever for me during the war, which took away many people - my brothers, godfathers. I created the first of the paintings specifically in honor of the memory of my deceased godfather, - says Serhiy Gerasimenko, who joined the ranks of the Territorial Defense Forces from the very beginning of the large-scale invasion. The exhibition presents the artist's works of various genres - from iconographic images to art installations using front-line artifacts - shell casings, fragments of boxes from BC and burnt boards. -These shell casings cut by fragments,- the artist points to the installation, -stood at the entrance to the dugout.- I don't know whose exactly it was, but the shell casings may have saved someone's life because the shrapnel hit them and got stuck there. Recalling his first work during the war, Serhiy Gerasimenko notes that it was -Pieta-, or -Lamentation of Christ-. He created it from several support boards from a slot machine box. Combined with numerous prongs that once held weapons, they form a whole composition that symbolizes the strength of the unity of Ukrainian society. Artist, architect and designer Volodymyr Vakulenko came to the opening of the exhibition on crutches - he is currently in Kyiv undergoing treatment. However, all the thoughts, all the experiences of the artist are now at the front, where his comrades from the Third Assault Brigade are fighting. — I live here, but in my thoughts and in communication I am always with the boys. I call every day to find out who went to war and who left. I'm afraid it's hard for civilians to understand, but this is not the end of the war. Therefore, in my works, I want to convey to society that sooner or later it will touch everyone - you can't relax. Even if now there will be some kind of calm for a few years, then the enemy will go to Kyiv again, - says the artist. Volodymyr Vakulenko emphasizes the responsibility of everyone - citizens and the state, representatives of the authorities. Because if we relax, next time the Russian invaders will not only reach the capital, but will also be able to capture it. — Those who are mobilized now are often unmotivated, indifferent. How to send them to -zero-? And there are few patriots left. Society needs to understand that what I said, we are fading away, we are becoming very few. And if the attitude does not change on the part of society, on the part of the country, on the part of the state&#8230; It is necessary to stop pretending that the war does not affect anyone, because it directly affects all of us, the military does not hold back its emotions. &nbsp; A short speech by Volodymyr Vakulenko, who stands firmly on crutches during the long opening of the exhibition, leaves no one indifferent. Against the backdrop of the peaceful Kyiv front, he reminds us that the terrible war for the very existence of the state of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation continues, and it is still far from a victorious end. The exhibition -Artists on the Front- will continue in the -ABS-art- gallery until March 8, 2025. Address: str. Hlybochytska, 32 B, 3rd floor. Opening hours: from 12:00 to 18:00. Entrance is free.

Exhibitors of the General Staff are suspected of embezzling UAH 246 million for the creation of the ...	About reported February 19 NABU. Important examinations in criminal proceedings were carried out with the active involvement of the Ministry of Defense. Among the suspects: Their actions are qualified under ch. 5th century 191 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. According to the investigation, in 2016 the Ministry of Defense signed a contract for the development of the system with a commercial company that had no experience in creating software. During the four years of development, the technical task was changed 13 times, which made it possible to increase the cost of the works by 300 million hryvnias. Without justification, the number of prototypes of the system was increased from 4 to 12, which caused additional costs for adjusting the documentation — 115 million hryvnias. As NABU and SAP found out, the developed system did not meet the technical task at all: from incompatibility with NATO protocols to lack of integration with other military systems. Moreover, some of the software is not used at all. Of the 200 information and calculation tasks set, only 10 were actually implemented. During the investigation, detectives and prosecutors encountered attempts to hinder the investigation: persons involved in the scheme began to hide key documentation related to the financing and development of the project. Also, after the investigation began, they accelerated the work and even modernized the system for free, trying to make it more similar to the original design. However, due to fundamental errors in the architecture, finalization of the -DZVIN- system is impossible. Despite the obvious shortcomings, at the end of 2022, the DZVIN system was officially adopted by the Armed Forces. And already in 2024, instead of eliminating shortcomings or abandoning an ineffective solution, they planned to allocate additional funding to -DZVIN-. This may indicate attempts not only to hide previous corruption abuses, but also to continue them. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement exposed the -Ukroboronprom- exposadors for embezzling more than 107 million hryvnias. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/eksposadovcziv-genshtabu-pidozryuyut-u-rozkradanni-246-mln-grn-na-stvorenni-systemy-dzvin/	2025-02-19T05:08:55-08:00

Either death or capture - in the Third Assault, it was told how long a Russian assault fighter lives	-Motya-, commander of the 1st company of the 2nd assault battalion of the Third Assault Brigade, told about this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. According to him, the fighters of the Third Assault Division regularly manage to take prisoners, and the description of the Russian fighters is short - they are people devoid of intelligence by 100 percent. Their motivation, says -Motya-, is exclusively financial. Nowadays, the occupiers are not even taking convicts into the army, but people who are still only under investigation. But these soldiers do not live long. -The lifespan of an ordinary Russian attack aircraft is approximately three weeks. From the moment when his military ID is stamped. That is, a week of training ground, logistics to Ukraine, and then the war. And either -200- or we are in captivity,- said the officer of the Third Assault Brigade.

Their task was to collect information about the places of greatest concentration of personnel and military equipment of the Armed Forces in the region and to pass it on to the Russian occupiers. One of the detainees turned out to be a former teacher of a local university. On the instructions of the enemy, he collected geolocations of reserve command posts and fortified areas of Ukrainian defenders in Kharkiv. To do this, he drove around the northern outskirts of the city in his car, secretly recorded the location of the Ukrainian military and submitted reports to the FSB. Another informant worked as a security guard at a local hotel. Under the guise of walks, he spied on the temporary bases of the Defense Forces on the territory of the community. He sent the collected information to his Russian handler via messenger in the form of text messages and screenshots of Google maps with potential targets for strikes. Thanks to the operational actions of the SBU, both criminals were exposed and detained at their places of residence. During the searches, mobile phones and computer equipment containing evidence of cooperation with the Russian Federation were seized from them. Investigators of the Security Service informed the detainees about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for the possibility of their identification on the spot). They face up to 8 years in prison. This case once again emphasizes the importance of vigilance and conscious attitude of citizens to information security. The enemy uses various methods to obtain information, so each of us must be attentive and careful not to become an unwitting helper of the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service and the National Police during the day detained agents of the Russian special services who were preparing a terrorist attack on the order of the Russian Federation in Mykolaiv on February 14 of this year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/na-harkivshhyni-zatrymano-dvoh-informatoriv-fsb-yaki-koryguvaly-rosijski-udary/	2025-02-19T03:57:50-08:00
-In one sortie - minus ten-: how a fighter -Mark- destroyed an enemy dugout with occupiers	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Mark, an FPV crew commander in the Antares Unmanned Systems Battalion, joined the Defense Forces in the first months of the full-scale Russian invasion. Before the war, he worked as a trainer in a gym and had plans to develop his own clothing brand. However, the events of 2022, and especially what he saw in Buch, forced him to make a decisive choice. -The question arose before me: am I ready to close my eyes to this? I came to the military commissariat, asked to be enrolled as a volunteer. I even thought of writing a statement that I would refuse the salary of a military man - the main thing is to take it. It took a long time to persuade them,- the fighter recalls. During his service, -Mark- tried himself in different positions: he was a physical training instructor, served in the infantry, worked as a scout on Maviks, and eventually became an FPV drone operator. -FPV is a precise, filigree piece of work. It is not suitable for everyone, but if a person has a desire, he can learn. If I succeeded, then 90% of motivated people can also succeed,- explains -Mark-. Thanks to accurate strikes, FPV pilots repeatedly thwarted plans of enemy assaults. -Once we worked on landings where there were enemy fortifications. Later, from the interrogation of a prisoner of war, we learned that during one of these sorties, we -minus- ten occupiers who were hiding in a dugout,- the National Guardsman recalls. Nevertheless, Mark plans to return to his civilian dream of developing his own clothing brand and bringing it to the international level. However, if his combat experience is still needed by the country after the war, he is ready to pass on his knowledge to a new generation of UAV operators. As reported by ArmyInform, Rodion from -Jupiter- is a soldier of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade, originally from Khmelnytskyi. His story is an example of how a person can change his life and stand up for his country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/za-odyn-vylit-minus-desyat-yak-boyecz-mark-znyshhyv-vorozhyj-blindazh-z-okupantamy/	2025-02-19T03:48:27-08:00

This time, they managed to hit two such points at once within just one day. Also in our possession is another fat target - the Strela-10 self-propelled air defense system (no longer produced, and its analogue, the Pticelov air defense system, costs $3-4 million). And for dessert, a traditional ``loaf'',- the battalion commented on the video.

The law enforcement officers established that the man went to cooperate with the occupiers in June 2022. He got a job in a captured colony, having received the position of dog trainer. The figure served the occupation authorities until the liberation of Kherson, for which he received a salary in rubles. -After the liberation of the city, the defector decided to stay in the territory controlled by Ukraine and hid, and later got into the Armed Forces. In January 2025, the SBI exposed and arrested the defector before he began full-time service,- the statement said. The court chose a measure of remand for the defendant — detention without bail. -The figure is accused of collaborative activity (Part 7 of Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of deprivation of liberty for a term of up to 15 years,- the SBI noted. As reported by ArmyInform, employees of the State Security Bureau in Lviv exposed a fraudulent lawyer who, under the guise of assistance profited from the families of dead and missing soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/perebizhchyk-praczyuvav-na-okupantiv-ta-led-ne-potrapyv-na-sluzhbu-v-zsu-sudytymut-cholovika/	2025-02-19T03:22:18-08:00
Teroborona is one of the main elements of the System of National Resistance — the Ministry of Defens...	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 19. -Since the large-scale invasion, territorial defense has evolved from a reserve component to a full-fledged combat force. Until 2022, territorial defense was perceived mostly as an auxiliary tool for the Armed Forces, but the realities of war proved that its importance is much greater. Today, territorial defense is an effective mechanism for deterring the enemy and ensuring the stability of the state. In the future, it should become even more prepared, integrated into the general security system and able to quickly adapt to new challenges, turning into a real foundation of national resistance,- said Yuriy Yelenych, head of the national resistance policy department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. aggression. What is territorial defense? Territorial defense is a system of national, military, and special measures aimed at protecting territories, maintaining population security, and countering threats in a specific area. TrO can perform tasks both in peacetime and in a special period, in particular during the legal regime of martial law. It is a holistic mechanism that unites military units, local authorities and civil society to ensure security and defense at the local level. Territorial defense activities are regulated by the Law -On the Basics of National Resistance-, which entered into force on January 1, 2022. The history of the formation of the modern system of territorial defense began back in 2014, when the first battalions of TrO became part of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces. In 2020, a separate Territorial Defense Command appeared as part of the Ground Forces Command. Before the start of the full-scale invasion, the full-time personnel of TrO was 580 servicemen, but it was this structure that laid the foundation for the further large-scale deployment of territorial defense forces. What is the place of ТРО in the system of national resistance? Territorial defense is one of the three key components of the system of national resistance, along with the resistance movement and the system of preparing citizens for national resistance. Unlike the resistance movement that operates in temporarily occupied territories and the system of citizen training, which forms the base for the resistance, TrO provides direct protection and control of the territories under the control of the Ukrainian authorities. Such a structure makes it possible to create a multi-level defense system, where each component complements the others and works towards a common goal — protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. What tasks are assigned to territorial defense? Tasks of territorial defense cover a wide range of defense and security functions. The priority is the protection and defense of the territory, which includes a timely response to threats within the defined area and strengthening the protection of the state border. In the same direction, TrO units oppose sabotage and reconnaissance forces and other armed formations of the enemy. The second important task is the protection of critical infrastructure. Territorial defense units provide protection and defense of important facilities and communications, on which the population's livelihood depends. This includes both objects of state importance, determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, and objects of local level - oblast, district and city importance. A significant part of the tasks is related to ensuring public safety. TrO, together with law enforcement agencies, participates in maintaining law and order in populated areas, controls movement in emergency zones and areas of hostilities. In the event of the introduction of martial law, territorial defense units are involved in the implementation of appropriate measures of the legal regime. A separate role is assigned to the protection of the civilian population. TrO forces participate in the protection of the population from emergency situations and liquidation of the consequences of hostilities. They also provide conditions for the safe functioning of state authorities and local self-government. An important aspect of activity is the creation of favorable conditions for the defense of the state — from ensuring the strategic deployment of troops to participating in information activities aimed at increasing defense capabilities and countering hostile information operations. In addition, territorial defense participates in the preparation of citizens of Ukraine for national resistance and provides legal assistance to the population in accordance with the law. What does territorial defense consist of? Territorial defense has a complex, but clearly structured organization, which includes three main components: military, civilian and military-civilian. Each of these elements has its own unique functions and tasks, but they all work as a single mechanism. The basis of the military component is the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is a professional military structure, which includes: This component provides the main military potential of the TR, professional training of personnel and coordination of all military aspects of activity. By decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, additional formations may be involved in the performance of territorial defense tasks. The Commander-in-Chief also determines the composition of security and defense forces and means involved in territorial defense, coordinating it with the heads of the relevant management bodies. The civil component is represented by state bodies and local self-government bodies. They provide administrative support, coordination with the local population and resolution of organizational issues - from material support to interaction with local communities. The military-civilian component includes headquarters of territorial defense zones and voluntary formations of territorial communities (DFTG). This element provides direct communication between military structures and local communities, allowing effective coordination of efforts of all participants of territorial defense. On what principle does TrO function? Territorial defense organization is based on the territorial-zonal principle, which takes into account the military-administrative division of Ukraine. This allows you to create a clear management system where each level has its defined tasks and area of ​​responsibility. In practice, this means that each oblast of Ukraine is a separate zone of territorial defense, and districts within the oblast form territorial defense districts. Each such zone and district has its own headquarters. They coordinate all aspects of defense activities on their territory. Such a structure contributes to the effective use of available resources and provides the possibility of prompt response to threats. It also allows maneuvering of forces and assets between zones and districts depending on the operational situation. Who manages territorial defense? The territorial defense management system is built on a clear hierarchical principle. At the highest level, general leadership is exercised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces. At the regional level, leadership is exercised through regional military administration bodies and the relevant headquarters of the territorial defense zones. They coordinate the actions of all units and formations within their area of ​​responsibility, interaction with other military formations and authorities. At the local level, the headquarters of territorial defense districts operate, which directly organize the implementation of assigned tasks. How does TrO differ from other military formations? Territorial defense has a number of unique features that distinguish it from other military formations. First of all, it is its close connection with local communities and territories. The second important difference is the combination of military and civilian components. TrO not only performs military tasks, but also ensures interaction between military structures, local authorities and the civilian population. Thus, if mobilized individuals can be sent to different units of the Armed Forces, then the TrO consists of both mobilized and volunteers who serve in their local communities. Also, as noted earlier, territorial defense has a wider range of tasks that go beyond purely military functions. In particular, it is the maintenance of law and order, the protection of critical infrastructure and assistance to the population in emergency situations. What is the role of the Security and Defense Forces in repelling Russian aggression? With the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, territorial defense became one of the key elements of the defense of Ukraine. Only during the first month of the great war, more than 110,000 volunteers of various professions and ages joined the ranks of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This made it possible to quickly form combat-ready units that played a decisive role in the defense of many cities and settlements. The contribution of TrO units to the liberation of Kyiv and the northern regions of Ukraine from the Russian occupiers became particularly important. By ensuring the security of the rear areas, they enabled regular units of the Armed Forces to focus on the most threatening directions. Since 2023, the Territorial Defense Forces have significantly expanded their capabilities - in addition to infantry, they have included mechanized units, aerial reconnaissance units, and mortar units. Special attention is paid to the training of sappers. Today, units of the Territorial Defense Forces continue to perform combat tasks in the most difficult areas of the front, participate in the defense of the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine. The experience of their combat use in the conditions of a full-scale war has become the subject of study in many countries of the world, confirming the effectiveness of the concept of territorial defense as an important component of the national resistance system.

A -strong iron fist- - about four dozen armored cars - was thrown against the hunters and their neighbors. They were divided into several columns, in front of each was a tank with a EW and a mine trawl. -There was even such a comical situation, if you can call it comical. One tank either broke down or got lost. He just started spinning on the minefield, and all the other armored vehicles followed him like ducklings following a duck. It is clear that they blew up. Our FPV-drone operators beat them as much as they could. In general, together with the adjacent units, we destroyed about 20 pieces of equipment,- Oleg Gulyk said. As reported ArmyInform, in the Novopavlov direction, the enemy continues to carry out assaults and tries different attack methods.

According to him, now the enemy in the direction is quite serious. These are not elite troops, rather average infantry in terms of training, general support and equipment. But they have a base for fighting. -They also tried out the use of heavy equipment, know-how in the form of homemade pickup trucks converted from Russian or Soviet-made passenger cars, motorcycle assaults, buggies, old-fashioned infantry groups. But now the enemy has not received any -exhaust- from all this, and it remains to freeze in the plantings with future fertilizer,- said Bohdan Janusz. Tactics on the battlefield are constantly changing. Now, Janusz notes, the Russians' approach to the use of artillery has changed. If earlier they were covered with hundreds of thousands of shells, now they work more precisely. -Fire ramparts- before assault actions have a local character. -We export due to the accuracy of the use of our artillery. Plus or minus the same level of artillery use, but the accuracy of damage is many times different. Therefore, in principle, with our stock of ammunition, we perform the same tasks performed by the Russian gun, which uses twice as much,- said the deputy commander of the air mobile battalion of the 79th separate amphibious assault brigade.

Currently, the relevant evidence base has been collected on the persons involved and their connection with the enemy has been fully documented. -Then the bombers used a resident of Poltava region to detonate her together with an explosive device near a cafe in the center of Mykolaiv. As a result of the incident, a woman and three soldiers died on the spot, and seven more people were injured of varying degrees of severity,- the report said. Counter-intelligence of the SBU detained accomplices of the crime -on hot pursuit-. They turned out to be four minor residents of the Poltava district aged 14 to 17, who were recruited by the occupiers through Telegram channels in search of -easy money-. According to the instructions of the Russian special services, the young men independently made an improvised explosive device (IED), hid it in a backpack and handed this -parcel- to a 42-year-old resident of a nearby village. -In exchange for a promise of -quick earnings- from the Russian Federation, a woman came to Mykolaiv to allegedly hand over a -bag of money- to a local resident. Not realizing that she had a masked explosive in her hands, she approached the parking lot near the cafe, where a group of Ukrainian soldiers was standing,- the SBU said. As soon as the woman approached them, the Russian special services remotely activated the SVP through a call to a mobile phone. According to the available information, the enemy prepared in advance the elimination of his agent as an -extra- witness to the terrorist attack. Meanwhile, after preparing and handing over the explosives, the minors -lay down- in their homes, where they were waiting for money from the occupiers. Ukrainian law enforcement officers detained them there.

Tested by war: Israeli company modernized active defense system to combat kamikaze drones	According to the authors of site Army Recognition, the management of this manufacturer of various types of weapons from Haifa made such a statement within the framework of the Defense IQ International Armored Vehicles (IAV) conference, which was held in the second decade of January in Farnborough, Great Britain, ArmyInform notes. According to a company representative, the improvement is aimed at solving problems related to low-altitude air threats. Namely: commercially available drones, kamikaze drones and larger fixed-wing UAVs. The upgrade, which requires software tweaks and minor hardware changes, is compatible with existing systems used by operators in the United States and Europe. During testing, the updated Trophy system, mounted on a 30 mm turret, successfully intercepted a fixed-wing jet drone classified between UAV groups 2 and 3. At the same time, in the attack, the drone was directed in an almost vertical dive. Rafael emphasized that these improvements were achieved without changing the system's core hardware. In addition to intercepting drones, the Trophy has been updated based on operational experience, including lessons learned by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during conflicts in Gaza and northern Israel. These improvements address the system's effectiveness against short-range threats in urban environments and long-range threats such as ATGMs in open terrain. A representative of EuroTrophy, a joint venture between Rafael, GDELS and KNDS to sell the Trophy in Europe, said the system achieved high interception rates during conflicts. The company is working on the integration of Trophy on such platforms as the MGCS and ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles, as well as three types of European armored vehicles with the 8×8 scheme. Representative Rafael noted that the Trophy contributes to operational efficiency by providing consistent vehicle protection, which is critical to mission continuity. The company also highlighted the operational challenges commanders face when vehicle losses threaten the success of an operation. The Trophy APS complex, also known as -Windbreaker-, was developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in cooperation with another Israeli arms concern Elta Systems to counter modern anti-tank threats such as ATGMs, RPGs and other anti-tank weapons. Development began in the 1980s to increase the survivability of armored vehicles in urban environments and on open battlefields. The system became operational in 2009, and its first recorded intercept took place in 2011. Variants were developed for different weight classes of vehicles, including Trophy HV for heavy vehicles, Trophy MV for medium vehicles and Trophy LV for light vehicles. The Trophy's functionality is based on the Elta EL/M-2133 fire control radar, which uses four planar antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. When a flying projectile is detected, the approach vector, threat type, time to impact, and angle of attack are calculated. Rotary launchers deploy Explosive Penetrators (EFPs) in a precise pattern to neutralize threats at a safe distance. The system counters ATGMs, high-explosive anti-tank missiles, RPGs and similar threats. It can engage multiple threats simultaneously on stationary and mobile vehicles and integrates with C4I systems and remotely controlled weapons. Newer models have automatic reloading for continuous combat. Trophy APS has been in service since 2011, demonstrating success in low and high intensity combat in urban, open and forest environments. This system intercepted such threats as Kornet ATGM and RPG-29. By 2017, all Trophy systems had accumulated a total of 50,000 combat hours, and by 2023 production had reached 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month. The radar system can share data with other vehicles, providing improved coordination for threat detection and targeting. It can determine whether or not a projectile will hit a target, holding countermeasures and exchanging data for tactical use. According to reports, the radar provides protection against certain missiles when attacked from above and is used by Israel and the United States. However, Trophy APS has certain limitations in its application. It cannot resist kinetic energy penetrators and is vulnerable to direct attacks from above, as was demonstrated in Israel in 2023 when enemy drones dropped grenades on IDF protected vehicles. It should be taken into account that the weight of this equipment is approximately 500 kilograms. This may affect the performance of light vehicles. The use of EFPs creates risks for infantry that may be near the station, complicating operations involving soldiers in a hurry. Techniques such as rapid succession rocket fire, ultra-close-range RPG attacks, and supersonic projectiles exploited the system's weaknesses. Conflicts in 2023 and 2024 highlighted cases where the system was overwhelmed, and video evidence shows some failures. Rafael representatives emphasized that, despite the new capabilities of combating drones, the Trophy alone cannot provide comprehensive air defense against drones. The company's specialists advocate a multi-level defense strategy that includes mobility, lethality and survivability, supported by technologies such as lasers and electromagnetic spectrum control. The approach is aimed at addressing the growing challenges associated with unmanned aerial vehicles, including the threats of UAV swarms and attacks from the top, which complicate operations for maneuverable forces. Production of the Trophy APS began in Israel in 2007 and in the United States in 2012, with a total production of 40 systems and 500 countermeasures per month by 2023. Since 2010, the device has been deployed on such platforms as the Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4 tanks, Namer, armored personnel carriers, and American M1A2 Abrams tanks. The system has been tested on Stryker armored personnel carriers and Bradley fighting vehicles. The lighter version of the Trophy MV/VPS was designed for medium and light vehicles, while the Trophy LV is designed for vehicles up to 8 tonnes. It was also integrated into the German Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and included in the order for the Leopard 2A8. Great Britain has signed contracts to install devices for Challenger 3 tanks. Other potential buyer countries could be Croatia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic. Visualization of the combat application of the Trophy protection system.

Adaptation course of mobilized before deployment -to zero-: ArmyInform report from Donetsk region	-In the areas of hostilities in each military unit, sergeants and officers organize additional training for servicemen who come from training centers after BZVP or after long-term treatment. We call it the adaptation training course. This is a very important element of training, &#8211; says Master Sergeant Yevgeniy. - Why is it important? They are trained here directly by the instructors of units who have extensive combat experience and an understanding of the nature of combat operations in the area of ​​responsibility of the brigade in a specific direction of the area. Mobilized after the BZVP already work in those full-time positions in which they will perform combat tasks. Here they are intensively trained to fight and taught the skills and abilities that they will definitely need on the front line. I will say this: based on my own combat experience, in those military units where this preliminary training is carried out seriously, there is a much better structured combat work on the front lines, and a better level of combat tasks. We are going to the training ground of the 79th separate airborne assault brigade of the Tavrian Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. There, the adaptation course for the training of newly arrived servicemen is currently underway. Optimally, it lasts at least 14 days. Of course, this depends on the combat situation at the front and the capabilities of the brigade. The boys are divided into small training groups, and experienced paratrooper instructors work with them. The range itself is divided into training sectors: tactical, fire training, mine and explosives, engineering training, intelligence, tactical medicine, work with/against UAVs, communications, topography. -The mobilized are chased away very carefully. Here they are adapted to new conditions, taught to survive in battle and destroy the enemy. Today, we organized a meeting with chief sergeants of combat brigades, units and units of the operational-tactical group -Donetsk- at the training ground. These meetings are held in order to increase the level of training of the non-commissioned staff, improve their skills and abilities, in particular, by working out the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine regarding the procedure for issuing operational (combat) documents with tactical signs, expanding communication and sharing experience, as well as developing the non-commissioned officer corps. We are developing a certain algorithm of actions so that the sergeants-in-chief of the units already in their units work with their subordinate sergeants-instructors on how to effectively prepare new arrivals for combat operations. Studying new experience and implementing it in parts is the key, constant development of the training system, because the war does not stop for a moment. Here they look at what can be improved in training, what needs to be -trusted- and so on. Each military unit trains its personnel in a different way plus a different educational and material base. The 79th brigade was not chosen by chance - it is one of the best units in the system of conducting preliminary training of servicemen before sending them on combat missions. Experienced and combat instructors, a strong educational and material base of the training ground: this synergy gives good results of combat work in the future. After the -pumping- in the preparatory training, the newly arrived servicemen become more confident and better trained to act in a real combat situation,- &#8211; says Roman. Fighters train on those samples of weapons that are specifically in their unit. Working with weapons and shooting different types of small arms and grenade launchers day and night, throwing grenades. The tactics of actions in urban areas, plantations, fields, ruins of cities and villages are being worked out. Actions in defense and offensive, assault actions, which tactical movements are inherent in various types of combat. The tactics of using small groups: hit and roll back. The actions of clearing trenches, conducting fire at a short distance from the enemy are practiced. Each exercise takes place using FPV drones, drones of various types. The military gets used to the constant -buzzing- of drones, they become less afraid. The boys learn to counter -fpvishkas-, run to cover, shoot down drones in the air. The classes are conducted in the most realistic way, where UAV drops on our military are simulated. FPV drones carry balls of water and sand and deliver -hits- from above. Plus smoke screens, imitation of explosions, that is, people work in conditions that are close to the combat zone. Working on stress resistance, guys need to know how to act in a combat situation, when there is panic, stress or a -stupor-. They are taught how to correctly and quickly cope with stress, make decisions under pressure, and so on. Plus they learn to use electronic devices. It is necessary to be able to suppress the work of enemy UAVs. How important is it for an infantryman to know the basics of mines and explosives? The question is very important. An infantryman or stormtrooper may not know how to properly defuse a mine or other explosive object, but he must be able to identify it, understand what he is dealing with, and how to bypass such a mine. He must have an understanding of what mine obstacles the enemy has placed on the front line. The range of ammunition used by the enemy is simply huge. Anti-personnel, anti-tank mines, various types of stretchers, mine traps. raiders resort to the most diverse ways of mining the terrain, traps can be everywhere: in fields, in bushes, in houses and basements of some settlements. Newcomers are taught how to break through the defense of the occupier, what the enemy mines in the first place, and so on. Training is conducted both during the day and at night with simulation of explosive devices. At the range, paratrooper instructors teach newly arrived soldiers how to properly operate and inflict fire damage on enemy air targets using portable anti-aircraft missile systems. These weapons can be used to destroy low-flying planes, helicopters, UAVs and even enemy missiles. In the classes, visual reconnaissance and identification of aerial targets are mastered. Next, they practice pointing and firing at targets. The guys work on both the Igla MANPADS and the American Stinger. The Stinger is better than the Igla in its tactical and technical characteristics: the target range is up to 8 km, and the height is up to 3.8 km. It has a digital signal processing system, unlike the analog one in the -Igla-. But the -Igla- MANPADS also effectively destroys enemy air targets, but with a slightly shorter attack distance of up to 5 km and an altitude of up to 3.5 km. Tactical medicine is the basis of the adaptation course for military training in combat units. Classes are held daily. The main thing here &#8211; initial medical examination and stopping of critical bleeding. The ability to correctly apply tourniquets and bandages. It is not always possible for combat medics to reach a position on the front line. Therefore, in the conditions of battle and intense shelling, it is extremely important to save one's own life and help a brother if he is wounded. Evacuation of the wounded with the help of various stretchers, homemade wheelbarrows and quadricycles is practiced by itself.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/adapczijnyj-kurs-mobilizovanyh-pered-vidpravkoyu-na-nul-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-02-18T20:44:02-08:00
Recruiting in a dress with a backpack -frog-: war -on the screen- UAV operator Siri	Ininterview ArmiyaTV, she said that today she controls drones, watching the war through a screen. Her story is more than a UAV story. It's about a generation coming of age in war. About those who are forced to be torn between civilian and military life. And about those who, despite everything, find the strength to fight. The first thoughts about joining the army appeared in Syria since the time of the ATO. At that time, the girl dreamed of joining -Hospitaliers- - a volunteer organization of paramedics, which was founded by Yana Zinkevich at the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine in 2014. But at first she decided to finish university and get a higher education. The large-scale invasion of the Russians in February 2024 did not allow the girl's dreams to come true. Being in the Kyiv region, she and her parents were at risk of falling into the occupation. I had to leave home and move out with my family. Later, her parents sent her abroad, although she strongly did not want it. Siri understood that she did not belong here and firmly decided that she would definitely return to Ukraine. Eventually it happened. After returning to her homeland, the girl began to search for herself in a military specialty that would not require a lot of physical strength. — And then I started thinking about the possibility of working with drones. At that time, FPV had not yet been used on such a scale. I was looking at Maviks, or large reconnaissance drones. But I knew for sure that I would finish university first, says the girl. The girl remembers the first steps on the way to the 37th Marine Brigade with a smile. Knowing that women were not accepted into the Marine Corps, Siri decided to give it a try. — I came for recruiting through Lobby X. Without a -relationship-, I simply directly asked the sergeant: -Will you take it?-. She was in a dress, with a -frog- backpack. They asked: -Are you sure you're here?-. I say: -Yes, I called you!- she laughs. The girl's motivation convinced the command, and she was taken. Weeks of training, courses and training began, during which the girl learned to work with drones and thought that she would be a Mavic operator. After studying in Britain, where she saw FPV for the first time, she finally decided that she wanted to work in this direction. In general, almost a year passed from the moment of decision on mobilization to departure on a combat mission. — I remember there was a long learning process. At first we waited two weeks for the shipment to Britain. Then study there. They came back and waited another two weeks. We were told that there will be training on the -Maviks-, then the actual training on them&#8230; In general, I was in the training centers for about two months, if not more. And then everything happened very quickly - I arrived, stayed somewhere for four days, they told me: -Do you want to go?- I answered: -I want,- the girl recalls. The first line of responsibility. The first combat task. Only the beginning and immediately difficult and difficult direction - Krynyk. For her, they became the first realization of what war is. How scary it is, how many losses. And on the other hand, understanding how much these people really are titans. Human potential is huge. We can do things that were difficult to even imagine. - I have never been so close to death. But I'm lucky - I'm not in the infantry. I see the war on the screen and it's a little easier. Sometimes the brain sees it as a movie or a game. But when the realization comes that this is reality&#8230; it's scary,'' Siri recalls. - It is difficult to realize how large-scale it all is. When you're in civilian life, you just read the news: -so many occupiers have been destroyed,- -so-and-so died,- it's kind of in the background. Here, on the front line, you see how technology is rapidly developing. One method worked yesterday, but today it no longer works, because Russia is also developing. This is a rather ambivalent perception. I felt it for the first time in Krynyk. After the Kherson region, her brigade was transferred to the Kurakhiv direction, where the battle tactics were significantly different. The enemy quickly adapted, their intelligence worked more efficiently: - It is hotter here in terms of assaults. First, there are new working conditions. In Kherson region, we did not work from the landings. It's not that it's harder or easier, it's just a little different. We prefer to work in the countryside because basements are safer than dugouts. A different situation has developed here: the enemy can reach you on foot. There was water in the Kherson region, even if they wanted to, they couldn't get that close. Now it's a new danger - DRG. Fortunately, we did not have any cases when they came to us or were noticed close. For now. But everything can change. Yes, this is a new threat, new conditions. You have to be on duty, preferably at night, to listen if someone is there or not. Well, it's hotter here in terms of assaults. It was easier there: driving into a position was easier. At the time we were there, FPV drones weren't working that efficiently. The main fighting took place in Krynyk itself, so their intelligence was also there. We were on our shore, so they did less reconnaissance. Although it sometimes happened, but not that often. They usually adjusted the artillery. A new threat has appeared: their intelligence works very well. Unfortunately, they quickly notice the antennas, can see when you take the drone out, even in landing. Even if you place the antenna between the trees, it is still visible. We don't have a very good radio horizon here. Our antenna is higher than the trees, so they figure us out very quickly and start coming at us. There was less of this in Krynyi, because they simply conducted less intelligence. And now they work from all sides - from above, directly, from the left, from the side. They find us very quickly. That's why it's hotter here in this respect, the girl says. By education, she is a specialist in social work, and now she is a military servicewoman who talks about the situation, the nature of hostilities, using general terms and concepts, having her own experience of hostilities in difficult conditions, but she does not feel completely military: - They tell me: -You are a soldier.- And I'm like: -No, no, you shouldn't call me that!-. I am too civilian for the military, too military for civilians. Siri still intends to continue his military career: - If the war does not end before the end of the contract, then perhaps I will consider the option of taking courses and obtaining an officer's rank, but it is too early to talk about it. It's so much responsibility to be honest&#8230; Well, I haven't really thought about it yet. But I don't know how long the war will last. We all imagined that it was for 10 years, and we did not think about civilian life at all. Looking at the contract, I still have two years left. I don't remember how old I am, but I think I'll be out of the army at 25 and&#8230; I can't do anything. So, of course, I'm thinking about something related to the military. I would be interested in international cooperation, because I know the language and understand military affairs, she says. — I don't consider myself a veteran. For me, it was always people who came to us at school: adults, serious, who talked about their military actions, says the servicewoman. — But sometimes you look at that paper&#8230; Yes, it's just a bill. In fact, it can break at any moment. And you are like: -Damn, but it's cool!-. But it was very difficult for me to come to the fact that I really deserved it. For example, when I was given a UBD, I put it down. And it wasn't that I was ashamed, I just didn't feel that I deserved it. But over time&#8230; So I even bought a pink case for him! It's certainly not very military, forgive me!&#8221; Siri smiles. Understanding the difficulties that the modern generation of young Ukrainians has to face in the conditions of war and constant stress, she herself, like no one else, realizes how important it is to communicate with young people on the topic of raising healthy patriotic attitudes in them and constantly preparing them for possible challenges in the future: - I want them to graduated and had the opportunity to live in a peaceful, civil, beautiful Ukraine, went to university and had a normal life&#8230; A life that, unfortunately, we do not have, but it will be as it will be. And it seems to me that it is necessary to prepare for this. Russia is not going anywhere, unfortunately. And at any moment, she can attack again. That's why you need to prepare, you need basic military training. I think absolutely for everyone. And I'm not just talking about boys now. I don't know if they are reviewing the curricula now? It would be cool to introduce classes on drones in computer science. Why not? This is our future. Everyone needs to prepare. And this does not mean that you will necessarily fight. It would be great to invite young veterans to the school, ask them about their experiences, just show the reality. I believe that the youth should communicate with the youth, because in this way they would feel more comfortable than in communication with the older generation, taking into account the social and psychological component of the behavior of young people, - emphasizes the servicewoman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/rekrutyng-u-sukni-z-ryukzakom-zhabka-vijna-na-ekrani-operatorky-bpla-siri/	2025-02-18T20:27:22-08:00
rosfake about -paid evacuation- in Kherson: how everything actually happens	Russian mass media and information resources controlled by them claim that Ukrainian authorities in Kherson are forcing local residents to pay for evacuation from the city. According to them: In reality, the situation is radically different from what Russian propagandists portray. Ukrainian authorities organize evacuation for those who wish to leave dangerous areas, and this process is absolutely free for citizens. In particular: The main goal of such information attacks is to sow distrust in the Ukrainian authorities and create chaos among the population. Russian propaganda is trying: it is not the first time that Russian propaganda has used such methods to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. However, with critical thinking and trust in reliable sources, we can withstand these informational attacks and stay calm in difficult times.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/rosfejk-pro-platnu-evakuacziyu-v-hersoni-yak-vse-vidbuvayetsya-naspravdi/	2025-02-18T20:13:18-08:00
Steel -Ty-: The story of a warrior who grew up in -Country- and returned to books	The 23-year-old fighter with the call sign -Tai- (in honor of the antagonist Tai Lung from the children's cartoon) quickly realized that war is not like computer shooters. And if in Counter-Strike you can restart the game after a failed mission, then there is no second chance on the front line. During half a year of service, David gained serious combat experience. The most difficult test was the battle in Toretsk, where his unit faced the enemy literally through the wall - in the neighboring entrances of a four-story building. -At first it was scary,- admits the fighter. -But the comrades knew how to find words that encouraged them to beat the enemy with all their might.- Now they are a real family to him. Despite the brutal realities of the front, David does not lose himself. In between tasks, he returns to books, his old passion. But -Taya's- biggest dream is to go home. To Sumshchyna, where his wife and little son are waiting. The steel warrior of -Staleva Sotka- continues his journey - not only as a fighter, but also as a person fighting for the future of his family and the entire country. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian border guards from the Gart brigade continue to clear Kharkiv region from the Russian invaders and their fortifications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/stalevyj-taj-istoriya-voyina-shho-vyris-na-kontri-ta-povernuvsya-do-knyzhok/	2025-02-18T11:58:55-08:00

However, operatives of the Chernivtsi border detachment exposed the idea of ​​preparing to violate the state border and detained a group of people. -The violators prepared carefully, because they were equipped with so-called invisibility cloaks, in which they planned to move further and in which a person could not be seen with the help of a thermal imager,- the DPSU noted. During the communication with the detainees, the border guards learned that residents of Ivano-Frankivsk and Khmelnytskyi regions found the organizer of the illegal scheme through one of the telegram channels. The men paid him 8,000 euros each for illegal transportation abroad. -Regarding the guide, a report was sent to the law enforcement agencies under Article 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The information is included in the EDPR. Regarding the rest of the detainees, administrative offense protocols have been drawn up,- the DPSU said.

Air dome — -Birds of Magyar- took up the protection of Kherson from enemy drones	A video about it was released on February 18 on the brigade's channel. -Yesterday, 47 FPV drones were detected, 39 of which were destroyed. The percentage is quite low, but I remind you again that all these 39 suppressed drones have gone somewhere. One way or another, the explosion happened. It is not controlled. The drone falls exactly at the moment when suppression is applied to it,- said brigade commander Major Robert Brovdy. According to him, the number of enemy drones is not as large as during the operation in Krynk, where the enemy used one and a half hundred FPV drones per day, but the situation in Kherson is complicated by the fact that the enemy is deliberately targeting the civilian population. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 414 shock brigade -Birds of Magyar- unmanned aerial systems destroyed dozens of units of enemy equipment - from trucks to tanks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/povitryanyj-kupol-ptahy-madyara-uzyalysya-za-zahyst-hersona-vid-vorozhyh-droniv/	2025-02-18T09:22:21-08:00
Forty-seven evaders - the record-breaking carrier went to court in Odesa	This was reported on February 18 by the prosecutor's office of Odesa region. The investigation established that a 30-year-old resident of Odesa region organized an illegal channel for men of draft age to leave Ukraine. The group consisted of a policeman he knew, a citizen of a foreign country and two local residents. Accomplices searched for -clients- and organized their -escape- to unrecognized Transnistria. The policeman provided cover — informing about the location of roadblocks and laying out safe detour routes. Men had to cross the border along paths, bypassing official checkpoints. For such -services-, criminals received from 4 to 18.5 thousand US dollars from each evader. Law enforcement officers exposed the group to the crime in June 2024 during an attempt to transport 47 people to a forest strip near the border with unrecognized Transnistria. During the investigation, at least four cases of illegal transfer of persons, as well as receiving payment in the form of digital assets on a crypto-wallet, were documented. Currently, the organizer and one of his accomplices are in custody.

Series -Ы- and -Ъ- - GUR told how the Russian army is modernizing -Shakhedi- and other attack UAVs	The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on February 18. Since the beginning of 2025, a number of significant changes have been recorded in the structure of Shahed-136 (-geran-2-, -harpy-): -On the tamper-proof 8-channel satellite navigation CRP antenna with a circular arrangement of peripheral patch antennas, a sticker with markings in Chinese and English -Agricultural equipment parts- and a number indicating for production in 2024,- the statement said. It is noted that the manufacturing method and the color of the body of this antenna are similar to other units and units of the -Ы- series of -Shaheed- manufactured by Iran and the Russian Federation, so the discovered sticker is probably used to mislead about the real origin and purpose of the CRP antenna. -Increasingly, the aggressor state uses products manufactured in China as an alternative to components from the USA, the EU and other countries,- noted the GUR. For example, in the above-mentioned 8-channel antenna of the latest versions of the Shahed-136, the Russians replaced the US-made XILINX Kintex-7 programmable logic integrated circuit, which is a critical component of the CRP antenna, with an integrated circuit manufactured by Beijing Microelectronics Technology, China. UAVs produced on the basis of the special economic zone -Yelabuga- in addition to -Ы- received a new series - -Ъ-. UAVs produced at the -Kupol- electromechanical plant (Izhevsk) received a new -KC- series in addition to the previous -K- and -KB- ones. -There is information that, in addition to the 8-channel comet M8 antennas, new Russian 12-channel comet CRP antennas are also used in the production of enemy attack drones,- the GUR said. Russians use disposable Telegram bots and a Raspberry Pi mini computer, a web camera, and 3G/LTE modems to capture and transmit a video image of the target. According to the scouts, manufactured at the factory in Yelabuga UAVs -Gerbera-, which previously performed a simulation function, the enemy began to equip them with combat units OFBCH-2.5 produced by the enterprise -Basalt- and engineering ammunition KZ-6. A detonator connected to the flight controller via a RUICHI SSR-10DD solid-state relay is used to activate the warhead. Russia is also setting up production of an analogue of the Shahed-238 jet, the Geran-3, with a Tolou-10/13 small-sized turbojet two-circuit engine, which provides a flight speed of up to 550-600 km/h and a range of 2,500 km. -There are a number of tools in the world to create a component famine in Russia for its nuclear weapons - sanctions, export control, compliance, KYC, CHPL. Competent authorities of various countries are capable of cutting off the aggressor from the elements she needs, from OFAC to TAXUD, as well as companies producing components, journalists on different continents,- the GUR summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of the -Stugna- special unit, which is part of the -Timur Special Unit- of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, in the Kupyansk direction, conducted an operation to eliminate the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/seriyi-%d1%8b-ta-%d1%8a-%e2%80%95-u-gur-rozpovily-yak-armiya-rf-modernizuye-shahedy-ta-inshi-udarni-bpla/	2025-02-18T08:16:04-08:00

After the beginning of the invasion, he voluntarily came to the Military Commissariat, but due to the lack of a suitable military specialty, he had to wait. A month later, he learned about recruitment into the unit, and on March 23, 2022, he joined the ranks of the Ukrainian army. His company guarded Kyiv for about a year, after which he got into the rifle battalion of the first tank brigade, took courses and became a unit commander. During the defense of positions in Kurshchyna, there were about 25 fighters under his leadership. -Buhor- emphasizes: the main thing is to correctly distribute responsibilities and dig in. Deep shelters save lives, and discipline and trust between fighters help to endure during the fiercest attacks. One day, the enemy launched an assault, landing a landing force of four armored vehicles. Thanks to coordinated actions, the Ukrainian military repelled the attack and was able to hold its position. -My boys are real -rexes-. They proved that they are ready to fight and win. Some of them were going on a mission for the first time, but they acted as a single mechanism. Thanks to this, we were able to repel several assaults,- says -Buhor-. Having suffered several contusions, he underwent treatment and a military medical board, which found him fit for rear service. He is currently undergoing an internship as a clerk in the division. -I hope to stay here and help my brothers. The main thing is that they all return alive,- says -Buhor-. As ArmyInform reported, there are no easy professions in war, but combat medics are those who stand between life and death every day. They pull the wounded from under the fire, put tourniquets under the explosions and do everything possible to save every fighter. One ​​of such medics is a soldier with the call sign -Takmed-.

About this on the air of the TV channel -Suspilne.Novyny- told representative of the press service of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo Andriy Polukhin. According to him, in Chasovoy Yar, the enemy is trying to make a way through the channel Siverskyi Donets — Donbas for their landing equipment. But at this time, the enemy's attacks are successfully repulsed. Andriy Polukhin notes that it is difficult to name the exact number of enemy casualties. But they are three or even five times more than the Defense Forces. -At this time, all their creativity is connected with the use of manpower. The enemy is trying to flood the city itself with his infantry. It takes advantage of the weather when there is fog or precipitation and limited use of our drones. When the weather is clearer, the enemy suffers slightly less losses, because he is in cover,- Andrii Polukhin said. As reported by ArmyInform, there were 55 military clashes per day in the Pokrovsky direction. Capturing Pokrovsk is the main objective of this phase of the campaign for the enemy.

Repair -Vampire- in the field: how the drones of the -Hart- brigade use the rule of three -C-	Vampire repair video published on the brigade page. During one of the sorties, a Vampire of the Fury unit of the Garth brigade made a hard landing, which resulted in minor damage. Sending the drone immediately to the rear for repairs is not the best solution, because any unnecessary movement in the combat zone increases the risk of being spotted by enemy UAVs. In addition, it is a waste of time, and the task of destroying enemy tanks in the direction required immediate implementation. Therefore, border guards-drones decided to carry out repairs directly in the field, using improvised means. In this, they were helped by the rule of three -Cs-, which they always follow. What is the rule of three -Cs-? The rule of three -Cs- is a kind of code of drones of the Gart brigade, which helps them to make quick and effective decisions in difficult situations. It reads as follows: It was thanks to these three -C's- that the Vampire crew was able to quickly assess the damage to the drone, find the necessary materials and tools, and promptly carry out repairs right at the crash landing site. How was the repair? Repairing the Vampire in the field is always a challenge. However, thanks to their ingenuity and professionalism, the drones of the -Hart- brigade successfully coped with this task. They used materials at hand such as tape, iso tape, plastic ties and others to restore the damaged parts of the drone. Special attention was paid to the restoration of critical systems such as the engine, wings and control system. Thanks to coordinated work and strict adherence to the three -C- rule, repairs were carried out quickly and with high quality. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian border guards from the -Gart- brigade continue to clear the Kharkiv region from the Russian invaders and their fortifications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/remont-vampira-v-polovyh-umovah-yak-dronari-brygady-gart-vykorystovuyut-pravylo-troh-s/	2025-02-18T03:38:49-08:00

-I traded metal hearts for live ones-: the story of a combat medic -Takmeda-	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of 141 separate infantry brigade. -I come from Dnipro, studied at the National Metallurgical Academy, worked as a car mechanic. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, I was stopped at a checkpoint and taken into the army. And I don't regret it, because now I help people stay alive,- says Takmed. After basic training, he entered the combat medics. Military instructors quickly realized that he had the necessary skills and determination. -At first it was unusual, but then I got involved. I saw a guy pass out when he saw blood at a training session. And I was interested - I even voluntarily went to an autopsy to understand how the human body works. It helped in the real world.- Evacuating the wounded is now a daily risk. -It used to be easier - we drove to the disembarkation point and moved to the positions. Now the enemy controls every meter, uses drones, mines roads. Any exit is a potential ambush.- Once, comrades came to Takmed's position, chatted and returned. -After six hours, the guys run in and shout: -Trouble!- Explosions, shelling&#8230; I am leaving - they are dragging the wounded. One has his legs torn to the knees - I saw all the bones. Tourniquets, hemostatic measures, transportation—everything happened under fire. 82mm and 120mm mortar fire began. While he was helping one, others ran in - every 10 minutes more wounded were brought. We pulled out five in total that day.- -I tell the guys all the time, at least learn how to put a turnstile! It could save your life or someone else's life. When I see that a person can go on his own, I send him on his own so as not to endanger the evacuation transport. And when there is internal bleeding, injuries to vital organs, then without immediate help you cannot survive.- Once, -Takmed- had to evacuate a dead comrade. -The 200th brothers went, and the enemy began to throw petals at us. One guy was blown up, his foot was blown off, another had his whole body cut by a landmine. These were my friends, and for the first few seconds I just froze. But then he pulled himself together and we pulled them out. They survived and are now in rehabilitation.- Despite the war, Takmed has his passions. -I'm a car mechanic, I like to fix cars. Our old ones are a separate story, but I try to keep them in good condition. In our spare time, we play FIFA, although I prefer to watch others play.- He fights for his land, for his family, for his brothers. -My home is in the Dnipro. For now, our fight is here and I'm doing everything I can to get the guys back alive.- As reported by ArmyInform, Rodion with the call sign -Jupiter- is a soldier of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade, originally from from Khmelnytskyi.

However, it was near Pokrovsk that obvious signs began to appear that the Russians were starting to run out of steam. -Despite a great advantage in manpower, the Russians have lost what in English is called momentum. This is the same moment of momentum that allows you to press. Because, first of all, it is impossible to maintain such pressure all the time. They are also exhausted.

They started to lose even RSZV. This means that they are affected quite deeply. And manpower losses are also very high. 7 thousand killed and total losses of 14-15.

Military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia poses a serious threat to the international communi...	This stated the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, in an interview with the South Korean publication The Chosun. According to him, the North Korean group lost about 4,000 soldiers killed and seriously wounded in the war against Ukraine. But despite significant losses, North Korean forces continue to actively participate in joint operations with Russian troops. There is also an increase in the number of North Korean artillery at the front. -This war mobilized all the military capabilities of the countries involved. Only three states—Ukraine, Russia, and North Korea—gain direct experience of full-scale war in the 21st century. The future North Korean army will be radically different from the past,- Kyrylo Budanov emphasized. The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine emphasized that the aggressor state Russia and the DPRK are deepening military cooperation in the sphere of technology, science and industry. -This cooperation reaches the highest level and poses a serious threat to the international community. [&#8230;] North Korea is using this war to gain combat experience and modernize its military technology. This will have long-term consequences for the security system in the Asia-Pacific region,- noted Kyrylo Budanov. As an example, he described the changes that North Korea's KN-23 missile has undergone. -At first, its accuracy was very low, with an error of 500 to 1,500 meters, but Russian specialists made technical modifications. Now the missile has become much more accurate and is a much more serious threat,- noted the head of the Ukrainian intelligence service, adding that this missile weapon threatens the security of South Korea and Japan. Kyrylo Budanov expressed hope that cooperation between Kyiv and Seoul will deepen. -Both Ukraine and South Korea are facing the same enemy - North Korea. South Korea has decades of intelligence on North Korea, and that information would be extremely valuable to us. Ukraine is now gaining combat experience on its own battlefield.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Emmanuel Macron discussed security guarantees for Ukraine	This was reported by the head of the Ukrainian state on his page. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, France and Ukraine share a common vision of the need for reliable and strong security guarantees. He emphasized that any other decision, including a fragile ceasefire without clear guarantees, would be just another deception on the part of Russia and could lead to new aggression against Ukraine or other European countries. Emmanuel Macron, for his part, informed the Ukrainian leader about his negotiations with other European and world leaders. As a result of the conversation, the parties agreed to maintain constant contact and continue work on strengthening the security of Ukraine and the region as a whole. -It is necessary to ensure reliable, lasting peace. It can only be a consequence of strong security guarantees,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that Ukraine should have clearly defined security guarantees: NATO or reliable alternative.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/volodymyr-zelenskyj-ta-emmanyuel-makron-obgovoryly-garantiyi-bezpeky-dlya-ukrayiny/	2025-02-17T21:19:34-08:00
The daring French, 10 Polish billions and the fleet in Naples: who in Europe is the world leader in ...	-On February 18, the first serious negotiation process should take place between the United States of America and representatives from the Russian Federation to find a formula for exiting this phase of the war. This is a very fundamental event indeed. And representatives of European countries clearly react to it, especially in the context of the Munich conference that took place. Because it is known that the Europeans will not be involved there (in the negotiations between the USA and the Russian Federation - ed.). France takes the most active position. And the French say they are beginning to rebuild a major security process that may be independent of the United States. And here there are several pitfalls, very serious ones. Europe after the Second World War was under the nuclear umbrella, primarily of the United States of America. And we must understand that 90% of the NATO bloc is the United States. At the same time, the Europeans still remain major arms producers. Let's say, according to the results of 2024, the French for the first time in their history as a weapons manufacturer came in second place after the United States. Will such a peculiar military demarche of the French be crowned with success? In my opinion, it is still too early to draw a conclusion. Because there are countries in Europe that directly sympathize with the Russian Federation. I mean Hungary, Slovakia. Let's not forget that right-wing and left-wing forces are gaining momentum. What is Marine Le Pen's party worth in France itself? Not to mention the fact that -Alternative for Germany- in Germany is a right-wing populist party, and I would call it the extreme right, which is very much claiming a serious role in the parliamentarianism of this country. Will Europe try to build some kind of collective system? Yes, it will definitely be. Large manufacturers of weapons and equipment have already announced joint projects, both with Ukraine, and the restoration of entire production chains. And, let's say, a country like Poland bought more than 10 billion dollars worth of weapons. Which is an unprecedented phenomenon on the European continent since the collapse of the Warsaw bloc. However, here we really need to be patient and wait, because the interests of the big players do not always coincide. Let's not forget, there is Great Britain, which left the European Union and remembered that it was once a powerful empire. The Scandinavians started militarization very seriously. For the first time since World War II, both Sweden and Finland joined NATO. In fact, the voices are getting louder and louder that every country should spend more than two - and some already say even 3-4% - of the gross domestic product on defense. The process has begun. And it will grow. But in view of the fact that there are 28-30 countries of the European Union and NATO countries on the European continent, it will not happen all at once. This will take some time. And I have no reason to say that it will all be very fast and very high quality. But even if we just focus purely on the financial part, I must remind that over 140 billion dollars were allocated to us during this war, primarily by the countries of the European Union. The USA is on the second step in these indicators. So, in the strategic sense of understanding that war as a tool of geopolitics has returned to our history, the Europeans have. And they will gradually develop their own outlines of collective security. Will it come to a point when Europe will completely follow America? In my opinion, no. Because we must understand that the presence of American troops in Europe is not only a security part. This is also finance. One aircraft carrier strike group, which is, say, in the Mediterranean and is based in the city of Naples, that's a huge cost of maintenance. And these, accordingly, are the funds of manufacturers of both weapons and maintenance. And countless examples can be drawn here. But speculation in this direction will continue. Indeed, Trump announced a strategic concept called Make America Great Again. Which means let's make America great again. And such strategic processes of isolationism are now visible in them. The most important takeaway from all of this. Both Europe and the world in general are entering a zone of enormous geopolitical turbulence. And the cascades of small, medium and, perhaps, one big war will only increase.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/zuhvali-franczuzy-10-polskyh-milyardiv-ta-flot-u-neapoli-hto-v-yevropi-svitovyj-lider-u-pytannyah-bezpeky/	2025-02-17T21:10:24-08:00
The aggressor keeps a missile carrier in the Black Sea: there is a threat of a strike	This was reported by the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the same time, there are currently no enemy ships in the Sea of ​​Azov. Four more Russian ships, three of which also carry Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 26 missiles, remain in the Mediterranean Sea. During the day, in the interests of the Russian Federation, passage through the Kerch Strait was carried out: the Russian Federation continues to violate the International Convention for the Protection of Life at Sea of ​​1974. (SOLAS) by disabling automatic identification systems. As reported by ArmyInform, the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces monitor mine safety in the water area around the ports. Odesa, however, in other places it is quite problematic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/agresor-trymaye-raketonosij-u-chornomu-mori-ye-zagroza-udaru-2/	2025-02-17T21:07:43-08:00
Additional 70,000 -combat-: who has the right, the calculation procedure and whether it is possible ...	And although it is called -disposable-, but is essentially reusable. After all, you can receive it several times. How it works, ArmiyaInform tells. This payment is intended specifically for those who directly perform combat or special tasks on the front lines of the enemy or in his rear: This payment works on an accrual basis for every 30 days of tasks. That is, if, for example, you were on the front line for 15 days in February and another 15 days will be in March, then already in April you should receive 70,000. If there will be, for example, 18 days in March. So in April you will still receive 70,000, and another 3 days will go into the account for the next payment. And so every time 70 thousand for every 30 days of combat (special) tasks. So it turns out that the -one-time- reward turns into a multiple one. Importantly! The performance of such tasks must be confirmed on the basis of a combat order, combat log, or combat report, and a unit commander's report on the performance of tasks by each serviceman. If a serviceman is seconded to another unit, then it is the unit that must keep track of the days of tasks and transfer this data to the staff unit where the serviceman is serving. And on the basis of these data, the staff unit must issue a payment order. Data is transmitted by the 5th. That is, if in June a military serviceman accumulates 30 days of performing tasks on the front line, then by July 5 these data must be in his regular part to calculate the payment. It is worth making sure that this data is transferred. If the serviceman was transferredto another unit, then information about the number of days of combat missions (if there were less than 30 and the payment has not yet been made) must be in the order of the commander of the military unit. Therefore, during the transfer, it is worth checking that these days are included in the order. We will remind that these 70 thousand are not a replacement for 100 thousand -combatants-, but an additional reward to them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/dodatkovi-70-tysyach-bojovyh-hto-maye-pravo-poryadok-obchyslennya-ta-chy-mozhna-otrymaty-ne-raz/	2025-02-17T20:47:51-08:00
The Middle East -Spider- is spreading its webs: the demand for the products of the Israeli manufactu...	The authors of the Dutch portal for the study of defense processes Army Recognition (AR) note that representatives of the military department of this Asian island state announced the relevant intentions in the first decade of February, ArmyInform reports. At the same time, AR experts emphasize the fact that for official Manila, the products of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems from the Israeli city of Haifa are well known. After all, the Spyder-MR complexes are in the arsenal of the Philippine Air Force. It is worth noting that the Spyder family of systems (Ukrainian: -Pavuk-) was developed by Rafael with the participation of another Israeli defense giant, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), and has several versions that differ in range and launch methods. Spyder-SR (Short Range) and Spyder-ER (Extended Range) are designed for close and medium range protection. The Spyder-SR has a maximum engagement range of up to 15 km, while the Spyder-ER can intercept targets at a distance of up to 25 km. These complexes use inclined launchers, which speeds up the targeting process and reduces reaction time. The Spyder is built on a modular basis and is designed to intercept a variety of aerial threats, including aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. The main advantage of the complex is its mobility, ability to work in difficult radio-electronic conditions and flexibility in integration with different platforms. Python-5 missiles with an infrared guidance system and Derby missiles with an active radar correction head are selected as standard ammunition for hitting targets for this complex. Python-5 has high maneuverability and the ability to capture the target -after launch-, which allows the operator to change the pre-selected target to another already in the direct flight mode of the missile. An important feature of the Spyder is the use of modern radar systems. The standard version uses various radars from IAI Elta, such as EL/M-2106 ATAR 3D and EL/M-2138M Green Rock AESA. The variants of the medium and long-range systems (Spyder-MR and Spyder-LR) integrate the EL/M-2084 multifunctional radar, which is also used in the famous Israeli system -Iron Dome-, which has been repeatedly discussed site IKK Defense Express, the Spyder All in One system can be used both as an independent unit and as part of a battery. The maximum number of targets fired at the same time is 4. The minimum time to prepare for combat readiness is 3 minutes. The weight of the machine, including eight missiles, is about 30 tons. Spyder, according to the official portal of the manufacturing company, is actively exported to various countries, including India, the aforementioned Philippines, Singapore and the Czech Republic. India uses the complex to protect its military facilities, while the Philippines has adapted the system using modified radars. High mobility and modularity make this air defense complex attractive to states seeking to provide reliable airspace protection without the need to deploy large fixed systems. Current trends in Spyder development include improving targeting algorithms, improving jamming and adapting to new types of threats, including stealth drones and hypersonic targets. Israeli developers are working with the experience of using this defense equipment during recent military conflicts of IDF fighters in the Gaza Strip and in the north, actively working to increase the range of detection of enemy objects and the effectiveness of missile interceptors, which will allow the system to remain relevant in the conditions of a permanent military situation. The Spyder family of Israeli air defense systems is air defense against all threats.

-Magic montage- from the FSB: in the swamps they create -horror stories- for their own population	Russian propagandists traditionally rely on cheap editing, primitive scripts and actors who, in a peaceful life, probably work as porters. In a recent video released by the -public- of the FSB, Ukrainian soldiers seem to be shooting at their comrades. Everything would be scary if it wasn't so funny. The problem is that the -murder- is filmed as unconvincingly as the Russian -referendum- in Mariupol. The camera shakes on purpose, at the climax of the -shot-, the video cuts, and the body of the -killed- never enters the frame after the -execution-. No splashes of blood, no real fall physics are classic signs of a fake video created in the best traditions of Russia's TikTok troops. Facebook movie fans do not particularly burden themselves with the thoughtfulness of the script, so their -exclusives- are easy to check: Sharp editing - frames are cut exactly at the moment of a shot or other -violent- scene. No aftermath – no blood, bullet marks, or physical body reactions. Inadequate quality - the camera is deliberately shaken or shot at dusk to hide details. Lack of confirmation - There is no evidence that the video is related to the ZSU. the Kremlin again resorts to dirty tricks, because it simply has no other methods of influencing the world. War crimes, terror and propaganda are the three pillars on which the Russian empire of lies rests. However, with each such fake, they only prove their weakness. Because while the Russians are filming production videos, Ukrainian soldiers are destroying their warehouses, headquarters and equipment. The reality is this: mass shootings do take place in the Russian army, only the mobs themselves, who are thoughtlessly thrown to the front lines, become the victims. But this is no longer a fake, but a reality. And no editing will hide it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/magiya-montazhu-vid-fsb-na-bolotah-stvoryuyut-strashylky-dlya-vlasnogo-naselennya/	2025-02-17T20:11:41-08:00

Video published by the Chief of Communications of the Land Forces Command Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on his Facebook page on February 17. In the short video, you can see how a guy in a military uniform and with the inscription TCC on his back enters the stage. After that, another guy runs onto the stage and gives a -military- blow, after which he falls to the floor and is dragged backstage. On the recording, you can hear that at this time there is laughter and applause in the hall. -How did we get to the point where mobilization — a necessary step for the survival of the country — became the object of ridicule at the level of school events? Isn't it because the adults themselves spread the narrative about the -criminal TCC- while the real criminals sit in the Kremlin? War does not forgive mistakes, and one of the biggest is the substitution of concepts. And if in the minds of Ukrainian children, the Ukrainian military is an enemy, and to -draw- him is a manifestation of heroism, then to all of us it is a huge fat -two-, - wrote Vitaly Sarantsev. The post spread widely on social networks, and the actions of schoolchildren and teachers who allowed this skit caused outrage in society. On Monday evening, the Minister of Education of Ukraine Oksen Lisovyi reacted to the incident. -The video, in which students of a Kyiv school act out a skit in which they show open contempt for the -military-, is shameful and unacceptable in the third year of a full-scale invasion and the 11th year of the war,- he wrote on his Facebook page. He said that he called the principal of the school with the demand to conduct an internal investigation and collect explanations from all those who participated in this act. -I personally find it strange that none of those who participated in the preparation and direct participation in this scene felt resistance. A thorough official investigation should be conducted, and appropriate decisions should be made regarding all those involved. No one has the right to show disrespect to those who protect the country at the cost of their lives and health,- the minister emphasized. responded to the scandalous school play in Darnytsia to the district state administration, informing that a commission was created for the purpose of investigation, based on the results of which -an appropriate assessment of the case will be provided.- Kyiv police reported that juvenile police officers are conducting an investigation following an incident during a school play. -At the moment, employees of juvenile prevention of the Darnytsia police department are communicating with the administration of the educational institution, as well as with minor -actors,- the law enforcement officers said in a statement.

The NATO-Ukraine Joint Center has officially opened	This was reported by the Government Portal. The event was attended by the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration - Minister of Justice of Ukraine Olga Stefanishyna, Deputy Secretary General of NATO Radmila Shekerinska, Supreme Commander of NATO for Transformation Admiral Pierre Vandieu and Minister of Defense of Poland Władysław Kosyniak-Kamysh. -Today I am happy to be here personally and to state that the first joint institution of Ukraine and NATO in history is officially opened. On behalf of Ukraine, I express my sincere gratitude to colleagues from NATO and Poland for the great joint work that made the opening of the Center possible,- the Deputy Prime Minister emphasized in her speech. She reported that the Center showed the first results even before its official opening: yes, in the fall of 2024, measures were taken on the issues of sustainability, assimilation of medical knowledge and operational interoperability of air defense. Separately, Olga Stefanishyna noted that today, when a brutal war is raging on the territory of Europe, peace and security should become the first priority issues for the democratic world — in particular, for the sake of strengthening the Alliance itself. NATO's Supreme Commander for Transformation, Admiral Pierre Wandier, emphasized that JATEC is a direct response to the war in Ukraine. -The war, which has been going on for almost 3 years, determines both immediate and future defense needs. A war that forces everyone to learn and adapt quickly, every day. JATEC addresses this vital need, today and tomorrow,- he said. Vladyslav Kosinyak-Kamysh noted the key historical moment in which the opening of the Center takes place. He expressed confidence that this will only strengthen the unity of Poland, the Alliance and Ukraine. On the eve of the opening ceremony, a constituent meeting of the JATEC Senior Supervisory Board was held. Such meetings will be held at least once a year.

Manifestation of cowardice and crime: in the Lviv region, unknown persons attacked a serviceman of t...	This is stated in the notification of the Lviv RTCC and SP. Today, at 11:45 a.m., a brazen attack was made on Lvivska street. Two unidentified persons attacked the serviceman, inflicting cuts on him with an unknown sharp object. The probable cause of the attack is an attempt to create conditions for the escape of one of the conscripts who had to undergo a medical examination. As a result of the attack, this citizen fled. He is currently wanted. -This crime is not only a manifestation of cowardice, but also an open contempt for those who risk their lives every day for the sake of the country. Thousands of Ukrainians on the front line do their duty without hesitation. At the same time, there are those in the rear who choose the path of shameful escape, not even scrutinizing an attack on the military. Fear of death is natural. But a blow in the back to those who defend your land is not fear, it is meanness,- emphasized the Lviv RTCC and SP. Criminal proceedings have already been opened for this fact under Article 125 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. At the same time, an official investigation is ongoing in the Lviv RTCC and SP. -Appeal to all citizens of mobilization age. Do not choose the path of crime. Evading military service not only breaks the law, it puts you in the same category as those working for the enemy. Update your credentials on time. Perform your duties honestly.

His unit was the first to be sent for Patriot air defense training in January 2023 in the United States. -They trained there for three months, although it was very little. In America, Patriot air defense system operators undergo training for nine months, and this training was twisted three times for us. And in three months we mastered this type of weapon as much as possible, showed good knowledge, showed good skills. The partners were delighted,- the soldier assured. From the first days after returning to Ukraine, his unit began to defend the infrastructure facilities of the Kyiv region. -And during this period, my unit destroyed the Kh-47 Kinzhal aeroballistic missile on May 4, 2023. Then, over the entire period, dozens of ballistic targets were destroyed that flew into critical infrastructure objects of Kyiv region, at the civilian population,- he recalled. According to him, when working with the Patriot air defense system, a lot depends on the work of the operators themselves. -It is impossible to 100% work and destroy all targets. Even these destroyed targets still fall somewhere, crash on the ground. Effective performance of assigned combat tasks is achieved by the work of everyone, absolutely everyone, everyone who is in the unit,- noted the defender. He said that it is necessary to train and multiply experienced air defense specialists who will effectively influence the air defense system in the future. -On February 12, during another massive strike with the reinforcement of the enemy's attack UAVs, at 4:30 in the morning, information was received about the launch of ballistic missiles by the enemy. The calculation was at the workplace. Six ballistic targets were detected by means of intelligence. They worked cold-bloodedly,- the defender said. After the successful work, the guys from the settlement were in high spirits. -After that, we read on the morning news that the Air Force was flat-out lying. It demotivates our people a bit. They practice 100% every fight. They teach us the maximum. The support of Ukrainians, the support of the Ukrainian people is very important to us,- the defender emphasized.

-In Kurshchyna, Russians order God's service for the health of our soldiers-. Colonel Dmytrashkivsky...	The press officer of the temporary military commandant on the territory of the Russian Federation, Colonel Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi, spoke about the situation regarding civilians on the territory of Kurshchyna: -Today it became known that the Russian authorities have instructed their military to destroy the Suzhan district. Every morning, the -Gradiv- package is released. They beat in the squares - in the city, in the villages adjacent to the city of Suji. Every day we are faced with the need to evacuate injured people. Currently, about 10 of them are in medical institutions of Ukraine. In total, more than 100 people have already been deported to the territory of Ukraine. Let me remind you that on February 1, the Russians carried out an airstrike on a boarding school in the city of Suja, where local residents were staying. About 100 people were then under the rubble. 85 people were evacuated on the first night after a direct hit by an aerial bomb. People suffered varying degrees of injuries. One person died from his injuries. The further fate of these people is now in the hands of the International Red Cross. From the moment people crossed the border with Ukraine, they were handed over to the International Red Cross, which accommodated them and is now doing everything possible to ensure their comfortable living. People's ages are very different. There is a two-year-old child and there are people who are almost 90. There are still more than 1,500 people left in the territory of Suzhan district. And the Russians are methodically destroying them along with the houses. It is currently impossible to find out how many Russians have died, because the work is made very difficult by the constant operation of drones, which hit vehicles and even armored vehicles at the entrance to the city. Accordingly, the delivery of humanitarian aid, namely food and medical supplies, becomes more difficult. Russians hit ambulances with FPV drones. Therefore, the process of searching for people under the rubble is currently impossible. There are territories located in the zone of activity of the units of the Armed Forces. If our fighters have time, they provide assistance and evacuate people. Yesterday, for example, at night, a husband and wife were taken to a medical facility. A man lost an eye as a result of an aerial bomb explosion. In general, there were 13 aerial bomb strikes in one day and, characteristically, all the bombs fell near the houses, that is, they did not hit the houses, but they hit nearby and people were left without homes at all. In fact, the entire street was completely destroyed. People live in basements. Instead, the Russians are proud of the fact that they have great success in conducting hostilities. Although success is minimal. Russia does not need these people, and this is evidenced by the fact that a decision has not yet been made to accept these people on the territory of Russia. They should have been taken out a week ago. All the necessary assistance to the people was provided, but Russia is still silent about the reception of its citizens. Both the enemy and the population of Russia now know clearly what a war on their own territory is like. Interestingly, Russians pray a lot&#8230; for our soldiers. I'm serious, they call and say that they are visiting monasteries now, ordering God's service for our health and so on. One woman right here gives me a report - she calls and tells: -I was in such a monastery this weekend, I ordered a service for you, collected notes from the people of the Suzhan district and wrote a lot about you, your boys, so that you are all alive and healthy. She said that until the end of her life she would pray for us to God.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-zamovlyayut-bozhu-sluzhbu-za-zdorovya-nashyh-voyiniv-polkovnyk-dmytrashkivskyj-rozpoviv-pro-evakuacziyu-poranenyh-czyvilnyh/	2025-02-17T07:15:15-08:00

In particular, Russian military channels publish videos of the probable execution of Ukrainian servicemen who were captured by the Russians. On the video, Russian soldiers are repeatedly ordered to shoot prisoners of war. -This underlines that executions are a conscious policy of Russia. Such actions violate international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. As the Ombudsman of Ukraine, I immediately sent letters to the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross,- said Dmytro Lubinets. He emphasized that organizations should put pressure on the Russian side so that the Russian Federation feels the consequences of such actions and does not commit them in the future. -If you witnessed or have any information regarding the specified fact of a crime against Ukrainian servicemen, please report it immediately to the -hotline- of the Ombudsman of Ukraine at the number 0800 50 17 20,- the message reads.

Major Ivan Sekach, head of the communications department of the 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Corporal General Mark Bezruchka, told about this on the Espresso broadcast. According to him, there were three columns, each of which had 5-8 units of -armor-. The equipment did not fulfill its task - not a single column reached. However, a large number of infantry still gives the enemy an advantage, since the Russians have small advances. -Currently, we don't have enough infantry to counter infantry itself. Yes, we use shells, FPV drones and everything else. This stops the enemy, but he has opportunities to advance at the expense of infantry,- said the head of the communications department of the 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka.

Ukrainian drones hit the enemy's key defense enterprises in the Kuban	This is stated in the message of the SSO. About 20 explosions rang out at the Ilya oil refinery, about 400 kilometers from the territory controlled by the Ukrainian army. The fire is still raging at the facility. The plant has six technological units for oil refining with a capacity of 6.6 million tons per year.

Peacekeeping mission: how Europe reacts to the idea of ​​sending troops to Ukraine	An important point of such an agreement may be the placementof peacekeeping forces on Ukrainian territory, which will ensure a ceasefire. The USA, which so far communicates only directly with the Russians, without involving either Ukraine or Europe, has already declared that there will be no American soldiers in Ukraine under any circumstances. Therefore, the most likely option at the moment is the formation of such peacekeeping forces from the European military. And some countries have already expressed their support for participating in this mission. ArmyInform collected the reactions of European capitals regarding their readiness to send their troops to Ukraine. At the beginning of January, French President Emmanuel Macron took the initiative to deploy European peacekeepers on the territory of Ukraine. However, this was before all the loud statements and actions of the White House regarding the start of negotiations with the Russians. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that, taking into account the length of the front line, according to the calculations of the Ukrainian side, 100,000 troops will be needed for the peacekeeping mission, and Kyiv has already prepared a corresponding map for the allies. Actually, this is a very high figure. For comparison: the number of the German Bundeswehr is about 180,000 soldiers, and the armed forces of Great Britain — 148,000 soldiers. However, London was the first to officially declare that it was ready to send British troops to the territory of Ukraine to ensure the implementation of any peace agreement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in an article for The Telegraph emphasized that Europe faced -a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our continent-. -This involves further support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the introduction of our troops into the territory of the country, if necessary,- he said. After that, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson also stated that sending Swedish troops to Ukraine as part of peacekeeping forces is possible. -There has to be a very clear mandate for this force, and I don't think we'll be able to get that until we get further in the negotiations. But Sweden, as a rule, is involved in strengthening security in our part of the world, so I predict that we will be part of this process this time as well,- — he explained his position. The German government, as usual, issued a cautious statement, noting that it is premature to talk about sending peacekeepers at the moment -We have repeatedly said that we should first wait and see if he comes peace, as we hope, to Ukraine, and if so, in what way. Then we can discuss the conditions and how it can be organized,- — German government spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann said. The German government also expressed reservations about the announced talks between high-ranking Russian and American officials, warning that they should be aimed at -achieving lasting peace in Ukraine.- At the same time, neighboring Poland declared that it will not send its troops to Ukraine, but will support other countries that agree to this mission. -We do not foresee sending Polish soldiers to the territory of Ukraine, but we will support countries that may want to provide such guarantees,- — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk assured, adding that his country will also continue to provide military and financial support aid. Hungary, which traditionally opposes any military aid to Ukraine, criticized European leaders. The head of the Foreign Ministry, Peter Sijarto, said that Europe is allegedly -obstructing- the US president from concluding a peace agreement in Ukraine. -We welcome the resumption of the Russian-American dialogue at the highest level. We are pleased and relieved to learn that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a long conversation-, — said the Hungarian minister. Tonight in the capital of France, an emergency meeting initiated by Emmanuel Macron will take place after Donald Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said that the United States does not see Europe at the negotiating table to end Russia's war against Ukraine. In the meeting will be attended by Great Britain, Germany, France, Poland, Italy, Spain and Denmark, which will represent the Baltic and Scandinavian countries. A number of countries, in particular, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, expressed their disappointment that they were not invited to the summit. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who will also be at the summit, has already arrived in Paris. -Europe's security is going through a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine, but it also concerns us. We need an urgent rethink. We need to strengthen the defense. And we need both now,- she wrote on the social network Kh. European leaders will obviously discuss further joint actions against the background of the first steps of the new administration in the White House and the meeting of the US and Russian delegations organized by Washington on February 18 in Saudi Arabia regarding the end of the war in Ukraine. Among the issues should be a possible peacekeeping mission as part of the future agreement, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine. Europe's position is currently unequivocal — any peace agreement with Russia is impossible without European participants. Ukraine maintains the same position. -Ukraine will not take part in negotiations in Saudi Arabia and will not recognize any agreements about Ukraine without the participation of official Kyiv,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said on Monday while visiting the United Arab Emirates.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/myrotvorcha-misiya-yak-yevropa-reaguye-na-ideyu-vidpravyty-vijska-v-ukrayinu/	2025-02-17T06:18:11-08:00

Money was demanded from the relatives of the men who were taken to the recruitment center for verification of military registration documents. -If their relatives came to pick them up, the civil partner of the TCC employee approached them and offered to -solve the issue- for money. For 4.5 thousand USD plots promised to influence TCC officials and send the conscript home,- the report says. On February 13, 2025, law enforcement officers detained an employee of the TCC with an accomplice while receiving payment for such a service from the relatives of a mobilized person who had already joined the ranks of the Armed Forces. He learned about the fact that money was demanded from his family only after the arrest of the participants of the arrangement. -The employee of the TCC and his accomplice were informed of the suspicion of obtaining an illegal benefit for influencing the decision-making by a person authorized to perform state functions (Part 2, Article 28, Part 3, Article 369-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The issue of choosing a preventive measure for the detainee is being resolved,- the SBI said. The article is punishable by up to 8 years of imprisonment. The investigation is ongoing, the SBI is identifying all persons possibly involved in the device. As reported by ArmiyaInform, DBR employees detained an instructor of the recruiting department of the Mukachevo RTCC and SP, who for money helped men of draft age to escape from the premises of the assembly center, and to servicemen who were returned after voluntarily leaving the unit - from the reserve battalion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/zaroblyaly-na-rodychah-mobilizovanyh-pidozryuyut-spivrobitnyka-mykolayivskogo-rtczk-ta-sp/	2025-02-17T06:02:35-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi told what security guarantees Ukraine should have	He said this during a video conference with media representatives while on an official visit to the United Arab Emirates. According to him, security guarantees for Ukraine should be comprehensive and include weapons, as well as economic and political support. -If we don't have NATO, then, relatively speaking, NATO should be built in Ukraine. Conditionally speaking, but do not conditionally, but do objectively. That is, a million-strong army, and money is needed here, and who gives money for it. Besides money, there are weapons. If a contingent, then the size of this contingent, where they will be, from which countries, what and how they are armed. And if there is a contingent, it is very important not to lose the USA in one way or another,- the head of state said. He noted that there is significant progress in the issue of the contingent. In particular, it will be discussed today at the meeting of European leaders in France. The military contingent in Ukraine can also become the first platform for the creation of the future armed forces of Europe, which in the sky, on water and on land, with the help of drones and artificial intelligence, will be able to respond in the event of an attack. -We can create a platform from strong countries - only those who want to. This is very important: not those whom we force, but those who want. You know perfectly well that a warrior who was forced and a warrior who came on his own are completely different armies. We want security guarantees not on paper, but on the ground, on the water and in the sky. Air defense, planes, ships,- summarized Volodymyr Zelenskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine paid a working visit to the United Arab Emirates, where he held a meeting with the President UAE by Muhammad bin Zayed Al Nagayan. The key topics of the negotiations were the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war, economic cooperation and humanitarian initiatives.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/volodymyr-zelensky-rozpoviv-yaki-garantiyi-bezpeky-povynna-maty-ukrayina/	2025-02-17T05:34:02-08:00

- For them, this is a valuable combat action - - two Russian divisions burn their tanks in the Khark...	Oleksandr Borodin, spokesman of the Third Assault Brigade, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, the Russians are attacking with the mechanized formations of two Russian divisions. The situation is unusual, because usually the enemy tries to preserve the -armor-, instead throwing infantrymen into the assaults. -Earlier, tanks were used as artillery - from closed firing positions. To reduce risks for machines. Now used in assaults. For them, these are valuable assault actions because we destroy a lot. This speaks of a serious motivation or order to advance in our direction,- said Oleksandr Borodin. As reported ArmyInform, very active fighting is going on in the Pokrovsk direction, southwest of the city of Pokrovsk. However, lately the Russians have been getting more trouble there than they bargained for.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/dlya-nyh-cze-koshtovni-bojovi-diyi-dvi-rosijski-dyviziyi-spalyuyut-svoyi-tanky-na-harkivshhyni/	2025-02-17T05:23:22-08:00
-Twenty grenades on the helmet-: the fighter -Jupiter- told about his most terrible battle and why h...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. According to the press service of the 58th OMPBr, Rodion once graduated from the Ivan Bohun Kyiv Military Lyceum and even studied for three years at the National Academy of Internal Affairs, but due to health problems, he was unable to complete his studies. Later, the man's life turned out to be such that he ended up on the dock and serving his sentence. When the prisoners were allowed to fight, Rodion, without hesitation, asked for the front. After training, he got into an assault unit, part of which is now fighting as part of the 58th motorized infantry brigade. -I remembered one of my first combat missions for the rest of my life,- says -Jupiter-. — We then stormed the enemy's position, which could not be taken before us for two years. We went in, established ourselves, and then everything possible started working on us - artillery, mortars, especially there were a lot of drones. I hid in the hole, so that only my helmet was sticking out of it. It was this helmet that made the resets. I counted twenty grenades. They hit the helmet, bounce and explode next to it. It's a miracle I didn't go deaf - tactical headphones saved me. Then came FPVs. Many. I started running around the trench, distracting myself so that the drones would chase me. I wrote such twists and turns! They couldn't hit me, they exploded nearby.- Unfortunately, one of the explosions still hit Rodion - a fragment hit his hand. Since then, he is very afraid of drones. They came out of those positions also with problems. Rodion helped his wounded brother, and they walked about five kilometers through a minefield. In the end, they got to theirs. As Rodion notes, his hatred of the occupiers and the desire for revenge gives him the strength to fight. He says that at the very beginning of the war, he saw a video with the atrocities committed by Russian inhumans in the captured cities and villages, and then he decided that he must go to the front to fight this evil. -I have a son growing up, and I want him to live in his own, free country, so that no one dares to tell him what language to speak and what to think. That is why I am here today and I will not leave here while the war continues. This is my choice and my position,- says Jupiter. As reported by ArmyInform, two Ukrainian soldiers - -Vishnya- and -Kolomiya- - spent 45 days surrounded, resisting the Russians invaders and eventually making a bold breakthrough to his fellow men. Their story is proof of the courage, resilience and indomitable spirit of Ukrainian soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/dvadczyat-granat-po-kasczi-boyecz-yupiter-rozpoviv-pro-svij-najstrashnishyj-bij-ta-chomu-vin-voyuye/	2025-02-17T05:07:50-08:00

-Prickly- skill: the gunner-scientist turned the occupiers' tank into scrap metal	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The fighters of the artillery brigade received the coordinates of the enemy tank and began preparing for a fire attack. -Prickly-, the gun commander, cold-bloodedly set about the task. -Everything happened very quickly.

Impunity breeds indignation: why residents of TOT of Luhansk region do not believe in the personnel ...	reported this by the head of Luhansk OVA They are expected to have -fresh ideas- and -willingness to take responsibility for the future of the population.- However, local residents are not at all delighted with such an initiative, because they see with their own eyes the level of impunity with which the Russian military commits numerous crimes in the occupied territory. According to Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk OVA, this program caused outrage among the local population. People are rightly indignant that -heroes- and -managers- become those who break the law, commit arbitrariness and do not bear any responsibility for their actions. In addition, despite loud statements about the involvement of local personnel, attractive positions in the occupation authorities continue to be occupied by middle-ranking Russian officials. This indicates that the personnel program -Heroes of Luhansk Region- is just another propaganda campaign aimed at creating the illusion of support for the occupation authorities among the local population. The real situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region is far from ideal. The Russian military feels impunity and commits numerous crimes against the civilian population. Local residents are oppressed, harassed and discriminated against. As reported by ArmyInform, a financial crisis is raging in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region, which is hitting ordinary people the hardest. As Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk OVA, reported, the debts to state officials of the -lnr- reach a colossal amount of 1.2 billion rubles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/bezkarnist-porodzhuye-oburennya-chomu-zhyteli-tot-luganshhyny-ne-viryat-kadrovij-programi-lnr/	2025-02-17T03:43:37-08:00

The story of the fighter was published on page 32 of a separate mechanized brigade. -I was always attracted to the army - its physical exertion, tests, risks, adventures. Apparently, I am a victim of exciting adventure films of Western cinema,- says Valentin. And this -adventurism- bore fruit. According to the official statistics of the Army of drones, the drones of all battalions of the 32nd OMBr were ranked 15th among the 304 UAV units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in terms of the effectiveness of impressing the enemy's equipment and manpower. And in this there is a great merit of Valentyn, who works conscientiously in combat positions and with personnel. For his contribution to the defense of the Motherland, Valentin was awarded the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - -Golden Cross-. However, the fighter himself does not flaunt his achievements. -I sent home my Award of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Golden Cross,- says the soldier. — There my wife decides what to do with my awards. I love what I do in the army, but I do not fully perceive myself as a soldier. I adore our -two-, but I don't flaunt it. For me, this award is about gratitude, respect and understanding that I am in a place where I am needed and useful.- Together with his unit of attack UAVs, Valentin fought in the Kupyan direction, defended Sumy, Toretsk, Zaporizhzhya direction, and now Pokrovsk. -To this day, the personal bravery of my brothers remains a role model for me,- he adds. -There is something that in a difficult moment, when it seems that everything is lost, a flame of hope is lit, which turns into a full-fledged fire of retribution.- Valentine considers as an example those who perform assigned tasks better than him, who do what seemed incredible, who are not afraid to take risks to reach their goal, no matter what; people who can reboot their lives, step out of their comfort zone to achieve their dreams. -The longer I am in the army, the more motivated I become,- says Valentin. — I don't know what has changed, but now I feel great satisfaction from the effectively performed work. Don't feed me, but give me a target for destruction. My team knows and feels my despair when things go wrong, when things don't work. They also begin to feel that responsibility and excitement in hunting the enemy. We become one family at this time. When we come back from the position, we can truthfully say to ourselves that we are the best.- As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Directorate for Support of the Life Cycle of Weapons and Military Equipment of the Ministry of Defense (GU ZSZHC OVT) prepared for developers and manufacturers a standard package of documents necessary for codification of a wide range of OVT samples.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/dajte-jomu-czil-i-vin-znyshhyt-voroga-chomu-golovnyj-serzhant-vzvodu-bpla-vidchuvaye-azart-na-vijni/	2025-02-17T02:47:00-08:00
They complain about dominance in the air — near Pokrovsk, the Russians cannot -break- the Defense Fo...	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the broadcast of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. According to him, we are talking, among other things, about the recent liberation of the village of Pischanoy by the Defense Forces. And although such small settlements change hands from time to time, the enemy now has a lot of problems. Thus, enemy soldiers actively complain about the dominance of Ukrainian FPV drones in the air and the mistakes of their own commanders. -Their attempts have been consistently unsuccessful, and there is nothing to indicate that they can reverse this trend. This is primarily due to the more efficient operation of Ukrainian drones. Evidence that the Ukrainian troops have become more effective,- said Major Viktor Tregubov, spokesman for the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. As ArmyInform reported, in the Kursk region, the Defense Forces defeated a column of a brigade of Russian marines. The column included a dozen tanks and about a company of soldiers who went into battle under the flags of the USSR.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/skarzhatsya-na-dominacziyu-v-povitri-poblyzu-pokrovska-rosiyany-ne-mozhut-perelamaty-syly-oborony/	2025-02-17T02:34:07-08:00
New algorithm for -birds- and -jammers-: the Ministry of Defense has simplified the codification of ...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The introduced changes relate, in particular, to the process of codification of new domestic samples of unmanned systems and EW tactical level means. Specialists of the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment spoke about the main changes in the codification algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles and prepared graphic material that reflects the step-by-step actions of manufacturers in preparing the necessary package of documents. For the attention of manufacturers of UAVs and tactical-level EW, the codification algorithm has been updated.

A traitor in uniform: a former policeman who helped the occupiers in Kupyansk will be tried in Khark...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. The investigation established that the traitor voluntarily began working for the enemy in July 2022, taking the position of -acting senior operational officer of the criminal investigation department.- Later, he was promoted to -senior operative of the criminal investigation department of the Police Department No. 1 (dislocation of Kupyansk).- While in the service of the occupiers, the traitor helped them create a punitive body, conducted -investigative actions- and took explanations from local residents. In addition, he identified pro-Ukrainian citizens and passed on information about them to the occupation leadership. After the liberation of the Kharkiv region of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the traitor fled to Russia and was declared wanted. He will be tried in absentia at the Chervonozavod District Court of Kharkiv. The maximum penalty he faces is life imprisonment for treason and collaboration. This case is another evidence of how the Russian occupation encourages some people to betray and collaborate with the enemy. However, sooner or later, all traitors will be punished for their crimes. As reported by ArmyInform, the Kharkiv regional prosecutor office approved and sent to the court an indictment against a 32-year-old man, a citizen of Azerbaijan, who has a permit for permanent residence in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/zradnyk-u-pogonah-na-harkivshhyni-sudytymut-kolyshnogo-policzejskogo-yakyj-dopomagav-okupantam-u-kupyansku/	2025-02-17T02:12:35-08:00
45 days surrounded: The story of the heroic breakthrough of the fighters of Vyshny and Kolomyia	The story of the fighters was made public on page 141 of a separate mechanized brigade. Fighters entered the position on March 22. Later, their unit was completely surrounded, and the enemy was gradually capturing positions around it. -For two weeks, positions were taken piece by piece. If a shot was heard, it meant that an assault was underway there. If a person did not answer, then he is no longer there. - says -Vishnya-. To survive, the boys set up a shelter where they hid from enemy drones and shelling. Food and water were dropped to them with the help of drones. However, their shelter remained in the zone of active hostilities. When the enemy occupied their previous position, setting up a mortar there, the situation became even more critical. Water and food were running out, and the risk of being discovered was increasing every day. -We were not noticed in that first position, but they captured it. They put a mortar there and started working from it. After four days, food and water ran out. - recalls -Kolomia-. The fighters were forced to move to a new hiding place, where they stayed for another three weeks. All this time, they avoided fighting, realizing that any open battle would mean the end. The command developed an exit plan for them, which was transmitted via a drone. Along with the instructions, camouflage robes were thrown over the soldiers to avoid detection by thermal imaging cameras. -We were waiting for the exit code. No backpacks, just armor, helmet and weapons. When they heard the command, they rushed forward- - says -Vishnya-. Breaking through the enemy positions, Vyshnya diverted fire on itself, while Kolomiya looked for an opportunity to hide. After a long movement in difficult conditions, relying only on their own strength, the fighters finally reached the Ukrainian positions. -I went out for five days. Walked all night. In the morning I reached the landing, heard voices. I crawled closer and heard the Ukrainian language - I realized that it was my own.- - recalls -Kolomia-. As reported by ArmyInform, his story is deeply touching. -Cossack- is a combat medic of the 126th separate brigade of TrO, who spent three days in real hell on one of the Dnieper islands. Under continuous shelling, among the wounded and dead, he fulfilled his mission - saving lives. For this feat, the serviceman received an order -For courage-, but his main reward remains his saved brothers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/45-dib-v-otochenni-istoriya-geroyichnogo-proryvu-bijcziv-vyshni-ta-kolomyyi/	2025-02-17T01:57:56-08:00
-Residents- did not want to fight: in Voronezh, electronic warfare complexes burned down even before...	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, a fire broke out at night from January 27 to 28, 2025, on the territory of the Protek plant, where, in fact, these EW complexes are produced. The two -Residents- who were there burned to the ground. The R-330Zh -Zhitel- is a modern Russian electronic warfare complex designed to suppress enemy communications, including mobile and satellite communications. It is able to create serious obstacles for the enemy's radio-electronic means, which makes it an important component of the Russian military arsenal. The destruction of two such complexes is not just a loss of equipment. This is, first of all, a disruption of the plans of the Russian command to strengthen its grouping at the front. After all, these -Residents- were supposed to go to war against Ukraine, where they could cause significant damage to our military. However, as we can see, the firefighters, or perhaps not quite the firefighters, made adjustments to these plans. Ironically, the EW complexes, designed to jam the communication, themselves -shut down- in the fire. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine destroyed the Russian installation of the Orlan reconnaissance drone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/zhyteli-ne-zahotily-voyuvaty-u-voronezhi-kompleksy-reb-zgorily-shhe-do-vidpravlennya-na-front/	2025-02-17T01:37:32-08:00
- Another sur from the Russians - in Kurshchyna opponents are burning in tanks under red flags	This information was confirmed on the broadcast of the Yedyni Novyni telethon, Sherkhan, deputy commander of the 47th separate mechanized brigade battalion. According to him, the enemy is very actively trying to storm. It is obvious that it is important for him to win back his territory. That's why the red flags are for motivation. -Another sur from the Russian army, which they like to do. There have already been cases when they stopped at red flags. It was as if they were going to some kind of victory parade, all under big red flags,- said the deputy commander of the battalion of the 47th separate mechanized brigade. If you take a chronology, Sherkhan noted, the last few months have seen assaults every day. Often these are attacks with equipment, which the Defense Forces destroy with their UAVs. In addition, the Koreans who had a period of regrouping returned to the battlefield. -They try different tactics. They are trying to drive in on equipment - they cannot pass due to the fact that we successfully change their approach routes and work with FPV and resets on them. They are trying with infantry — they also have heavy losses,- stated the deputy commander of the 47th OMBr battalion. As ArmyInform reported, the enemy's tactics in the Kharkiv direction are unchanged. From time to time, the Russians attack in small assault groups of 2-3 people. Most of them are destroyed by Ukrainian drones, because the clear sky allows you to see the advance of enemy groups in advance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/chergovyj-syur-vid-rosiyan-na-kurshhyni-protyvnyky-goryat-u-tankah-pid-chervonymy-praporamy/	2025-02-17T01:28:11-08:00
- Holes in the pockets of budget workers - LNR: debts reach billions, and - the government - spreads...	He reported this on his page. The situation is so critical that even the Russian -authorities- recognize the problem. However, it seems that the case does not go beyond the establishment of facts. In those cases where there is documentary proof of the debt, some repayment mechanisms are still being considered. But if the money is -stuck- between some links of the bureaucratic machine, then -even if the grass doesn't grow- here. The occupiers simply refuse to look for ways to solve the problem. This problem has been going on since 2014, when the Russian occupation of part of the Luhansk region began. Since then, thousands of people working in the budget sector have been left without their honestly earned funds. As reported by ArmyInform, the invaders continue to take the property of Ukrainians in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region. In Severodonetsk, the occupation administration has already -recognized- 504 apartments as ownerless in high-rise buildings, whose owners did not have time to declare their rights within 30 days after fixing their absence.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/dirky-v-kyshenyah-byudzhetnykiv-lnr-borgy-syagayut-milyardiv-a-vlada-rozvodyt-rukamy/	2025-02-17T01:16:36-08:00

The group moved on foot for ten hours under the constant threat of enemy FPV drones. No water for the last few hours. Burning ruins and broken equipment all around showed fierce battles. Movement had to be made from bush to bush, avoiding open areas where one could become an easy target. -This is intelligence, the bullet does not choose here - you are a lieutenant colonel, a major or a general. There is a task, it must be completed and returned,- says -Rocky-. Moving forward, the group realized that they had been counted out - most likely due to interception of radio communications. At that moment, scouts noticed an approaching enemy vehicle. The decision was made instantly: to hide in the bushes and wait. But the enemy changed tactics and started chasing the group's car. -I jump out in front of our driver and shout: -Pasha, pedal to the floor, go ahead!-. He understood everything without words. And immediately - an explosion. Scouts called Pasha on the radio for a few minutes. The answer came - he broke free and is moving towards the shelter. The decision was made immediately: to leave the position and join the brother. The operation was a success, with all members of the group returning alive. -There are no ranks in war, only missions and a chance to come back,- Rocky concludes. As reported by ArmiyaInform, before the full-scale invasion, Viktor Ponomaryev worked as a civilian journalist, but after the deoccupation of Kyiv Oblast in 2022, he realized that he wanted to do more. Now he is an officer of the media interaction group of the Pomsta brigade, who together with the fighters goes to combat positions. films their work and tells their stories.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/kulya-ne-obyraye-yake-v-tebe-zvannya-ty-mayesh-vykonaty-zavdannya-i-povernutysya-istoriya-odnogo-bojovogo-vyhodu-pidpolkovnyka-zsu/	2025-02-17T01:07:07-08:00

Terrorist attack near the TCC in Kamianets-Podilskyi: Russian agents who blew up a courier with expl...	informs the SBU about this. According to the press service of the SBU, the perpetrators used a courier from the delivery service to -darkly- deliver the explosives to the TCC building. The perpetrators of the crime turned out to be a local drug addict and a 17-year-old student of the city college, who were recruited through the Telegram channel in search of -easy- earnings. Both agents operated separately, but shared a Russian curator. Under his instructions, the juvenile agent made an improvised explosive device, stuffing it with nuts and scraps of rebar for maximum damage. He used a mobile phone for remote detonation. The student planted explosives in a hiding place and gave its geolocation to his supervisor from the FSB. The Russian intelligence officer gave the coordinates to another drug-addicted agent, who took the explosives. The latter, fearing for his safety, ordered delivery to the TCC building through a courier service. When the courier arrived at the site, the occupants detonated the explosives remotely. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of contacts with the Russian special services, as well as tools and components for making an explosive device, were seized from the detainees. Both detainees were informed of suspicion for h. 3 Art. 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (a terrorist act that led to the death of a person). They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, as a result of the explosion near the Territorial Center of Equipment and Social Support in Kamianets-Podilskyi there is a dead and injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/terakt-bilya-tczk-v-kamyanczi-podilskomu-zatrymano-rosijskyh-agentiv-yaki-pidirvaly-kuryera-z-vybuhivkoyu/	2025-02-17T00:37:21-08:00

In addition to problems with hygiene, the woman also complained about constant conscription among the personnel of the Russian army. She is outraged by the fact that the occupiers are forced to buy all the necessary equipment for the war against Ukraine at their own expense: -Belyy also made an attempt somehow! The generator is quite expensive. And plus these wires&#8230; It is necessary to reduce the fire for sure. Does the fact that the payments are coming in make him think everyone is a millionaire now? It's just problematic to collect with mothers like that,- the occupier's wife complains.

NSATU and JATEC: how the new NATO structures working to help Ukraine work	Initiatives adopted last year turned out to be surprisingly relevant and timely now, when the new administration of the US president can stop aid at any moment, and then European allies will independently support Ukraine. In 2024, European members of NATO and Canada gave Ukraine about 60% of the total amount of military aid. And now there are two special structures that are supposed to ensure proper logistics of weapons and the study of the Ukrainian experience of the war against the Russian Federation. How exactly these structures work and what their tasks are - see below in the ArmyInform material. Today, February 17, in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz, a solemn event will take place - the official opening ceremony of the Joint Ukraine - NATO-Ukraine Joint Center for Analysis, Training and Education (NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis, Training and Education Center, JATEC). This is the first joint structure of NATO and Ukraine. The decision to establish the center was made a year ago. In fact, it has been functioning for some time and today's opening will have a more symbolic nature. The director of NATO's defense and security cooperation department, Piers Cazalet, in an interview with ArmiyaInform last year, said that the new center will be a location where NATO and Ukraine will be able to meet and discuss the lessons of the war together. -We will conduct an analysis, develop training programs based on this analysis and train ourselves, NATO, and Ukrainian troops to be better prepared for any conflicts in the future,- he explained. In January 2025, it became known that NATO and Ukraine have already formed a plan for the work of the center, and its tasks will include the integration of Ukraine's experience into the military preparation, training and conduct of hostilities. -We seek to record all the lessons and all the experience of what you are doing now in Ukraine, fighting against the Russians, as well as how we, as a collective Alliance, can learn from you and apply these lessons,- — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said last week at a meeting with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov in Brussels. NATO Supreme Commander for Transformation, Admiral Pierre Vandier, previously explained that one of the main areas of research is the combination of modern technology during the war in Ukraine with brutal trench warfare and artillery fire. -Ukrainian soldiers are fighting in the trenches and using artillery as it was customary more than a century ago, but they are also using drones, artificial intelligence and space communication As a result, Ukrainian artillery has become more effective and more lethal,- he said. NATO is confident that studying Ukrainian experience will allow it to respond quickly to modern threats and remain a strategically reliable organization. Ukraine has already formed a list of 70 projects for joint work and suggested to partners which of them should become priorities. The second important structure that was created to help Ukraine has more practical dimension. NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, NSATU) During its formation, the American Security Assistance Group in Ukraine (SAG-U) was used as a basis and the new structure became a kind of logistical Ramstein. The meetings of the Contact Group on the Defense of Ukraine have a political dimension, and NSATU is already helping to implement them practically. The command staff is about 700 people, the structure is headed by the American Lieutenant General Curtis Buzzard, who is accountable to the Supreme Commander of the Combined Armed Forces of NATO in Europe (SACEUR). The Ukrainian team at NSATU was recently led by Brigadier General Gennady Shapovalov, who until recently commanded the OK troops -South-. The command in Wiesbaden works in two main directions. The first is the coordination of the training of Ukrainian servicemen and the transfer of military equipment and equipment to Ukraine. The actual process of training and provision of everything necessary is organized by individual countries, but it is NSATU that coordinates all this, gathering information about the needs of Ukraine and the capabilities of allies. As for the transfer of weapons and equipment, before the creation of NSATU, this assistance was provided on a special bilateral basis, and last year it was decided to combine it into a single system to make more predictable and coordinated in the long term. -This is done in order for Ukraine's combat capability to be effective and well-planned. NSATU also combines into a single coordination structure a significant part of the international security assistance provided to Ukraine by donors,- explained a high-ranking NATO official last week in Brussels. In addition to its headquarters in Germany, NSATU has logistics centers in the eastern part of the Alliance. In addition, the structure has two operational partners — New Zealand and Australia. NATO has also taken over the mission of protecting these logistics centers on the eastern flank from the United States. Therefore, they are now also under the command and control of the Alliance. The second direction of NSATU's work is to help in the development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the future, in particular, in achieving interoperability with NATO forces. -We not only support Ukraine when it comes to short-term supplies, but also help it in long-term planning. We have the so-called interoperability roadmap, which was agreed at the summit in Washington last year, and which helps Ukraine build a future for Ukraine. We advise on what is needed in terms of capabilities, what is needed in terms of personnel, what is needed in terms of funding,- said a NATO official in Brussels. At the same time, NATO emphasizes one important detail: NSATU's activities do not make them a party to the conflict and the Alliance will not deploy military forces in Ukraine. Likewise, he will not conduct training or deliver aid to the territory of Ukraine. That is, all the aid comes to a certain point in one of the NATO countries in the east, and from there Ukraine takes this aid to its territory on its own, and this is already its responsibility. NATO assures that NSATU has a very clear understanding of Ukraine's needs in the near future, and these requirements are immediately transferred to donors so that they can meet them as quickly as possible. -We are putting Ukraine in the best possible position situation so that it will be strong in the future, and our ability to support Ukraine will determine the trajectory of security for decades to come,- another NATO official emphasized in a conversation in Brussels. By creating these structures, NATO guarantees Ukraine constant and predictable support despite all political turmoil.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/nsatu-ta-jatec-yak-praczyuyut-novi-struktury-nato-shho-dopomagayut-ukrayini/	2025-02-16T20:50:49-08:00
Self-propelled guns -Bohdana-: about the destruction of the enemy tens of kilometers away, counter-b...	In February 2022, he became a volunteer for the defense of Ukraine. Ruslan was awarded the Order of Courage III degree, the Golden Cross and Steel Cross badges from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. His calculation has been fighting on the -Bogdan- for more than a year and is considered one of the strongest calculations in the brigade in terms of the accuracy of hitting racist targets. How many Russian artillery systems did the -Bohdana- destroy in counter-battery duels and other targets of the occupiers, what are its combat capabilities and advantages over Soviet artillery installations, about battles with the enemy in different areas of the front of the Russian-Ukrainian war and what life hacks are used by gunners in order to qualitatively equip a firing position - in the ArmyInform material. It has a NATO caliber of 155 mm. The main advantage of the self-propelled guns is the filigree accuracy of damage and the range of effective fire. The combat installation has already managed to prove itself excellently on the battlefield. According to the characteristics, the declared fire range is up to 42 km with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile, and it can reach the enemy up to 60 km with an active-reactive projectile. But here, in Donetsk region, gunners strike at the enemy up to 30 km. For example, on the self-propelled howitzer -Akatsiya- the firing range of a high-explosive shell is up to 18 km, and an active-reactive one is up to 24 km. Agree, this is a significant difference. The Soviet machine is less fast and does not accurately hit the targets. The guys say that there are almost no problems with the undercarriage of the -Bogdana-, the machine is quite passable in hard-to-reach areas of the terrain, overcomes swampy roads, but is afraid of sand. After all, its weight is 32 tons, so it can get stuck there. What is interesting, the engine -Bohdany- works much quieter than the Soviet self-propelled guns. And in general, in many parameters, it is much better than the Soviet models. -The self-propelled guns have a computer guidance system. This greatly simplifies combat work and saves time. There is no need to turn any gears or anything like that, &#8211; says the commander of -Bogdana- Ruslan. &#8211; There is an automatic platform where special buttons for modes, sectors, barrel operation and so on are placed. With the help of this system, the car steers itself. Of course, the gunner adjusts the details and -corrects- aiming at the target. The installation is equipped with a special charging system. We have an automatic projectile launcher, but we don't use it in real combat. Much faster if we do it manually. The service room charges the projectile and sends it using a special manual mechanism. During a combat mission, every minute counts. The vehicle is well armored and has a significant degree of protection. For example, the cabin can withstand impacts from FPV drones, Lancets and fragmentation shells of various calibers. We were recently attacked by a group of enemy -fpvishok- and -Lancet-. The windshield was cut by splinters, the cabin survived, the boys are alive and well. Also, the car's armor can withstand blows from 152 mm shell shells. What is interesting, the armored car cabin is also adapted for driving in the dark without the use of headlights in light-masking mode. Inside there are monitors for monitoring from the front and rear infrared cameras. In the wheels of the car, rubber is installed, which works according to the principle of a pillow. If the wheel is pierced by shrapnel, the car will still be able to move and leave the firing position. But it works when the rear wheels are affected. -Bohdana- leaves for a safe place without any problems, the speed is, of course, slightly lower. We inflict fire damage on various enemy targets. Coordinates of targets and correction of fire is carried out through air reconnaissance units. We mainly hit the front edge of the Russian troops: infantry, heavy military equipment, mortar positions, shelters and fortifications of the Rashists &#8211; it is stable. We can strike deep into the battle formations of the enemy troops. We fire up to 100 shots per day, sometimes 120 shots. If we attack the enemy with high-explosive and cluster projectiles, the debris can fly at a high speed for 200-300 meters. You yourself understand what a destructive force this is. 155 mm artillery ammunition is a much more powerful and serious striking force than a drone. With such strikes, we immediately stop the advance of enemy assault groups advancing on our infantry positions. The most difficult thing is to destroy small assault units that move simultaneously and from several directions. As was the case near Toretsk, there was not enough of our artillery in the square where we stood. Plus enemy tanks and artillery. It was very difficult, in fact, the work on extermination of roaches did not stop. The speed of calculation work on this installation is also a significant advantage. We can fire three or four shots at the enemy in one minute. We recently hit a large Russian mechanized column that was trying to break through to our positions on the front edge. It was in the Lymansky direction, in the area of ​​Terna settlement. The column consisted of five tanks and six infantry fighting vehicles along with infantry. the Rashists attacked us. Before that, our positions were attacked with artillery and tanks. Then other self-propelled guns and artillery systems of the brigade worked together with our calculation. With the first accurate strikes, we stopped the movement of the column and continued to inflict fire damage. Everything burned then, the equipment, the occupants almost all burned alive, those who somehow managed to get out of the BPM did not live long. as usual, the Russians do not withdraw their troops from the battlefield, some detonated grenades and killed themselves. Once in the Serebrian Forest, our aerial reconnaissance found a concentration of enemy equipment. 15 km away in the forest stood tanks, BMP, armored personnel carriers and MTLB. They were immediately covered with shells. Our calculation shows simply impressive indicators of effectiveness in destroying the enemy's artillery. As part of the counter-battery fight, we use active-reactive projectiles. How it works: special vehicles detect enemy artillery, aerial reconnaissance confirms that our artillery continues to work. In just one year of combat work, the artillery unit of the 45th brigade, armed with the -Bohdana- self-propelled guns, destroyed more than 200 units of various enemy artillery systems. These are towed and self-propelled artillery, mortars, Grad anti-aircraft guns. This is the enemy's artillery that has been officially confirmed by our UAVs, there is still a certain amount that could not be recorded. We are setting up the position for firing very carefully. We tear out the caponira. We strengthen everything well, mask it so that no one burns the location of the installation from the air. This is a well-protected fortress, we will not tell all the secrets in detail. But I will say that the occupiers have never found us. The dugout for personnel is nearby, also camouflaged. The enemy is raging furiously, we heard more than once in radio intercepts that they cannot detect the work of our -Bogdana-. How many times have there been cases when enemy UAVs flew over us and could not detect us. I have a very good team. In the calculation of 5 people. Guys from Ternopil region, one from Lutsk. My gunner is 25 years old, I am 26, the driver is 45, the service numbers are 46 and 48, respectively. The boys are very active, patriotic and motivated. They are fighting for their families, homes and Ukraine. The team has been formed since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. For three years now, as part of the 45th separate artillery brigade, we have been destroying the occupiers in various areas of the front. We had no experience in artillery, we learned everything from wheels. None of us were born ready-made artillerymen. In 2022, we fought in Kryvorizha, knocked out the enemy from the right-bank Kherson region and liberated Kherson itself. Then the Lyman direction, the battles near Toretsk, the defense of Bakhmut, the Serebryansky forest area, again the Toretsk direction. Now we are piling on the occupiers in the Siver and Lyman directions. The boys have tremendous combat experience, we are always together as one family. We started fighting with a 152-mm howitzer gun D-20, then destroyed the enemy with a French 155-mm field howitzer TRF1. This howitzer had technical features. For example, it has an engine installed, it could drive into position, unfold itself, fold itself up and leave independently to the point where the tractor pulled it. Despite its longevity, this weapon showed itself quite effectively in battle. When the brigade was reinforced with self-propelled guns -Bohdan-, we were immediately offered to work on it. Our calculation was taught by those guys who in 2022 destroyed the Russian garrison with equipment on the island of Zmiiny in the Black Sea on the first model of the -Bohdana-. The fire was carried both on the water from pontoons and from the coast. The first crew of -Bogdana- taught us, told us how to properly operate and maintain the machine. We lived with them 20 km from the front line, went out together on combat missions, fired shots. Then, over time, they went out on their own and hit the occupiers. Now artillerymen from various units of the Armed Forces are coming to us. We teach them how to efficiently destroy the enemy. Here, in a combat environment, it is much more effective to undergo training, people learn much faster.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/sau-bogdana-pro-znyshhennya-voroga-za-desyatky-kilometriv-kontrbatarejni-dueli-ta-pozycziyu-forteczya/	2025-02-16T20:41:34-08:00
Russia does not control 70% of Ukrainian resources: the swamps are already crying about -inevitable ...	It seems that while the Russian army roams the fields of Donbass and receives a beating from the Armed Forces, their propagandists have decided to fight on another front - in the world of fantasy. According to the version of the Kremlin -analysts-, Russia seems to have seized the main Ukrainian deposits containing coal, oil, gas, ores and other resources. The main -evidence- is the traditional anonymous -experts-, cloudy maps and slogans in the style of -hooray, we beat them all-. They claim that after seizing part of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions, they now have in their hands critical deposits of everything that can only be mined. Yes, part of the deposits are indeed located in temporarily occupied territories. But there is a nuance - just capturing the territory is not enough to get resources from it. Mining requires complex infrastructure, machinery, energy supply and personnel. Coal mines of Donbas are not -black gold-, but black money for the budget of the Russian Federation. Without the support of Ukrainian energy systems, most mines are flooded and unusable. Mining there right now is more of a loss than a profit. Oil and gas fields? And tell us about the sanctions! Russian-controlled reserves in southern Ukraine do not compensate for its own deficit. Mining in the Black Sea is almost impossible due to the actions of the Armed Forces and limited access to technology due to sanctions. Metallurgy? The occupiers simply destroyed the factories: Mariupol Azovstal and MMK Ilyich - not -controlled resources-, but burned down after Russian bombings. Without these enterprises, most of the metallurgical industry in the occupied territories simply does not work. the Kremlin is trying to create the illusion of victory. They are losing on the battlefield, the economy is bursting at the seams, sanctions are stifling, but it is necessary to show the people that everything is not so bad. That is why they invent that -now we have 70% of Ukrainian wealth.- This lie is necessary for: The reality is this: Russia does not control 70% of Ukrainian resources. She controls a pile of ruins, flooded mines, destroyed factories and unusable territories. And if the Kremlin somewhere finds even a drop of profit on these lands, then all this -oil- or -gas- will be burned in the next cotton from Ukrainian FPV drones. Therefore, let them continue to dream about 70% of minerals there. Because the only thing that Russia really controls is its own impoverishment, default and the path to the abyss.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/rosiya-ne-kontrolyuye-70-ukrayinskyh-resursiv-na-bolotah-vzhe-volayut-pro-nemynuchyj-uspih/	2025-02-16T20:08:49-08:00
The financial forecasts of the Central Bank of Russia are exclusively political and have no relation...	reports this by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Against the background of the Russian-Ukrainian war and the maintenance of Western sanctions, the forecasts of the Russian regulator regarding the improvement of economic indicators for 2026 are primarily political in nature. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation raised the inflation forecast for 2025 from 4.5–5%, which was predicted in October 2024, to the level of 7–8%. According to the average key rate for 2025, the forecast worsened from 17-20% to 19-22%, and for 2026 - from 12-13% to 13-14%. The forecast for the rate for 2027 remains at the level of 7.5-8.5%. Prerequisites for lowering the discount rate may appear no earlier than in the second half of 2025 if inflation slows down. Under this scenario, by the end of 2026, the rate may drop to only 18-19%. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation recognizes high inflationary pressure, which makes it impossible to reduce the discount rate. Worsening forecasts for inflation and the average annual refinancing rate for 2025 testify to the deepening of economic imbalances in Russia. We remind you, the occupation authorities of Crimea will -nationalize- more than 720 objects.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/finansovi-prognozy-czentrobanku-rosiyi-vyklyuchno-politychni-i-ne-mayut-vidnoshennya-do-realnoyi-ekonomiky/	2025-02-16T10:56:23-08:00

Russians intensify propaganda on TOT	reports this by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. At this time, the development of a television signal retransmission network is part of the strategy of consolidating the Russian regime on the lands newly occupied from 2022. The invaders are investing heavily in the total modernization of television and radio broadcasting facilities in the occupied Luhansk region. In January 2025, Luhansk was visited by a delegation of managers of the Russian state company -Российская телевизорная и радиовечательная сеть-. Their task was to establish broadcasting in the so-called -white zones- - populated areas that have recently been occupied and are not covered or poorly covered by Russian television. The Russians assigned more than 70 settlements to such zones. The main criteria when choosing the potential locations of new relay towers were the inaccessibility for barrel artillery, the signal coverage factor of the -white zones-, as well as the promising possibility of their use for broadcasting across the front line. At the same time, for the third year in a row, the occupiers have been conducting a preferential program for issuing equipment for receiving Russian satellite signals in -white zones-. -Dishes- and receivers, together with installation services, are provided free of charge at the expense of the Russian budget. The Luhansk branch of -Российской телевизорной и радиовечательной сети-, created on the basis of the captured regional branch of the Ukrainian Concern of Radio Broadcasting, Radio Communications and Television, now broadcasts four digital multiplexes and provides broadcasting of Russian state and private radio stations. The third multiplex contains the largest number of propaganda TV channels. Among them, we can mention -Luhansk 24-, -Pobeda-, -Solovyev Live-, -History-, -Mir 24-, etc. This activity is carried out in parallel with the eradication of at least the potential possibility of access of residents of Luhansk region to Ukrainian television. The general supervision of this entire -modernization project- is carried out by the first deputy of Putin's administration, Sergei Kiriyenko, and the direct executor is the head of the -Russian Television and Broadcasting Network- Andrei Romanchenko. We remind you that during 2024 the amount of gold on the balance sheet of the National Welfare Fund (NFB) decreased from 359 tons to 187.7 tons (minus 48% for the year).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/rosiyany-posylyuyut-propagandu-na-tot/	2025-02-16T09:36:19-08:00
The occupiers are once again robbing the Ukrainian Crimea	reports this by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Among them are the premises of the dolphinarium -Nemo- in Sudak, Feodosia and Alushta, -Saksky mineral waters- and property of citizens of Ukraine. The Russian occupiers plan to sell the stolen goods and spend the money received on the soldiers fighting against Ukraine and their families. the Russian occupiers have been systematically carrying out -nationalization- in Crimea since 2014. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the pace of plundering of the peninsula has accelerated. propagandists of the Russian Federation actively highlight the -nationalization of the property of the enemies of Crimea-, often using the rhetoric of the times of Stalinism. Such a policy is not only banal robbery, but also part of a campaign to intimidate people who, for disloyalty to the occupiers, risk losing their freedom and all their property. We remind you that in the annexed Crimea, the Russian administration continues to impose the cult of war on young people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/okupanty-vchergove-obkradayut-ukrayinskyj-krym/	2025-02-16T09:11:10-08:00

In Russia, gold and currency reserves are falling rapidly	This is reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The reason is the sale of gold by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation to cover the deficit of the federal budget. In January 2025, 8.7 tons of gold were sold, as of February 1, 2025, the reserves were only 179 tons. A significant decrease in the volume of gold in the FNB indicates a lack of funds in the federal budget in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian war and Western sanctions. In the short term, the government of the Russian Federation will be forced to limit the sale of gold and consider other instruments for filling the budget, including fiscal ones. Ordinary Russians will once again pay for the continuation of the war against Ukraine. We remind you that International Institute for Strategic Studies in the annual report -The Military Balance 2025- notes an increase in world defense spending by 7.4% to $2.46 trillion in 2024.

The occupiers are killing Crimean youth	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. Recently, the so-called -opening of the year of the defender of the fatherland- took place there - another propaganda event aimed at preparing young people for mobilization. The ceremony, which was supposed to create the impression of mass support, turned out to be another performance. Budget officers, students and teachers were forced to attend in order to fill the hall with simulated supporters of Russian aggression. In fact, the majority of Crimeans remain hostages of a repressive system that destroys any resistance. The biggest cynicism of this event was that the representatives of the -Storm- assault unit of the 810th Marine Brigade of the enemy army were speaking in front of the young people. This unit was staffed not only by conscripts, but also by ex-prisoners, including people convicted of serious crimes. The occupiers seek to make -heroes- out of these criminals, as well as to hide real losses among the ranks of the occupying army. In addition, in the territory of the occupied peninsula, educational institutions have actually been turned into centers of propaganda. Students are taught how to properly obey the occupation regime. The invaders are also trying to recruit new so-called -volunteers- through universities, using blackmail and threats. Thus, the occupiers are most afraid of losing Crimea, and that is why they are trying to suppress any resistance with mass propaganda. They know that the people of Crimea remember what freedom is - and it cannot be erased by any lies. We remind you that the occupiers are strangling people with taxes and sending them to war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/okupanty-zombuyut-krymsku-molod/	2025-02-16T07:52:57-08:00
Defense spending in the world is increasing	This is reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In 2024, global defense spending increased to an average of 1.9% of GDP, compared to 1.8% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2022. The largest increase was recorded in Russia, where defense spending increased by 41.9% and amounted to 145.9 billion dollars. USA. The share of Russian defense spending was 6.7% of GDP, and in 2025 this indicator may increase to 7.5%. In 2024, defense spending in Europe increased by 11.7% to 457 billion dollars. USA. The reasons are the growth of threats caused by the Russian-Ukrainian war, as well as the commitment of NATO member countries to achieve the level of defense spending of 2% of GDP. The largest increase in 2024 was demonstrated by Germany, which increased its defense budget by 23.2%. In Poland and the Baltic states, defense budgets exceeded 3% of GDP, other states, in particular Spain and Italy, continued to spend less than 2% of GDP on defense. China's defense budget grew by 7.4%, well above the average for the rest of the Indo-Pacific region (3.9%). However, due to greater growth in defense spending in other regions, Asia's share of global defense spending has declined to 21.7% in 2024. In 2021, this figure was 25.9%. Sub-Saharan Africa was the only region where defense spending declined, with a 3.7% drop. We remind you that considering the position of the Russian Federation regarding the accident of flight J2-8432 of the airline company -Azerbaijan Airlines-, the deterioration of relations between Baku and Moscow continues.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/oboronni-vytraty-u-sviti-zbilshuyutsya/	2025-02-16T07:36:05-08:00
Relations between Baku and Moscow are deteriorating	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In particular, the leadership of Azerbaijan plans to limit the activities of the Russian editorial office of the Sputnik agency. The publication's staff will be reduced from 40 employees to one. This effectively means closing the branch. Official Baku pays attention to the principle of reciprocity: Sputnik will be able to keep as many employees in the country as there are working in Russia in the Azerbaijani state news agency -Azertaj-, i.e. one journalist. In addition, a member of the State Duma of the Russian Federation was declared persona non grata in Azerbaijan. value, he is included in the list of persons who are prohibited from entering the country. The reason is Valuev's statement after Baku's decision to stop the activities of the -Russian House- on the territory of the country. In particular, he stated that it is necessary to pay attention to the activities of the Azerbaijani diaspora in Russia, hinting at their financial activity. Previously, the first deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs was declared persona non grata. Zatulin and deputy head of the committee for family protection in Milonov for their statements contradicting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. In this context, the Kremlin is developing measures to increase pressure on Azerbaijan, namely: Blocking money transfers. The amount of money transfers from Russia to Azerbaijan for January-September 2024 amounted to more than 410 million dollars. USA. Stopping oil exports through the port of Novorossiysk. The share of Azerbaijani oil transported by this route is 4% of total exports. The main supply is carried out through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline bypassing the territory of the Russian Federation and the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which passes through the territory of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Support for separatist movements in Azerbaijan. One of the most dangerous threats is the -Lezgin problem-. The Lezgins, who live in the north of Azerbaijan on the border with Dagestan, have historical prerequisites for unification with the Lezgins of Russia. In early February 2025, the State Security Service of Azerbaijan conducted a special operation in the Husar district (bordering the Republic of Dagestan, Russia). As a result of the operation, eight members of the group associated with the -Forest Brothers- terrorist group were eliminated and six were detained. Members of the group planned terrorist attacks on the territory of Husar district. As a result, Azerbaijan, with the support of Turkey, is increasingly showing an independent position in relations with Russia. For its part, the Kremlin has limited opportunities to put pressure on Baku. In the short term, tensions in Russian-Azerbaijani relations will grow, and Azerbaijan will continue to distance itself from the Russian Federation. We remind you that Russia continues its aggressive war against Ukraine, using daily shelling as a method of pressure and intimidation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/vidnosyny-mizh-baku-ta-moskvoyu-pogirshuyutsya/	2025-02-16T07:12:00-08:00

The invaders are introducing a new stage of repression on TOT	reports this by the Center of National Resistance. Therefore, among the servicemen of the Russian occupation forces, they will begin to be appointed en masse to the so-called -administrative positions- in the occupation administrations, etc. This means that from now on, incompetent security forces, among whom there is a small number of people with a criminal past and other -cream- of Russian society, will be in charge of managing settlements, dealing with -economic issues- and other activities. Along with this, the occupation sources officially present it as a -personnel competition- that should -celebrate the merits of the defenders-, but the reality is different. The occupiers cannot find civilian personnel among the locals who are ready to work in their occupation structures. In connection with this, they are trying to integrate the invaders from the DOM in order to raise their status and try to justify their crimes, which they committed against the local population and Ukraine as a whole. It is obvious that these appointments will lead to the strengthening of repressive measures, looting and new corruption schemes. And former mercenaries and previously convicted occupiers do not have management skills, however, they have experience of intimidation, torture and uncontrolled violence. Therefore, they will use their new -powers- in their own interests, including for their own enrichment. We remind you, occupiers continue the systematic destruction of Mariupol.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/zagarbnyky-zaprovadzhuyut-novyj-etap-represij-na-tot/	2025-02-16T06:31:59-08:00
Occupiers strangle people with taxes and send them to war	This is reports the Center of National Resistance. Almost two-thirds of the amount, or about 65%, are compulsory levies in favor of the occupation administration in the form of taxes, fees, etc. Therefore, intimidation and repression became the main working method of the invaders. Among the harshest methods of influence is the ban on driving vehicles, as well as the seizure of bank accounts and even the confiscation of wages. But the worst thing is that those who cannot or refuse to pay the occupiers are forcibly taken to war, forcing them to fight against their own people. The invaders are trying to strangle the local population economically, leaving the people without a means of livelihood and forcing them to either pay or become cannon fodder. But they will certainly bear responsibility for their crimes. We remind you, the occupiers continue the systematic destruction of Mariupol. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/okupanty-dushat-lyudej-podatkamy-i-vidpravlyayut-na-vijnu/	2025-02-16T06:13:43-08:00

Drones against infantry: Taurian paratroopers defeated the occupiers	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The result of this carelessness of the occupiers is obvious: none of them survived. Ukrainian pilots competed not only with the enemy, but also among themselves - for the title of the most effective liquidator of invaders. In the end, it was not possible to determine the winner, because every shot was perfectly accurate. The brilliant work of the soldiers of the 79th brigade once again demonstrates that modern war is not only about fighting on the ground, but also high technological skill in the air. Ukrainian defenders continue to destroy the enemy, leaving him no chance for survival. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation is stable in the Novopavlivskoye direction in the area of ​​Ulakla and Kostiantinopil villages tense. The occupiers try to maintain a high intensity of their attacks. They mostly go forward in small assault groups.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/drony-proty-pihoty-tavrijski-desantnyky-vlashtuvaly-rozgrom-okupantam/	2025-02-16T05:37:12-08:00
The occupiers continue the systematic destruction of Mariupol	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. There are not so many such houses left, as the occupiers destroyed a large part of the city with their massive shelling. Therefore, in the central part of the city, representatives of the ROA decided to allow the construction of so-called -new- housing under mortgage for Russians from depressed regions of the Russian Federation and immigrants from Asia. This is a purposeful policy aimed at changing the ethnic composition of the population and creating the illusion of -returning life- to the destroyed city. At the same time, residents of Mariupol remain homeless, because they are not allocated compensatory apartments - all construction is aimed exclusively at the resettlement of Russians. Despite loud statements by the occupiers about -repairs-, construction works are frozen due to lack of adequate funding, and imported workers constantly complain about non-payment of salaries. Therefore, the occupants often make only cosmetic repairs to the facades, while the inside of the house remains unlivable. However, the picture for the Russian mass media is presented in the best traditions of the Russian propaganda machine. We remind you, on the Kursk direction, Russian troops resumed assaults with the involvement of armored vehicles, as well as units from the DPRK.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/okupanty-prodovzhuyut-systemne-znyshhennya-mariupolya/	2025-02-16T05:12:37-08:00

22-year-old gun commander -Iskra-: how a young gunner destroys enemy positions	The defender's story was made public on the brigade's page. During the war, artillery remains one of the most effective combat forces, causing the most losses to the enemy.

We solve problems quickly, because everyone knows their role,- explains Maria. In her voice is the confidence of a person who not only knows what she is doing, but also believes in her business. Gunners continue to work on making each of their shots accurate and effective. Thanks to such commanders as Iskra, Ukrainian artillery remains a formidable weapon in the struggle for independence.

The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov congratulated military journalists on their professional holiday, emphasizing their important mission. -Military journalists work where it is most dangerous - on the front lines, under fire, side by side with our defenders. Your reports, photos and videos are not just news, but evidence of Russia's crimes and testimony of the heroism of Ukrainians,- Rustem Umyerov said. It was thanks to the work of the media that the world learned about Russian atrocities in Buch, Izyum, and Mariupol, about rocket attacks on peaceful cities. Their materials become a weapon of truth, bringing Ukraine's justice and victory closer. But the profession of a military journalist is one of the most dangerous. Since 2014, 104 media workers have died - both military correspondents and those who took up arms to defend Ukraine. -With pain in our hearts, we remember the journalists who gave their lives for the world's right to know the truth. Your mission is priceless,- Rustem Umyerov added, thanking them for their courage and professionalism.

-Thought I had spit out a tooth, but it was a fragment of a grenade-: FSB hunting, injuries and the ...	&#8230;2014 year. Luhansk. The young Marchenkos married only a year ago. They bought an apartment, they are planning to renovate it. Young ambitious journalists are making long-term plans for the future. But the Russian creeping occupation, which they had been watching for more than one year before, is coming to Luhansk already physically: with shelling and tricolors on the streets of the city. Marchenkas are leaving the regional center, but they are not leaving journalism&#8230; &#8230;The year 2022. The young couple, the Marchenkos, work in Seversko-Donetsk, in their native Luhansk region. They adore the cat Ted - for a minute, a native North Don. Sasha is a producer of the Suspilne.Donbas branch. Together with his colleagues, he does quality journalism. But with the beginning of a large-scale, he takes a backpack with documents, a carrier with Ted and leaves his native Luhansk Region for the second time with his wife. And then - mobilization to the Armed Forces, training in the field of military intelligence, command of the reconnaissance platoon of the motorized infantry battalion of the 30th separate mechanized brigade, wounded near Soledar - and a return to journalism, but already military. This short interview with Senior Lieutenant Oleksandr Marchenko is just a small puzzle of the portrait of my colleague: a journalist and a military serviceman who is currently fulfilling his constitutional duty in Donetsk region. But he admits that he dreams of making a boring material about&#8230; sowing and harvesting. How once&#8230; — Alexander, what formed your mental backbone at a young age? And why did it happen that many of your peers joined the ranks of the so-called -army of the LPR-, while you remained a Ukrainian-speaking Luhansk citizen? - I was a Russian-speaker for a long time: I studied at a Russian-language school and university, although at that time there were already requirements for education in the state language. Yes, for some time I was under the influence of Russian propaganda and their narratives, for example, about the Holodomor, the collapse of the USSR, etc. All these thoughts then circulated in my environment and I had no alternative. But then I began to have certain questions, in particular, I began to watch and read more about the same Holodomor. We had a very cool teacher of the Ukrainian language at the university - a Holodomor researcher in the Luhansk region, she once made a film about the Holodomor. This is the first. Then I started asking my relatives, like my grandmother. And she told such things that did not fit into my head and resonated very strongly with what was happening around. I also became interested in the history of the same UPA and why they were demonized in the end. The fact that I was born and lived in Luhansk, and my relatives - in the region, in Ukrainian-speaking villages, probably also had an influence. And I spent a lot of time there. And it also begged the question: why so? Why is it that when you leave 10 kilometers from Luhansk, you hear the Ukrainian language, and when you arrive in Luhansk, only Russian? This is how it all took shape for me: at first, questions arose, and I tried to find answers to them. - How did everything start in Luhansk in 2014? - Russian aggression did not start in 2014. In 2008-2009, when I just entered journalism, certain moments were already felt. For example, they started to hold the -Georgiivska tape- campaign, some guests from Moscow were constantly coming, -Don Cossacks-&#8230; Then I had to search for answers to the question, what is St. George's ribbon? In the fall of 2013, Luhansk also joined the Revolution of Dignity and had its own Euromaidan. But there were also a lot of anti-Maidan activists - the so-called local -kids-, some -wives-&#8230; Also, in Luhansk, a lot was built on administrative resources - these are large enterprises controlled by the -party of regions-, for example. Their employees were constantly -pumped up- with anti-Ukrainian narratives. And involved in various actions and protests. I didn't understand the scale at the time. At first it was thought that the local authorities, the so-called -elites-, were trying to maintain control over the region. Although Russia had already taken control, it was not clear at the time. In the information field, for a long time Luhansk region lived precisely in the information field of Russia, not Ukraine. You turn on the TV and all the first channels are Russian. And, for example, in the summer of 2014, it seems, there was a decision to turn off the broadcasting of absolutely all Russian channels. And when the Russians took over the regional television and radio company where I worked, the first thing they did was turn on all the Russian channels and turn off the Ukrainian ones. Therefore, answering the question, what shaped me, including lies that I did not believe and tried to understand what was happening. - Do you remember the first time you saw the tricolor on the streets of your hometown? - When the first Anti-Maidan meetings were held, many people already came with Russian flags. And when the Russian flag was raised over the Regional State Administration, Russians who came either from Belgorod or Rostov regions took part in it. —You left your native Luhansk region twice: Luhansk and Seversko-Donetsk. What was the most difficult for you in these two cases? - We left Luhansk at the end of July 2014. On July 4, armed men came to the village and kicked us out of work. They surrounded the building, walked through the offices, told everyone to go to the corridor, and see you. Then we stayed in Luhansk for some time, tried to work, because we still had a website and we were filling it. And it was our site in July 2014 that was almost the only source of information, and we worked until the last: as long as there was an opportunity and as long as the security situation allowed. At that time, the city was already being shelled quite often from the inside, it was becoming quite dangerous, the fighting for the Luhansk airport was actively going on, and a lot of people were flying in. The last straw was the day when two explosions rang out and windows flew out on the balcony. Then he and his wife decided to leave the city. It was difficult with the railway, we went first to Berdyansk, then to relatives. Was it difficult? The first time is hard. You don't know what to take with you, they just started repairing the apartment&#8230; In the end, they took documents and some clothes with them. And at the beginning of 2015, the manager wrote to me that broadcasting is planned to be restored in Seversko-Donetsk. It was the time when the first Minsk agreements were signed and there was more or less a lull, there were no checkpoints yet, only roadblocks and we decided to go to Luhansk to pick up some things. When we were going to Severskodonetsk, we were basically going nowhere. Yes, we're told there are plans to resume broadcasting, but so far only on paper. There was not even a room. I was going to a city I had visited once in my life on a business trip. There is no housing. We just arrived. The first night we lived in a children's camp outside the city, the next day we were already looking for an apartment. To work, we were given a press center room in the regional administration, for a while we just came there with our laptops, sat down and worked on our knees. Everything was made completely from scratch. Later they got the premises. It was the building of the Institute of Chemical Industry, which had not been used for seven years. With one exception: during the occupation of Siverskodonetsk, the -ghost- gang was based there. Although the premises felt as if they had not been used for seven years, but for 27 years: old walls, no sewerage. - That is, it was easier to leave Luhansk Region for the second time, already in 2022? - There was an understanding of what to do, how to do, what to take, what not to take. Yes, there was no understanding where to go - but this is not the first time. We left in the early days. I, my family, and my company were preparing for the invasion. We gathered at the beginning of 2022 and explained the situation to the team. I clearly remember that at the meeting at the beginning of January, I told everyone: if the Russians really go with very large forces, then the speed with which they will reach Seversko-Donetsk may be so high that we may not have time to pack up and leave. Many colleagues said that they would not leave. I warned: if it gets hot, everyone will leave. In principle, that's almost what happened. On February 23, we issued work books to people. I remember how Ira Tsybukh called me at 5 a.m. on February 24. That day, February 24, she was to present her film in Seversko-Donetsk. And here is the call. It's still dark. Ira asked if I was going somewhere. I asked why I would be going somewhere at 5 in the morning. She replied that rockets were flying and the invasion had begun. Afterwards, we left with friends. It was a long way: Dnipro, Uman, some village near Khmelnytskyi&#8230; I had the most important thing in my hands: a backpack with documents in one, a carrier with Ted the cat in the other. - Tell us more about the incident at the checkpoint, when the FSB officers asked, -Where is Marchenko?- - Some of our colleagues left Luhansk region some time after the beginning of the large-scale invasion - already from the occupation. The route ran through the territory of the Russian Federation to European countries. One of my colleagues left anyway. Before starting the journey, he cleaned the phones. But FSB officers checked at the border: questioned, checked phones, including, apparently, they have a program that restores everything on the phone. And during this inspection they asked for me and for my colleague. Why such meticulous attention? Because, I can assume, we were, in essence, branch managers. - Tell me, when did you find yourself in the ranks of the Defense Forces? - I am conscripted. He graduated from the military department while studying in Luhansk. When they left Seversko-Donetsk for Lviv Oblast, they went to register. Passed the VLK, received a combat summons, but they said that there is no request for my aviation specialty. And so it continued throughout 2022: I went to the Military Commissariat as if it were work, and I had already gotten to know many people there. And the subpoena was simply rewritten for me. This continued until the beginning of 2023. I went through VLK and in a few days they told me to prepare things because there is demand. But for another SSC. As it turned out later - military intelligence. It surprised me a little: where am I, and where is the intelligence. But hey, let's go, let's go. Then there was training at the Military Academy in Odesa, actually on the seashore, resort&#8230; And then I led the platoon after that. Why did I do this - join the ranks of the Defense Forces? As my compatriot said in a recent interview: -Need - yes must-. Not even what is needed&#8230; This is my duty and my convictions, that is, I could have stayed in Luhansk, spit on everything and said: -Well, that's fine, the main thing is to survive, so I'll adapt to this and that's it.- But I have a conviction that I want to live in Ukraine - independent, free, which sometimes makes strange choices from time to time (laughs - ed.). But these elections should be made by Ukraine, and not by someone instead. —You went from civilian journalism to the intelligence unit. What, in your opinion, facilitated this adaptation? - During my studies at the Academy, I talked to a teacher, and he asked what I was doing in my life. I replied that I was in journalism and ended up in military intelligence, and expressed my astonishment at how such a thing could happen. What did the teacher answer me: -What do they work with in journalism?- With information. Scouts also work with information. Although there are nuances.- But I'm not the first and I'm not the last to find myself in such a situation. And nothing: they learn, move forward. The main thing is to have a desire, to want to learn something new, to strive to be efficient. Because if you are not effective, you will not be needed. I wanted to be as useful as possible: I went to all classes. We had very cool intelligence teachers. And also with us were sergeants from the DSHV brigades. They served as reconnaissance platoon commanders and attended courses to become officers. These are guys from the 25th, 95th, 81st, 79th brigades. With vast combat experience. They taught me a lot. So I can say that we are lucky. On the last day of my training, when we took the exam, I found out which unit I would be in - it was the 30th separate mechanized brigade. At that time, it stood in the direction of Bakhmut. I drove to my unit, which I was supposed to lead - he had already been there for a long time. They asked me who I was and where I was from, what my combat experience was. I honestly answered them that I had no combat experience and that I would focus on them. Because he is interested in the fact that we perform the task normally, without losses or with minimal losses. And for this I need their experience. This approach more or less worked: they really helped me, told me a lot, there were no refusals to complete tasks or any large-scale scandals. —On October 20, 2023, you were wounded in the Bakhmut direction. Tell me, please, under what circumstances? — It was an assault on our positions by the Russians. We knew and expected that he would. The night before, the pilots were conducting a reconnaissance of the front edge and saw that some group of Russians had arrived. We looked closely and saw that they were removing their mine barriers so that equipment could pass through. We were immediately reinforced - that is, we were, in principle, ready. On October 20, the Russians first tried to seize one position, then entered from the other side. We went to the aid of one of our companies - their positions were badly -hit- by the enemy. We entered those positions not on equipment, but in two groups on foot. No losses. I remember that we were walking, I looked where we were going - and there everything was exploding, burning, shooting range, tracers, constant arrivals. And I thought to myself, -My God, this is the last place on earth to go, but we're going there.- To say that I didn't want to is to say nothing. But we knew that there were many wounded, we were aware of the risk of this position being captured by the enemy, and we understood that we had to go to help. When they arrived, they saw that almost everyone in that position was wounded, some were seriously injured, with amputations of limbs, unfortunately, died. The Russians tried to level that position with the ground - everything went one after the other: mortar, artillery, AGS, and so on. Then -Grad-, then a tank. After a while, the position just turned into mush. It was saved by the fact that there was one dugout under the asphalt, and it was not damaged by enemy fire. Although it was very small and not everyone could fit there. Later, the night drone with resets began to work and it was he who brought us the most losses. Yes, our drones were also monitoring the situation, our civil service officers were covering us - by the way, they also saved our lives, because the Russians came very close to us at one point. At one point, the wounded were evacuated - our medical M113 rushed. She endured several hits, but was able to leave. Unfortunately, at that time they could not take out one soldier whose legs were broken. And we decided to drag him closer to the exit from the cover position. And at that moment I heard a drone above us. I tried to ask on the walkie-talkie whether it was ours or not, but almost immediately there was an explosion. On the left, I felt a powerful blow to my face. I felt something in my mouth - as if hard and redundant. I thought that the tooth had fallen out. Well, spit it out. Went back to the dugout and really wanted to drink. I started to drink, and I realized that the water seemed to be leaking out of me somewhere on the side. I say to our doctor: -Doc, tell me what I have.- To which he replied, -Commander, through and through: the cheek is pierced.- And then I realized that a few minutes ago I had not spit out a tooth, but a fragment. —Since January 2024, you are a correspondent of the Information Agency. What, in your opinion, is the role of military journalism in the context of the war with the Russian Federation, both physical and informational? - In short: we see what is happening now with the TCC, mobilization processes, etc. And there is only one conclusion: if you do not create an appropriate information field, the enemy will create it. And we all know what hostile propaganda can create. Therefore, we must do everything in our power so that we dominate the information field, not the Russians. To perceive you, to listen to you. It is important to communicate about all problems. It is hard work, but very necessary. And if we don't do it, they will do it for us. Because in the information war, the Russians let their tentacles go very, very deep. There is only a gap where they can breed their narratives - they crawl through it. And this is not only a problem of Ukraine - many countries of the world suffer from such influences of the Russian Federation. - What would be a just end to the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - Just revenge is when all Ukrainians feel that they are Ukrainians. Because this is exactly what the Russians are afraid of: that Ukrainians feel like Ukrainians. And I also want all Russians to be punished. Not necessarily all at once, but gradually. I would very much like to return to our internationally recognized borders. But not at the cost of the lives of a huge number of people. - Do you want to return to Luhansk? - Live? Unlikely. Why? Because I just know what and how it happens there. The population there changed a lot, a lot of Russians came there. If we de-occupy the territory, what to do with them? Maybe they will escape. Or maybe not. I don't want to live near them. But you can come and walk the streets of your hometown. Work for a while, too. - What do you dream about above all else? - I dream that our people will stop dying. I really want to go back to the life I had. Although I understand that it is unrealistic. Civil journalism will be somewhat different &#8230; But I want to go back to my civilian work, really - I like it. And again I want to prepare materials about those topics that were very annoyed during the conditional information lull. For example, sowing. Now I would love to return to these -boring- topics: how many hectares were sown, how many quintals harvest were harvested &#8230; And that there is no news about the destruction of our cities and death of our people. P.S.: November 15, 2024 Special Alexander Marchenko's information agency was marked by the Order -For Merit- of the 3rd degree.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/dumav-shho-vyplyunuv-zub-a-to-buv-ulamok-granaty-polyuvannya-fsb-poranennya-ta-dvichi-vtrachena-luganshhyna-istoriya-voyenkora-armiyainform/	2025-02-15T20:55:40-08:00
Defense mix: Britain may choose an American air defense system on a German armored vehicle	As the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition (AR) note, these two machines have been presented as potential candidates for participation in the British Army's Ground Air Defense (GBAD) program, which aims to meet the requirements of Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) and countermeasures unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), reports ArmyInform. The Supacat HMT and Dingo 3 were also proposed for the British Army's Land Mobility Program (LMP). This program aims to optimize the fleet by reducing the number of vehicle chassis types to 15 by 2030. The program focuses on consolidating more than ten types of protected patrol and light vehicles into three -Common Platforms- replacing legacy systems such as the Land Rover and Pinzgauer. These modernization efforts aim to simplify the fleet while supporting a range of roles with fewer, more versatile platforms. The Supacat All Terrain Mobility Platform (ATMP) was identified as a low-risk option for the LMP due to its existing service history, with nearly 1,000 units in service since 1988. The ATMP supports 4×4 and 6×6 configurations, offers a payload capacity of 4,000 kg, and a gross vehicle weight of 12,000 kg. The platform has a length of 7.1 meters, a range of 800 km and a maximum speed of 120 km/h. The vehicle includes an armored cabin with ballistic and blast protection for four crew members and can be adapted for roles such as a mobile fire platform and logistics vehicle. The Dingo 3, developed by KNDS Deutschland, is based on a Unimog chassis with a V-shaped body design to increase resistance to mines and improvised explosive devices. It is available in 4×4 and 6×6 configurations. Moreover, the latter offers increased cargo capacity and space for up to 12 crew members and equipment. The car is equipped with a six-cylinder turbodiesel engine, which is paired with an automatic transmission and a central tire inflation system. Dingo 3's modular structure allows integration of various weapon systems, including Starstreak missile pods and an RIwP turret. The unveiling of the Reconfigurable Integrated Weapons Platform (RIwP) at the current Farnborough Defense Show, according to AR experts, was the first operational demonstration of the RIwP outside the United States. This platform, which is already in use on the BTR Stryker M-SHORAD, is a modular tower system designed to integrate various systems weapons and sensors to counter multiple threats, including drones and helicopters. In Britain, it was shown equipped with the Thales High Velocity Missile (HVM), also known as the Starstreak, the Northrop Grumman M230 LF 30x113mm Bushmaster cannon and a 7.62mm machine gun. Additional capabilities include Light Multi-Missile (LMM) integration and the L3 MX series electro-optical/infrared sight. Moog stabilization technology reduces shock and vibration during cross-country operations, and the turret's modular design allows integration of new weapons and sensors without requiring significant redesign. The Starstreak missile launcher, which was a key feature of the RIwP weapon configuration presented at the British exhibition, is being used effectively in Ukraine to engage air and armored targets. About this weapon, our editors previously told in one of its materials. Its ammunition uses three laser-guided tungsten submunitions with a range of 7 kilometers and a speed of over Mach 3. This missile system is designed to combat low-flying aircraft, helicopters and unmanned aerial systems. The complex is manufactured by Thales Air Defense and can be fired from the shoulder or mounted on mobile platforms. The addition of XM1211 ammunition for the M230 LF gun can improve RIwP effectiveness against smaller and more maneuverable drone-type targets in the British Army's Ground Air Defense program (GBAD). The British Army's GBAD program is part of a wider modernization drive to counter growing air threats. As part of the Land GBAD initiative, activities are based on SHORAD, Medium-Range Air Defense (MRAD) and Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS), and partially replace air defense systems Stormer HVM. The Supacat HMT and Dingo 3 offer advantages for the Land Mobility Program (LMP) and the Ground Air Defense (GBAD) initiative when equipped with the RIwP turret, making them serious contenders in their respective weapon categories.

To see the war. Show war. Living by war: when drive is a must have at work. Who are the soldiers of ...	To see the war. Show war. Living by war&#8230; It is through their eyes that not only Ukraine, but also the whole world sees all the cruelty of the Russian invasion and the crimes of the occupiers, but also the courage, sacrifice and heroism of Ukrainian defenders. ArmyInform is part of a large family of military journalists. Our correspondents are constantly in the war zone and prepare reports on the work of our defenders. Many of our colleagues, before becoming military journalists, defended the country from the aggressor in different directions and in different units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine with weapons in their hands. Military Journalist Day is not a holiday. The holiday is when military journalists are not needed! Rather, it is a day to honor the difficult, painstaking, but very important work that is an important part of the country's defense&#8230;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/bachyty-vijnu-pokazuvaty-vijnu-zhyty-vijnoyu-koly-drajv-v-roboti-must-have-hto-vony-voyenkory-armiyainform/	2025-02-15T20:31:09-08:00
Day of the military journalist: what is known about the officer in whose honor today the soldiers ar...	There is a corresponding order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. Dmytro Labutkin &#8211; military correspondent, captain of the 3rd rank (posthumously). Died on the morning of February 16, 2015 while leaving Debaltseve. The advanced group, which he was part of, was ambushed. -Dmytro suffered 7 serious injuries as a result of the fighting. One of the large-caliber bullets penetrated the body armor and almost completely tore the liver. Later, during the identification of my son's body, I saw that the hole from the wound reached almost seven centimeters,- - said father Vitaly Volodymyrovych Labutkin. Footage of the shot Ukrainian with an armored personnel carrier, the occupiers put it on the network. -That day I went to the city. The godfather came up to me and said: -Uncle Vitaly, there was a video about your Dima on YouTube...- At that moment, I was struck by lightning, - I realized that this was the end,- the father recalls. Dmytro was in different clothes in the video. But the father didn't know at the time that his son was disguised because he gave his brand new uniform to a wounded soldier on the front line, whose camouflage was tattered by debris. Later, the parents find out that the video with the dead fighters was not taken immediately. Dmytro's brother told that after the clash, the occupiers did not dare to approach the Ukrainian armored personnel carrier for six hours. -The Russians were afraid that the boys would shoot back, because they did not know that they had used all their ammunition in the battle,- the father said. And when they realized that the combat vehicle did not respond to provocations, the separatists attacked. The video was shot in another location. laying out the bodies of the killed servicemen in the same way. ...Dmytro Labutkin was one of the last to leave Crimea. Debaltseve was the last of the journalists to leave surrounded by the aggressor, recording evidence of the criminal actions of the Russian army until the last moment. For personal courage and high professionalism, shown in the defense of the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, loyalty to the military oath by the decree of the President of Ukraine, Captain 3rd rank Dmytro Labutkin was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree (posthumously), by order of the Minister of the Defense of Ukraine - with the award -For Military Valor- (posthumously).

A horror story about medical experiments on military personnel: why is the Russian Federation invent...	Well, in response, I want to ask: why not supplement this fake with something brighter? For example, about secret bases where Ukraine is creating a super soldier, or laboratories where an army of cyborgs is being produced. What was invented this time? Propaganda resources of the Russian Federation spread the -testimony- of anonymous sources (read - drunk screenwriters from Olhino), who talk about the fact that Ukrainian doctors allegedly perform cruel experiments on patients. For example, the wounded are not provided with ordinary care, but -dubious experiments- are conducted - from testing new drugs to some mysterious genetic manipulations. As always, there is no proof in their -sensations- - only blurry photos taken out of the context of the video and the stories of some nameless -eyewitnesses-. Ukrainian medicine works according to clear international standards. Ukrainian doctors, who save the wounded at the front and in the rear, have earned immense respect both in the country and in the world. The treatment of military personnel and civilians is carried out in accordance with international norms, including the Geneva Convention, which prohibits any medical experiments on people without their consent. Ukrainian hospitals and hospitals receive humanitarian aid, modern equipment and drugs from partners, and are not -testing unknown substances-, as Russia is trying to present. Medics save even captured Russian soldiers, which completely destroys their myth of -cruel experiments-. This fake has several purposes: This is far from the first -horror story- from the Kremlin. They have already talked about -war mosquitoes-, -black transplant specialists- and -secret NATO laboratories-. Now they decided to add more medical experiments. We are waiting for new stories about the fact that Ukrainian doctors not only save lives, but also turn military personnel into cyborgs, and civilians into Marvel superheroes. Well, it's nice to know that even in their lies, the Russians admit that our medicine is so advanced that they can only invent myths about its extraordinary capabilities. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/zhahalka-pro-medychni-eksperymenty-nad-vijskovymy-chomu-rf-cze-vygaduye/	2025-02-15T20:02:49-08:00

In 2025, Russia plans to create 15 new divisions - the President of Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said this during a speech at the main session of the Munich Conference on Security Issues. He emphasized that in order to achieve a fair and long-term peace, European countries should strengthen their defense capabilities, pursue a coordinated foreign policy and, together with the United States, provide Ukraine with effective security guarantees. -Many leaders spoke about the fact that Europe needs its own armed forces, the army is the army of Europe. And I truly believe that time has come. It is necessary to create the armed forces of Europe. It is not more difficult than resolutely resisting Russian attacks, as we are already doing,- he said. According to the President, Europe needs a single voice, not a dozen separate ones. That is why diplomacy and a unified foreign policy must be coordinated. In particular, regarding the just end of the war. -Ukraine will never agree to agreements concluded behind our backs, without our participation. And this very rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions regarding Ukraine without Ukraine. No solutions for Europe without Europe. Europe must have a seat at the table when decisions are made about Europe,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. Voladymyr Zelenskyy expressed his belief that Russia does not want peace. As Moscow plans to create 15 new divisions, Ukraine needs reliable security guarantees after the end of the war. They will be strong only with the participation of the USA and the proactive position of Europe. -Some say that the new year does not come on January 1, but during the Munich Security Conference.

- We need to take advantage of this now, not later - Volodymyr Zelenskyy called his recipe for peace...	He shared his thoughts on this matter on Saturday, February 15, during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. -The fate of this war cannot be determined by just a few leaders: neither Trump and Putin, nor me and Putin, nor anyone here in Munich together with Putin. We must press together to achieve true peace. Putin cannot offer real security guarantees. Not only because he is a liar, but also because Russia in its current state needs war to hold on to power. And the world must be protected from this,- the head of state said. According to him, the recipe for peace has five main components. -First, the Armed Forces of Europe as an update of NATO. Secondly, common European foreign policy. Third, the level of European cooperation that Washington should take seriously. Fourth, international law. And fifthly, the continuation of pressure on Russia,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. He explained that only pressure on the Russian Federation, -and not some words of Putin-, can guarantee peace, since the Kremlin dictator's promises cannot be trusted under any circumstances. -Putin is lying. It is predictable. And he is weak. We have to take advantage of it now, not later. And we have to act as Europe, not as a group of disparate individuals. Let this year be the year of a united, strong, safe and peaceful Europe. Peace for Ukraine. Peace for Europe. Peace for the whole world, for all your families,- added the President. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier Volodymyr Zelensky warned that, according to intelligence, Moscow is now preparing not for peace talks, but for further escalation, planning to send its troops to Belarus under the pretext of alleged -training-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/treba-czym-skorystatysya-vzhe-a-ne-potim-volodymyr-zelenskyj-nazvav-svij-reczept-myru-v-yevropi/	2025-02-15T04:52:58-08:00

The US is seriously concerned about the difference in presence between it and Russia in the Arctic -...	Answering the question of the ArmiyaInform correspondent, what the declaration of intention to buy Greenland from the Kingdom of Denmark, doctor of philosophy in the field of social and behavioral sciences, Major of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Andriy Rudyk could mean, said that this is not the first time that the United States has claimed Greenland, and most of the existing infrastructure was built there by the Americans during their stay on the island during the Second World War. -Many of us look at the world map incorrectly. We look squarely at it, and in Arctic issues, we need to look at the globe from above in order to understand what the mileage is and whose ownership is there. The Americans in the Arctic have no permanent large port city, no settlement that will provide them with permanent sea communications. There are only two bases that are slightly above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. But Russia has a huge Murmansk base with a population of more than 200,000 people, has several military bases, one of which is 65 km from the outermost island of the Norwegian archipelago, Svalbard, which is completely demilitarized. This base is called -Arctic Shamrock- near the village of Nagurske on the island of Zemlya Oleksandry. It was commissioned again in the 20th year. And on the 24th, Russia launched a number of nuclear icebreakers. Currently, the Russian fleet, both civil and military (there they have a combined grouping of the northern fleet), has 41 icebreakers in operation, in particular, a number of nuclear icebreakers armed with sea-based cruise missiles of the caliber and Kh-35 anti-radiation missiles of various modifications. The operational distance is from the smallest 130 km to the largest 2300 km. And in order not to go into details, here is the answer to the question why the United States is so interested in Greenland. Because we need to deploy ballistic missiles there, including,- Andriy Rudyk said. The expert also emphasized that Russia is interested in the Arctic due to the fact that 85% of Russian gas production is in the Arctic region. And it protects it with three main military bases, where it has more than a thousand military personnel, including the Federal Security Service, which takes care of a number of border issues there. In addition, Russia has 10 full-fledged airfields and icebreakers with cruise missiles in the Arctic, in addition to military bases. Meanwhile, according to open data, only 100 personnel are stationed at the Danish military base in Greenland, most of them civilians. -In addition to the Arctic Shamrock base, which I mentioned, there is a Polar Star base (opened in 2014 - ed.) on Wrangel Island, which is adjacent to Chukotka. And they also have one base on the Novosibirsk Islands (Northern Klyver - ed.), which are adjacent to the Nenets Autonomous District. Therefore, it is clear that the United States, or rather the Trump administration, in my personal opinion as a scientist, is a little shocked by the difference in presence. By the way, why the question was also raised about Canada, about Nunavut (the territory that covers most of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - ed.) - because Canada only has radar stations there. And you can't repel missiles with radar stations. Their task is only to identify them,- the expert noted. To continue the topic, candidate of political sciences, head of research programs of the USSD National Academy of Sciences Yuriy Oliynyk drew attention to the fact that the shortest flight paths of intercontinental missiles from Russia to America are precisely through the Arctic. -And in addition to Panama, where Chinese influence is very large, China is also trying to negotiate with Denmark in Greenland to advance its investments. There is also Cuba, also from that block. Obviously, this is increasingly becoming a threat for the US, because it can be surrounded by China's friends on all sides,- said Yuriy Oliynyk. Oleksandr Chupak, the head of economic programs of the USSD National Academy of Sciences, in his turn, expressed confidence that Denmark will most likely offer the United States to increase its military presence in Greenland, and this will be the real consequence of all these statements in question.

The dynamics of military confrontation in 2024 increased by more than 5% compared to 2023 — analysts	The principle of formation of the study is the ranking of military-political conflicts and diplomatic clashes from the most heated and large-scale to the least visible, but potentially dangerous. The great war in Europe, the powder keg in the Middle East, the appearance of North Korean troops on the Russian-Ukrainian front, escalation in the Pacific region, Trump's expansionist statements and the -destruction of the principle of territorial integrity of states- - is this already a hot third world or is it still a creeping -quiet phase-? This was discussed by the co-authors of the study: Yurii Syrotyuk, director of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Strategic Research Studies-, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th Armed Forces Brigade; Andriy Rudyk, Doctor of Philosophy in the field of social and behavioral sciences, major of the ZSU; Yuriy Oliynyk, candidate of political sciences, head of research programs of the National Center for National Development of Ukraine -USSD-, serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; Oleksandr Chupak, head of the economic programs of the National Center of the National Academy of Sciences -USSD- and Kateryna Shymkevich, candidate of historical sciences, expert of the Analytical Center for Balkan Studies. Last year, there were 8 interstate wars in the world (Ukraine, Israel, Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, CAR), two border clashes (Armenia - Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan - Tajikistan), 18 local conflicts (Afghanistan, Libya, Myanmar, Mali, Burkina Faso, DR Congo, Somalia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Chad, Cameroon, Western Sahara, Niger, Senegal, West Papua (Indonesia), Baluchistan (Pakistan and Iran)), Guerrilla War (Thailand), 5 Domestic Political Crises (Latin America (Multiple Countries), Bangladesh, Balkans (Multiple Countries), Iraq, Iran), 4 Power Diplomatic Conflicts (Guyana-Venezuela, Greece-Turkey, Korean Peninsula, Taiwan), a total of 38 cases of resolution of inter-state and intra-state confrontations by military methods. In 2024, the dynamics of military confrontation in the world increased compared to 2023 by more than 5%. And by more than 10% compared to 2022. Thus, in 2024, the main event on a global scale continued to be the Russian-Ukrainian war, which, in terms of the intensity of technical means, became one of the largest after the Korean War, as well as the largest conflict in Europe since 1945. The Palestinian-Israeli war has serious consequences for the world and the Middle East region, which began with a terrorist attack by the Hamas group on Israel, and then turned into an Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip, and then spilled over into Lebanon and led to an exchange of airstrikes between Iran and Israel. At the end of the year, the rapid fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria led to a radical restructuring of the balance of power in the region and a decrease in Russia's influence. Tensions are rising in the Pacific. The situation around Taiwan is traditionally difficult in the context of China's regular naval exercises. Of particular concern is the demonstration of a military threat and declarations of the DPRK's readiness for war, accompanied by Pyongyang's direct participation in the Russian-Ukrainian war. On the territory of less developed states, long-term conflicts continue, although a significant part of them reduces the intensity within the framework of the negotiation process (for example, in Ethiopia). At the same time, a potentially large-scale conflict is unfolding between DR Congo and Rwanda. Yemeni Houthi attacks on civilian vessels in the Red Sea continue to threaten the security of global supply chains. The situation in West Africa remains traditionally tense, where Russia increases instability and supports military coups. Force continues to be the main argument for the resolution of international disputes. The restoration of conventional means of warfare, with the frontal collision of numerous armies, has become a characteristic feature. On the other hand, the importance of the technical level became obvious, primarily in the field of accuracy and speed of data transfer. Along with the proxy confrontation between the USA and the PRC, regional leaders — Iran, Turkey — are actively intervening in the force competition. The influence of network paramilitary formations and the emergence of the instrument of quasi-states is increasing. These quasi-states fill the lacunae of the -dead zones- that form outside the influence of nation states, regional leaders, and as a result of the strategic confrontation of superpowers. Private armies are engaged in full force. The War Index is an analytical product that has been published for the seventh year in a row. This is an analysis of the conflicts taking place in the world, their ranking, an expert opinion and a forecast of how they will change and affect world politics.

This is evidenced by their whining audio intercepts, which published by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -In a conversation intercepted by spies, a resident of the Bryansk region is outraged by the lack of reaction and informing the population by local leaders about the explosions caused by Russia's criminal war against Ukraine,- the GUR notes. According to the woman, local authorities and propagandists completely ignore the problems of the population, which finally faced the consequences of the war launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. -They don't say anything about it. And our Bogomaz (governor) does not write anything. We only have eavesdropping on what people will write. Everything is fine with Bogomaza, everything is calm. Suzemka, White Birch - that's all. Daily. Like our Lomakovka. No one pays attention anymore. Every day they beat there. This whole thing will probably take a long time. And then even if it all ends with a nuclear war,- the Russian laments. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians also complain that hungry soldiers of the Russian Federation are wandering around Bryansk, begging locals for any food.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/hoch-by-yadernoyu-ne-skinchylosya-na-bryanshhyni-skyglyat-shho-misczeva-vlada-ignoruye-vijnu-ta-yiyi-naslidky-dlya-rosiyan/	2025-02-15T00:32:35-08:00

Restored -techik-, the battles near Bakhmut and the broken spine: the story of Oleksiy, a military o...	Aleksii told our correspondent about the defense of Kyiv and the tasks he performed in the Bakhmut region. -On the second day of the large-scale invasion, he found his military ID at home and went to the TCC in Kyiv. I remember that there was a long queue. They asked me if I was ready for the front line. He replied that he was ready. And soon he was already in his military unit. I got into one of the famous artillery brigades. By the way, I came to the TCC with two boys. They are from Donetsk. They moved here back in 2014. And one of them said: -Lyokha, we used to sit out, now we don't have a home there, we have to go fight.- Before the invasion, I had a good life, I have no regrets. Management position in one well-known company. By the way, they still wait for me there and support me constantly. When it's all over, I'll go back to my normal life. My parents didn't approve of my decision to go to war at first. And then over time they accepted this situation. He wrote to his wife and son, who had left for Poland, that he had joined the army. They understood me. My mom and dad also left with the start of the large-scale invasion. To Austria. My father died there. ...My civilian job was related to automotive engineering, so it came in handy in the army. The war cannot exist without cars. So I started. It was the defense of Kyiv. We were constantly loading and sending shells. The military didn't have many vehicles at that time. I saw a semi-dismantled Volkswagen T4 standing in the area. I say to the company commander: -Give me this car, let it go for two days, and it will drive with us.- So they did. and I have first dealt with this car with this renovated car. Sometimes it was very dangerous to break through to some of them. But at speed it was possible. And went through Sumy. And we caught up with them on two trawls with guns. They stopped, decomposed, fired on them, made up and reconciled again. They invited me because I never refused even the most difficult tasks. He passed his studies, finished him perfectly. And I voluntarily &#8211; there. And there, everything is completely different. Almost round-the-clock work. In the crew, someone is resting for three hours, at which time the other works, then on the contrary. Sometimes you can work in the field for a whole day when there is frost, snow and enemy birds in the sky. And the tasks were completely different then. Sometimes we hit important enemy facilities, which were located sometimes 30 kilometers from the contact line. Sometimes, we scouted where the Katsaps attracted some heavy equipment, or the same -Grades-. The Katsaps then carried mortars, heavy weapons and periodically tried to break through. And when they artillery began to hit our infantry, then we engaged in counter-battery fighting: we searched for their guns and hit them with our means. And there, just in the direction of Bakhmut, a mine landed almost next to me. As a result &#8211; broken spine, damage to all its departments. Then I was found to be of limited fitness and transferred to the TCC to serve. Now I periodically undergo rehabilitation. After the procedures, the pain goes away for a month and a half. Although even before that landmine landed, my spine had already begun to collapse, because they were loading heavy shells. ...My colleague, who is also currently serving in the TCC, does not respond to reproaches directed at us by civilians, who say, why are you here and not there. And I am in solidarity with him, I also do not pay attention to such phrases. There is no point in explaining something in the third year of a large-scale invasion. The one who is interested, he knows everything very well. There are a lot of people who tell us this at assembly points: we know, we read, we see that the military in the TCC &#8211; these are those who cannot fight because of their health. That is, the majority just understands who we are.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/vidnovlenyj-techik-boyi-pid-bahmutom-ta-perebytyj-hrebet-istoriya-vijskovogo-z-tczk-oleksiya/	2025-02-14T21:04:31-08:00
In the Pokrovsky direction, the armored column of the Russians was unwound: the scouts discovered th...	The intelligence officer of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade with the call sign -Cornet- told ArmyInform about how brigade intelligence works during the modern war. -Radio-electronic intelligence deals with intercepts and direction finding. As soon as the enemy presses a tangent and transmits some information, we catch this information and, with the help of certain resources, transmit it to the point of collection and processing. Then, from this collection point, all the data comes to my gadget,- says -Cornet-. Of course, the enemy tries to encrypt his messages. To do this, radios are flashed using special equipment and keys. This is necessarily done before groups leave for positions, however, after a certain time, the enemy's encryption keys can be broken - this forces the Russians to periodically flash the radio stations. -You can break it in a couple of hours, you can in a day. We crack their encryption and start listening to them. In three days they have to come back to reflash the radio stations, because by that time we can definitely listen to them,- the officer explains the work of electronic intelligence. After the enemy reflashes the radios, the encryption keys have to be cracked anew. This requires additional time, but Ukrainian scouts always cope with the task. Especially since, if necessary, more powerful means can be turned on at a level higher than that of a brigade. -If we don't have the appropriate means and capabilities, you can always turn to higher-level management and ask them to break one or another key. Then they help us, break the enemy's encryption key - and we can listen to the enemy's radio communications again,- says the intelligence officer. Capturing enemy radio stations is a significant advantage for scouts. This makes it possible to extract from them all the information necessary for breaking the keys and to listen to all the radio communications of the enemy. -If we have samples of radios, samples of telephones that the infantry brought from the front, that's a very big plus. They are connected, all keys and information are extracted, and we can hack all radio stations without any questions,- explains -Kornet-. Of course, the advantage gained in this way has its expiration date, because sooner or later the enemy will change the encryption keys again and they will have to be cracked anew. -Almost every captured prisoner has a radio station. These are -Here-, -Baofeng-, -Azarty-. -Baofeng- is the easiest to listen to, -Azarty- is the hardest. However, if they are captured, everything can be hacked if you wish and have the appropriate resources,- the intelligence officer says. This is how a classic military -battle of sword and shield- takes place in REP: scouts break through enemy defenses, invaders restore defensive barriers - and the struggle for preemption begins all over again. Radio interception, according to the intelligence officer, is today one of the most valuable sources of information about the intentions, plans and actions of the enemy. It is from them that the main information that allows effective countermeasures against the Russian invaders in the area of ​​responsibility of the brigade comes. -These intercepts contain all the information - what they plan, how they lead the groups, how long the equipment will leave. The commander sits -on a stretcher- somewhere and communicates with his own personnel on the front edge, gives certain guidelines: -Move forward, go to the right, you will see a green hangar-. And we listen and understand that the green hangar is only in one place - and it's a good reference point for artillery,- Cornet smiles. Then everything happens simply - after receiving visual confirmation, the scouts give a reference point and the artillery inflicts fire damage on the enemy group. Its effectiveness can also be determined by radio interception, from which it becomes known that the enemy has a lot of -two hundred- and -three hundred-, so he is forced to retreat. -Radio intercept detects, -mavik- flies there, confirms the radio intercept visually - and the artillery strikes. Therefore, it can be said that the second wing of the PEP is aerial reconnaissance - apparently, they are on the same level and allow protecting the lives of fighters, who, thanks to this, do not need to sit at an observation post and take risks,- the military officer explains. The enemy is usually unable to even understand where exactly he has pierced. To understand all the enemy's code designations, special maps and databases are created, which allow you to find out literally by one word what the intercepted message is about. The least valuable source of information is the captives, who usually do not know any valuable information and are poorly oriented in space. They know nothing even of their immediate commanders. -Prisoners don't know anything. They have a command that instructs the assault group before going out. They have their phones with them, the AlpineQuest program on their phones. A stormtrooper is given a route from point A to point B, where he must arrive. But they turn on the program not from the point where the briefing was held, but 5 kilometers from there,- says -Kornet-. Thanks to this, the captive only knows this route and only from there can you follow his path with the AlpineQuest application on the phone. In the best case, the name of the location and the call sign can be extracted from the prisoner. -Out of ten, at best one or two know something. We ask them if they have anti-tank means, what kind of artillery they have, what tanks they have, what kind of weapons they have in the infantry that goes to the front line, whether they have anti-tank means on the front line,- says Kornet. But in most cases, enemy foot soldiers have an extremely low level of intellectual development. They are used purely as suicide bombers for -meat- assaults, issuing one machine gun, two shops and a one-way ticket. Visual surveillance of the enemy's actions is provided not only by fighters at observation posts or aerial reconnaissance vehicles, but also by a network of cameras installed at the front edge. In adverse weather conditions, when it is impossible to raise reconnaissance drones into the sky, cameras become the main eyes of scouts. -We go to the front and install CCTV cameras. When the weather does not allow us to raise a -wing- or -mavik- into the sky, we watch everything on cameras,- says -Kornet-. The enemy, of course, tries to detect and destroy CCTV cameras of the Defense Forces. Such a hunt becomes especially persistent on the eve of planned assaults, which the Russians try to carry out under favorable weather conditions. This is how the enemy thinks at this time, according to the scout: -We are planning assault operations when there is fog. The terrain is a beam. The enemy—that is, us—will not see us. He will not be able to lift -mavics- or -wing-. Therefore, we will work on this day in this direction. But before that, we need to destroy their cameras that are on the front line here, here and here.- After the enemy hits the cameras, he conducts reconnaissance and reports the result. However, the very act of destroying cameras is a sign of the Russians' preparation for offensive actions, so Ukrainian intelligence officers are increasing their vigilance in this direction. Regular collection of information from all possible sources allows you to learn in advance about the intentions and plans of the enemy and make the necessary preparations to disrupt them. -We monitor everything, we know about all their movements and meetings. For example, there is an interception of the PEP on the gathering of mechanics-drivers in -Leshego-. This means that the enemy is planning some actions and will conduct briefings with personnel. If we are talking about mechanized vehicles, this means that the occupiers will form an armored group for an assault,- the officer says. The intercepted message is a signal to Ukrainian scouts to strengthen aerial reconnaissance and monitoring not only of the front edge, but also of the enemy's rear areas. After all, if it is possible to detect an enemy assault armored column further from the combat line in the depth of enemy lines, the Ukrainian fighters will have more time and opportunities to destroy it. -Recently, we had such an armored column in the Pokrovsky direction - 11 units of armored vehicles, approximately 120 enemy soldiers per company. Total losses were suffered - the column was broken, all the equipment was destroyed. Of the personnel, even before the start of the assault, there were already 40 -two hundred- and 37 -three hundred-, says -Cornet-. Suffering critical losses, the remnants of the enemy assault group were forced to retreat. It was possible to stop the assault thanks to the professional actions of scouts - the occupiers were already found at a depth of about 30 kilometers from the combat line. -We were warned and knew that the convoy would be moving. Therefore, our entire personnel was warned in advance, anti-tank weapons were brought to readiness, tanks were taken to closed positions, and drone crews were prepared. This allowed the brigade, with the help of confederates and attached units, to completely destroy all enemy equipment, and the remaining enemy personnel were ordered to retreat,- says the officer. In this way, it was the comprehensive intelligence that made it possible to prepare in time for the enemy's offensive actions and to effectively repulse an enemy assault attempt with the use of a significant amount of armored vehicles. Under the command of -Cornet- are people from purely civilian professions who, after training and during service, became highly professional scouts capable of performing the most difficult tasks. -My guys are not from the regular army, they are not military personnel, they are all mobilized. But in three years, they have already reached the level where they can compete on equal footing and outpace the personnel of the Russian Federation army,- the officer says about his subordinates. They are not inferior to the best enemy developments and equipment that Ukrainian intelligence officers work with.

Another Russian fake: Ukraine mobilizes orphans? Well, of course, and also - pokemons and pets	Fake Russian -media- (read - factories of lies) spread the -news- that Ukrainian military commissars are forcibly taking orphans to the army. The -evidence- includes blurry videos, footage taken out of context, and anonymous -testimonies-. Everything according to the standard scenario of Kremlin storytellers. Ukrainian legislation clearly defines who is subject to mobilization. Citizens between the ages of 25 and 60 are subject to the draft, not teenagers, and even more so not children of orphanages. In addition, only those who have a military specialty or have served are subject to mobilization. Therefore, even 18-year-olds without experience are not -taken- just like that, let alone minors. The propaganda machine of the Russian Federation works according to the principle -the more ridiculous the lie, the faster it will be believed.- The purpose of such fakes is to cause panic, sow distrust in the Armed Forces, and provoke the indignation of the international community. But every time they overestimate their audience, because even their supporters are not always ready to swallow such nonsense. the Russians have already figured out that: Ukraine sends -war mosquitoes- into battle, the Armed Forces of Ukraine use -black magic- against the invaders, the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are aliens, and now here are -mobilized children.- We are waiting for new masterpieces. For example, that Ukraine is raising an army from pets or cloning Cossacks from the DNA of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. And for now, let's spread the truth: no one is mobilizing teenagers, but it seems like it's high time for Russian propagandists to rest. It is better in a sanatorium somewhere in Siberia. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/chergovyj-rosijskyj-fejk-ukrayina-mobilizuye-ditej-syrit-nu-zvisno-a-shhe-pokemoniv-i-domovychkiv/	2025-02-14T20:13:47-08:00

- I have nothing to hug you-. The story of love, injury and support of Alexander and his Nadia	This ward is a temporary home for Alexander and Nadia. He was seriously wounded during the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in Kurshchyna, his two upper limbs were amputated. She is a beloved wife who will always be there: both in grief and in joy. They have been together since 9th grade. Both are from Poltava Oblast. A quarter of a century as acquaintances. 21 years in marriage. They are raising two sons. And the war and the serious wounding of Alexander, unfortunately, only emphasized how strong the feelings of this couple are. This short story, recorded by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform in one of the medical institutions of Kyiv, is about love during war, mutual support and understanding during war, as well as plans for the future. -I studied in the 9th grade, Sasha was four years older than me. He used to visit my brother on business, and he introduced us,- recalls Nadiya and adds that, unfortunately, her brother died seven months ago in the Russian-Ukrainian war. The initiative in the relationship was mostly shown by Nadiya. There were many evenings at dances, discos. In 1999, Oleksandr served a term of service in the PPO. Worked with a radar station. Nadiya studied, and Alexander served his time and started working in Pyryatyn. Sometimes the girl went to visit her lover. -And we are from the village! That's what they said in the village: -And why does she go there?!- Let's either sign up or not go.- So we applied on my birthday, March 23rd. April 25 was the wedding.- They got married when Nadiya was 20 years old, Alexander was 24. A year later, the first-born Dmytro was born, and at the age of 29, Nadiya gave birth to her second son, Roman. Alexander lived a civilian life. By 2024. Then he went to the TCC, because he had to update his military registration data by July 16. I updated the data and received a combat summons on the same day. First, the training center in Chernihiv Oblast (30 days), then Kryvyi Rih (additional staffing), and from there the Kursk direction. At first he was in the ranks of the 47th separate mechanized brigade, then the 25th separate assault battalion. Position: Grenade Launcher. -I had enough for six days. Told to take a stand. We got there, and it turns out that there were already people sitting there. The landing was dense, nothing was visible - they started working on us with machine guns. The right hand was wounded as a result of machine gun fire, an artery was hit. The left hand was injured due to mortar shelling. The first was the wounded right hand. While they were evacuating, a mortar arrived literally in 10 minutes. As soon as it got dark, the FPVs arrived with cameras and began to cover. I still hid properly, in a hole&#8230; And thanks to my brother with the call sign -Father-. If it weren't for him, I would have stayed there. He pulled me out and dragged me into the evacuation vehicle. He is also injured now, undergoing rehabilitation,- the soldier recalls the circumstances of the injury. -&#8230; My brother put tourniquets on him. If it weren't for him, Sasha would have bled and been the 500th. Because many boys from the Kursk region are missing,- adds Nadiya. The evacuation lasted a long time. The tourniquet was applied for 34 hours. -If everything had been faster, the right arm would have been saved,- says the soldier. All this happened in October 2024. Since then, treatment and rehabilitation. -When Sasha was mobilized, I cried every day. I waited, went to work. When he was taken to the battlefield, he did not confess to me, only told his eldest son. But he called every day: morning and evening. Then a few days of silence and suddenly a call. Sasha calls. Said it was fine. At that time, he was in intensive care. And then in the evening he called again and told what had happened: -I have nothing to hug you.- I was glad that he was alive. While I was in the positions, I cried every day. When she found out that he was injured, she did not cry. I came to Kyiv, saw him, and didn't cry either. Yes, when they were taken to the war, there were tears. When I'm already near him, I try not to cry,- the woman says firmly and confidently. After she left for her husband in Kyiv, Nadia was fired from the Kremenchug Carriage Works. -As far as I know, when our colleagues go abroad to earn money, they have three months in reserve. I thought that I would go to Sasha in Kyiv - it would count for me either as a vacation or at my own expense, etc. I warned that I would not return to work anytime soon, because my husband is without two hands. But two weeks passed and I was fired. I worked for 17 years,- says Nadiya. -&#8230; And in two weeks they were fired. But she is next to me!-, adds Oleksandr. Followed by further treatment and prosthetics. The application was submitted for state prosthetics at the Ortho-pro company. For the time being, there will be mechanics on the left hand (while the stump is prepared - ed.), bionics on the right. Oleksandr's plans for the future are to learn to work with new hands. In rehabilitation, he emphasizes, time is of the essence. Nadia plans to breed chrysanthemums in the future. This is what she was still doing at the factory: breeding indoor plants, cuttings, etc. -I want to buy chrysanthemums that no one has yet. And breed them. Work should be such that you can be at home. Next to the man. And the most insulting thing is that Sasha was called a universal soldier, because no matter what he did, he succeeded in everything. And here it is,- says Nadiya. -&#8230; But never lose heart: I have two sons who need to be put on their feet!-, Oleksandr seems to conclude his wife's thoughts. The 11-year-old son continues his studies. He is especially interested in mathematics, music, football. Parents help with lessons remotely. The eldest son is already working. -As soon as Sasha was taken into the army, he immediately showed himself as a man. Dad used to give a sample,- says Nadiya. In the end, I ask Nadiya what she would advise wives who, unfortunately, find themselves or may find themselves in the situation in which she herself found herself - when her husband was seriously injured. After all, cases are not rare, according to doctors, when spouses separate after the injury of a defender. To this the woman replies: -I don't understand how this is possible&#8230; We are always together. 20 years!..- says Nadiya. -21,- Alexander corrects. -&#8230; But, for example, we go to the store together, visit together, visit our mother together. We are all in this together. And when he was taken to the war, I came home from work, went into the yard, passed the arch made of grapes, and began to cry. I go in and he's gone. Therefore, I do not understand how I can leave him after he was taken to war. So he was taken away and there is no part of the family. Is our heart not there? Oleksandr continues the idea of ​​mutual support in a couple: -When you are lying alone and being treated, it is psychologically very difficult. And when a woman is around, there is nothing to compare it with! And we'll talk, and we'll laugh, and we'll joke. When your significant other is around, it's wonderful. And we are out of Kyiv, we can go for a walk. When the children arrived, they went to the water park and Fairyland. We try not to lie in one place, because the tummy will grow,- Oleksandr says with a laugh. And the couple walks a lot. Walks alternate between procedures: either go out for coffee, then go to the market for beads, or just take a walk in the park. And everything, of course, together.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/meni-nemaye-chym-tebe-obijmaty-istoriya-kohannya-poranennya-i-pidtrymky-oleksandra-i-jogo-nadiyi/	2025-02-13T21:02:34-08:00
Standby mode: how Donald Trump's statements affected the NATO meeting and what Ukraine should prepar...	But very quickly the focus of the discussions shifted to one and only one topic - potential negotiations on ending the Russian war against Ukraine. The trigger for this was US President Donald Trump's statements about telephone conversations with Kremlin dictator Volodymyr Putin and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. Usually, such topics concern diplomats, but it was impossible to ignore this flow of information. Therefore, the ministers of defense expressed their positions and had to respond literally on the go to new and new statements from the White House. How European allies perceived the actions of the USA and whether this will affect the further support of Ukraine - read more in the article of the ArmiyaInform correspondent from Brussels. In a certain sense, this ministerial ended up being a preparation for the Munich Security Conference, which begins on February 14. It is in Munich that the American diplomatic mission will arrive, which, as expected, will outline its position regarding support for Ukraine for the first time and will talk about its vision of possible negotiations to end the war. However, events developed so rapidly that two days before Munich, drastic changes occurred. It all started with the harsh statements of the new head of the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, who arrived at the ministerial for the first time and also took part in the Ramstein meeting held at the NATO headquarters for the first time. ArmyInform wrote in detail about his demands to the allies to increase defense spending and the statement that returning to the borders of Ukraine by 2014 is an unrealistic goal. As it turned out, this was only the beginning. A little later, Donald Trump announced that he had a phone conversation with the Kremlin dictator, and an hour later - with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Trump also said that preparations for the negotiations have actually begun and that he is ready to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia. He did not mention the meeting with the Ukrainian president. Next, the American president questioned the need for Ukraine's future membership in NATO and avoided answering whether Ukraine should even be part of the negotiations. And therefore, he actually called into question the subjectivity of Ukraine. However, already on February 13, Pete Hegseth announced at the final press conference in Brussels that the US president will hold talks with the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. -Any negotiations that are held will be held with both. President Zelensky understands the realities on the ground, Putin understands the realities on the ground, and President Trump, as a person who makes agreements and conducts negotiations, also understands these dynamics,- he said. The American minister also suggested that a -demarcation that will not suit either side- will be carried out as part of the peace agreement. On the same day, Donald Trump himself declared that Ukraine would be part of the negotiations: -We will have Ukraine, Russia will be there, and there will be other people... I believe that he (Putin. - Ed.) wants peace. I think he would have told me if he didn't want to.- These statements hardly convinced anyone, given the changeable position of the US president. In addition, Europe's participation in the negotiations remained unclear, for which the head of the Pentagon assigned a -certain role-, without specifying what exactly. This scenario obviously does not suit the US's European allies, and many of them immediately made it clear. Mark Rutte stated at the final press conference that the members of the Alliance are already holding consultations among themselves, including the USA. -As NATO, of course, we coordinate intensively. And I know that many allies and EU members are doing the same with Washington. And what we have been doing for the last 24 hours is that the clocks were ticking,- the NATO Secretary General added. At the same time, he emphasized that NATO's commitment to Ukraine's membership does not apply to future negotiations. Mark Rutte reminded that at the summit in Washington, NATO adopted commitments regarding Ukraine's future membership. -But there was never an agreement that whenever peace talks began, these peace talks would end - in any case and always - with NATO membership,- he explained. The head of EU diplomacy Kaya Callas, who was invited to the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council yesterday, reacted much harsher to the US statements. -Any agreement concluded without us will fail, because Europe and Ukraine are necessary to implement this agreement. Without us at the negotiating table, you can agree on anything, but it will all fail due to the lack of implementation,- she emphasized. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Europe should be involved in the negotiations, especially if the US expects European allies to play a peacekeeping role in any future deal. He emphasized that Putin should stop the attacks on Ukraine if he is really serious about negotiations. -It would be better if the US did not make concessions to Russia even before the start of negotiations,- the German minister added. Before leaving for Munich, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi made it clear that Ukraine will not accept the results of the negotiations if the USA and Russia conduct them themselves. -We simply will not be able to accept as an independent country any agreements without us. I articulate this very clearly to our partners. Any bilateral talks about Ukraine - I am not talking about other topics, here they are free - we will not accept any bilateral talks about Ukraine without us,- the head of state said. It is safe to say that today all discussions regarding potential negotiations will resume with renewed vigor in Munich. The Secretary General of NATO will meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyi and the US delegation, and the Ukrainian leader is also scheduled to meet with representatives of the US administration. The previous evening, Donald Trump announced that a meeting of high-ranking officials of the USA, Ukraine and Russia will be held in Germany. The Office of the President of Ukraine replied that negotiations with the Russians are not foreseen. -The Ukrainian position is unchanged. Ukraine should first talk with America, Europe should participate in any serious conversation. And only then an agreed joint position should be on the table for discussion with the Russians,- the OP said. Placement of peacekeepers in Ukraine may become one of the points of a potential agreement. The USA immediately ruled out sending its troops, shifting the responsibility to Europe. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, 100,000 military personnel are needed for the peacekeeping contingent. However, even before the meeting in Brussels at the beginning of this week, the Russians clearly demonstrated their attitude to the negotiations by launching another missile attack on Kyiv. Likewise, they continue daily assaults on Ukrainian positions at the front and bomb the houses of civilians. Meanwhile, Europe has obviously realized that it will have to rely much more on itself in defense matters and also take on the support of Ukraine. Great Britain has already held the first -Ramstein- under its leadership and announced an increase in military aid to Ukraine from 3 to 4.5 billion pounds. London is also preparing a major defense deal with the EU and could replace Washington amid continued pressure from the White House. All this shows that Europe is clearly aware of the Russian threat and is not going to leave Ukraine alone with the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/rezhym-ochikuvannya-yak-zayavy-donalda-trampa-vplynuly-na-zustrich-nato-i-do-chogo-gotuvatysya-ukrayini/	2025-02-13T20:35:26-08:00
Love at first sight -Kenobi- and -Acid-: about service in the Legion, annual injuries and the comman...	After all, they are both military professionals who never hid behind other people's backs during a brutal war with an insidious enemy. How to be able to speak without losing your mind when the monitor of the combat control point shows the burst of a 152-mm projectile at the place where your beloved was just performing a task? How do you keep your composure after reading a message that the father of your unborn son is injured and may not survive? How to go into battle, having more than one wound and many contusions, and most importantly, how to let a loved one go on a dangerous mission? Their path has never been simple or easy, but despite all the trials, they confidently look to the future and have no intention of backing down from their chosen goal, because they understand how much Ukraine needs them. - How was your first meeting? — Ian Kenobi: The Year 2022 Far Away. Kruglyakivka settlement. I was the commander of an infantry company in the Legion at the time. Anastasia just joined us, served at the medical station. The company commander injured his back and medics came to help him. Then we saw each other for the first time&#8230; — Anastasia -Acid-: When I first saw him, I immediately liked him - so manly, you know, serious. It was love at first sight&#8230; — How did you manage to combine relations with service in combat conditions? — Ian -Kenobi-: She was originally in the medical unit. Then I knew that her duties were limited to evacuating the wounded, providing aid and delivering to stabilization points and it was safe. But already, when I went to a higher position and became the deputy commander of the battalion, Anastasia was transferred to an infantry company. Then, I'll be honest, it was difficult for me at times. Especially when you are on the other side of the screen (video surveillance at the command post - author), and she is on a combat mission in the field at the time. There were a couple of situations that were simply heart-stopping. We immediately drew a clear line between relationships and tasks. There was no such thing as -you're not going there because you're my girlfriend.- There was a distribution of personnel: who, when, how and what tasks are performed. In Anastasia, it was mainly medical support of assault groups during missions, evacuation of the wounded directly from the battlefield and evacuation of dead soldiers, etc. I remember one such moment. I then lost the ability to speak literally somewhere for a minute of time. I watch how they evacuated the soldier, unfortunately, the deceased. She and another serviceman. They put him on a stretcher and began to tie him up. And at that moment I see: a large white spot appears on the entire screen. Arrival of a 152 mm projectile. It was literally a few meters away from them. I thought it was all over&#8230; — Anastasia -Acid-: We went to evacuate the soldier who died. All we had to do was take the body. I had such a partner who was funny, who moved very slowly behind me with these burdens. We did not take anything extra with us, no medical backpacks - only our first-aid kits, because we understood that the soldier could no longer be helped. He just had to be evacuated. There was a landing and an open area. He was right in that open area. Before this corpse, I had only seen the corpses of Russians who had been lying for a long time. And to come face to face with a dead person right after death was the first time. We squatted down, began to unfold the stretchers. And, by the way, these stretchers, I think, saved us. I cut the plate carrier. We were right above the ground when it hit. Everything happened very quickly: you turn around, there is some smoke. I look, -Zulu-, that's the callsign of that guy, he's already running. I think it's clear, so I have to run somewhere too. And then already on the radio station: -Some back! Come back!-&#8230; And then we turn around. From my side, it's always on adrenaline. And you don't think for what was thought on the other side of the screen. - Ian -Kenobi-: And then, literally in 30 seconds, the duty officer shouts, tries to communicate with them on the radio station. They answer. The weather helped us. Wet, mud around, so the projectile just buried itself in the ground. The main shock wave went up. They were very contused then. The fighter was evacuated and left. — Anastasia -Acid-: The first time he went on a combat mission, and we were not yet in a relationship, it was just the year of the large-scale invasion. He went out as a company commander with his guys, because they needed to raise morale. - Ian -Kenobi-: To put it simply, it was just the anniversary. It is February 24, 2023. And the guys were a little wary. They thought that now a mass attack of the enemy would begin or something else. We know, the enemy loves such significant dates and doing something bad on these days. Then I went out with the guys on a combat mission. On the way, we were fired upon with cluster munitions, a mortar caught us, then there was remote mining. But we got to the position, thank God. It's standard there: -nightmare- a little with resets. At that time, they were not yet very popular, but drones with ammunition drops were already working. The position itself was shelled. During the three days when we changed, the way back was also -fun-. Repeated remote mining, the route was changed four or five times during the advance to the exit point. All these remote mines started going off. A witty situation - already when we reached the exit point, an armored personnel carrier of friendly units passed by us. Apparently, the enemy decided to inflict fire damage on it. But this was a very bad decision for us - they wanted to -nightmare- the -beha- with an 82 mm mortar. It is not very effective against armored vehicles. Another thing is that we were walking along this road at that moment. Mine landed literally eight meters from me. But I was walking in the center of the formation, and the fighter who was walking first was probably two or three meters away from him. We were saved by the fact that there were tracks rolled by armored vehicles, it was winter and everything froze. We moved with a night vision device. They saw the flash and how the exit from the mortar takes place. At that moment, a nightlight dazzled. We turn our heads in that direction, we hear that it is starting to whistle. I give the command: -Lie down!- Foreigners understood this command. Because if I fall, everyone falls. Well, we just fall into this rut. I had an easy view from the track, I saw this mine land. On the one hand, it is scary, on the other hand, it is very beautiful. To see how the mine breaks, and on the ice such sparks go. The warrior who went first, to whom the closest distance was, runs to me and says: -Sir, my seals were knocked out by the shock wave.- I'm like, -Dude, let's get the hell out of here!- I'll send you to the hospital later, you'll get new ones.- — Anastasia -Acid-: I was already five to six months pregnant. And I just went on vacation and did not know that he went to war. I'm reading a message in the group: -Kenobi 300- and another guy. And then they convey that maybe -200-. And I am like that&#8230; (sigh - ed.). — Ian -Kenobi-: I didn't run much back then. I was more carried back&#8230; At the moment when the boys were pulling out, I thought more about the fact that the child would remain without me. This was really the most stressful for me at that moment (at this moment in the story, the son of Jan and Nastya, who was sleeping peacefully in the cradle, woke up and cried - ed.). — Anastasia -Acid-: I will say yes&#8230; I talked about this (injury - author) with him for a long time afterwards. — Ian -Kenobi-: A long time! That's it, don't cry! (cradles the baby - ed.). I'm around now. To be honest, the very first month of my son's life is very similar to being on duty at the command post. It's the same: you don't sleep, there's no time to eat, there's no time to take care of your personal affairs, even to wash yourself. Constantly screams, wants something from you, you can't understand what. Very similar work in the legion with foreigners, and just being on duty at the command post (smiles - author). — How many wounds did you have while repelling a large-scale invasion? — Ian -Kenobi-: Nastya has one wound and a hell of a lot of other injuries. — Anastasia -Acid-: Five concussions. - Ian -Kenobi-: I have three wounds during the period of the large-scale invasion. The extreme was the most serious. Yes, once a year is stable. I hope I can get by this year (smiles - ed.). — Anastasia -Acid-: By the way, when the 152 mm shell arrived, I was already pregnant. I just didn't know that. So the child should be given the status of a participant in hostilities (smiles - ed.). — Ian -Kenobi-: I already have at least three official reasons to resign from the Armed Forces. But I just can't leave the unit. I invested a lot of my energy in him. I literally shed my blood in this unit. And I have no intention of leaving him. — Anastasia -Acid-: We have discussed this more than once. But I saw him at work and I understand that I simply do not have the right and will not deprive Ukraine of a commander like him. And these are not just my words. When he thought he was going to leave the service because of his health, many people from our Bravo company wrote to me that they would not be able to trust anyone else the way they trusted him. Without him, this legion will be different. RS: People have different family photo albums. Yan and Anastasia's photo and video archive will definitely stand out. Life gave them little time for theaters, flowers, ice rinks or romantic walks. But there will be trophy rare weapons and equipment, captured prisoners and personally removed enemy flags in settlements freed from the invaders, shelling, battles and injuries, evacuation from the battlefield. Anastasia has retired from military service, but her soul is always with the Legion. When Yang, an outwardly intelligent, fit, thin young man of average height, enters the unit, many people immediately appear around him. The sincere respect and communication style of experienced, battle-hardened warriors from different countries of the world, often much older in age and stockier in stature, is visible to the naked eye. They are worth a lot and testify to a lot. One can only guess at what price and under what conditions such authority was gained and what an officer is capable of when he has to make a decision or act personally. To the question -What is the Legion for you?- Yan and Anastasia answered in one voice, without thinking: -Family, family-&#8230; You can learn more about the International Defense Legion of Ukraine on the official website https://ildu.mil.gov.ua/ Photo from the archive of Yan and Anastasia Volodymyr Patola for ArmiyaInform	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/kohannya-z-pershogo-poglyadu-kenobi-ta-acid-pro-sluzhbu-v-legioni-shhorichni-poranennya-ta-syna-komandyra-v-lyulczi/	2025-02-13T20:24:12-08:00
Changing the approach to combat operations: German machine builders offer ground drones to support t...	The manufacturing company on its official portal positions this line of ground drones as those designed to support the military in dangerous missions, difficult terrain and in adverse weather conditions, ArmiyaInform notes. According to the authors of the Dutch defense website Army Recognition, the Mission Master family of unmanned vehicles is famous for its versatility and state-of-the-art capabilities. These autonomous ground vehicles (A-UGVs) are designed to perform a variety of missions, ranging from reconnaissance and logistical support to medical evacuation, CBRN detection, use as signal relays and fire support. Their modular architecture allows for rapid configuration changes to suit specific mission requirements. Central to their functionality is the autonomy suite PATH, a navigation and operational control system that enables autonomous operation while retaining human oversight of any lethal functions. PATH maintains control over potentially lethal human functions in compliance with safety and ethical standards. This approach ensures that autonomous systems remain a reliable and secure tool in the hands of operators. The Mission Master family consists of three different models, each tailored to specific operational needs. The Mission Master SP is a compact and stealthy platform designed for missions where maneuverability and stealth are required. It is equipped with an electric propulsion system that ensures quiet operation and low visibility, making it ideal for reconnaissance operations or transporting small loads such as sensors and consumables. The minimal noise and environmental friendliness of this model make it irreplaceable in difficult operational scenarios. The Mission Master CXT is built for tougher operations and features a hybrid powertrain. This platform is distinguished by its strength, the ability to transport loads up to 1000 kg and work in extreme conditions. The CXT is suitable for logistics support tasks and can perform short silent operations thanks to its built-in battery system. Such characteristics allow CXT to be used in areas with harsh climatic conditions or difficult terrain. Mission Master XT is optimized for longer missions. With a maximum range of up to 750 km and the ability to overcome water obstacles, the XT offers exceptional autonomy and amphibious capabilities. This model supports the integration of heavy weapons and complex optical systems, which expands its application in combat conditions, increasing situational awareness and firepower. Autonomous UGV Mission Master platforms have already proven themselves as versatile and reliable systems, but their potential continues to grow. It is planned to integrate more complex sensor systems, improve artificial intelligence algorithms to increase autonomy and adaptability, as well as develop new modules that meet specific needs. Increasing energy efficiency and communication capabilities will also be prioritized to make A-UGVs even more practical in operations of varying complexity. The UGV Mission Master demonstrates how modern technologies can effectively combine autonomy, modularity and reliability, providing new opportunities for military and civilian missions, reaching hard-to-reach places.

SZCH, studio -Krylya- and unidentified actors: new cinema from Moscow fakers	In fact, this incident has no corroboration. The filming is done in such a way that it is impossible to identify the place and the actors, and people behave unnaturally, so the video has all the signs of being staged. Even last year, the Center for Countering Disinformation of the NSDC found out the source of such fake videos, which are distributed exclusively by propaganda resources of the Russian Federation. -Krylya studio, which is connected to the Russian Ministry of Defense, is involved in the production of fake videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel on the front lines, in the trenches. Contractors related to Novorossiya TV are also working on such videos, and infrastructure acceleration is provided by agencies working with the Russian Federation,- says the head of the CSDP of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko. The purpose of such fakes is to discredit and demoralize the Armed Forces of Ukraine, so they should not be trusted.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/szch-studiya-krylya-ta-neidentyfikovani-dijovi-osoby-nove-kino-vid-moskovskyh-fejkorobiv/	2025-02-13T20:03:17-08:00

Instead of looking for missing budgets for repairs, the occupation administration turned to Moscow for help. They are not only asking for funding, but also demanding to send emergency teams - because there are almost no qualified workers left. The reason is simple: due to forced mobilization, Luhansk lost most of its specialists, and now virtually no one can work in the communal sector. Restrictions on freedom of movement are added to infrastructural problems. The occupying forces blocked civilian traffic on the highway between the front-line Rubizhnye and the relatively rear-facing Starobilsk, citing the -security situation.- At the same time, the Russian military themselves continue to use this road without hindrance. Now local residents have to choose an even more dangerous route, which runs close to the battle line. Destruction, chaos and lack of responsibility are the realities of the temporarily occupied Luhansk Region. And while the invaders cover their own failure with loud statements, the city literally sinks into a sewage crisis. As reported by ArmyInform, the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk continue to plunge into chaos and degradation.

Secrets of survival from marine special forces: a first aid kit is always at hand, even underwater	This was reported on the center's page. The combat medic of the 73rd SSO center, -The Spaniard-, said that in their group, all the first-aid kits are located behind on the warbelt, the unloading belt. This location is very convenient, because it does not interfere with the manipulation of the weapon and is always within quick access. If necessary, the fighter can get the first-aid kit himself or his comrade can do it. The first-aid kits are quick-release, and the combat medic of the group deals with their collection. However, before each operation, the composition of the first-aid kit can be adjusted depending on the situation. Usually, medics add more essentials - decompression needles, tamponades, etc. - so that in the event of losing the medical pack, the fighter has a larger supply of aid. Turnstiles are always located in a prominent place - at least four for yourself and a few more for your companions. The most important thing for every fighter is to regularly check his first aid kit: whether the products have lost their airtight packaging, whether something has spoiled, or whether the expiration date has expired. The medic also checks the first-aid kits before each combat mission, but the fighters themselves must control this moment. In some cases, when there is a probability of a large number of wounded, fighters can take two individual first-aid kits with them. One is located on the belt, and the other is in another place. This is done to help the medic and wounded comrades. However, the second first-aid kit is taken only for specific combat tasks. As reported by ArmyInform, in modern combat, where it is often necessary to operate in conditions of limited visibility, a flashlight on a weapon is a critical piece of gear. Operators from the 73rd Naval Special Purpose Center shared their experiences using different types of lights and their importance to operational success.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/sekrety-vyzhyvannya-vid-morskyh-speczpryznachencziv-aptechka-zavzhdy-pid-rukoyu-navit-pid-vodoyu/	2025-02-13T10:11:39-08:00
-Tactical crutch- became the last hope of the lame occupant to be saved from the FPV drone	A rather interesting example in this sense was shared on social media by the drones of the 77th separate airmobile Naddniep brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the footage they published, you can see a lone Russian occupier limping somewhere on two crutches when he suddenly notices the approach of an FPV drone that has clearly targeted him. At the same time, the Russian invader, of course, did not have any weapons with which he could try to shoot down the quadcopter while in flight, or even more so an electronic warfare device to -silence- it. Realizing that he would not be able to escape or hide either, the Kremlin's -cannon fodder- faced such desperation that he tried to shoot down the FPV drone with one of his -tactical crutches-. You can evaluate the result of this approach on the video. Russian soldier of the Special Needs Forces was treated by an FPV drone of the 77th Airmobile Brigade. The Russian command spares no one.

US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth said this at a briefing in Brussels, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports. Pete Hegseth recalled that Donald Trump called both presidents on the same day earlier this week. -Any negotiations that are held will be held with both.

--Emka- is a rocket, but they break it all the same-: a frank story of a mechanic-driver about milit...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -When I joined the 32nd brigade, they asked if it was interesting to ride on the M113 tracked armored personnel carrier. I agreed,- Vitaly says. At first he was a gunner, and then, after the mechanic was injured, he took his place. -Emka- in control is a rocket. But they break them all the same. There are still no cars that don't break through,- he adds. One of the most vivid episodes shared by Vitaliy took place near Kotlyny. Then his APC was destroyed, but luckily everyone survived. -I'm just leveling up with this -beater- - arrival. The car is full of smoke, everyone is crazy. You feel in your gut that everything. I check myself, my legs are moving - that means I'm alive,- he recalls. After this incident, Vitaliy and his comrades successfully evacuated, although mortar shelling from behind -caught up- with them. Vitaly is the father of two children, and in his civilian life he was a repair mechanic. -I worked at a shoe factory for 15 years. He took care of the technical condition of conveyors and sewing machines. I don't care what nuts to twist,- he says about himself. Now he is the head of REBs and drives American MaxxPro armored vehicles. -The boys were traveling from Pokrovsk, so the FPV with the -zucchini- flew like half a bucket into the lobeshnik. The car flipped over on its side, it is clear that it no longer had controllability, but inside there are all the targets, both mechs and landing gear,- Vitaliy shares his observations about American equipment. In his crew, Vitaly and his gunner-operator are interchangeable professionals. -When I sit in the gunner's seat, I help the infantry to throw out the bags during the landing. I work on the lever of the apparatus, because it is not convenient for me to move. In MilChat, I control the road so as not to drive into p@#$rasiv. Mekhan only steers with the steering wheel, and I tap him on the left shoulder if he needs to turn left,- Vitaliy says about his work in the crew. To be a good mechanic, you need to know your car well. -Don't catch the gav until someone does it, because some people there are used to the fact that fixers have to come from the repair company. No, I went myself, checked the tracks, tightened them properly. So that the machine, as it should be, immediately -jiked- and flew away. This is important,- Vitaly shares his experience. As reported by ArmyInform, war blurs the boundaries between people, changes destinies, destroys and at the same time creates something new. Ian -Kenobi-, commander of the 1st International Legion, and Anastasia, a combat medic, found each other in the midst of hostilities. Their story is one of struggle, loss and a love tempered by war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/emka-raketa-ale-rozbyvayut-vse-odno-vidverta-rozpovid-mehanika-vodiya-pro-vijskovi-budni/	2025-02-13T08:47:50-08:00
NATO Secretary General: We cannot allow Putin to win	He said this at the results of the ministerial meeting in Brussels, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform reports. -All members of the Alliance and Ukraine are united in their desire for peace in Ukraine. We all agree that we should put Ukraine in the strongest position for negotiations. And we need a strong, lasting peace, not Minsk-3. We cannot allow President Putin to win,- Mark Rutte said. Today, the members of the Alliance also met with representatives of Ukraine at the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council, which was joined by the High Representative of the EU Kaya Kallas. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, informed the members of the Alliance about the latest events at the front. -We discussed the importance of our continued support to Ukraine. Which is crucial to bringing this brutal war of aggression to a just and lasting end. And we discussed the need for the European members of the Alliance and Canada to do even more,- Mark Rutte said. He added that in 2024, NATO members provided Ukraine with more than 50 billion euros in security assistance — almost 60% of this amount came from Europe and Canada. -Both yesterday and today the members of the Alliance announced new packages of military support. This will help Ukraine in its struggle today and the development of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the long term. We had an honest and frank discussion between ourselves and with Ukraine. And we end our meetings with a clear sense of purpose, commitment and urgency,- Mark Rutte concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/gensek-nato-my-ne-mozhemo-dozvolyty-putinu-peremogty/	2025-02-13T08:38:51-08:00
-Each of our departures brings benefits-: the story of the chief sergeant of the UAV platoon	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. With the beginning of a full-scale invasion, Nazar joined the territorial defense, although he was not yet eligible for mobilization due to his age. There, he got his first experience with drones, striking enemy shelters. Later, when the commander changed in the unit, many fighters began to transfer to other units. Nazar, knowing about the combat effectiveness of the 128th OGSHBr, decided to transfer there. -I immediately wanted to serve in a combat brigade, but at that time only those with combat experience were hired. I gained the necessary skills in ground defense, and now I work with FPV drones already in the 128th brigade. Our attacks destroy enemy antennas and fortifications, which seriously affects the combat capability of the occupiers,- says Nazar. One of the key aspects of the new service for the military has become adequate command, which not only sets combat tasks, but also helps develop professional skills. -If something doesn't work out, no one here will insult you. On the contrary, they will explain and help correct mistakes. It motivates and gives confidence,- says the fighter. His wife and two sons are waiting for his return in Vinnytsia. The youngest was born already during the war, and the eldest, who is four and a half years old, believes that his father is -fighting zombies.- -It's difficult for him - he sees that dads come to the kindergarten to pick up other children. I communicate with my family via video, but it is no substitute for face-to-face communication. The most difficult thing in this war is separation from family,- the soldier admits. Despite everything, Nazar and his comrades remain on the front lines because they understand that Ukraine's success in the war depends on their work. -Each of our sorties is beneficial - if not destroying the enemy, then at least damaging their logistics. It adds strength.'' As reported by ArmyInform, when the combat medic of the -Rubizh- Brigade with the call sign -Sam- decided to go to the front, he had a choice - to stay in a civilian job thanks to -armor- or to defend the country. He chose the second and not only became a combat medic, but also set a unit record for destroying enemy armored vehicles. On his account includes five destroyed vehicles along with the landing party.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/kozhen-nash-vyyizd-prynosyt-koryst-istoriya-golovnogo-serzhanta-vzvodu-bpla/	2025-02-13T08:32:23-08:00

The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The warrior went through many hot spots of the war: the defense of Kharkiv, the liberation of the region, battles for Bakhmut, border skirmishes in Sumshchyna. However, the battle in the Zaporozhye direction, near the Chereshnya observation point, is most vividly etched in my memory. That day, Klim spotted an armored infantry vehicle approaching his trench. Five enemy paratroopers were sitting on the armor. He lay in wait, waiting for the right moment. The car stopped five meters away, the paratroopers got out and started moving, unaware of the danger. -As soon as the BMP began to leave, I realized that there would be no machine gun cover. I shot down two or three with a machine gun, they were lying down. Then I threw ``efka'' into the pile. From the fierce, hateful cries, it was clear that I still touched the trio. The guys covered me from behind with machine gun fire and we dealt with him in almost a minute or a half. At that time, the BMP was running at full throttle,- Klim recalled. Before the war, -Klim- lived a peaceful life: he built, repaired shoes, took care of the dacha. -Valery dreams of taking up his favorite work again, leaving the war in the past.

-Shelters- failed: the drones of the Iron Brigade found an enemy tank and deleted it from the game	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. At the forefront of today's chronicle is the Crazy Cats group of the rifle battalion. Their FPV drones sent the enemy into the scrap -Ural- with frontal strikes, destroyed the antenna complex and blew up the mortar. Border guards are not far behind: kamikaze drones destroy a grader engaged for engineering work and a 122-mm D-30 howitzer. Each such blow not only reduces the enemy's potential, but also brings victory closer. But the real gem of this combat selection is the work of the Flint crew from the Control and Artillery Reconnaissance Battery (BUAR). They managed to find and destroy a carefully camouflaged tank. A powerful charge turned the occupants' armored car into a pile of scrap metal. The 3rd Tank Iron Brigade does not give the enemy a chance.

From the keyboard to the gun: how the Aitivite -Apostol- became a threat to the Russian invaders	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Mykhailo served in the army in 2018-2019, and after the full-scale Russian invasion, he took up arms again. Having an officer rank after the military department, he was trained as a platoon leader, and later became an artilleryman. Since the spring of 2023, Mykhailo has been serving in the 58th motorized infantry brigade, where he first worked with the Soviet D-20 guns, and then mastered the British AS-90 self-propelled gun. -I saw the world a little, because we were taught in Great Britain, at the Royal School of Artillery,- Mykhailo says. — The Allies wanted us to be versatile, able to work both as mechanics-drivers and as gunners, to know the basics of repairing equipment. This helped a lot in a real combat environment. Because there were times when up to 100 shells were fired a day. British guns are more accurate, easier to aim, a lot of automation.- Thanks to the work of -Apostol- and its brothers, enemy columns, Russian tanks and other armored vehicles were hit, enemy positions and manpower were destroyed. The range of ammunition for British guns allows for a wide range of combat missions. -In addition to destroying identified targets on command, our main task is to protect the infantry. Do not let the enemy get close to our brothers. Only the drones see the advance of the enemy or the assault, we open fire to eliminate the invaders while they are on the way. That's how we worked at one time near Urozhany, and then near Prechistivka, in Donbas,- says the officer. At home, Mykhailo's parents and sister are waiting. After the war, he dreams of returning to a peaceful profession and starting a family. But it will be after the victory, when the guns die down. As reported by ArmyInform, on the front line, where every day there is a fierce struggle for every meter of Ukrainian land, fighters of the 21st separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine use unexpected weapons against modern enemies drones - Maksym machine gun, developed back in the 19th century.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/vid-klaviatury-do-garmaty-yak-ajtishnyk-apostol-stav-grozoyu-rosijskyh-okupantiv/	2025-02-13T05:32:04-08:00

Fighters, who are called -bombers- on the front lines, demonstrated the filigree operation of attack drones. The occupiers were simply knocked out of their hiding places: FPV drones methodically hit dugouts, trenches and even so-called foxholes - small earthen shelters where the enemy tried to wait out the attacks. However, it was not possible to wait - Ukrainian drones found everyone. The footage released by the military shows Russian fortifications turning into fire traps. The occupiers tried to hide, but they could not escape from the highly accurate Ukrainian -bird-.

Ukrainian veteran won bronze at the Invincible Games in skeleton	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ilya Hayduk covered the distance in 32.67 seconds, demonstrating great skill and strength of spirit. This victory is especially important, because Ilya is a military man who, despite being wounded, found the strength to move on and achieve success in sports. Ilya Hayduk is a 34-year-old serviceman of the 36th Brigade. Before the war, he served in the police and took the Murphy test every year. During a full-scale invasion, he transferred to the Armed Forces, where he was assigned to a company of strike unmanned aerial systems. In November 2023, while performing a combat mission in the Zaporizhzhia region, he was wounded and lost his leg. At the Invincible Games, Ilya again felt lightness and enjoyment of life. Loves adrenaline and believes that the veteran community is very important for an active post-war life. Skeleton is a sport most likely invented by the British military in the late 19th century. This is a sled race, when athletes move along the track head first, maneuvering between turns. Participants must overcome not only the distance, but also their own fear. This year, the skeleton is featured for the first time at the Invincible Games. We are proud of Ilya Hayduk and all Ukrainian military and veterans who, despite being wounded, found the strength to move on! As ArmiyaInform reported, a skeleton was presented for the first time at the Invincible Games 2025, and Ukrainian veterans and military could not miss this opportunity.

Three days in hell on the Dnipro: the confession of a combat medic -Cossack- about an extremely diff...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -I never thought that I would have to crawl over corpses, that I would have another person's brains on my beard, that all my armor would be covered in blood,- says -Cossack.- His words are not just scary details, but the reality of the war that Ukrainian defenders face. The operation on the island was a turning point for him. He already had combat experience - he served as a senior medic of a mortar battery, provided assistance to units' fighters, and detected enemy equipment. But what he experienced on the left bank of the Dnieper was beyond anything that could be imagined. Since the beginning of the assault, the enemy has destroyed up to 20 of his fighters, but Ukrainian units have also suffered losses. The wounded were taken to the island, which quickly became a priority target for the occupiers. At night, the Russians started a massive fire, turning a small patch of land into an inferno. -You're walking through the swamp, debris is flying at you, you're covered in blood, you don't even count the contusions- Among the wounded is a boy who has no life left. In the abdominal cavity there are fragments with which I cut my fingers to the bone, trying to stop his bleeding,- recalls -Cossack-. At a critical moment, it is important not only to save, but also to manage chaos. -Cossack- remembers how he shouted at the wounded and shocked soldiers, forcing them to act. It was the only way to survive. One of the most difficult tasks was to find and extract a wounded comrade nicknamed -Psycho-. When he was being pulled out, another flight happened. -I pressed myself against him, and then I realized that I had his brains on my beard- - recalls the fighter. The -psycho- survived, but when he regained consciousness, he tried to tear off the breathing tube. Then -Cossack- had to tape his hands. Later, in the hospital, he apologized to his friend, although he probably owed him his life. After the evacuation of the wounded and a series of logistical operations, it was time for the -Cossack- itself to leave the island. He remembers that moment with trepidation: -When I stepped on the asphalt of the right bank with my bare feet, I felt such relief that words cannot express it.- Today, -Cossack- not only continues to serve, but also transfers his experience to young fighters. His main rule is to train every day, challenge yourself and never stop. This is how the legendary marines who are making history right now are hardened. As reported by ArmyInform, a junior sergeant with the call sign -Katran- is an example of dedication and professionalism in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. holds the position of commander of the guard company branch of the 15th separate marine support regiment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/try-dni-v-pekli-na-dnipri-spovid-bojovogo-medyka-kozaka-pro-nadskladnu-operacziyu/	2025-02-13T04:37:55-08:00

- Barrels are also timeless - the Armed Forces explained why the occupiers began to use artillery le...	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the air of the Yedyny Novyni telethon. -Fighting continues near Toretsk, as before. The problem is that we report on the results of battles when there is already a certain consolidation and a certain stabilization of the line on which it is happening. We can say something only when we are already convinced that there is confirmation,- he assured. According to him, the enemy has not changed the intensity of the use of armored vehicles. -If we talk about equipment in other directions, its use is reduced not so much because of weather conditions. The earth was already frozen. The point is rather that it was limited by the use of FPV drones, it was limited by the effective countermeasures of Ukrainian locations. Therefore, we do not observe any serious increase in the use of heavy equipment,- he explained. Viktor Tregubov said that the occupiers cross the Oskil River in small groups that can fit in a boat. -They move as much as a normal rubber boat can fit. They are also crossed by small watercraft. As long as the river does not freeze over, they can only do so. Therefore, they are limited by the number of seats in those plazas that are directly there,- he noted. Also, the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV said that the Russian troops began to use artillery less in certain directions. -Where there are certain supply problems, there are fewer of them. Supply problems also create strikes by Ukrainian forces. This is no longer our area of ​​responsibility, but when their warehouses begin to blow up or even explode something on the territory of the Russian Federation, it negatively affects the supply of ammunition. Trunks are also eternal,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy has recently been trying to look for weak spots in our defense in the Novopavlov direction. Attack mainly in small infantry groups. In addition, the weather makes it possible for both Ukrainian and enemy unmanned systems to work.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/stvoly-tezh-ne-vichni-okupanty-pochaly-menshe-vykorystovuvaty-artyleriyu/	2025-02-13T03:13:06-08:00

As noted, the detainee was an accomplice of previously detained FSB agents who were planning to blow up the police outfit. -The perpetrator turned out to be a 16-year-old local resident who was recruited by a Russian special agent on the Telegram channel.

According to the minister, the search for additional funding to cover urgent military needs remains an important task, but Ukraine is open to the mutual development of defense industries and will promote cooperation between Norwegian and domestic companies. -He thanked Norway for the significant support of Ukraine and leadership in the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. We count on further active cooperation and I am sure that Ukraine will also be a reliable partner for our Norwegian friends,- added the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/rustem-umyerov-zustrivsya-z-glavoyu-minoborony-norvegiyi-golovni-pytannya-osnashhennya-pivnichnoyi-brygady-ta-ppo/	2025-02-13T00:43:38-08:00

He told about this on Thursday, February 13, on his Facebook. -An important direction is the supply of heavy armored vehicles. Poland supplied Ukraine with a significant amount of armored vehicles, so they discussed its more active participation in the work of the Coalition of Armored Vehicles and Maneuverability. Our soldiers are counting on the help of the brotherly state,- the minister said. In addition, the parties separately focused on logistics issues, since, as Rustem Umyerov emphasized, -maintenance and repair of equipment must be fast, so that combat vehicles can be promptly returned to the battlefield.- The prospects of joint defense projects in four key directions were also considered: -Poland is interested in the development of industrial cooperation and understands the strategic importance of Ukraine for the localization of production. I count on Mr. Vladyslav's support and constructive solutions. Poland has been with us since the first days of the full-scale invasion, and we are grateful for that support. We must continue to move forward,- added the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, Rustem Umyerov met in Brussels with the Minister of Defense of Belgium, Theo Franken, and discussed with him the strengthening of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/glava-minoborony-ukrayiny-obgovoryv-z-polskym-kolegoyu-postachannya-vazhkoyi-bronetehniky/	2025-02-13T00:00:30-08:00

How to destroy an enemy mortar attack with three shots: a master class from the commander of the sel...	Is it possible to hit an enemy tank with a 2C1 self-propelled gun? But who are the main targets for our gunners today? The military man told our correspondent about this: -Now, as in 2015, I work for the 2C1 Gvozdika self-propelled guns.- In 2022, he even got into the same battery he was in during the anti-terrorist operation. 2С1 is a Soviet self-propelled artillery system of 122 caliber. In principle, it is quite accurate, considering that there are now drones that provide the ability to adjust fire. This ACS shows itself well. If the ammunition is normal, you can even hit the target area with the third shot. The system is effective for destroying manpower, mortars, lightly armored targets. We mainly work on infantry, enemy mortars. All guidance in Soviet systems is the same, if you once learned, then everything there is more or less similar, you will be able to work on 2C1 as well. Of course, there are nuances. But, in principle, every weapon, every artillery system likes to be serviced after a certain number of shots. -Clove-, in my opinion, is more reliable. It can be compared with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, because it is also not very picky. &#8230;I can remember how we recently destroyed an enemy mortar. We received the command -to battle-. They set up, we aimed, fired. It so happened that we hit this enemy mortar with several shots. It seems somewhere in the three, and that's a very good result. We then destroyed the mortar, the ammunition and the Russians included in the calculation. In fact, the precision of our work is the result of efforts not only of our calculation. Because we are only one of the final chains of this process. It is very important who corrects us. These are our UAV operators. Then they quickly detected this mortar, gave the coordinates. So if everyone did their job well, then the result is good. By the way, if we compare with 2014-15, then there were not so many drones. And there was no such precision. Then we worked harder to cover the defined plane. Now due to the technologies that have moved forward, a bet is placed on accuracy. There were other episodes with hits. If we recall Mykolaiv Oblast and Kherson Oblast in 2022, there was even a time when a tank was hit. Now the enemy does not have so much equipment. And then there was, and they simply dug it in from landings: BMP, tanks. And they didn't worry about them that much. We could hit a buried BMP in the landing, and then the next day the enemy would bury another one next to it. And it turns out that there is one burnt one, and a new one is already in the hood next to it. Now they don't have such stocks of equipment anymore, they are saving. Therefore, our main targets now are infantry, mortars. &#8230;The commander of Maksym told our correspondent about the case when the calculation of his subordinate hit a moving enemy BMP. The commander added that Maxim has a lot of experience as an artilleryman: he has more than two thousand shots under his belt.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/yak-znyshhyty-minometnyj-rozrahunok-voroga-z-troh-postriliv-majsterklas-vid-komandyra-sau-gvozdyka/	2025-02-12T20:57:59-08:00
Battalion -Predators of height-: reconnaissance at 50 km, night bombers and records of defeating the...	What is the secret of success of this battalion, due to which it is possible to destroy Russian targets, what is the daily record for defeating enemy attack aircraft, about the specifics of combat missions and the specifics of the operation of the unmanned aviation component, which bombers is the enemy most afraid of and whether the invisibility cloaks save the occupiers near Pokrovsk, the commander of the -Predators of Heights- battalion, Major Maxim with the call sign, told ArmyInform -Condor-. Maxim from Vinnytsia, a teacher by education. Since 2016, he has been serving in the 59th brigade, he joined the unit as an ordinary soldier. Sociable and charismatic commander. He graduated from the leadership course at the National Academy of Ground Forces in Lviv and received the rank of officer. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the brigade repelled the offensive of the occupiers in the south of Ukraine. In August 2022, he headed the first infantry battalion of the brigade, which he had formed before that. He has a huge experience in the destruction of rasches in Kherson region, Luhansk region, and now also in Donetsk region. Since September of last year, the command of the brigade offered to lead the battalion of unmanned systems -Predators of Heights-. The performance indicators of this unit are simply amazing. -In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, a rating is conducted on the impact of Russian manpower, military equipment and other enemy targets. This is what specifically applies to UAV damage. Points are awarded there for all destroyed (hit) Russian targets. These points can then be exchanged for different weapons. In addition, it is a good indicator of the work of the units of the Armed Forces. It is not for nothing that for the fourth month in a row, our brigade has taken the leading position in this rating in terms of the number of enemy personnel affected. In January alone, our military eliminated 2,667 occupiers, of which 1,230 were irreparable losses, and 1,437 were wounded. As for the combat work of the -Height Predators- battalion, the numbers of destruction (damage) of various enemy targets speak for themselves. So, about the statistics from January 1, 2024 to February 1, 2025. This is the current data, see for yourself - hit/destroyed: Figures are constantly updated, they can be viewed on the website of the battalion. We like to be tops, this is our job, we stop and destroy the enemy. We go to the command post of the battalion of unmanned systems -Predators of Heights-. The point itself consists of several rooms, workplaces are equipped with large monitors with computers and tablets. There are live video broadcasts from different areas of the line of battle and the depth of the enemy formations. Enhanced aerial reconnaissance is conducted by various reconnaissance UAVs for enemy activity. Absolutely all information about the movement of Russian troops, for example, small assault groups on the front line and the identified targets of the Rashists: shelters, fortifications, KSP, field warehouses, placement of enemy equipment, flows here. Those on duty accumulate all the information and report to the command. Hot targets are identified that must be destroyed immediately. Then the coordinates are transmitted to the attack drone units. The -Altitude Predators- unmanned systems battalion combines two components: the use of unmanned aerial systems and ground robotic systems. This makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of combat missions and preserve the lives of personnel. UAV units carry out aerial reconnaissance and attack the enemy. In terms of reconnaissance functions, there are various UAVs that are engaged in this. These are primarily -Maviks- and -wings- of various ranges. What are our intelligence capabilities? We can close a lane from zero to 50 km deep into enemy territory. If desired, even a little more. That is, different UAVs for different flight ranges. We fly up to 5 km on Maviks, if we need 10 km, we use Autels and the same Maviks, only with a paired battery. If we need to work even further and the weather allows us, we use different types of -wings-. There are -wings- that can fly up to 15 km, and there are those that can fly up to 50 km and even further. The complex application of various reconnaissance UAVs gives a complete picture of informing about the actions of the enemy in our area of ​​responsibility. With up-to-date streams, we can react quickly and destroy the targets of the raiders. We -unwind- the Russians with attack drones of various types with different combat capabilities. These are FPV drones that work as kamikaze drones and drop drones, Maviks with a warhead, heavy large bombers such as Nemesis and Vampires plus shock -wings-. According to the reaction of the Rashists, the enemy is most afraid of large bombers such as Nemesis and -Vampires-. With these bombers, we can effectively destroy enemy equipment up to 20 km or more. Bomber drones can drop different types of munitions on the enemy: thermobaric, cumulative and high-explosive munitions to effectively hit different types of targets. Just last night, our Nemesis and Vampire calculations were hit by two Russian 152mm self-propelled artillery pieces. At the same time, the Russian equipment was on the move, moving quite quickly. They were hit while moving, the equipment stopped and it was already finished on the spot. On the same night, it was also possible to burn a tank and three enemy cars, one of the cars was destroyed on the move. The distance to the enemy targets was approximately 12-15 km from the contact line. The drones struck and returned successfully. Our tactics are simple: we find a target, determine its priority, think about which drones to destroy faster and more efficiently, and take off. There are goals that are nearby and need to be worked on immediately. Depending on the distance, features of the terrain, weather conditions and the goals themselves, we mostly use FPV drones. If the target, such as a stationary one, is far from the front and is well camouflaged, we use other strike UAVs. It is not always possible to destroy equipment with -fpvishkas-, then more powerful means of destruction are needed. If targets are detected at a distance of 50 km or more, then we transmit the coordinates to neighboring units equipped with HIMARS. Recently, our -wing- 35 km from the front line detected the calculation of an enemy UAV, perhaps it was an Orlan-10 complex or a Supercam. The location coordinates were quickly reset and the HIMARS calculation did its job. Our brigade has been carrying out combat missions in the Donetsk direction since November 2022. In principle, here the enemy constantly tried to act actively. Now, already here in the Pokrovsky direction, he continues offensive actions with the involvement of a very large number of infantry. Involves heavy machinery when possible, but very rarely lately. And it is mostly non-armored vehicles: motorcycles, buggies, pickups, UAZs and -loaves-. Large armor can be seen far away, it can be heard, it can be detected faster and, accordingly, there is more time for its damage. But these are quiet and small machines, they are used en masse. They are not particularly visible, they are more mobile and maneuverable. And rashists often use this easy technique just in one direction. The assault group arrived, disembarked and left the car there. Combat work to detect and destroy enemy assault groups is very energy-intensive and intensive. There are a lot of stormtroopers coming from different directions, so all of them must be identified and destroyed. So that you understand, we had such difficult days when, in just one day, we destroyed more than 100 Russian soldiers who were advancing near Pokrovsk with the means of destruction of the -Predators of the Heights- battalion. Rashists were killed with FPV drones, Maviks and other drones. About 80 Rashists were dying on the spot from our blows, others were bleeding for some time. The absolute record of -Predators of the Heights- for a day for the destruction of enemy manpower was at the end of November at the beginning of December. Then 117 raschits lay forever in the Ukrainian soil. In general, if you take the means of destruction of the entire 59th brigade: it is infantry, tanks, artillery plus our battalion, then usually during one day it is possible to destroy more than 200 invaders. Enemy assaults do not stop for a single day. If once stormtroopers moved along forest plantations, attacked key intersections, now they go straight across the field in groups of 8-10. The enemy also learns and understands what points in the area are being scouted, so he tries to act more cunningly and bypass them. Especially often they move in the fog or in the morning, after a while large groups break up into several people and want to bypass our infantry positions. Do not come into fire contact, expecting that new forces will come up and it will be possible to take our infantry into the encirclement. Of course, we will not let the enemy do this. The main thing is to detect the movement of assault groups in time, then drone calculations are connected and inflict damage on the enemy. Infantry units of the Russian Federation are being depleted very quickly, new ones are coming. And so we work monotonously every day. Assault teams have now begun to use anti-thermal imaging cloaks or invisibility cloaks. Let's put it this way, they give a certain effect. When the weather is not very good, the raschits are not so far visible, but they can still be seen by their characteristic features. For example, kamikaze raiders walk across the field at night, hear our drone flying somewhere, immediately lie down on the ground, completely cover themselves with these cloaks, do not move and think that no one has -besieged- them. A few nights ago, our calculations of fpvish, Maviks, Vampires and Nemesis dismantled 30 of these stormtroopers in a 1 km area. Vampire and Nemesis heavy bomber drones are formidable and effective weapons. There are, of course, certain differences between them in combat capabilities and characteristics. These are means of different damage ranges. If the -Vampire- works up to 10 km, then the Nemesis up to 20 km and more. -Vampire- covers a distance of up to 10 km in 23 minutes with a 10 kg reset weight. If it is necessary to carry a warhead over a long distance, then a slightly smaller ammunition is attached to it. In good weather, we can hit equipment and other enemy targets at a distance of up to 30 km. These two bomber drones are particularly effective at night. It is not for nothing that the Katsaps set up observation mobile guard posts in places of deployment, for example, armored vehicles or warehouses with ammunition. These posts at night are supposed to neutralize heavy bombers so that they do not reach their targets. Similar to how our mobile fire groups work on -Shahedam-. Rashists usually use small arms. -Baba Yaga-, as the occupiers call them, is quite noisy at work, so it can be heard from afar. At the front, the enemy constantly uses EW means. Starting from tiny devices in the backpacks of Russian attack aircraft and ending with operational-level EWs located at a depth of 20-30 km from the front edge. Work on their detection is carried out around the clock. We make special maps with the routes of the location of EWs of the occupiers, bypass in the air the zones of their radius of action. Ideally, we find and destroy these means, because they affect the operation of our drones. The enemy is improving and every time it is more difficult to fight the enemy. But we are also developing strongly, we are looking for new ways and methods of combating the EW means of the Russians. In different directions, the enemy uses different means of countering the work of our reconnaissance and strike drones. For example, when we were defending in Krasnohorivka, the Rashists tried to block with their -maviks-. They just dropped an ordinary fishing net on our bomber, then the blades spin and it falls to the ground. I once remember a case when the enemy dropped a net on the -Vampire- a little unsuccessfully, but then the drone's blades did not stop, it successfully hit the target and turned back. FPV drones with thermal imaging are often used to attack our bombers. As this happens, enemy infantrymen report that they have been detected and hear the operation of a Ukrainian bomber drone. Immediately, an enemy -fpvishka- flies out, which should already find and hit our drone. But, usually, when it arrives, the rockets are destroyed and the bomber is no longer in place. Even with a light -Mavik- they went for a battering ram, but nothing came out of them. Our pilots skillfully maneuvered and got out of the attack. From my own experience and combat experience, I can say that the most skilled UAV pilots of various types are our infantrymen who performed combat missions on the front line. We have a lot of guys who have been drafted into the army since 2014 and those who have participated in assault operations since the first days of the large-scale invasion. These are people from different regions of Ukraine, teachers, businessmen, IT specialists, people of other peaceful professions. The guys are united by a single goal - to destroy the enemy and drive them out of our land. Someone was transferred to the -Height Predators- battalion due to their health, someone of their own volition, someone was recently called up for mobilization. No one is better at piloting a drone than a person who understands what it's like to be an infantryman in the trenches and how difficult it is to be there and perform tasks under enemy fire. The infantryman-pilot perfectly understands how to do so in order to save his comrades in -SPeshki- when they are attacked by the invaders. He understands the enemy, how he will act. Of course, anyone can become a strong drone operator, the main thing is the desire to learn.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/bataljon-hyzhaky-vysot-rozvidka-na-50-km-nichni-bombery-ta-rekordy-urazhennya-voroga-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-02-12T20:44:20-08:00
New military aid and tough statements by the Pentagon: what Ramstein was like for Ukraine in Brussel...	This meeting was expected primarily because of the arrival of the new head of the Pentagon, who was supposed to outline the future attitude of the US to this format and to the provision of security assistance to Ukraine in general. What agreements did yesterday's meeting bring and whether the format of -Ramstein- will change - read more in the material of the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Unlike most previous Ramsteins, which took place at a German airbase, yesterday's meeting took place at NATO headquarters. It was decided to combine it with the ministerial meeting of the Alliance in the Belgian capital. Another peculiarity was the presiding of Great Britain — for the first time in almost three years, Rammstein was not presided over by the United States. According to interlocutors in Brussels, London itself initiated such a decision due to the arrival of the new administration of US President Donald Trump and the related uncertainty regarding the future fate of this format. And it was Britain that announced the largest aid package at the end of the meeting. It should also be recalled that the previous -Ramstein- was only a month ago and yesterday's meeting was primarily not about new aid packages, but about coordinating work in the future. The new head of the Pentagon, Pete Gegset, saw with his own eyes how Rammstein works, heard about the needs of the Ukrainian army and for the first time met with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. Pete Hegseth also spoke at the beginning of Rammstein with a statement that contained a number of harsh messages and caused a heated debate. The main message of the head of the Pentagon was unequivocal — European allies should increase defense spending and share the financial burden of assistance both in supporting Ukraine and in ensuring their defense capability. -We call on your countries and your citizens to redouble their efforts and reaffirm their commitment not only to Ukraine's immediate security needs, but also to Europe's long-term defense and deterrence goals,- Pete Hegseth told his NATO colleagues. The US is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine, but other NATO countries have actually already seriously increased their spending. In 2024, NATO members in Europe and Canada invested $485 billion in defense, which is almost 20% more than in 2023. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte supported the US demands, saying that last year Canada and European allies provided more than 50% of the total amount of aid to Ukraine. -And I fully agree with President Trump and his team that this is the only sensible way forward. Of course, there will undoubtedly be debates regarding the issue of future support for Ukraine, who will pay for it, where it will come from, etc. But there is also an agreement between all members of the Alliance that Ukraine should have all the necessary military assistance, so that whenever peace negotiations start, it can conduct them from a position of strength,- he explained. Potential peace talks were another point in Pete Hegseth's speech. -Like you, we want a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by realizing that returning to the borders of Ukraine by 2014 is an unrealistic goal. The pursuit of this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,- he said. The head of the Pentagon believes that it is possible to achieve an end to the war only by combining -allied forces with a realistic assessment- of the situation on the battlefield. In his opinion, lasting peace for Ukraine should include reliable security guarantees to prevent the recurrence of war. But how to get these guarantees from the Kremlin, the US Defense Minister did not explain. He also said that the United States does not consider NATO membership for Ukraine to be a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. However, not all allies share the US position on this point. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen disagreed with the US position expressed at Ramstein. -We have decided to offer Ukraine membership in NATO, but it is also clear that for this we must all agree. So we can say that there is a discussion going on now about what future awaits Ukraine,- he said on the sidelines after -Ramstein-. Defense Minister of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov emphasized that Kyiv is not going to abandon the path of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. -Our position is unchanged: we want to be a NATO country, we will be a NATO country, we will be an EU country,- he said in a conversation with journalists in Brussels. However, this -Ramstein- was distinguished not only by harsh statements of the USA, but also provided Ukraine with new packages of military aid from a number of countries. Great Britain hands over 150 million pounds worth of weapons and equipment: thousands of drones, dozens of battle tanks and armored vehicles, as well as air defense systems. Britain plans to provide Ukraine with more than 10,000 drones during the year, and by the end of spring it will deliver more than 50 armored vehicles, including modernized T-72 tanks. Germany will soon hand over to Ukraine about 100 missiles for the IRIS-T anti-aircraft missile complex, which will help strengthen the protection of Ukrainian infrastructure against Russian air threats. The Netherlands is handing over 25 armored tracked vehicles to the YPR, which will be used to transport the wounded. In total, the country has allocated more than 10 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine, of which approximately 6 billion euros have been implemented. -We have to continue our support, especially now, when Ukrainians are having a hard time at the front. Peace against Russia is possible only with the help of military force,- Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans is convinced. The Netherlands also handed Ukraine the last promised T-72 tanks as part of a joint program with the Czech Republic and the United States. In addition, Ukraine recently received a new batch of Dutch F-16 fighters, but the exact number of transferred aircraft is not is disclosed Norway has joined the Drone Coalition for Ukraine and will help strengthen the protection of Ukraine's critical infrastructure. Latvia, which last year spent 0.25% of its GDP to support Ukraine, will hand over 42 more armored personnel carriers. -We are determined to continue supporting Ukraine. It must be emphasized that any peace negotiations must be conducted from a position of strength,- said Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds. For now, we can definitely say that -Rammstein- will survive, only technical issues remain, such as the chairmanship. Whether it will be Great Britain in the future, or the format will return under the auspices of the United States, is still unknown. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is confident that the format should work in parallel with the new command in Wiesbaden (NSATU), which is responsible for the coordination and delivery of aid to Ukraine. -Obviously, both are needed. Because in the Rammstein format, the members of the Alliance and other countries outside NATO undertake to guarantee that Ukraine has everything it needs,- he explained. At the same time, NSATU not only organizes logistics for the transfer of weapons, but also, for example, conducts training for the Ukrainian military. -So we need these two programs. Therefore, I think that the future depends on both,- said the NATO Secretary General. Rustem Umyerov is also convinced of the continuation of Ramstein's work. -I believe that Rammstein was held productively and it was agreed that the next meeting will also take place, the place and time will be announced later,- he said, summing up the meeting in Brussels.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/nova-vijskova-dopomoga-ta-zhorstki-zayavy-pentagonu-yakym-buv-dlya-ukrayiny-ramshtajn-u-bryusseli/	2025-02-12T20:30:47-08:00
Mobilization of drones: a Californian firm has redesigned its civilian UAV for the needs of the US A...	As informed by the profile defense edition The war zone, in February 2022 the Californian drone manufacturer Skydio won the army competition under the SRR project, in which the company presented its Skydio X2D civilian drone adapted for the needs of the Pentagon, which in The US Army received the name RQ-28A, according to ArmyInform. As part of the agreement with the Pentagon, the amount of which amounted to $99.8 million, the Skydio company undertook to transfer 1,080 units of RQ-28A quadcopters to the army units of the United States Armed Forces. In turn, the authors of the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition (AR) was informed that as part of one of the first in 2025 Army multinational exercises Combined Resolve 25-1, which took place in mid-January at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center on the Hohenfels training ground in Germany, fighters of the 317th Engineer Brigade of the US Army actively tested the advanced RQ-28A drones in their arsenal. Skydio X2D, an American unmanned aerial vehicle designed for rapid deployment and capable of being fully ready within a minute of activation. This portability is one of its key features—soldiers can carry the drone in their backpacks, making it an ideal accessory for platoon-level operations. Weighing just under 2.25 kg (5 pounds), the Skydio X2D can conduct high-resolution video surveillance both day and night, with a range of up to three kilometers. The drone's robust autonomous capabilities set it apart from other unmanned systems as it can navigate complex environments while avoiding obstacles such as trees and buildings. This level of autonomy reduces the burden on soldiers, allowing them to focus on their mission rather than piloting the UAV. In addition, the drone's ability to operate in low-visibility environments, such as populated urban areas with heavy construction or dense forests, further expands its usefulness. A properly trained operator can access control of the RQ-28A using a dedicated controller with a 6.8-inch 720p LED touchscreen and an internal antenna. The latter is used to communications at a distance of up to 6 kilometers using the 5 GHz band, and such a relatively modest signal transmission range clearly defines the RQ-28A as belonging to the short-range drone class. Speaking of equipment, the RQ-28A provides comprehensive reconnaissance capabilities thanks to the presence of 4K optical cameras with 16x digital zoom and dual sensors, including 12-megapixel color camera and thermal sensor FLIR. Such a set guarantees a 360-degree view of the field of view, the ability to detect people and vehicles, and an equally impressive obstacle avoidance system. A kind of -icing on the cake- is the ability to perform 3D scanning of the environment, which makes it possible to automate the process of observing a given target, although the low battery life on a single charge somewhat limits this efficiency. What sets the Skydio X2D apart from other drones is its exceptional autonomy and obstacle avoidance technology. Equipped with Skydio's proprietary computer vision software, the AR site's authors say the drone can navigate complex environments without requiring constant manual control. This level of autonomy allows it to avoid obstacles while maintaining a smooth flight path and minimizing the risk of accidents. Skydio X2D is designed to deploy in less than a minute, offering soldiers a fast and reliable aerial reconnaissance tool that greatly improves their ability to respond to new threats on the battlefield. Deployment of Skydio X2D as part of the initiative Transformation in Contact reflects the US Army's desire to integrate advanced technology into its warfighting strategies. According to the official website of the U.S. Army, this initiative aims to increase the speed and accuracy of decision-making, enabling a real-time tactical response in crisis or conflict scenarios. Using drones such as the Skydio X2D, soldiers can gather real-time intelligence that can be quickly transmitted to commanders, thereby improving situational awareness and the ability to respond to rapidly changing conditions on the battlefield. Using small drones for tactical reconnaissance is an increasingly common approach as they allow the military to assess enemy positions, identify potential threats, and gather critical information without putting soldiers in direct harm. The transition to wider use of drones in The US military is part of a broader trend in modern military strategy. Unmanned systems, previously used primarily for large-scale surveillance, are now critical tools for small units operating at the platoon level. Looking to the future, the US Army plans to expand the use of drones and other unmanned systems in various echelons of military operations. The increasing deployment of these systems at the platoon level reflects a shift to smaller, more nimble and flexible units that can quickly respond to new threats. The Army is expected to integrate even more advanced drone technology, focusing on improving data connectivity, communication between drones and ground units, and expanding the range of operations. As technology advances, drones will likely incorporate artificial intelligence, swarm capabilities, and even autonomous decision-making, making them even more effective tools in combat. The Skydio X2D drone test during Combined Resolve 25-1 in Germany underscores the U.S. Army's commitment to using new technologies to improve battlefield awareness and operational readiness. This drone is a key element of the US military's ongoing efforts to modernize the way it conducts war, ensuring that soldiers are better equipped to meet the challenges of today's conflicts.

Disrupt the mobilization and demonize the TCC: the enemy continues to -pump- the audience with fakes	This week, the topic of the mobilization of Ukrainian teenagers is actively -rocking-. In particular, a video with a Ukrainian prisoner of war, who says that he allegedly saw teenagers from an orphanage in his brigade, is circulating on Russian resources. The propagandists do not provide any other evidence for their lies. They base the charges solely on the -confession- of a Ukrainian prisoner of war, who in the hands of the enemy could have been subjected to torture and death threats. Another example: the dissemination of information that teenagers are being mobilized for the 41st OMbr. In these messages, pro-Russian resources provide screenshots with various comments of military personnel and relatives on Facebook. However, the screenshots turned out to be drawn in Photoshop and generated by artificial intelligence, and the comments under them were added by fake accounts. In order not to fall into such -throwaways-, it is worth knowing that according to the current legislation, citizens of Ukraine between the ages of 25 and 60 are subject to mobilization. Citizens under the age of 25 can join the ranks of the Armed Forces only voluntarily by signing a contract. Traditionally, fakes related -to the atrocities of the TCC and SP- continue to appear. Their goal, in addition to disruption of mobilization, is destabilization of the internal situation in Ukraine. Unfortunately, such fakes are often spread by Ukrainian men. Mostly those who are violators of the law: have not yet updated their data or fled the country. In January, I went through the VLK and did not see any disdain or prejudice towards me in any of the offices. Also, none of the fifty people who spent several hours with me in the queues complained about something similar. Because those citizens who are conscious reservists know very well that in case of need they will fulfill their constitutional duty. And in the TCC and SP, they also treat conscientious citizens who updated their data on time, passed the VLC, and do not hide in the bushes after seeing a person in a military uniform. Those who do not want to serve, are wanted and evade mobilization are criminals. And the attitude towards them is appropriate. Of course, it is easier for them to blame everything on the TCC and SP, ZSU or the government - anyone but themselves. The enemy dreams that such sentiments will prevail everywhere in Ukraine, because that is the only way he will be able to overcome our resistance. That is why it reproduces staged videos, which it tries to cause fear, panic and shake up the internal situation in our country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/zirvaty-mobilizacziyu-ta-demonizuvaty-tczk-vorog-prodovzhuye-kachaty-audytoriyu-fejkamy/	2025-02-12T20:06:15-08:00
Ukraine and the USA are preparing a new agreement on security and economy	The Office of the President informs about this on February 12. -Just held a meeting of the National Security Council - the decision has been made and will be published tomorrow. We are protecting our state and restoring justice: everyone who destroyed Ukraine's national security and helped Russia should be held accountable,- the President assured. According to him, the billions that were actually earned by selling Ukrainian interests and security should be blocked and should be used to protect Ukraine. He also met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and announced the preparation of a new agreement. -We plan to work out all the details so that already within the limits of the Munich Conference and our meetings there with American representatives, in particular the Vice President of America Vance, so that we have a ready vision of how we will add more security and what document can record it,- the head of state said. He also talked about the talks with the US president. -Very substantive negotiations with the United States of America. President Trump briefed me on what Putin told him. We believe that America's strength is enough to push Russia and Putin to peace together with us, together with all partners,- the President of Ukraine noted. We will remind you that Volodymyr Zelensky conducted long a telephone conversation with former US President Donald Trump about the possibilities of achieving peace in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/ukrayina-i-ssha-gotuyut-novu-ugodu-shhodo-bezpeky-ta-ekonomiky/	2025-02-12T11:59:00-08:00
Love Through Explosions: The Story of an International Legion Commander and a Combat Medic	The story of the defenders was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Their paths crossed in 2022 in Kruglyakivka. Jan then commanded an infantry company, and Anastasia served in a medical station. Their acquaintance happened by chance - when medics came to help the injured commander of another company. -He was so courageous, serious - I liked him right away,- recalls Anastasia. But then she didn't allow herself to even think about a relationship. War left no room for sentiment, and war rumors only increased caution. Jan himself took his time. They just talked for a long time, until all his personal issues were resolved, and only then did a real feeling develop between them. Together they went through moments when the heart was clenched with fear. Ian saw on the screen an explosion where his beloved had just been. Anastasia - saved the wounded under fire, knowing that someone who was worried was waiting for her. -We immediately drew a line between personal life and work. It wasn't like, 'you're my girl, don't go there,'- says Ian. She worked in evacuation groups, took the wounded out of the hell of battle. Yang had to come to terms with the fact that he couldn't protect her the way he wanted to. Once, while evacuating a dead soldier, Anastasia came under fire. Ian watched it on the monitor, a huge flash, followed by a few seconds of silence that seemed like an eternity. -I thought - that's it, she's gone- But then I heard a voice on the radio- Shelling, contusions, operations. The war more than once made them wonder whether they would return alive. Ian recalls one of his combat exits: mines exploded a few meters away, and only the frozen ground saved their group from death. Anastasia survived serious injuries. -When you're injured, you don't think about how they care about you. You think about your soldiers, about how to save them,- she says. Their feelings were hardened under the bullets. They passed tests that would be enough for several lifetimes. When Anastasia became pregnant, Ian felt even more afraid of losing her. -When I was injured, I was most afraid that my son would be left without a father,- he admits. -But when you're with the one you love, all fears fade away.- Despite all the difficulties, they do not back down, because they know: together, Ukraine needs them - and each other. As ArmiyaInform reported, she saves lives on the front line, helps the wounded and finds time for creativity. -Shantal- is a combat medic of the 34th separate coastal defense brigade, who has been faithfully fulfilling her mission since 2022. An Odessa resident, artist, writer and big animal lover, she shares her experiences, thoughts about the future and the inspiration she finds even in the most difficult moments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/kohannya-kriz-vybuhy-istoriya-komandyra-internaczionalnogo-legionu-ta-bojovoyi-medykyni/	2025-02-12T11:57:36-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi commented on the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO	He said this during a meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. -We were constantly told about the open door policy. But no one has invited us to NATO yet. The fact that there are appropriate steps and the inclusion of this issue in the Constitution of Ukraine&#8230; You know how it happened. This does not mean that NATO said: -Include this in the Constitution, and you will be in NATO tomorrow,- he noted. The head of state recalled the Budapest memorandum. -Exchange for nothing. On paper. Yes, we all want to be in NATO, we are all adequate people with you. But you must understand that all these talks are about steps, about reforms, about re-equipment of the army, about a new level of the Ukrainian army. Where is higher? We stopped Putin,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. According to him, membership in NATO can really become a security guarantee for Ukraine. -But the United States, Germany, Hungary, they don't see us there - yet. When we talk about the alternative, I always say that the cheapest option for everyone is Ukraine in NATO. The most expensive is to build NATO in Ukraine, because you, the Ukrainians, will have no other way. There will be no other way for security in Europe. And then it will be reflected in the security of the United States,- the President assured. He noted that Putin does not want to end the war. According to the head of state, building NATO in Ukraine means keeping the same army as in Russia. -That is, there are 220 brigades in Russia, and we have 110 combat brigades. This is the usual arithmetic. And in Europe, I spoke about this recently, approximately 80-82 combat brigades. If there is no Ukraine tomorrow, Russia will go to Europe and occupy it. And we need real security guarantees. And I ask President Trump to give us these security guarantees, to help Ukraine strengthen us,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. He also reminded that large resources are needed to maintain the Ukrainian army. -Of course we should talk to Europe. We currently have a budget deficit. To have an army at least as small as it is now, and to feed this army and arm it is to have a large resource. This money has to come from somewhere,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky conducted a long telephone conversation with former US President Donald Trump about the possibilities of achieving peace in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/volodymyr-zelenskyj-prokomentuvav-mozhlyvist-vstupu-ukrayiny-do-nato/	2025-02-12T11:41:41-08:00
Tank funeral: Ukrainian drones turned the armored vehicles of the Russian Federation into a pyre	The video of combat work was published on the regiment's page. UAV operators worked brilliantly on enemy targets. As a result, one tank and a fuel-lubricating material warehouse (FMM) were destroyed, and another tank and an armored fighting vehicle (AMV) were critically damaged. In addition, at least six occupiers were eliminated. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the 429th regiment of unmanned systems -Achilles- knocked out the strike from 8 occupants in the truck and continued the hunt.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/tankovyj-pohoron-ukrayinski-dronari-peretvoryly-bronetehniku-rf-na-zgaryshhe/	2025-02-12T11:39:44-08:00
As a defender of the Donetsk airport - Katran - found a new mission in the army	The soldier's story was made public on the page of the Ukrainian Navy. His path to this role was full of events and achievements. Since childhood, -Katran- was interested in aviation and electronics, which led him to take part in model aircraft sports, where he repeatedly became the winner of national competitions. Studying at the Odessa Aero Club gave him deep knowledge of aviation technology and experience in parachute jumping, after which he became an instructor. In 2014, with the start of hostilities in eastern Ukraine, -Katran- voluntarily joined the last reconnaissance group defending the Donetsk airport. In 2015, he commanded a platoon of the 25th separate airborne brigade of the airborne assault troops. Since 2016, -Katran- together with like-minded people has been actively developing the field of unmanned aviation, holding the position of head of the operation department. He trained the military to work with reconnaissance devices and provided their maintenance. With the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, -Katran- joined the 35th Marine Brigade, where it performed combat missions in the Donetsk and Kherson directions as part of the reconnaissance battalion. His experience and leadership qualities helped to motivate the team and achieve the set goals. For his service, Katran was awarded numerous state awards, including the Cross -For Courage- from the President of Ukraine and the honorary badge -Steel Cross- from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After the third wound received in Krynk, he was declared unfit for service in the marines and assault troops due to his health. However, -Katran- did not leave the service and continues to pass on his invaluable experience to the 15th Separate Marine Support Regiment. His story is an example of indomitable spirit and devotion to Ukraine. -Understanding and support of relatives, responsibility and awareness of one's own benefit in serving the Ukrainian people motivates and helps to believe in a peaceful future!- - sums up the military man. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 4th battalion -Freedom Force- of the 4th operational brigade -Rubizh- of the National Guard struck the enemy equipment and finished off the Russian landing party.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/yak-oboronecz-doneczkogo-aeroportu-katran-znajshov-novu-misiyu-v-armiyi/	2025-02-12T11:27:01-08:00
A wolf in sheep's clothing: a traitor who was hiding in the ranks of the Armed Forces was exposed	informs about this. In 2022, when Russian troops occupied part of the Kherson region, the perpetrator cooperated with the occupation authorities and got a -service- at -Daryiv Correctional Colony No. 10-. Since June 2022, he held the position of -junior inspector of the security department- and received a salary in rubles. After the liberation of Kherson Oblast, the man remained in the territory controlled by Ukraine and even went to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, hiding the fact of his cooperation with the enemy. However, the SBI exposed the traitor and detained him in the Kharkiv region. He was informed of the suspicion of voluntarily occupying a position in an illegal occupation law enforcement body in the temporarily occupied territory (Part 7 of Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the article provides imprisonment for up to fifteen years with confiscation of property. The court chose a measure of remand for the accused - detention. Procedural management is carried out by the Kherson specialized prosecutor's office in the field of defense of the Southern region. This shameful case is another evidence that the Russian occupiers are trying to penetrate into all spheres of life in Ukraine, even into the ranks of the Armed Forces. However, thanks to the vigilance and professionalism of the DBR and SBU employees, traitors and collaborators will inevitably be punished. As reported by ArmyInform, the DBR employees detained the instructor of the recruiting department of the Mukachevo RTCC and SP, who for money helped men of draft age to escape from the premises of the assembly center, and servicemen who were returned after voluntarily leaving the unit - from the reserve battalion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/vovk-v-ovechij-shkuri-vykryto-zradnyka-yakyj-perehovuvavsya-u-lavah-zsu/	2025-02-12T11:04:01-08:00
-Sivalka- was not a joke: the occupiers are harvesting thermobaric charges	The video of combat work was published on the command page. The Ukrainian flamethrower system -Sivalka-VM8- is a mobile means of fire damage to the troops of the Russian Defense Forces of the Support Forces for the tactical level. The flexibility of application makes it possible to quickly destroy the enemy in the defense at the strongholds,- the message says. -Sivalka-VM8- is especially effective in the conditions of enemy defense at strong points. The thermobaric charges used by the system create excess pressure at the point of arrival, guaranteeing the area of ​​damage even where classical projectiles do not give the required result. -The occupiers have practically no chance of survival,- the Armed Forces Support Forces Command notes, emphasizing the devastating power of the Sivalka-VM8. As reported by ArmyInform, a strong character is an extremely important trait for a soldier, which not only helps to endure all the burdens of the service, but can also save lives. to the fighter himself or his comrades.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/sivalka-rozijshlasya-ne-na-zhart-okupanty-zbyrayut-vrozhaj-termobarychnyh-zaryadiv/	2025-02-12T10:53:15-08:00
Rustem Umyerov spoke about the results of -Ramsteinu-: air defense, ammunition, armored vehicles are...	Rustem Umyerov said this at a briefing following the results of the 26th Ramstein meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports. -We had a productive meeting today.

- The Koreans have changed their tactics - in Kurshchyna, soldiers from the DPRK are climbing the po...	This was told by Stanislav Krasnov, platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade, on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon.

After all, the war is now going on in their territory, and they need to get some minimal victory at any cost. That's why they relentlessly throw their infantry into attacks, and that's why they have such heavy losses. -It is not visible from the prisoners that they have more motivation.

Despite the fact that the Koreans returned to the battlefield. -They changed their tactics somewhat. They are already moving in smaller groups. If before that they moved in groups of up to 50 people, now there are 15-20. But their tactics are the same. All the same, they climb like cockroaches on our positions.

Prince Harry in the Frontier: how the Duke of Sussex supports Ukrainian soldiers at the Invincible G...	This was reported on the brigade's page. Whether this was a planned move or a sincere impulsive decision is unknown. However, this sign did not go unnoticed. Ukrainian military and veterans participating in the competition felt special support from the Duke of Sussex. This is not the first time Prince Harry has expressed solidarity with our country. During the Invincible Games, he actively communicates with the Ukrainian military, inspires them and, it seems, has become even closer to the defenders of Ukraine. -Welcome to the -Rubizh- Brigade, prince Harry!- — humorously remarked the fighters of the brigade in social networks. And although the title of prince does not imply service in another army, it seems that he has already become an honorary -fighter- of the Ukrainian -Rubezh-. As reported by ArmiyaInform, fighters of the 4th battalion -Freedom Force- of the 4th brigade of the operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard hit enemy equipment and finished off the Russian landing party.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/pryncz-garri-u-rubezhi-yak-gerczog-sassekskyj-pidtrymuye-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-na-igrah-neskorenyh/	2025-02-12T06:28:33-08:00
Latvia will transfer 42 armored personnel carriers to Ukraine	He said this before the start of the meeting of the Contact Group on Aid to Ukraine at the NATO headquarters, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports from Brussels. -We will announce new aid in the form of 42 armored personnel carriers, which corresponds to the number of armored vehicles for the battalion. We also continue to co-chair the Drone Coalition and participate in the training of the Ukrainian military,- Andris Spruds said. He reminded that last year Latvia provided more than 0.25% of its GDP to help Ukraine. -We are determined to continue supporting Ukraine. It must be emphasized that any peace negotiations must be conducted from a position of strength. Practical steps are also needed: financial support, military aid,- concluded the Latvian minister. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance have already provided Ukraine with more than the 40 billion euros of defense support promised last year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/latviya-peredast-ukrayini-42-bronetransportery/	2025-02-12T06:05:14-08:00
-Maxim- vs. -Shakheds-: how a 19th century machine gun destroyed a modern kamikaze drone	The story of the fighters was published on the brigade's page. Their comrade-in-arms is -Maxim-, a legendary machine gun that survived two world wars and, as it turned out, is still capable of effectively destroying the enemy. Although its firing range is limited to 800 meters, it was enough to shoot down an enemy Shahed during combat duty. -When we saw the drone, we started working from all six positions. But it was our -Max- that shot him down,- the fighters say. Volodymyr, a builder from Cherkasy region, and Petro, a 58-year-old military man whose son also defends the country, know well the price of accuracy. -If you don't hit the target, it can kill civilians - that's the hardest part,- Volodymyr adds. Such combat experience once again confirms: even century-old weapons can be formidable if they fall into the hands of those who are ready to defend their land. However, the fighters do not hide: they dream of more modern weapons. -We would like something more powerful, DShK or Kanik, then we could shoot down more targets,- says Petro. The Ukrainian army once again demonstrates that war is not only about technology, but also about determination, courage and ingenuity. And if the enemy thinks that his drones will fly through the Ukrainian sky with impunity, he should review history - because even 19th century technologies can work in this game. As reported by ArmyInform, the chief sergeant of the unit with the call sign -Puzzle- is one of those who does not hesitate for a minute when it is necessary to go into battle or save his brothers. His story is a story of courage, bravery and iron will, which became the basis of the battles for Krynky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/maksym-proty-shahediv-yak-kulemet-xix-stolittya-znyshhyv-suchasnyj-dron-kamikadze/	2025-02-12T06:03:46-08:00
-Gifts for an imaginary friend- - violators invented an original scheme for crossing the border, but...	On Wednesday, February 12, reported in the DPSU press service. -First, the young men met with the border guards during verification measures in the controlled border area. They said that they were going to a friend's birthday in one of the border towns, and to be convincing, they took gift packages and food,- &#8211; the message says. However, later the border guards discovered these same citizens in a completely different place. -During the conversation, the boys admitted that they don't have any friends in Volyn - they just wanted to cross the border illegally.

Mark Rutte: NATO countries exceeded their obligations to Ukraine by providing EUR 50 billion in aid	This was said by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on the eve of the ministerial meeting in Brussels, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports. -At the Washington Summit, the Alliance members promised to provide Ukraine with 40 billion euros of security assistance until 2024. They not only fulfilled their obligations. They significantly exceeded them. They provided more than 50 billion euros, more than half of which came from European Allies and Canada,- Mark Rutte said. He emphasized that this is a clear signal of NATO's unwavering commitment to Ukraine. -It's also a big step in the direction of what President Trump has called for. I agree with him that we should distribute security aid to Ukraine evenly. But in order to really change the trajectory of the conflict, we must do even more,- said the NATO Secretary General. Mark Rutte added that the stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield, the stronger it will be at the negotiating table: -The more chances there are to get a good deal to achieve lasting peace.- As ArmiyaInform reported, on February 12, the defense ministers of the NATO countries will participate in the work of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine in the Ramshtein format under chaired by Great Britain.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/mark-ryutte-krayiny-nato-perevykonaly-zobovyazannya-pered-ukrayinoyu-nadavshy-50-mlrd-yevro-dopomogy/	2025-02-12T05:38:43-08:00

Mobilizing 18-year-olds: when the idea first arose	And it happened in revolutionary France. On August 23, 1793, the National Convention (constitutional and legislative assembly of the period of the French Revolutionary Wars) passed the -Decree on the Mass Levy- (French: Levée en masse), written by Bertrand Barér with Lazare Carnot. The revolution that took place in France in 1789 caused friction between the new republican government and its European neighbors, who decided to invade France to restore the monarchy. The war with Prussia and Austria began in April 1792. And already by March 1793, France was in a state of war with Austria, Prussia, Spain, Great Britain, Piedmont and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. The French army at the time was a mixture of volunteers and what was left of the old royal army. Due to the introduction of conscription on 24 February 1793, the size of the mercenary army was increased to approximately 645,000 soldiers, but this number was insufficient and the military situation continued to deteriorate, especially when Mainz fell on 23 July 1793. The convention began to be demanded to increase taxes, but the assembly solved the problem in a different way, announcing the first general mobilization. A member of the Convention, Bertrand Barrère, asked the convention -to make a solemn declaration that the French people are going to rise up in defense of their independence.- It contained, in particular, the following points: 1. From now on and until the enemies are expelled from the territory of the republic, the French people are constantly in military service. Young men go to battle; married men - forge weapons and provide transport; women make tents and clothes and will serve in hospitals; children turn old rags into lint; the elderly should assemble in public places to stimulate the courage of the warriors and to preach the unity of the Republic and the hatred of kings. 2. National buildings are turned into barracks; public places - in the armory; the soil of the cellars will be washed with lye to remove nitrates from it. 3. Weapons of various calibers should be transferred exclusively to those who oppose the enemy. 4. Saddle horses will be used to equip the cavalry corps; draft horses, other than those used in agriculture, must carry artillery and provisions. 5. The Public Security Committee is instructed to take all necessary measures to immediately establish the special production of weapons of all kinds&#8230; He is empowered to establish all establishments, manufactories, workshops, and factories, as he may deem necessary for the execution of such works, and also to require for this purpose throughout the territory of the Republic such workers as may contribute to their success&#8230; The central establishment of said special production shall be established in Paris&#8230; 8. Bulk collection is general. Unmarried citizens or childless widowers between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five shall be the first; they are to meet without delay at the capital of their districts, where they are to exercise daily while waiting for the hour of departure. 9. Representatives of the people regulate meetings and marches so that armed citizens arrive at places of assembly only in those for which there are sufficient supplies, ammunition and everything that constitutes the material part of the army. 10. The places of assembly shall be determined by circumstances and appointed by the representatives of the people seconded to execute this decree, on the advice of the generals in cooperation with the Committee of Public Safety and the Provisional Executive Council. 11. The battalions organized in each district must be united under a banner with the inscription: The French people have risen against the tyrants&#8230; The mass conscription resulted in the creation of a national army in France composed of citizens rather than mercenaries, which was standard practice at the time. Its maximum number was reached in September 1794 — 1,108,300 people. Most of the soldiers were peasant farmers. The rich and urban workers were given special privileges and exemptions. In addition, the rich could buy replacements (poorer men to take their place) from families who needed money. Men who did clerical work, as well as other men who could read and write, were released from service and worked in government offices. Despite the solemn rhetoric, the mass collection was not popular; desertion and evasion were very high (the number of deserters was later estimated at 175,000). However, these efforts were enough to turn the tide of the war and protect the French borders from all enemies. France's brilliant victory surprised and shocked monarchical Europe. There was no need for further conscription until 1797, when a permanent system of annual conscription was introduced. General mobilization was used in France and during the Napoleonic Wars. Later, the French term -Levée en masse- came to refer to the policy of mass national conscription, often in the face of invasion. But the further practice of mobilizations in the world led to a constant increase in armies with each subsequent war. The culmination was the mass conscription into the armies of various countries during the First and Second World Wars, which claimed millions of lives of those mobilized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/mobilizacziya-18-richnyh-koly-czya-ideya-vynykla-vpershe/	2025-02-12T05:26:25-08:00
A rat in a trap: how the SBU turned a traitor into a weapon against the FSB	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, operation -Rat- made it possible not only to identify the traitor, but also to use him for disinformation of the enemy. During the entire time of being under surveillance, the agent transmitted to the FSB data that was carefully prepared by the Ukrainian special service. The occupiers received information that looked plausible but worked against them. -We monitored his every move, all contacts, communication and correspondence around the clock. He literally lived under the supervision of our special services,- said Vasyl Malyuk. However, in addition to agent activity, the -mole- also had family support in the form of his parents, who openly justified the aggression of the Russian Federation. The SBU is already preparing suspicions against them under Article 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The investigation revealed that the official was recruited in 2018 in Vienna. After a temporary -conservation-, it was reactivated in December 2024, when it began to transmit classified data to the enemy. However, all these actions were under the control of the Ukrainian special services. Together with the -topshurt-, the entire FSB intelligence network was exposed, and its curator - Yuriy Shatalov - was also established. During the operation, a hidden conspiratorial apartment, a mobile phone for transmitting information and other evidence of treason were discovered. The official was charged with treason (Article 111 of the Criminal Code), he faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. The case is under the control of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. The SBU emphasizes that the cleansing of its own ranks from traitors continues, and no FSB agent will remain unnoticed. The enemy can be sure of only one thing - a trap is waiting for him. As reported by ArmyInform, employees of the Security Service of Ukraine discovered a -top- Russian FSB agent in their ranks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/shhur-u-pastczi-yak-sbu-peretvoryla-zradnyka-na-zbroyu-proty-fsb/	2025-02-12T05:13:55-08:00

About this wrote on February 12 the head of the public relations service of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, colonel Yuriy Ignat. -The anti-aircraft guided missile of the Patriot air defense system is capable of knocking down a ballistic missile only with a direct -head-on- collision. Due to the kinetic energy during the collision, the enemy missile either explodes or changes its trajectory and falls to the ground. We have no other way to hit ballistics! If the missile did not explode in the air, there remains a high probability of detonation of the warhead on the ground,- Yuriy Ignat said. He attached a video of the downed Iskander-M in Odesa to his post. According to him, there were similar cases in Kyiv (on Lukyanivka) and in other places. -The hit missile will no longer fly to the target where the enemy sent it, but it will definitely fall to the ground! On February 12, suddenly, at 4:30 in the morning, the enemy tried to destroy the objects of critical infrastructure in the capital, to deprive the residents of Kyiv of heat and electricity, to create a humanitarian disaster during the frost! The consequences could have been terrible...- assured Yuriy Ignat. According to him, the anti-aircraft missile division, headed by the Hero of Ukraine, was engaged in repelling the attack on the capital, and on whose account dozens of ballistic missiles were shot down in the sky of the capital. Yuriy Ignat dedicated his post to People's Deputy Maryana Bezuglii, who once again criticized the work of the Air Force and made a statement about the rocket explosion in Kyiv.

Two attacks on military personnel of the TCC and SP in a day: incidents in Kharkiv and in the Rivne ...	The first incident occurred in the Rivne region. During the verification of military registration documents, persons of mobilization age attacked servicemen of the TCC and SP, injuring them and damaging military equipment. The attackers fled from the scene of the crime and are being sought. This was notified in the Rivne Regional TCC and Joint Venture. The second incident happened in Kharkiv. On the territory of the regional TCC and SP, the attacker, using a gas canister and a knife, injured a serviceman of the Armed Forces. The assailant was detained, and the wounded soldier received the necessary medical assistance. This was reported in the Kharkiv Regional TCC and JV. Both incidents are united by the fact that they took place against the background of an information campaign aimed at discrediting the servicemen of the TCC and SP and the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The Kharkiv and Rivne regional TCCs and SP draw the public's attention to the fact that such crimes are a direct consequence of destructive activities aimed at undermining trust in the defenders of the country. Assaulting a military serviceman in the line of duty is a serious crime that requires a swift and objective investigation.

The first, but not the last: how the attack aircraft of the Defense Forces eliminated the general of...	He told about this in an interview on the -Defenders of Independence- channel, the official YouTube channel of the Main Communications Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian military carried out a unique operation, during which an enemy convoy was destroyed along with an enemy general. -We carried out a frontal assault - literally went to the enemy's column. Without losses on our side, we took two prisoners - the general's bodyguards, and destroyed the entire column along with the general himself,- says Brigadier General. The operation took place in Zhytomyr Oblast. The Ukrainian military conducted reconnaissance, determined the location of the enemy and carried out a lightning raid. In just a few minutes they were out of the battle without any casualties, while the enemy suffered a devastating blow. -It was important for us. This was the first case of the destruction of an enemy general on the territory of Ukraine. After this operation, the morale of the personnel rose significantly,- Colonel Vasyl Matiyev admits. The colonel says that the war has evolved over the past two years. The Russian army began to actively use the tactics of small tactical groups, reducing the time of attacks to avoid being hit by FPV drones. -Now they can storm even with two soldiers, trying to break into the shelter as quickly as possible,- explains the commander. Not only the tactics of the enemy have changed, but also the methods of the Ukrainian military. The 5th Assault Brigade uses a multi-layered battlefield surveillance system, including drones that broadcast real-time data. This allows you to make decisions faster than the enemy. -I see the full picture of the battle before the battalion commander has time to report to me,- emphasizes Brig. Vasyl Matiyev also emphasized the danger of excessive dissemination of military tactics in social networks. An example is the use of incendiary munitions from FPV drones, a method that quickly spread online and was soon used by the enemy against Ukrainian defenders. -A free country also has its risks: the enemy learns from our mistakes,- he explains. The colonel emphasizes the importance of psychological training of personnel. -You can't immediately throw newcomers into difficult tasks. They have to experience the first success, and then the fire in their eyes will only grow,- he says. In his opinion, the motivation and morale of the soldiers is the key to victory. As reported by ArmyInform, drone operators of the 5th separate assault brigade of Kyiv turned another offensive of the invaders. in the spectacle fiasco in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/pershyj-ale-ne-ostannij-yak-shturmovyky-syl-oborony-likviduvaly-generala-rf-na-pochatku-vtorgnennya/	2025-02-12T03:34:16-08:00

This is confirmed by the story of Denis from Chernivtsi on the pseudo -Dysant-, which shared by the DPSU. -He received his call sign for the initials of the Air Force in his passport. Pseudo fixed on the first combatants in Bakhmut.

Recalling his -baptism in combat-, Denys notes that it was then that he first encountered the loss of a brother. -We dragged him into the basement. They shot back and tried to provide help at the same time. The injury was severe. We did everything we could, but, unfortunately, he did not wait for the evacuation. We tried to divert the attention of the enemy to allow medics to get to the wounded, but they began to cover us with mortars. Only the boys advanced, everything possible flew in their direction. During this time, our comrade died from his injuries,- the fighter says. According to Denis, the loss of his comrade then gave him even more determination to destroy the enemy in memory of the fallen. -After Bakhmut, the battle-hardened border guard was sent to Klishchiivka. -Desant- calls joint work with attack aircraft from other units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine an unforgettable experience. The military fought and trained at the same time. On the stretcher, they honed their fighting skills in a variety of conditions,- the DPSU notes.

Bohdan Petrenko, the head of the communications department of the 48th separate artillery brigade, told about this on the Espresso broadcast. According to Petrenko, the enemy is coming in small infantry groups. Russians do not protect their people. In fact, the history of the Second World War is repeating itself, when the Soviet commanders simply pelted the enemy with the bodies of their soldiers - a kind of -collective Matrosov-. However, from time to time they still attack with highly guarded equipment. And these assaults look as strange as possible. -The -uber-weapon - the Wunderwaffe- is driving ahead. This is a tank, hung with all kinds of protective appendages. -Barbecue-, then -dreadlocks- are such chains that hang on the sides of this -barbecue-. Ahead is an anti-mine trawl, and what is interesting is that on top of the -barbecue- there is dynamic protection. But despite these -wunderwaffe-, none of these columns, and there were three of them, did not even reach the battle line&#8221; — said Bohdan Petrenko. As reported ArmyInform, in Kharkiv Oblast, in the Borova district, in the area of ​​responsibility of the Third Assault Brigade, repelled an attempt mechanized offensive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/poperedu-yide-vundervaffe-z-mangalom-i-dredamy-pid-velykoyu-novosilkoyu-atakuye-kolektyvnyj-matrosov/	2025-02-12T01:50:19-08:00

It didn't sit well - a pedestrian spy with a prison record was detained in Donetsk region	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on February 12. The man corrected the aggressor's rocket-bomb and artillery strikes on the locations of the Defense Forces on the hottest direction of the front — Pokrovsky.

During his first -term- in the colony in the temporarily occupied Makiivka, he was recruited by an FSB personnel officer and transferred to -waiting mode-.

After such investigations, the person involved would return home to submit the intelligence report to the FSB through an anonymous chat in the messenger. Employees of the Security Service exposed the agent early and detained him at his place of residence. Simultaneously, comprehensive measures were carried out to secure the locations of the Defense Forces on the relevant front line. During the search, a mobile phone and special devices were found in the detainee's possession, which he used to communicate with the FSB. SBU investigators informed him of the suspicion under 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

Britain will preside over Ramstein today for the first time: the meeting will take place at the NATO...	The meeting will take place in Brussels as part of a two-day NATO ministerial, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports from the Belgian capital. London initiated the chairmanship of Ramstein due to the arrival of a new administration in the US, including a new defense minister - Pete Hegseth headed the Pentagon just two weeks ago. It is currently unknown whether the United States will continue to lead Rammstein on a permanent basis, or whether there will be, for example, a rotating principle among several countries. Pete Hegseth arrived in Europe this week for the first time as the head of the US Department of Defense. In addition to Ramstein, he will also take part in the NATO ministerial meeting on February 13. The Pentagon previously said that Pete Hegseth in Brussels -will confirm President Donald Trump's commitment to a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as soon as possible and will emphasize the need to strengthen European leadership in providing security assistance to Ukraine.- Announcements of new military aid packages for Ukraine are expected at Ramshteyn, however, it is known for sure that the USA is not planning additional aid at the moment. As ArmiyaInform reported, the head of the NATO Military Committee Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone stated that Ukraine needs modern air defense systems, weapons for high-precision strikes at long distances, as well as increased supplies of artillery and ammunition.

-Shot, destroyed and forgot-: near Pokrovsk, our troops destroy the invaders from Stugna-P and Javel...	-Gimli- worked as a truck driver in Europe for 5 years before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. On the first day of the great war, he was in France. When there were thousands of queues of people leaving Ukraine at the western borders, Serhiy, on the contrary, moved back to the Motherland. He is from the Chernihiv region, his wife, children and parents were waiting at home in Nizhyn. The Polish border guards were surprised and asked him: -Are you going to war?-. He answered that yes - to defend Ukraine. They shook his hand and wished him well. At first, Serhiy joined the local DFTG, then enlisted in the ZSU. -Ghimli- is a pro, has tremendous experience in destroying Russian equipment from various anti-tank missile systems of domestic and foreign production at different areas of the front. -Ukrainian Stugna-P ATGMs are part of the unit's armament, and calculations of American Javelin complexes from other units of the Armed Forces have also been seconded to us. The -Stugna-P- complex is a real pride and one of the important achievements of domestic production. Developed and manufactured by Kyiv Design Bureau -Luch-. The complex has a guided anti-tank missile guidance system based on a laser beam, which is carried out in a semi-automatic mode from a closed firing position with the help of a remote control that is carried by a cable at a distance of 50 to 100 meters. Some variants of this complex are equipped with a thermal sight for working on targets at night. ATGM can fire missiles with different warheads: tandem cumulative or high-explosive fragmentation and hit tanks or other armored vehicles and fortifications at a maximum distance of 5 km. Remote installation control is one of the key advantages of Stugny-P over other similar anti-tank systems. This is primarily the preservation of personnel, which is very relevant at the moment, given the intensity of hostilities. How we work: we are assigned a territory, relatively speaking, a square where there are tank-dangerous lines, where the enemy can go to bring in and land his infantry. We take off with Mavik, scout the area and determine the plus-minus point where the anti-aircraft missile position can be set up. Next, our scouts go out and on the spot determine at which specific point of the terrain it is advisable to deploy, from which there will be the best opportunity to destroy the enemy. Be sure to use -Nettle-, a map of the area with heights, whether there is direct visibility, and so on. A dugout is being equipped and only after careful measures to mask the position, we advance there with ATGM. Depending on the direction and actions of the enemy, we decide how many anti-personnel and cumulative missiles we will need at this position. We raise the -Mavik- again so that our pilots from the air can see whether the firing position and the camouflaged installation are visible. The -Stugna-P- installation can be located 100 m away from the calculation, which at the same time is in a shelter or in a dugout, and using the remote control method through the monitor, the guys can determine the distance to the target, and just in observation mode watch the battlefield, and, of course, shoot at a distance of up to 5 km. That is, hit from a safe distance, hit the target and forgot. Such are the obvious capabilities of our ATGM. For example, the calculation of the American Javelin complex makes a shot manually from firing positions and at a shorter distance, depending on the type of missiles. It can be 2, 3 or up to 4 km. Currently, there are three -Stugny-P- calculations and one -Javelin- calculation in constant combat mode. Ideally, what a combat job: one shot, one target. The capabilities of -Stugny-P- plus professional calculations are a formula for success, which gives many great results from hitting enemy combat vehicles. For example, in the Zaporozhye direction, at a distance of 4,800 meters, a Russian T-72 tank, which was moving at the same time, was destroyed with one shot. Or at a distance of 3 km, a racist BMP with occupants was destroyed. Their car came to take away the killed and wounded from the battlefield, the guys waited for the moment when 12 bodies were loaded onto the BMP and struck, the damage is one hundred percent, no one survives the rocket. In total, about 30 units of various enemy vehicles were destroyed in Zaporozhye. Now we are in Donetsk recently, so we are just shooting, as they say. The relief of the area completely does not allow to work. But we are already destroying the enemy. Just the other day, our calculations from the Javelin destroyed two BMPs of the Russian Federation from a distance of 2 km. Enemy combat vehicles tried to break through to the rear of our infantry and land a landing party. The situation developed very dynamically. It was only three or four minutes for two damage to the enemy. The guys were sitting at a good height, there was good visibility. One car was completely destroyed, the other was hit and stopped. Then the FPV drones took up the work, which until the end dismantled this BMP and the Russian attack aircraft that ran out of the burning car. Our unit is specially strengthened with calculations of FPV drones, which work in the interests of anti-tank calculations -Stugny-P- and -Javelin-. Another interesting story. In the last week, the Russians have tried to break through our positions on the front line 4 times. And all 4 attempts fail for them. These were columns with equipment. A tank with a minesweeper was ahead, followed by 3-4 BMPs and another tank. So, the first tank with a trawl destroyed the Javelin anti-tank calculation from the neighboring unit, it was most convenient for them to hit it. Then the total destruction of this mechanized convoy began. Everything flew there: artillery shells, drops from drones, tanks joined. Moreover, not only the units of the 117th brigade, but also the artillery of the neighbors hit the occupiers. Destroyed everything! &nbsp; All our calculations have undergone professional training in the operation and combat use of -Stugna- and received educational certificates. The guys are professionals, motivated to beat the enemy, quick learners, mastering new ways and methods of destroying the enemy. What is interesting, in addition to the main work of destroying enemy equipment and fortifications, our calculations, together with air reconnaissance units, adjust artillery fire against small enemy assault groups and Russian equipment advancing in the Pokrovsky direction. Again, the calculation at a safe distance from the complex in a specially prepared shelter remotely monitors the designated area of ​​hostilities. In the radio communication mode, artillery unit strikes are being adjusted. These things about the interaction of brigade weapons significantly affect the success of the process of destroying the enemy. Somehow in the Zaporizhzhia direction, we captured the Katsap anti-tank missile -Kornet- and missiles for it. Interestingly, we even destroyed a Russian tank later with this complex. The disadvantage of this anti-tank installation is that the settlement is directly next to it, and this greatly increases the chances of being spotted, for example, by the Mavik UAV from the air. Our calculation, on the contrary, is at a distance of 100 meters from the camouflaged -Stugna-P-, that is, in cover and in safety, it strikes the enemy's equipment. We value our people, unlike the Russians. -Cornet- also works on the principle, like -Javelin-, -see and hit-. But the installation is heavy, it is difficult for two people to carry it. -Thigh- is also heavy, but it is more adapted to defensive actions. Like any ATGM calculation, we are tied to height and line of sight. The range of use of the -Cornet- is the same as that of the Ukrainian installation. Another minus is that it has poor optics, there is a Soviet sight, while the Stugny-P, on the contrary, has modern optics with a zoom that allows you to change the picture scale three times. Even if there is thick fog for 3-4 km, some signatures will be visible. And you won't be able to do this on a Russian ATGM, you just have to look at the sight. -Kornet- is actually a Soviet type of anti-tank weapon, so of course our ATGM is much better. The enemy is trying to improve its combat capabilities, but so far I have not come across a modernized version of the Rashist ATGM. Enemy anti-tank calculations are always a fat target for us. As we are for the enemy. Russians, because of their stupidity or because of something else, it is not clear, make mistakes. And that's good. I remember a case: a Rashist ATGM calculation fired three or four shots from one and the same place. Then there was a thick fog and our guys just saw by flashes, even the signatures were not visible, that it was an enemy calculation. They waited until the occupiers fired one of the shots. And as soon as their missile went off, we fired our shot and that was it, the damage was done - the enemy calculation was destroyed. After that, the enemy is already afraid to deploy their ATGMs near the contact line. This, in turn, allows our tanks to strike at the enemy with direct fire in the zone of responsibility of our unit. If the enemy does not use armored vehicles in the area of ​​hostilities, we conduct surveillance and identify the locations of enemy FPV drones, reconnaissance and attack UAVs. It is an effective weapon in the fight against dandruff. The missile has a thermal homing warhead, so the operator of the missile complex does not have to follow and correct the flight of the missile after launch while it approaches the target. That is, if you fixed the target, fired a shot, then you do not need to prove this missile, it hits the target automatically, simply by aiming. If there is direct visibility, you can work at a distance of 4 km. The big advantage is mobility, it is a portable installation, not as bulky as the stationary Stugna-P ATGM. One Javelin complex weighs only 22 kg. And, of course, the question of the price of missiles. If the Ukrainian rocket costs about 20,000 dollars, then the American one - at least 175 thousand. dollars But if you look at the price of, for example, a destroyed Russian tank, then the cost of even American missiles does not seem so high. But the Javelin installation has some peculiarities in terms of hitting targets. For example, if the first target, let's say, is hit and a second target is spinning near it, then the missile will again fly into, relatively speaking, a burning BMP, which gives off more heat, even though the aiming device is already fixed on this second target. Everything depends on the successful actions of the calculation, which already has similar experience. That is, you have to wait for the second target to move a little further, or move forward, or, on the contrary, roll back, and only then shoot. This is the -principle of heat transfer- in -Javelin-. You have to have a desire. You can learn absolutely everything. Our unit consists mainly of volunteers who came from the very beginning of the large-scale invasion and are not professional soldiers. That is, they did not have the concept of green in anti-tank complexes. A lot still depends on the professional training in the Training Centers. But the main thing is to constantly learn and develop. Now the preparation lasts a month. I will say from my own experience: if a person is motivated and wants to learn, ten days will be enough for him to study. I still studied on a shortened course - two weeks. You yourself understand that due to the cost of the Stugna-P missile and the limited number of these missiles, we did not have training shots during training. Worked at training complexes. Therefore, the first combat shots were already on the front line. Of course, there are some issues with this setup. When you see that the enemy column is moving towards our infantry, you forget absolutely everything, the adrenaline kicks in and you work on automaticity. You gain more and more experience with each subsequent shot at the grids.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/vystrilyv-znyshhyv-i-zabuv-pid-pokrovskom-nashi-nyshhat-okupantiv-zi-stugny-p-ta-dzhaveliniv/	2025-02-11T21:05:43-08:00
-Poles- and -Czechs- are repaired along -Shustrom-: who -fixes- the tanks of the 117th brigade	During his military service in 2008, Oleksandr became a mechanic-driver of the T-64 tank, the then main battle tank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Then he worked in his native Khmelnytskyi region as a forest feller and believed that a military specialty would no longer be needed in peaceful life. During the anti-terrorist operation, the serviceman recalls, he was called to the military commissariat four times, but each time everything ended with a verification of credentials and a warning to be ready to appear at the next call. A large-scale invasion changed everything, when Shustroy's knowledge and skills made him one of the most experienced tankmen in the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — When we came to Poland for training, the Poles showed us their PT-91 Twardy tanks and said that we would go to the training ground. I then asked if it was possible to -take a ride- - drive the tank by yourself. Only, I say, show how to launch, because the -sixty-four- has a different launch system. The Poles were surprised, but they allowed us - three of us from the entire battalion immediately sat down like that and drove off, - Oleksandr recalls. However, Shustrom did not have to use the privilege of driving for a long time - already after several trips, the Polish instructors recognized the high level of qualification of the Ukrainian tanker driver and ordered to hand over the driving of the armored vehicle to less experienced comrades. - I haven't been there for a long time, maybe I've been riding for a week - and I was told that it's enough, let those who know worse drive. That's why I went to the test site as a passenger for another month, - the tanker driver smiles. -Shustriya- remembers training in Poland with gratitude, noting the extremely friendly and at the same time demanding attitude of the instructors, well-thought-out living arrangements and good financial support for the cadets. - They taught us very well - everything was explained, chewed up. Everything was explained very clearly. The main thing was not to be ashamed to ask - everything you need will be shown, everything you are interested in will be analyzed. And together with you, everything will be collected and disassembled, and then they will be allowed to sort through everything themselves, says Oleksandr. The tank driver practically did not feel a language barrier when communicating with the instructors, because he had previously visited and worked in Poland for some time. Not needing an interpreter, he not only had more opportunities to study personally, but also helped his fellow students in this. Thanks to good basic knowledge, diligence and the help of instructors until the end of training, Oleksandr mastered PT-91 Twardy -excellently-. This allowed him to become responsible for the technical condition of armored vehicles in the tank company. Since the Twardy -Poles- are in many respects identical to the T-72, on the basis of which the Czech modernization of the T-72 Avenger was also created, -Shutriy- eventually became a universal specialist in the repair of the entire tank fleet. Now, under his leadership, a team of high-class specialists is working, capable of carrying out technical maintenance of all tanks of the company in field conditions. — Now I am considered to be the senior among the driver mechanics, I am responsible for all the cars so that they are in good working order, on the move. I sit down with the boys, go where necessary, organize and help. Is it for the evacuation of equipment that has been knocked down or is broken there. I make sure that the drivers do their work correctly, maintain the equipment, -Shustriy- explains his tasks. The tanker is convinced that a fully functional machine that will work flawlessly on the battlefield is the key to the completion of the combat mission and the survival of the crew. After all, if even a small thing in the tank does not work like clockwork, it can have irreparable consequences. Oleksandr praises PT-91 Twardy and T-72 Avenger, although he notes that, in his opinion, there are no fundamental differences from the basic T-72 model. However, he admits that the more powerful engine, fire control system and sights of modernized armored vehicles are important on the battlefield because they increase their combat capabilities. — The running gear is all the same. This T-64 is very different from them, and they are not really different from T-72. If you learned on the T-72, you can relearn on them very quickly - if you wish, -Shustriy- assures. So, when necessary, Oleksandr himself takes the seat of a mechanic-driver and can lead any tank of the company even for repairs, even for changing positions, even for battle. The senior mechvod, jokes -Shustriy-, is like a universal soldier - he must be -on you- both with equipment and with personnel. — If someone doesn't know something, doesn't know how, I have to show, explain, teach. It is necessary to do it together so that the guys in the process understand how it is done and then they can repair, sort through, fix it themselves, - explains Oleksandr. He is convinced that the main thing in the war is brotherhood, mutual understanding and mutual assistance in the team. After all, a well-coordinated team is able to perform the most difficult tasks precisely by insuring each other and offering a shoulder of friendly support. — Help the boys, show, do. And for everyone to be together. Unfortunately, we have losses. Very good guys are no longer with us. But this is a war, you can't do anything about it. We need to get together and hold on, do our work, because otherwise, nothing will be solved without us. If we don't do it ourselves, it won't get better or easier, the tanker explains his position. Fighting is hard, losing comrades is even harder. However, it is much worse to be defeated, because then nothing can be fixed, because the conditions will be dictated by the enemy and you will have to follow his whims. Therefore, the Shustriya tanker is convinced that he is now in his place - exactly where he should be at this time - among his brothers in tank company 117 of the separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/polyakiv-i-chehiv-remontuyut-po-shustromu-hto-fiksyt-tanky-117-brygady/	2025-02-11T20:40:52-08:00
Availability and mass: the well-known American manufacturer of drones will master the production of ...	This company is well known in the world arms market as a manufacturer of reconnaissance and attack drones, such as MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-1C Gray Eagle, which ArmyInform talked about in detail in its materials, did not previously specialize in the creation of air-to-surface missiles. As the authors of the defense portal The War Zone (TWZ) told, the latest charge was presented at the annual Surface Navy Association symposium, which testifies to the growing need of Armed US forces in available and mass-produced air-based munitions. TWZ writers who visited the General Atomics (GA) booth firsthand pointed out that the company's website mentions past experience in the development of surface-to-surface and surface-to-air munitions, including low-cost and modular munition designs. Its Aeronautical Systems division also has extensive experience with drones. In general, as TWZ noted, the line between unmanned aerial systems, especially long-range kamikaze drones, and cruise missiles, as well as decoy UAVs carrying electronic warfare payloads, is becoming increasingly blurred. A single modular design can also be configured to perform different sets of missions. The fact that GA had not even chosen a name for it at the time of the presentation of the idea for a new charge can speak of the urgency and speed of implementation of this project. At the exhibition stand at the Surface Navy Association, the missile was given the tentative name Strike Missile, which in the Ukrainian version can be translated as -Strike Missile-. TWZ analysts noted that, according to the sketches, the newest charge has a compact and modular flat design. Its distinctive features include: At the moment, the size and technical characteristics of the rocket remain unknown. However, a representative of the General Atomics company noted in a comment to reporters that the project is at the development stage, and the name of the missile may be changed. TWZ believes that the new missile is also likely to be no exception to the trend towards an increasingly blurred line between drones, cruise missiles and air defense systems. What's more, the Strike Missile could be a cost-effective solution that the US military has long needed. And the creation of mass-produced and inexpensive air-launched munitions is driven by necessity: Analysts also noted that the presence of such weapons in the portfolio of General Atomics means that they can be offered directly in conjunction with its proposals for unmanned aircraft and other unmanned systems. -The shock missile can fit both in the internal compartments and under the wings of other drones, including the one that General Atomics is developing as part of the Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft program (CCA),- TWZ experts concluded.

-Biolaboratories-, -troll factories- and something else: what propagandists are trying to accuse USA...	In fact, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) financed Ukrainian mass media quite differently. Some grants, indeed, amounted to 100% of the budget, some - 40-60%, some even less. After all, the media in Ukraine receive support not only from USAID, but also from the European Union, the United Nations, other countries, foundations and organizations. Therefore, the propagandists' statements that practically all mass media in Ukraine -remained on the verge of bankruptcy- after the newly elected US President Donald Trump suspended all grants from USAID for 90 days are not true. But the fakers did not stop at these -throw-ins- and published several portions of their favorite nonsense about -troll factories- and -biolaboratories-. So, pro-Russian sources spread a fake video with the Bloomberg logo on the network, in which it is claimed that USAID -lost control over biolaboratories in Ukraine, although it invested $20 billion in their creation and development.- In fact, it is no longer a secret to anyone that under the pretext of the presence of so-called -biolaboratories- on the territory of Ukraine, which are allegedly engaged in the development of biological weapons, the Russian Federation has been continuing a large-scale disinformation campaign for years, aimed both at discrediting Ukraine and the United States, and at whitewashing its own crimes. Accusing the US Agency for International Development of financing so-called -troll factories-, the Russians shared a screenshot from the USAID website, which allegedly proves the financing of -students from Eastern Europe writing Russophobic comments on the Internet.- Allegedly, almost 500 thousand dollars were allocated for this. However, USAID did not actually fund any -troll factories-. The funds were directed to the implementation of the SURE program - Students for a United and Resilient Europe (-Students for a United and Resilient Europe-). As part of the program, students from 16 Eastern European universities conducted research and implemented campaigns aimed at countering propaganda that sows discord between refugees and local communities. As is known, it is Russian propaganda that actively uses the so-called -botfarms- to manipulate public opinion and spread disinformation. Thousands of automated or human-operated accounts flood social media with fake news, comments and fake likes, creating the illusion of mass support for pro-Russian narratives. But the avalanche of fakes, misinformation and manipulations regarding USAID did not end there. In the X social network, for example, a fake spread that the Agency sponsored the arrival of Hollywood stars to Ukraine during the war&#8230; -The worst thing is that the Russians are trying to use X against US interests. It is the same as if the Tomahawks were flying not at America's enemies, but at America itself. And for this, the Russians will have to be punished,- said the head of the CSDP of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/biolaboratoriyi-fabryky-troliv-i-shhe-deshho-v-chomu-propagandysty-namagayutsya-zvynuvatyty-usaid/	2025-02-11T20:08:01-08:00
Life and death in the same hands: how combat medic -Sam- set a record for the destruction of armored...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Before the war, Sam had no medical education, but when he was offered to become a combat medic, he accepted without hesitation. He passed the school of combat medics, attended numerous courses with foreign instructors and obtained a certificate. -I have never regretted my choice,- he admits. But his mission at the front is not limited to saving lives. -Sam- is also an anti-tank gunner. And although he helps his wounded brothers every day, the destroyed occupiers are on his account even more. His first combat operation took place on May 12. Together with his partner, he was on duty all night, waiting for the assault. At four o'clock in the morning, the enemy forces launched an attack with two MTLBs. The first was destroyed from the Javelin, the second the next day. Later, -Sam- was sent to another position, where he worked at a height. On May 22, a large convoy - seven units of equipment - went to Spirne. As a result of the battle, they knocked out one tank and three -motorcycles-. These successful strikes made -Sam- the unit's record holder for the number of vehicles destroyed. -I don't turn up my nose, we are all equal. After a successful job, the boys were praised, everyone was happy. Everyone does their own thing here,- he notes modestly. But war is not just about hitting shots. Sam clearly remembers the moment an 82 mm mine hit their position. One comrade died instantly, and he stabilized the other and handed over for evacuation. Today, that fighter is back in action. -I have a great team: the guys are cheerful, positive, will always support me and will not leave me in trouble. I am very happy to serve here,- says Sam. His story is an example of dedication, resilience and true love for his country. He not only saves lives, but also does everything to prevent the enemy from advancing further. As reported by ArmyInform, a fighter of the Defense Forces Major Dmytro Polonchak under the pseudonym -Coyote- knows well how to disrupt -hunting- an enemy sniper, turning him into prey, and willingly shares his experience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/zhyttya-i-smert-v-odnyh-rukah-yak-bojovyj-medyk-sem-vstanovyv-rekord-iz-znyshhennya-bronetehniky/	2025-02-11T11:58:19-08:00
Desperadoes from the Air Force: how -Pazl- and his comrades defended Krynka	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Eastern Air Command. After the decision to join the Armed Forces in 2022, -Pazl- got into the anti-aircraft missile regiment, but when the need arose to strengthen the infantry units, he did not think twice. Arriving at the position, -Puzzle- immediately went to work. Not paying attention to the skeptical attitude of the marines, he and his brothers began to train intensively under the guidance of experienced fighters. They practiced anchoring on the shore, maneuvering on the river and battle tactics. -Puzzle- often sailed for evacuation. When the soldiers came under enemy fire, he did not hesitate to gather an evacuation group, get into a boat and, under fire from mines, he sailed after his men. According to Puzzle, the marines quickly changed their opinion of them and started calling them desperate warriors. He told several heroic stories about his fellow Air Force men. One of the exceptional stories was the feat of the -Deputy-. Together with a group of six fighters, he took up positions in Krynk, holding the defense for six days without communication. At a critical moment, the -Deputy- crossed two rivers under enemy fire, reached the headquarters, transmitted the coordinates and returned the same way with the necessary equipment. Or the story of -Kuzi- - a 46-year-old soldier who, after undergoing combat training, together with his comrades destroyed two enemy armored personnel carriers, leaving no chance for the Russian landing party. Eight months of fighting in the Kherson region, endless risks, saving brothers and incredible endurance - this is what is behind the stories of these soldiers. And -Pazl- has no doubts: he is proud of each of them, because it is such people who are creating a new history of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, a serviceman of the 11th brigade named after Mykhailo Hrushevskyi of the National Guard of Ukraine, nicknamed Melman, originally from Dnipro region, began his military service in the ranks in December 2021. 11 brigade named after M. Hrushevskyi NSU, and in two months, Russia launched a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/vidchajduhy-z-povitryanyh-syl-yak-pazl-ta-jogo-pobratymy-boronyly-krynky/	2025-02-11T11:43:42-08:00
Left without wheels: how drones of the Defense Forces turned an enemy armored personnel carrier into...	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The video shows how the calculation of the FPV drone skilfully adjusts the flight of the UAV, pointing it precisely at the enemy armored personnel carrier that was trying to escape from our pilots. The result did not take long - after a good hit, the car burst into flames. -And the enemy did not hesitate to provide our pilots with their APC to improve accuracy and efficiency. The knight warriors performed the practical task perfectly. It was burning brightly,- the brigade said in a statement. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian military continues to mercilessly destroy the enemy at the front. In the Pokrovsk region, the fighters of the 32nd separate mechanized brigade showed how UMBRELLA BBS pilots work without days off , delivering precise strikes on positions around the clock invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/zalyshylys-bez-kolis-yak-dronari-syl-oborony-peretvoryly-vorozhyj-btr-na-kupu-bruhtu/	2025-02-11T11:23:47-08:00
Masquerading as a man, fake certificates and illegal routes: 4 schemes for evaders have been elimina...	informs about this on February 11. For bribes from 3 to 20 thousand US dollars, they issued fake documents to the evaders or transported them across the border bypassing checkpoints. Thus, in Kyiv, a citizen of the Russian Federation who organized the escape channel of conscripts to the European Union as drivers of international flights was arrested -in the heat of the moment-. -For the purpose of the conspiracy, the person involved acted under the guise of a man - cut her hair short, wore men's clothes and introduced herself under a fictitious name. -According to the investigation, before committing this crime, the Russian woman had previously been held criminally responsible for kidnapping and fraud,- the SBU said. Also in Lviv Oblast, a 32-year-old local resident was suspected of offering potential conscripts to flee across the border -bypassing- checkpoints. The attacker assured his clients that his accomplice would meet them outside of Ukraine, who would help the evaders to -legalize- in EU countries. In addition, a local resident was detained in the Poltava region, who decided to make money by -trading- fake medical certificates on disability. The suspect used personal connections among doctors to forge documents. In Ternopil, the military counterintelligence of the SBU detained a local businessman who, with the help of accomplices in the TCC, -wrote off- evaders from the military register based on their health status. -According to all the facts, the persons involved were notified of the suspicion in accordance with the committed crimes under Part 3 of Article 15, part 3 of Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (illegal smuggling of persons across the state border and attempt to commit this crime). Perpetrators face up to 9 years in prison with confiscation of property,- the report says.

One of the units of the 153rd OMBr, holding positions on the hottest part of the front, repelled the enemy's attack and prevented a breakthrough.- The footage shows how, thanks to aerial reconnaissance, an enemy column was detected moving in the direction of the positions of the Ukrainian defenders. After that, an artillery attack was made on the enemy column, as a result of which the enemy suffered losses and fled into the bushes. However, the story did not end there. Aerial reconnaissance drones continued to monitor the area and found all the hiding places where the occupiers tried to hide. After that, they were subjected to mortar fire, which forced the enemy to finally retreat. As reported by ArmyInform, the drones of the 153rd mechanized brigade could not destroy the enemy tank shed, but forced the crew to leave it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ochi-v-nebi-grim-na-zemli-yak-bijczi-syl-oborony-rozgromyly-vorozhu-kolonu-ta-vidbyly-shturm/	2025-02-11T10:54:19-08:00

The video released by the military shows how the enemy occupiers tried to hide among the ruins of the city. But the experience and impeccable accuracy of the Ukrainian gunners left them with only one prospect - to quickly leave the -air-. While FPV drones and new technologies are actively changing the nature of modern warfare, artillery remains a formidable force that has proven itself irreplaceable. It is not only about the power of the caliber, but also about the skill of the warriors, who know how to cancel the enemy's intentions with one well-aimed blow. -First of all, it's beautiful,- comments the military, urging you to watch the video until the end. And indeed, the finale of this wrestling episode is definitely worth watching. As reported by ArmyInform, today, at 6 a.m., the Russian occupiers made two attempts to establish their tricolor over Toretsk.

It is noted that the total number of companies that came under a powerful cyber attack reached 23. According to the sources, this became possible thanks to the cooperation of one of the managers of the holding, who gave the Defense Forces of Ukraine access to several key servers and -holes- in Russian-made cyber security systems. The list of companies that were successfully attacked by Ukrainian cyberwarriors: As a result of the successful actions of the cyber specialists of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, more than 120 physical hypervisor servers were disabled, on which more than 1,500 virtual machines were located, file storages with documentation totaling more than 2,000,000 GB were destroyed, more than 10,000 were disabled employees' computers, all systems and services were stopped. Preliminary calculations indicate that the enemy suffered heavy losses, which may reach several billion rubles. According to the sources, Ukrainian cyber experts reported that this is not the last successfully destroyed large-scale target in cyberspace, the cyber war will gain momentum and cause significant damage to the aggressor. It is noted that, in addition to long-range drones, experts of the cyber front joined the strikes on very painful points of the aggressor country.

More than $10,000 for a chance to freeze in Tisza — a new scheme for evaders was exposed in Transcar...	This was reported by in the DPSU press service on Tuesday, February 11. As noted, the organizer of the criminal scheme turned out to be a 35-year-old resident of Rakhov. In particular, according to border guards, he offered a 24-year-old resident of Ivano-Frankivsk region -a chance to freeze in the Tisza- for $11,000. -Disregarding the life of his client, the ferryman encouraged him to cross the Tisza River. Considering the drop in air temperature in the region to sub-zero indicators, the river and the approaches to it are sometimes covered with ice, and therefore it is extremely dangerous to swim across it,- the message reads.

Special officer -Georgian-: how a teacher became a master of mortar fire	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the 8th Special Purpose Regiment of the SSO named after Prince Izyaslav Mstislavich. With the beginning of a full-scale invasion, -Georgian- immediately decided: his place was in the army. The choice of the unit became obvious for him thanks to the instructor who gave him important knowledge during the training. It was he who advised the 8th SSO regiment, and the fighter did not regret his decision. He chose his nickname -Georgian- not by chance: his father is a Georgian who moved to Ukraine in 1985 because of love. The family is closely connected with the struggle for freedom, because during the war in Georgia, relatives of -Georgians- also fought, and some gave their lives for it. The fighter himself considers the war for Ukraine to be a war for Georgia at the same time - because we have a common enemy. The work of a mortar gunner requires perfect calculations. From the moment of receiving the coordinates to the first shot, usually 2 to 5 minutes pass. The accuracy of shots depends on the knowledge of mathematics, geography and geometry - disciplines in which the -Georgian- understands not only as a soldier, but also as a teacher by profession. Among the most effective operations of the fighter was the destruction of the enemy column near Chasov Yar. Together with their comrades, they hit 30 infantrymen under the cover of tanks and -Grads-, forcing the enemy to retreat. For -Georgyn-, the biggest motivation is his three children. He raises them in a patriotic spirit, teaching the history of Ukraine and Georgia so that the next generation does not repeat the mistakes of the past. On the front lines, the fighter has his own talismans: a bracelet from his wife, given to him on SSO Day, and the image of Vikings and Cossacks, which he embodies in his hairstyle and earring. -Georgian- and his comrades continue their struggle, forcing the enemy to pay for every meter of Ukrainian land every time. And he is sure: victory is only a matter of time. As reported by ArmyInform, a serviceman of the 11th Brigade named after Mykhailo Hrushevskyi of the National Guard of Ukraine, nicknamed Melman, originally from Dnipropetrovsk region, in December 2021 year began his term service in the ranks of the 11th brigade named after M. Hrushevskyi NSU, and in two months, Russia launched a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/speczpryznachenecz-gruzyn-yak-vchytel-stav-majstrom-minometnogo-vognyu/	2025-02-11T09:23:00-08:00

Paladin on the guard of Ukraine: how the guns of the Defense Forces destroy the enemy with American ...	The video of the combat operation of the calculation was published on the brigade's page. -With the appearance of the 155-millimeter howitzer M109 Paladin, our Cossacks have become much more confident, because the American machine allows you to work faster and more accurately, and also expands the range of possibilities: different projectiles perform different functions - damage, mining, illumination,- the brigade said in a statement. The video shows how Ukrainian gunners skillfully aim the howitzer at the target and fire. According to the soldiers of the calculation, with the receipt of 155-mm equipment, the amount of ammunition increased significantly, and the accuracy of fire improved. The firing range of an active-reactive projectile reaches almost 30 kilometers, and the working distance for artillery is about 22 kilometers. -Since a digital guidance and fire control system is installed here, the plus 155 caliber has a wider functionality for projectiles. There are remote mines, there are cluster munitions, there are ordinary high-explosive fragmentation, active-reactive, smoke, lighting and so on,- the fighters say. One of the gunners who was trained on the Paladin in Germany notes the speed and convenience of the machine, as well as its superiority over the 2C3 -Acacia- in terms of loading and aiming speed. -We try so that nothing breaks, we support, fill, lubricate so that it works at full speed,- the fighters add. According to them, they often observe the result of their work from a drone with almost no delay, which brings satisfaction from accurate hits and destroying the enemy. -At this moment, the enemy conducts aerial reconnaissance more actively, uses barrage ammunition -Lancet-, -Privet-82-. It also actively uses FPVs, which have already begun to fly to the firing positions of the artillery,- the fighters note. Despite the threat of enemy shelling, Ukrainian artillerymen continue to perform their work, because they are motivated by the protection of their land and their families. -I am from Kharkiv region, I have four children. And so that they don't reach us, my family, the family motivates,- says one of the fighters. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv direction in the Lyptsi-Hlyboke front line zone, the movement of infantry remains stable. and also the movements of enemy equipment are not recorded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/paladin-na-varti-ukrayiny-yak-garmashi-syl-oborony-troshhat-voroga-amerykanskoyu-sau/	2025-02-11T08:52:32-08:00

Marker -self-other-: The Ministry of Defense is strengthening cooperation with the language ombudsma...	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 11. Serhiy Melnyk said that the state should promote the comprehensive spread of the Ukrainian language in the interpersonal communication of military personnel. According to him, Ukrainian is used 100% in the defense system at the official level, but in informal communication defenders sometimes use Russian words. -This, in particular, is a consequence of more than three hundred years of Russification of the country. We are fully aware of the importance of the Ukrainian language not only in terms of observing the language law, but also in everyday communication. The Ukrainian language in the Armed Forces remains one of the main factors of unity and identification,- noted Serhii Melnyk. Taras Kremin emphasized that in the conditions of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the state language became a key marker of -own-alien-, allowing to quickly identify the enemy and destroy him. He emphasized that in order to strengthen national priorities, strengthen unity and struggle, it is important to strictly adhere to the current legislation, use the state language, and demonstrate an example of respect for the defining factor and main feature of the nation's identity. -Having an extensive network of educational institutions, language courses, state and local language programs, all of us, overcoming the consequences of the colonizers' assimilation policy, strengthen the power of the Ukrainian word, thereby ensuring the full functioning of the state language in all spheres of social life and strengthening the unity of our Ukraine,- Taras Kremin emphasized. Currently, the Ministry of Defense is an organizer and an active participant in a number of measures to implement the state language policy in the Armed Forces. In particular, this is work on normative and legal acts on cultural and language issues, support for measures to spread and popularize the Ukrainian language, holding language competitions, including: As reported by ArmyInform, in all training centers that prepare mobilization personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/z-akczentom-na-psyhologichnu-stijkist-v-zsu-onovleno-programu-bzvp/->implementation of the fifth edition of the program of basic military training (BZVP) with an emphasis on psychological stability.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/marker-svij-chuzhyj-minoborony-posylyuye-spivpraczyu-z-movnym-ombudsmenom/	2025-02-11T08:24:15-08:00

How a smartphone can become a threat at the front: the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces r...	The Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine inform about this. A fighter's smartphone is one of the most vulnerable points in cyberspace. The enemy can use mobile devices to gather intelligence, track whereabouts, intercept conversations, and even influence military morale. Main Threats and Recommendations: Location Tracking: An enemy can determine the movement of military units by merging geolocation data. Recommendation: Turn off GPS and Bluetooth in a combat zone, avoid connecting to unknown Wi-Fi networks. The IMSI-catcher technique (fake base stations) allows the enemy to intercept calls and SMS. Unsecured messengers can become a source of leakage of confidential information. Recommendation: Use only secure communication channels, avoid personal conversations on the phone on the front line. Photos taken on a smartphone contain GPS coordinates, device model and other metadata. The enemy can track the location of units through this data. Recommendation: Turn off geolocation for the camera and delete metadata before publishing a photo. Fake emails and messages may contain malware. Through infected files, the enemy gains access to the devices. Recommendation: Do not open suspicious links or files from unknown senders. The enemy tracks military groups on social media, analyzing activity to gather information. Recommendation: Limit the use of social networks during service, avoid posts with geotags and personal information. In case of capture or loss of the device, all data can fall into the hands of the enemy. Recommendation: Use two-factor authentication and configure automatic data deletion in case of device loss. A soldier's smartphone is not just a means of communication, but a potential security risk to the entire unit. Best practice is to completely avoid the use of civilian devices in a war zone or to strictly follow cyber hygiene rules. Remember: following simple rules can save lives. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Land Forces were the best in the Defense Forces in implementing electronic reports submitted through the Army+ application in January.

Ukrainian -key- to -Lancet-: how paratroopers effectively counter enemy UAVs	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The defenders of Donbas already know well how to fight against enemy UAVs. From now on, the -Lancets- of the Russian occupiers do not just lose their effectiveness - they become the next downed targets for Ukrainian soldiers. -Our comrades from BPS (combat application of systems. - Ed.) do not just oppose enemy drones - they actively hunt them. The enemy's drones more and more often end their flight not where the operators wanted, but on Ukrainian soil - in the form of scrap,- the brigade reports. In addition to fighting Lancets, paratroopers continue to conduct active aerial reconnaissance and attack the enemy with FPV drones. Hitting the occupiers' positions, destroying enemy equipment and firing points became commonplace for them. The only thing that changes is the count of eliminated invaders. And it is steadily growing. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian invaders continue to suffer devastating losses from units of unmanned systems and air defense 46 separate airmobile brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ukrayinskyj-klyuchyk-do-lanczetayak-voyiny-desantnyky-efektyvno-protydiyut-vorozhym-bpla/	2025-02-11T07:32:02-08:00

As informs on February 11, Mariupol City Council, the Center for the Study of the Occupation claims this. -The only Institute of Spatial Planning of the Russian Federation disseminated information about the new construction of the center of occupied Mariupol. They focused on building schools and hospitals. However, it is more likely that a total mortgage development is planned on the site of the real historical part,- the report says. It is noted that cultural and historical monuments, which were built at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, can be destroyed in this way. The Mariupol City Council noted that during the three years of Russian occupation, the local pseudo-administration was hardly involved in the restoration of damaged buildings in the historical part of the city. As reported by ArmyInform, in the temporarily occupied Kherson Oblast, the Russians, in the best traditions of the Nazis, destroyed Ukrainian literature in the captured libraries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/zamist-shkil-i-likaren-zhytlo-dlya-rosiyan-okupanty-planuyut-zrujnuvaty-istorychnyj-czentr-mariupolya/	2025-02-11T07:23:15-08:00
21 days on the brink of life and death: how -Student- took his fellow students out of the environmen...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Mykhailo says that at first he received a summons, but then his armor was still active. After being called again, he decided to go to the Military Commissariat on his own. That's how he got to the rifle battalion, and already there he was entrusted with the duties of an orderly. -It was fate,- says the soldier. - In peaceful life, I was not a doctor, but the war changed everything. We were trained in Norway to save lives on the battlefield. There, we experienced firsthand what hypothermia is - we stood in icy water at minus five degrees to understand how to act in critical conditions.- When their unit got into position, they found themselves isolated, with no food, no ammunition, and no way to retreat. Russian troops mined the roads with -Petals-, and the enemy constantly attacked. However, there was nowhere to retreat. -The first two days it was difficult to realize that there was no going back. But no one broke down. Everyone listened to each other, understood that the assault was inevitable, and when it began, everyone gave a fight, even the wounded. No one ran, everyone did their job,- Mykhailo recalls. Twenty-one days in the trenches under constant fire is a test not only physically, but also psychologically. The 15th day became especially difficult, when some fighters began to be unable to withstand the pressure: -Here it was important to find words of support, to give people the opportunity to change their shift schedule in order to preserve their fighting spirit.- On the 21st day, a group of three fighters broke through to them - the rest died in minefields. That's when the order to leave came. However, the confusion with the coordinates almost cost them their lives - they went in the wrong direction, realizing the mistake already on the way: -I ordered everyone to turn back - and everyone turned back. No one objected, everyone knew that time was short, and acted in concert.- Later, their unit was evacuated. Despite the first combat experience, all survived, showed iron endurance and self-sacrifice. Mykhailo has no doubt that war changes everyone. But he believes that he survived for a reason: -If the war ends tomorrow, then I was needed for something bigger. And now the main thing is to survive and win.- As reported by ArmyInform, -It was hell- - this is how the fighters of the 58th Motorized Infantry Brigade with the call sign -Student- describe their three weeks on the front lines. Together with four brothers, he fell into a real trap where every day was a struggle for survival.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/21-den-na-mezhi-zhyttya-i-smerti-yak-student-vyviv-pobratymiv-iz-otochennya/	2025-02-11T07:03:08-08:00

According to him, the assault took place according to the traditional scheme — the armored personnel carriers dropped infantrymen, who are usually used as meat for assaults, closer to the Ukrainian positions. After that, they tried to attack the firing points of the Defense Forces. -This mechanized assault was repulsed. This was done by infantry, our unmanned systems battalion and artillery.

Will feed 250 soldiers in the field: rear support will strengthen -Marichka-	On February 11, informs the Ministry of Defense with reference to the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment. The -Marichka- field kitchen was manufactured by a Ukrainian enterprise to replace the Soviet models. -The manufacturer listened to the wishes of the military to modernize and improve the preparation of hot food in field conditions. The advantages of the field kitchen of the army of one of the NATO countries were also taken into account,- the message says. The new field kitchen is built on a single-axle truck trailer chassis. The MOU noted that, compared to the Soviet model, the Ukrainian -Marichka- has a number of advantages. -In particular, with similar overall dimensions, the domestic model can prepare twice as much first and second dishes. In addition, the kitchen has two ovens with a volume of 55 liters each, the necessary dishes and technical containers,- the Ministry of Defense explained. -Marichka- runs on diesel or solid fuel. Thanks to the optimized heating system, cooks food faster, while using less fuel. The built-in modular umbrella cover allows the staff not to install an additional tent, which saves time for deployment to the working position.

Fiasco of the Soviet Union near Kotlyny — the occupiers wanted to hide in the cemetery, but the tape...	This was reported in the 425 separate assault regiment -SKALA-, publishing a video of the defeat of the enemy. It shows that the first assault attempt was made by the Russians on a truck loaded with BC. -At the entrance to the settlement, a Russian car is blown up by a mine. Part of the group from the body runs around the cemetery, part remains near the car. They start working here with everything. Arta covers the landing zone with cluster shells, our drones with resets and FPV are in the sky,- says the description of the released footage. As a result, six soldiers of the Soviet Union were eliminated near the truck, and the rest were left lying in the cemetery by the 200. Also, the ammunition they were carrying in the back of the truck eventually detonated, leaving the truck a pile of burning scraps. After that, the occupiers tried to bring the landing party on armored personnel carriers, but they were immediately met by kamikaze drones. -The affected equipment tried to reach the houses so that the landing party inside could immediately hide somewhere,- says -SKALA-, however, as can be seen in the video, they did not succeed in this either, and the enemy's armored vehicles eventually burned down along with everyone who was inside. As reported by ArmyInform, last week the Defense Forces stopped more than 700 enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/fiasko-zs-rf-bilya-kotlynogo-okupanty-hotily-shovatysya-na-czvyntari-ale-kasety-ne-zalyshyly-yim-zhodnogo-shansu/	2025-02-11T05:42:11-08:00
Until the tank arrived, enemy fortifications in Donetsk region were destroyed at close range	The video was published on February 11 on the brigade's channel. -We are publishing a video of our work in Donetsk region, where our soldiers are constantly destroying the enemy and fortifications. As soon as the enemy sees our tanks, he immediately understands that they have few chances. It happened this time as well. The enemy's bunkers were the goal. Now they are not so strong anymore, because ours hit without mistakes,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleksandr, a mechanic-driver of one of the tank battalions of the 1st Siver tank brigade has experience in service a tank operator, says that even in the most difficult moments, when the enemy is trying to destroy combat vehicles by all available means, it is in the tank that he feels the most protected.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/doty-doky-ne-pryyihav-tank-na-donechchyni-vprytul-znyshhyly-vorozhi-fortyfikacziyi/	2025-02-11T05:19:32-08:00
-They divide themselves into categories A and B- — in Chasovoy Yar, continuous shelling and attacks ...	Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyni telethon . According to him, each attack follows the same scenario. Enemy infantrymen rush out of armored vehicles and run around the basements. All these small groups of infantry have to be constantly searched and destroyed. -When we talk about small infantry groups, there may be a false impression that a whole brigade is fighting against three invaders. There are many such groups, and from time to time they try to drive in a large number of vehicles. Some are distracting, others are trying to enter the rear,- said Ivan Petrychak. He noted that this happens all the time. The enemy in the -non-stop- mode replenishes its units with new soldiers. There is no shortage of Russians willing to fight. As Petrychak says, the prisoners say that the main motivation is money. -They divide themselves into categories A and B. These are those who signed the contract and those who come from the colony - they have the motivation to remove the criminal case from themselves. And plus money. Because the money they are paid for signing a contract or entering the army is a large amount. And plus a salary of 210,000 rubles plus or minus,- said the representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo. As reported ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsk direction -hot- happened there 47 skirmishes. This is about half of all battles on the Eastern Front.

According to reported, the agents of the Russian Federation turned out to be a 20-year-old unemployed man who -darkly- involved a 17-year-old teenager in his subversive activities, promising him -quick earnings-. According to the investigation, on the instructions of their Russian curator, they were supposed to secretly install a GPS tracker on a special vehicle accompanying the convoys of the Defense Forces, so that the occupiers could monitor the movement routes and arrival points of Ukrainian troops in the frontline areas in real time. -According to the agent's instructions, the minor tracked down the parking place of the ZSU special vehicle. After waiting for dusk, he tried to fix a -beacon- on it. At that moment, the young man was detained by SBU officers. At the same time, the Ukrainian special service detained the main agent who coordinated the criminal activities of the minor. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of subversive activity were seized from the detainees, as well as a GPS tracker with which they were going to -equip- a military vehicle,- the message reads. In addition, during the investigation, it was established that the agent of the Russian Federation additionally fixed for the Russians the locations of the TCC and parking places of the service vehicles of the Ukrainian troops. -For the conspiracy, the agent rented housing on a daily basis, and maintained communication with the occupants through an anonymous chat in the messenger. The investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property,- the SBU added.

Enemy attack aircraft were just disembarking from the BMP when the drone flew over it for the first time. This frightened the mechanic-driver so much that he began to make sharp movements back and forth and chase the fighters he had brought.

It is directly manpower, infantry. But they are also getting exhausted, and their advantage is slowly diminishing. Because they suffer great losses in personnel. These are tens of thousands of people. Well, if, for example, there were irrecoverable losses over the past month, then only in the Pokrovsky direction - seven thousand,- Viktor Tregubov said.

In addition, the Czech Republic, as a member of the Coalition, launched its own initiative to supply ammunition, supplying Ukraine in 2024 with more than one and a half million large-caliber projectiles, of which half a million rounds are 155 mm. And thanks to the -Danish model- of financing the Ukrainian military defense forces, the Defense Forces received new -Bohdana- self-propelled guns. -In general, within the framework of the work of the Contact Group on Assistance to Ukraine, eight coalitions of capabilities were formed: the Air Force Coalition, the Coalition of Integrated Air Defense and ABM, the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, the Coalition of Drones, the IT Coalition, the Coalition of Artillery, the Coalition of Armored Vehicles and Maneuverability, and the Coalition for Minesweeping,- added the Ministry of Defense.

Prosecutors proved in court that the accused was familiar with the victim and knew that her husband had gone missing during a combat mission. Acting out of self-serving motives, the accused informed the woman that her husband was in Russian captivity, and that he had -connections- in the special service and could facilitate his release.

Don't be like Ivan: a resident of the Zaporizhzhia region forcibly mobilized by the Russian army is ...	In this video, the sixth prisoner in a row is from the Zaporizhzhia region. -(unintelligible)&#8230; Ivan Dmytrovych September 14, 2003. Zaporozhye region, Mykhailivskyi district, Mykhailivka village. Group of 34 -I don't remember any more-, - says the boy, who was captured by our paratroopers, about himself. Note that Ivan is only 21 years old. We are still debating whether to lower the conscription age from 25 to 21 or 18. And in the Russian occupation military committee, no one asked Ivan how old the conscript is - he is just 21 years old already on the battlefield, already fighting under the Russian flag and has already failed. Although - remained alive and that's good. And still, a significant number of our contributors in social networks continue to hate the military personnel of the TCC and SP. And positive posts about this topic are simply drowning in hundreds, thousands of reposted -news- from Russian bots. The material of our author about how he passed the VLK to sign a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine was subjected to hate by readers (real readers?). In his comments, the author was accused of lying, of living in a parallel reality. Almost the same thing is said in one post from Facebook contributors: -The TCC approached, asked to show documents and drive to the Military Commissariat. They checked what was on the record, gave them tea and sent them home. I didn't have time to call in the sleet.- I can tell you dozens more of these stories. &#8230;Why doesn't anyone say anything good?.. &#8230;Because you are more interested in reading something related to gyno..&#8230; &#8230;The word of mouth radio is still working, one story is told from mouth to ear through 10 people and from one story about 1 mobilized person becomes 10 mobilized boys who storm Donetsk from the Military Commissariat on the 3rd day with an AK-100 assault rifle. It's funny!-. Yes, it's funny. And it is difficult to hear the voices of the active military again in the noisy row of treasonous posts. Thus, on the air of -Public Radio-, the commander of the 3rd separate battalion -Brodyaga- as part of the 411th regiment of control of unmanned aviation complexes Ilya Mashina told-advised what Ukrainian men should do for a long time. And why: -I recommend to young and healthy men: get ready, now the third year is coming to an end, you could take at least basic training courses. Because the enemy will not stop at the borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region, and I know for sure that if you do not defend Ukraine and are not in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, then you will be in the Russian armed forces and storm Europe. And this shows in the practice of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya (regions - ed.)&#8230; where the enemy entered, now they (inhabitants of the temporarily occupied territories - ed.) serve there.- But will the Ukrainian men, who in 10 years have not found time to get to the TCC, hear the serviceman Ilya? Will they continue to sit quietly at home, afraid to leave the apartment and catch the eyes of their children and wife?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ne-bud-yak-ivan-prymusovo-mobilizovanyj-armiyeyu-rf-meshkanecz-zaporizkoyi-oblasti-vzhe-voyuye-proty-ukrayiny/	2025-02-11T01:57:48-08:00
-Having a hat-: a DPSU fighter -Coyote- shared his experience of hunting an enemy sniper	As states in the State Border Service, this Ukrainian soldier took part in combat operations in the Lyman and Bakhmut areas, -where there was no room for mistakes.- -Holding, defending, counterattacking, clearing - these are the tasks usually faced by the border guard. He is not one of those who underestimates the enemy, but together with the unit he led, a sniper rifle, DShK or MK-19, they quite often became the cause of a failed enemy assault, the impossibility of advancing, or other problems for him,- the DPSU said. According to the fighter himself, if the Ukrainian positions get hot because of the overwhelming enemy forces, he takes his sniper rifle to support his comrades. -We made a decision to -give at the drop of a hat-&#8230; If, for example, up to 10 people storm our position, if you overwhelm two, count on the fact that the remaining eight are already starting to run back and take their own. Their assault failed. Perfect,- Coyote explains. When Ukrainian defenders are threatened by a Russian sniper, Dmytro Polonchak also knows what to do. -Heard from the reports that they work on a spot basis. The sniper is working specifically, you have to do something with him. We took a long time to get to that sniper, we got there, the second number gave me his coordinates, where he was, which balcony, which floor, and I was already working directly on him,- the soldier recalls. But how this duel ended in the end, see in the video.

The enemy has an advantage in artillery, so the Defense Forces have to compensate for this factor with the accuracy and training of drone pilots who destroy bunkers, generators, and generally destroy enemy logistics. -It can be said that our pilots of large drones were offering to the enemy. They offered, as usual, large tank mines that fall on heads. All in order to be as uncomfortable as possible now, when it is frosty and cold.

The leftovers are smoked at night — near Pokrovsk, a wave of infantry attacks in cars	Serhii Tsehotskyi, an officer of the 59th separate mechanized brigade named after Yakov Handziuk, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, shelling is almost 24 hours a day. In the dark part of the day, there are fewer assaults. For the most part, the Defense Forces are finishing off what is left of the enemy's daytime assaults. They try to smoke out the underdogs from their hiding places at night, not to leave even a few people near our positions. -A large number of occupiers is negated. Equipment, mainly passenger cars, is also destroyed as quickly as possible. For them, it is a one-way street. They drove to the positions in passenger cars, disembarked, and then the task was to escape back. They rarely succeed in this,- said Serhii Tsehotskyi. As ArmyInform reported, a video appeared on social networks with a Russian invader that was hit by a drone of the Defense Forces in Toretsk and died right under the Ukrainian flag.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/nedobytkiv-vykuryuyut-vnochi-bilya-pokrovska-hvyli-atak-pihoty-na-legkovykah/	2025-02-11T00:32:52-08:00
They turned guns into -pipes- - destruction of enemy artillery	The video of the combat work was published on February 11 on the detachment's channel. Inspired by the example of the Magyar Birds, the Phoenix pilots destroyed the guns by burning holes in their barrels. After this, the gun can no longer shoot, it has to change the barrel, and this part is very scarce. Consequently, the capabilities of Russian artillery in the Kharkiv region were reduced. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Phoenix- detachment destroyed a lot of Russian armored vehicles. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/peretvoryly-garmaty-na-sopilky-znyshhennya-vorozhoyi-artyleriyi/	2025-02-11T00:22:01-08:00

Bohdan Petrenko, the head of the communications department of the 48th separate artillery brigade, told about this on the air of -Social News-. According to him, the weather in general now plays one of the decisive roles in the course of hostilities. So, for example, the soils in the brigade's area of ​​responsibility are mainly black soil, and when warming occurs, passage for any equipment becomes much more difficult. Sometimes the Ukrainian weather actually kills the occupiers. -For example, there was a case when the Russians attacked. It was snowing in the morning, they put on white masks. But by a certain hour the snow had melted. And their white maschalats were kind of white spots on a gray background. This assault was stopped,- Bohdan Petrenko noted. As reported ArmyInform, fighters of the unmanned systems battalion 110 of the mechanized brigade named after Corporal General Mark Bezruchka tracked down in advance the assault group of the occupiers. The invaders launched an attack without the cover of equipment that the Russian command guards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/mashalaty-buly-bilymy-plyamamy-na-siromu-foni-na-novopavlivskomu-napryamku-okupantiv-vbyvaye-navit-pogoda/	2025-02-11T00:11:34-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, last day the total losses of the Russian invaders amounted to 1390 people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/atakovano-saratovskyj-npz-yakyj-vidigraye-vazhlyvu-rol-u-zabezpechenni-zs-rf/	2025-02-10T23:23:57-08:00
Spotted, flew in, destroyed - another assault of the Russians choked on their own blood	The video of combat work was released on February 11 on the battalion channel. The invaders launched an attack without the cover of equipment that the Russian command protects. The enemy thought that at night he would be able to sneak up to our positions. But our operators proved the fallacy of such hopes. As a result of hunting with kamikaze drones, the group was broken up. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 110th mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka recorded how during the movement along the Great In Novosilka, the Russians cover themselves with the civilian population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/pomityly-pryletily-znyshhyly-chergovyj-shturm-rosiyan-zahlynuvsya-u-vlasnij-krovi/	2025-02-10T23:08:19-08:00

A real revolution in the field of drones: an expert on the unique Ukrainian experience, the newest W...	Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. -In fact, we, Ukrainians, have now carried out a coup in two parts. Part one: the use of FPV drones. The level of skill of various types, both quadcopters and on the wing (UAV type - ed.) has reached so high that aiming takes place - at the head, even at the knee of the enemy. One very serious example for 2024. In the dry weather cycle from conventional May to conventional September, we destroyed more than 4,500 units of enemy artillery. If you divide by 72 - this is how the full-time trunk brigade is completed - then it is more than 60 brigades. This is a fantastic thing, incredible. If, conditionally, until the middle of 2023, the bulk of damage to equipment was done with the help of artillery, then starting from the middle of 2023 - especially for the past year, when the indicators of the production and use of drones by us, Ukrainians, increased 10 times - then 50% of the destruction of all equipment, and sometimes and up to 80% in individual locations of personnel destruction is FPV drones. We are the first, I emphasize, in the world to use these unmanned systems on such a large scale. We are the first in the world to have systems of unmanned complexes starting from the mouth. We have no doubt that we will be the first in the world to form a separate brigade of unmanned systems, because we already have a separate command, as a separate type of the Armed Forces. This is the first revolution that Ukrainians really wrote on their own battlefield in the eternal Russian-Ukrainian war. But there is one more nuance that we somehow ignored, it is no less important. It was with the help of naval drones — the beautiful Magura-5 and C Baby — that we managed to expel the regular Russian fleet, which was considered one of the best in the Black Sea, from their bases in Sevastopol. What is the conclusion? The state, which did not have a classic fleet, solved this problem (regular Russian fleet in the Black Sea - ed.) precisely thanks to unmanned systems. And this is an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of naval warfare. So, let's summarize. Indeed, the phenomenon called -unmanned systems of various types of purpose- is being actualized on our battlefields. It should also be mentioned here that there are not only air and sea, but also ground robotic complexes. In fact, a revolution of a serious global order is taking place. It will determine the logic of hostilities for several decades to come. But there is a nuance. You can't look at these systems as if they were some new Wunderwaffe, which is, they say, everything - now only drones. Artillery will still have meaning and significance. And still the main fire shafts with a powerful coefficient of action, because after all, 3-5 kg ​​of explosives are not equal to a heavy 50-kilogram projectile - will remain in the war as a phenomenon. Not to mention aviation. As Winston Churchill once said, aviation is the cavalry of modern times. Indeed, the sixth generation of aviation is being developed in a binary sense: that there will be both a pilot and an aircraft with an unmanned system based on machine learning. But drones will not fully replace the main strike capabilities of artillery and aviation. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully approach the part that they (UAVs - ed.), they say, have no alternative. This is a serious high-quality weapon that needs to be developed, but we also remember about other weapons systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/spravzhnya-revolyucziya-u-czaryni-droniv-ekspert-pro-unikalnyj-ukrayinskyj-dosvid-novitnyu-wunderwaffe-ta-4-tysyachi-vorozhyh-stvoliv/	2025-02-10T21:06:08-08:00
The occupiers took a missile carrier with -Calibre- to the Black Sea	This was reported in the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -There is 1 enemy ship in the Black Sea, which is a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 4 missiles,- the message reads. At the same time, there are currently no enemy ships in the Sea of ​​Azov. Five more Russian ships, two of which also carry Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 22 missiles, remain in the Mediterranean. During the day, in the interests of the Russian Federation, passage through the Kerch Strait was carried out: -the Russian Federation continues to violate the International Convention on the Protection of Life at Sea of ​​1974. (SOLAS), turning off automatic identification systems,- the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the Commander of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine discussed the security situation in the Black Sea with the Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/okupanty-vyvely-u-chorne-more-raketonosij-z-kalibramy/	2025-02-10T21:04:22-08:00
-Innovator- at the front: what the modern Ukrainian armored car is capable of. Report from Donetsk r...	The brigade notes: -Novator- combat vehicles demonstrate good combat capabilities when performing tasks on the front line. -Now, without armored vehicles, it is almost impossible to deliver infantrymen to the front line, transport food or ammunition, and evacuate the wounded. Armor protection, speed and passability on country roads and hard-to-reach areas are especially valuable in cars,- says the driver of -Novator- Kostyantyn. A boy from the Kirovohrad region, mobilized in the Armed Forces since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. Served in the 69th Rifle Battalion, then joined the 117th Brigade. -We work mainly at night and in the morning. Cars in gray weather or even better in fog are not too visible to the enemy, so they are effective for us. Quickly deliver people, weapons and BC to the positions, and just as quickly left the front line. That's it - the task is accomplished,- says Konstantin. The cabin can accommodate 5 military personnel together with the driver. In the rear part, the landing compartment is quite large, designed for 8 people, but 10 soldiers in full equipment and with equipment can fit in there. Plus the transportation of BC, the car can even fit the Stugna-P ATGM, which is a large stationary installation, along with missiles. -The armored car is completely Ukrainian-made, has a basic Ford chassis, has a diesel engine, and an automatic transmission. The maximum speed on the highway is 140 km/h, a very maneuverable car. It can overcome a small swampy area and softened fields, of course, the speed is not the same as on the highway, but it is quite decent. On a normal road, it rips from under itself, but you need to be careful on turns, reduce speed, it can skid. If FPV drones attack, there is a much better chance of running away from them. The armored capsule can withstand shrapnel damage, hits from large-caliber machine guns, and even detonations from anti-tank mines. Fortunately, the boys have not yet had to fall on mines. Infrared lighting is installed for driving at night. By itself, the car is equipped with a EW to counter enemy UAVs and a communication system. Also, the car is equipped with NATO-style anti-mine seats and a fire extinguishing system. Each wheel of the -Innovator- is additionally equipped with rubber that works on the principle of a cushion. If the wheel is punctured by fragments, this cushion allows the car to continue moving without stopping. The 117th brigade received Roshel Senator armored vehicles from Canada as part of international military-technical assistance. These vehicles are also used by infantry and other front-line units. -I traveled on both Rochely and Novatori. I can already compare. The main advantage of the Ukrainian car is its chassis. Springs were installed at the back, so the -Novator- -catches potholes- much more gently. And -Rochelle- has springs, so it is thrown a lot on a bad road. The guys who go in the landing gear are not very comfortable. But instead, more people get into the Canadian armored car. The obvious disadvantage of the Canadian is the high center of mass located at the back, and if you drive carelessly and make a sharp turn, you can turn over on its side. Plus, the car likes to get stuck, it's hard for her, after all, our swampy roads are given. The armor protection of the -Rochelle- is generally sufficient, allowing it to withstand fragments from projectiles, even 122 mm caliber.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/novator-na-fronti-na-shho-zdatnyj-suchasnyj-ukrayinskyj-bronovyk-reportazh-z-donechchyny/	2025-02-10T20:45:56-08:00
Achieving Defense Autonomy: Turkey Moves to Mass Production of New Short-Range Air Defense Complex	As informed the authors of the Turkish Defense Agency portal, this system was completely developed in-house to raise Turkey's air defense capabilities to a new level, ArmyInform reports. Haluk Gjorgun, Minister of Defense Industry (SSB), shared the news on social networks, emphasizing the exceptional accuracy of the system in intercepting targets at a sufficiently long distance and at a considerable height. -The results demonstrated the technological maturity of HİSAR-O and the efficiency of Turkey's manufacturing processes. ASELSAN and ROKETSAN, in cooperation with local subcontractors, play a central role in the supply of competitive defense systems,- the Turkish official emphasized. HİSAR-O is a short-range air defense system designed to counter a wide range of threats, including aircraft, helicopters, drones, cruise missiles and air-to-surface munitions. It has a range of 25 km and can intercept targets at an altitude of more than 15 km using missiles equipped with radar and infrared (IIR) guidance. Its equipment includes a fire control center, a radar, three missile launchers, an optical-electronic system, a transport and handling unit. This modular architecture, combined with the ability to engage 360° targets using vertical launchers, provides operational flexibility. According to the analysts of the Dutch portal defense technology research Army Recognition (AR), the system includes advanced technologies such as mid-course navigation through data channels and remote control using wired or wireless communication. It is compatible with Link 1,11B and 16, tactical data lines, working within the framework of an open architecture that allows the integration of future technologies. Integrated testing and simulation systems provide efficient maintenance and high operational readiness, meeting the requirements of modern air defense scenarios. A systematic approach was followed in the development process of HİSAR-O. After the design and qualification tests, the prototypes undergo acceptance tests. The certification of the production line and the stages of pilot production ensure the compatibility of the project with the requirements of large-scale production. These rigorous processes reduce risk and ensure budgets and deadlines are met. In addition, batch testing during production ensures consistent quality and includes on-site feedback for potential adjustments. Compared to systems such as the American Patriot or the Russian S-400, HİSAR-O offers an intermediate solution. With a range of 25 km, it has a shorter radius than the Patriot (160 km) or the S-400 (400 km), but provides excellent mobility thanks to its integration on the chassis of a Mercedes-Benz 6×6 truck. This mobility, according to the experts of the AR portal, combined with simpler logistical support makes the Turkish air defense complex well suited for the tactical and operational needs of the Turkish Armed Forces, in contrast to the more complex requirements for the deployment of the S-400 complex purchased by it from Russia at the time. The transition to mass production of the HİSAR-O demonstrates Turkey's ability to independently design and manufacture advanced defense systems. By strengthening the strategic capabilities of the Turkish Armed Forces while reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, HİSAR-O makes a significant contribution to the country's defense autonomy. This achievement also highlights the growing competitiveness of Turkey's defense industry on the world stage. Testing of the HİSAR-O air defense complex.

What did a shooter with the call sign -Luga- receive -Golden Cross-: about training, fart, friendshi...	-Skillfully commanded the actions of the assault group, due to which the enemy suffered significant losses in manpower and equipment-, - this is how the actions are described, for which the serviceman of the 142nd separate mechanized brigade Vyacheslav with the call sign -Luga- received the Commander-in-Chief's award - -Golden Cross-. It is difficult for Vyacheslav to remember the details of the battle. What for military statistics is success on the ground comes at a price. Then three of his comrades died: -Let me say this - we simply defended our position, giving our comrades the opportunity to gain a foothold and further destroy the enemy. There were two attempts to take our position. We beat them back. That was the task. I just did my job. And how it feels from the inside, I don't want to talk about it. The guys who died are Heroes: Shaman, Olshava, Gypsy.- While working with the second group, Vyacheslav was injured. When he was brought to the evacuation center, it was unexpected for him that he was congratulated and praised. Then he learned about the award. When asked how motivating this is, he jokes that he would be happy to receive motivation in the form of a monetary equivalent: -Not for myself, of course. You understand, we lose all the time. Sometimes to repair cars, then we need to buy some equipment,- and adds: -Of course, awards for soldiers are important—it's attention, because they see you and your work.- &nbsp; Vyacheslav spent most of his life working in the restaurant business in various positions: from waiter to service manager. He had no combat experience before mobilization, but he felt what war was while still a civilian. The man was born in Luhansk, then moved to Kharkiv Oblast. In 2022, he met the large-scale phase of the war in Kupyansk. Recalls how the Russians taught the local population to call the occupation -liberation-. -Whoever spoke to them -incorrectly- was explained by force. They could be stopped and beaten in the middle of the street. They did not care about people's affection, they had enough fear. At the same time, it was clearly visible that there is no unity among the Russians. They are angry at each other. There was a vested interest in making money from the war. When they fled, they abandoned their own - wounded, drunk. Those who could not get into the trucks were simply thrown at checkpoints. People then wrapped such drunkards with scotch tape and handed them over to our military,- Vyacheslav recalls. Joined the Defense Forces in July 2023. At first he was a cook. But due to the lack of people, he ended up in the infantry. Now he is a shooter with the call sign -Luga- (in memory of his hometown - ed.). -BZVP was held in part. The instructors all had combat experience and were indifferent to their work. For the fact that I managed to persevere in difficult moments, I am now grateful, including to them. Many say that in such a war, luck determines a large percentage. To me, the concept of a fart is like a cat's life. Someone has 9 of them, and someone has only one. But if you are not prepared, no fart will help you. Preparation, attention, concentration are the real keys to accomplishing the task and coming back alive,- Vyacheslav believes. Vyacheslav studied in the Czech Republic for another month, although, he laughs, at that stage Ukrainians could already teach foreign colleagues something. -They didn't expect the way we -navigated- them at practice. They were surprised. It's nice when professional soldiers are beaten by yesterday's civilians. So we have the spirit and flair.- Vyacheslav talks about the need for psychological work with fighters. He himself would not hesitate to contact a specialist. But in parts of psychologists who actually work by specialty, there are few, and during rehabilitation - how lucky. The fighter himself says that when he was treated after his injury, communication with a psychologist was -for a tick- - a standard test survey. Meanwhile, tension levels are high and trigger situations abound. -I was on examination in Dnipro. I was going to the train station in a tram. And the conductor spoke to me, at first it seemed as if everything was normal, a person worried that the front was approaching. And suddenly he says: -we would have already surrendered the city and everything.- So that people are not afraid of destruction.- And I ask her: -What do you think would happen to the military personnel who are here in hospitals and hospitals?- Do you understand that they would be killed?-. And she says: -I didn't think about it-.. You can still find this kind of thinking in people.- Vyacheslav laughs, if he has to deal with psychological problems himself, then the way is simple - to occupy himself with something. For the opportunity to go for a walk and just look around. Call loved ones. He perfectly understands that, like most of his brothers, he postpones painful reflection - dwelling on grief and loss for later. All together, they save themselves with humor and mutual support. -I was lucky to experience true brotherhood. Of course, civil collectives happened to be different. They were also quite friendly. But people there did not become close to each other so quickly and so much, as here. During a year and a half of service, I saw interaction, mutual understanding. Disputes are resolved much more calmly than in ordinary life. What brings people together the most? I will tell you this: after the first exit to zero, the question of whether someone -sent- someone does not arise. But friendship in war has a painful side, and that is losses.- Vyacheslav replaced the struggle with fears in his mind with the philosophical -must, then must-: -It's scary until you enter the battle, then there are no thoughts. Focused on the task of survival for you and those with you. Covers after a few days of silence and awareness. You understand where you came from. Every exit is different. But once you've experienced this delayed fear, it's a normal, healthy feeling that you don't want that experience to happen again. That is, you have to overcome this, not fear. Pick yourself up and go again.- Vyacheslav dreams of returning to civilian life and opening his own bakery. And while he ponders philosophical questions about how to stand when those who are like dogs have been pitted against you for years, and a large part of your society is just learning to make complex adult decisions. In his opinion, the issue of psychological readiness is critical: -Psychological preparation is needed. Appropriate selection is required and physical and professional skills are secondary. Because no matter how diligent a person is on the range, if he drops his weapon when he has to cover his comrades, it can turn into a tragedy. There are people who cannot psychologically cross a certain barrier. And they won't be able to. My personal position is that there is only one harm from a hare sitting under a bush. I've seen them. Most of them are already -two hundred-. They cannot shoot at the enemy, even when they are being shot at. When moving around the landing, it is a burden that falls into a stupor, runs away, hides, screams. And we can't throw them away. What is the point of this to the state? Some costs, I will say harshly. The selection must be realistic. You can still deal with -I don't want to join the army, let my neighbor go,- but not with stupor. The shooter should shoot at a person, not at a target on the shooting range. As an enemy do not name - this is the same person on two legs with two hands. We see the enemy very close. Any indecision is your death or the death of your brothers.- When asked whether he thinks he has become a fatalist, Vyacheslav answers with a smile: -If you are destined to die by choking on a spoonful of soup, you will not drown in a puddle. If I was destined to die from the reset, then so be it. For me, to be afraid is simply to waste vital energy and time for no apparent reason. To clarify the relationship with oneself. You have to live here and now. In actions and deeds. Such times fell to us. Kyiv was already taken in three days, and they received a cap at a time. So, we can -take it easy- more. And we will be-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/za-shho-otrymav-zolotyj-hrest-strilecz-z-pozyvnym-luga-pro-pidgotovku-fart-druzhbu-na-vijni-ta-mriyu-pro-pekarnyu/	2025-02-10T20:10:59-08:00
A house and a car, a hotel and a villa with a bunker: why does hostile propaganda compare Volodymyr ...	Volodymyr Zelensky allegedly bought Hitler's house for $14.2 million. An article about this was apparently published by a German publication. But the source referred to by the propagandists does not have any real evidence of such an event, including official registers, contracts or public data that would confirm it. Furthermore, the material has neither the posting date nor the author, which is a typical sign of disinformation. In addition, the site, which is used as the primary source of news, does not contain any contacts, and the specified names appearing on it are fictitious. Similar fakes are regularly distributed by the enemy with the aim of discrediting and demonizing the President of Ukraine and his family. Yes, in October of last year, a fake was actively spreading on the Internet that Volodymyr Zelensky allegedly bought Hitler's state car for 15 million dollars. In November, enemy propaganda tried to convince its consumers that the President of Ukraine allegedly bought the Palace Des Neiges hotel in the ski resort of Courchevel in France for 88 million euros. And in January, the enemy spread a fake about the alleged purchase by the President of a -villa with an underground bunker- for 17 million euros on the -island of billionaires- Saint Barthelemy.

It is noted that a 36-year-old resident of Lviv Oblast undertook to prepare a package of documents and further escort through one of the checkpoints in Lviv Oblast for a citizen of Ukraine of conscription age for $1,500. -The woman promised the client that she would help remove him from the military register and secure an invitation for employment in Germany,- the report said. During the searches, law enforcement officers seized mobile phones, bank cards, as well as other things that can be used as evidence in criminal proceedings. -Currently, the person involved in the case has been notified of suspicion for h. 3 Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (Illegal transportation of persons across the state border). The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of deprivation of liberty for a period of seven to nine years. Other persons who may be involved in this scheme are being identified,- the DPSU said. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/falshyvi-dokumenty-za-1500-i-zagroza-9-rokiv-tyurmy-likvidovano-kanal-nezakonnogo-vyyizdu-za-kordon/	2025-02-10T11:53:22-08:00

The comment under the video speaks for itself: -Hell for the enemy on the front lines! Destroying enemy fortifications, transports and infantry. Clearly. Aptly. No compromises. — Direction: Kramatorsk.- As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian military continues to methodically destroy the enemy not only on the ground, but also in the air. Fighters of the 5th Assault Brigade conducted a successful -hunt- for an enemy drone that was trying to conduct reconnaissance at low altitude.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/peklo-dlya-okupantiv-syly-oborony-pokazaly-yak-nyshhat-voroga-na-kramatorskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-10T11:37:29-08:00
A Russian propagandist who called on the enemy to turn Sumy into a -dead zone- was sentenced	The SBU informs about this on February 10. According to the investigation, in June 2023, Mikheev called on the command of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation to carry out a series of massive rocket-bomb and artillery strikes on Sumy. -In this way, the attacker proposed to turn the frontline Ukrainian city into a -dead zone- in which, according to him, -no living people should remain.- Mikheev, who positions himself as a -political scientist-, made this thesis public during one of his broadcasts on the Kremlin's mouthpiece, Vesti FM, the SBU said. In addition, he regularly appears on Solovyov's propaganda talk shows, where he calls for the continuation of airstrikes and shelling of civilian infrastructure in the border areas of Ukraine. On the basis of the collected evidence, the court found Mikheev guilty of committing a crime under Art. 2 Art. 110 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine) and sentenced him to 8 years of imprisonment. -Since the perpetrator is hiding in Russia, comprehensive measures are underway to bring him to responsibility for crimes against our state,- the message reads. As reported by ArmyInform, an enemy agent was detained in Donetsk who was correcting Russian airstrikes on Kramatorsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/zasudzheno-moskovskogo-propagandysta-yakyj-zaklykav-rosiyan-peretvoryty-sumshhynu-na-mertvu-zonu/	2025-02-10T11:21:07-08:00
The blue-yellow flag flew over the oldest mine of Donbas in Toretsk	The video of the historical moment was published on the brigade's page. This symbolic step is of great importance for the Ukrainian people, because it demonstrates the indomitable spirit and desire for victory. The return of the Ukrainian flag to the -Centralna- mine is another step towards the liberation of the entire territory of Ukraine from the Russian occupiers. The -Centralna- mine is a historical symbol of Donbas, its age reaches more than 150 years. Placing a blue-yellow flag over it means that Ukraine is returning to its land, that the history of the struggle for freedom continues, and that victory will be ours. As reported by ArmyInform, at the age of 59, most men enjoy a well-deserved rest, spend time with their family or engage in their favorite activities. But not Valentin, nicknamed -Kupol- —the commander of a platoon of anti-tank missile systems of 100 separate mechanized brigades.

Ukrainian soldiers emphasize that now the -Dream- is not only a symbol of freedom, but also a technological development that helps fight the enemy. As reported by ArmyInform, the call sign of the senior sergeant of the 115th separate mechanized brigade -Bach- has nothing to do with the brilliant German composer of the 18th century. It comes from the word -babah- for an explosion, because Nikita is an instructor in mine and explosive training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/mriya-u-nebi-bijczi-syl-oborony-pokazaly-novyj-dron-kamikadze/	2025-02-10T11:06:39-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Ukraine is strengthening security guarantees and preparing for important intern...	This is reported on the website of the official online representation of the President of Ukraine. The next week will be important for Ukraine in the field of international security. As early as Wednesday, negotiations with allies will start - both in the format of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine -Ramstein- and during meetings in Kyiv. On the agenda is the strengthening of military support, the expansion of arms supplies and the strengthening of the Ukrainian army. A key event will be Ukraine's participation in the Munich Security Conference, one of the world's main platforms for discussing security issues. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that Ukraine is working on consolidating international support, increasing sanctions pressure on Russia and obtaining additional resources for defense. -It is important for all of us to work together for the sake of real peace and effective security guarantees - the safety of people, the safety of our state, the safety of economic relations and our resource sustainability,- the president emphasized. Along with security issues, Ukraine continues to receive financial support from international partners. The President reported on the meeting with the head of the European Investment Bank, as a result of which the allocation of another 2 billion dollars was agreed upon. The funds will be used to restore the energy infrastructure, implement housing programs and support critical projects. Separately, the head of state emphasized the need to lower the prices of medicines. He held a meeting with the participation of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyridenko and Minister of Health Viktor Lyashko, during which they discussed ways to solve this problem. In the near future, the NSDC will make specific decisions aimed at regulating the price policy in the interests of Ukrainians. The President emphasized that peace is not just the cessation of hostilities, but the building of a reliable system of international security guarantees. Ukraine, together with its partners, continues to work on the creation of long-term protection mechanisms that will strengthen the security of the country and the entire free world. As reported by ArmyInform, the Baltic states - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - officially completed the process of disconnection from the Russian energy system, synchronizing their networks with continental Europe. This is a historic event not only for the region, but also for the whole of Europe, which further strengthens energy independence from Moscow.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/volodymyr-zelenskyj-ukrayina-posylyuye-bezpekovi-garantiyi-ta-gotuyetsya-do-vazhlyvyh-mizhnarodnyh-peregovoriv/	2025-02-10T10:14:48-08:00
Under fire and with a flashlight: how a combat medic - Historian - saved his comrades	The story of the soldier was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the first combat forays into the trenches was most remembered by the Historian. Then the position was attacked by an enemy drone, and the fighter received a shrapnel wound almost under the armpit. The historian had to perform an operation to remove the fragment. Everything happened at night, under fire, in a cold dugout, by the light of a lantern. The medic, working on adrenaline, managed: the fighter survived and is already back in action. The historian joined the army in 2023. In the 141st OMBr, he underwent training, combat coordination and, without hesitation, decided to become a combat medic. It was his own decision - not just to be in the line, but to save lives at ground zero. Under fire, in cold dugouts and in firing positions, he is the first to come to the rescue: he pulls the wounded out of the fire, stops the bleeding, and brings his comrades back to life. Before the full-scale war, the soldier studied at the history faculty, worked as a guide, and was fascinated by the past. But when it was time to act, he chose the path of a defender. Now he himself has become part of a great story. As reported by ArmyInform, a soldier with the call sign -Fox-, platoon chief sergeant of the 128th separate of the Transcarpathian Mountain Assault Brigade, shared his thoughts about the war, comrades and dodgers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/pid-obstrilamy-ta-z-lihtarem-yak-bojovyj-medyk-istoryk-vryatuvav-pobratyma/	2025-02-10T10:02:02-08:00

-Water is a luxury-: 220,000 people were left without water at the TOT of Luhansk Oblast due to the ...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. Last week, Russian security forces detained the head of the Severodonetsk occupation administration, accusing him of forming a criminal group behind the murders of 11 people, kidnappings, extortion and embezzlement. However, as it turned out, he did not manage to collect enough money to escape - and the Russians decided to -deal with- another traitor. According to reports from the occupied territories, the other day he allegedly attempted suicide in a pre-trial detention center. If this information is true, it is further confirmation that the Kremlin uses collaborators for its own purposes, and then ruthlessly disposes of them when they become inconvenient. While the occupiers are dealing with their own oppressors, the residents of the temporarily captured cities of Luhansk region are once again on the verge of a humanitarian disaster. Due to the accident on the power lines, the pumping stations that supplied water to Khrustalny, Anthracite, Bryanka, Almaznaya, Petrovo-Krasnosillia and 40% of Kadiivka were cut off. As a result, more than 220,000 people were left without drinking water. The most interesting thing is that this region has not experienced hostilities or shelling - the whole problem is that during more than 10 years of occupation, Russia has not even tried to maintain critical infrastructure. Pipes, stations, power grids are deteriorating due to the complete inaction of the occupation authorities. Problems that could have been prevented with routine repairs are now becoming a real disaster for local residents. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians continue to implement their best corruption traditions in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region. Now they have officially legalized the robbery of housing, handing over -ownerless- property, and at the same time for ten years they -forget- to pay debts to state employees.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/voda-cze-rozkish-na-tot-luganshhyny-220-tysyach-lyudej-zalyshylysya-bez-vody-cherez-bajduzhist-okupantiv/	2025-02-10T09:23:46-08:00

In particular, specialists of the Center of Excellence for Mine Action and Environmental Safety took samples of environmental components. For this, they used equipment received from international partners. The experts of the Center shared the knowledge gained during the training with representatives of the State Environmental Inspection of the Southern District (Zaporizhia and Kherson regions). -The training took place within the framework of the activities of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in Ukraine. The organization was supported by the Belgian Nicole Foundation and the NGO -Institute of Public Policy and Consulting-, the report says. As a reminder, on June 6, 2023, the Russian occupying forces committed one of the largest environmental crimes of the 21st century — we blew up the dam of Kakhovskaya HPP. As a result of its destruction, more than 75,000 hectares of land were flooded. The devastating flood caused the destruction of the habitats of many species of animals and plants, pollution and littering of large areas. A lot of pollutants, harmful substances, oil products got into the soil. As a result of the flood, thousands of mines and explosive objects were washed away and ended up under the soil layer.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/pidryv-kahovskoyi-ges-vijskovi-ekology-projshly-navchannya-zi-zboru-dokaziv-zlochynu-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-10T09:04:53-08:00
The art of saving: the story of a combat medic -Chantal-	The defender's story was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Chantal- was born and grew up in Odessa, in the Kotovsky district. She studied at Normal School No. 14, and then entered a medical college. But the plans for a peaceful life were destroyed by the war. In 2022, she decided to become a combat medic and set out to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders. -My weekdays are, of course, specific. If there are teams - I do the work. If not, I am preparing for trips. I accompany the guys on rotations, take turns at positions, take the wounded to hospitals, help with communication with families. It is a constant movement and a responsibility,- says -Chantal-. As a doctor, she is faced with extremely difficult situations. It is often necessary to quickly make decisions on which the lives of soldiers depend. -I don't just provide first aid. If there is even the slightest complaint, the guys can contact me at any time. I contact the commanders, organize transportation. Apart from that, there is a lot of paperwork, but for me it is more important to work with my hands, to help people directly,- she explains. Before becoming a soldier, -Chantal- was actively involved in volunteer activities. And even now, despite the service, she continues to help. -I collected funds for frontline aid, supported the de-occupied territories, and now I also donate to charity initiatives. -I recently helped the Ark shelter in Odessa, which collects funds for laboratory equipment to save animals,- she says. Despite all the hardships of the war, -Chantal- finds solace in creativity. She paints pictures, writes books and even organized her own exhibition, the money from which she gave to charity. -Drawing and writing books is my way of dealing with stress. My dream is to create an art therapy center for military personnel and their families. This is important, because art helps to recover not only physically, but also emotionally,- she shares. Currently, -Chantal- is fully committed to the service, but is thinking about what will happen next. She dreams of returning to Odessa, doing art and continuing to help those in need. -I hope that the war will end already this year. In the meantime, I'm doing everything in my power to make that day come as soon as possible,- she concludes.

-One against three-: the border guard -Lysyy- single-handedly cleared the position of the occupiers ...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Yuriy, like many other Ukrainians, went to war -for the company- with a godfather who received a summons. However, this decision was not spontaneous. According to -Bald-, he always felt responsible for his country and was ready to defend it. Yuriy's first combat missions fell on the eve of Easter. At a time when the whole country was celebrating, he and his brothers held the defense on the battlefield. -Our first event in Bahmut was the night before Easter. People celebrated Passover, and we, together with our brothers, performed a combat mission. Then everything happened quickly. It was very hot around, we were being fired upon. I remember how on the go I jumped into Roshel and tore my back,- the soldier recalls. Despite the injury, Yuriy did not stay behind. -They didn't take me, I went to the doctors, got a few shots in the back and asked for a position with another group. My brothers clearly did not expect to see me there, they were surprised. But it was on this day that I agreed,- says -Bald-. During one of the combat missions, Yuri single-handedly cleared the position occupied by the occupiers. -All the young guys were with me, I didn't want them to take any risks and I went alone. He threw two grenades through the door, three from above through the hole. Three occupiers were eliminated, one remained. He was wounded, I heard him squeak. I asked my brothers to bring more BC, and I shouted to him to surrender, because I would throw a grenade. He came out with his hands raised,- the border guard recalls. During the search of the prisoner, Yuriy discovered that he was well equipped and had narcotic substances with him. According to the prisoner, all Russian soldiers received such -stimulants-. After the battles in Bakhmut, Yuriy realized that the Ukrainian military does not need artificial stimulants, because they are motivated by nature to protect their land and their families. -After Bakhmut, Yuriy understood one simple truth: Ukrainians, unlike Russians, do not need any stimulation, because we are naturally motivated to protect our family and our home,- the message reads. Yuriy is currently serving in the Vovchansk region as a machine gunner in the crew of the Roshel armored car. He is convinced that the Motherland must be defended until the last breath, until the last occupier on our land. As ArmiyaInform reported, Vasyl Ilyus, a fighter of the -Hart- brigade with the call sign -Faithful-, received five bullet wounds during fierce battles for Bakhmut.

Banderiv readings were held in Kyiv for the twelfth time, they were started during the Revolution of Dignity. For the second year in a row, researchers have been developing and justifying scenarios of the disintegration of the Russian Federation in their reports and during panel discussions. This time, representatives of peoples enslaved by Moscow, who have been fighting for their freedom and independence for many years, have long since become dissidents and are persecuted by Putin's regime, have been involved. The participants of the readings are convinced: only the disintegration of the Russian Federation into dozens of independent states will be a real Victory and the final point in the Russian-Ukrainian war. Recently, more and more military personnel, scientists, and politicians in the world are inclined to this opinion. Recently, during a meeting with students, the ambassador of Ukraine to Great Britain, General Valery Zaluzhny, spoke about this: -Our victory is the collapse of Russia into 27, and preferably 69 principalities, before taking away nuclear weapons from it...-. Each people, nation, on whose land the Moscow occupier came, made a desperate, sometimes more than a century, resistance to the empire. And Moscow, unfortunately, systematically destroyed the disobedient, encouraged traitors, and rewrote history. Only the current Russian-Ukrainian war has opened up a unique opportunity for peoples enslaved by Russia - to throw off the yoke of Moscow colonialism and imperialism and finally become masters of their own destiny on their land. The event began with greetings from the co-organizers - the participants were addressed by Yuriy Syrotyuk - the initiator of the Banderiv readings, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, director of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies- and Oleg Medunytsia - head of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (Banderivites), President of the Anti-Imperial Bloc of Peoples.

They also presented signal copies of the book -Involuntary Joining: The History of the Liberation Struggle of Peoples Enslaved by Russia.- This is the first comprehensive publication in Ukraine, which introduces the centuries-old history of the liberation struggle of peoples enslaved by Russia, none of whom voluntarily wanted to become part of the empire and used the slightest chance to try to gain independence and freedom from their enslaver and colonizer. &nbsp; The second day was dedicated to the prospects of the national liberation struggle at the current stage. Researchers of Russian colonialism and the struggle against it, as well as representatives of national liberation formations of peoples enslaved by Moscow, took part in the discussion. Among them: Ruslan Gabbasov, head of the Committee of the Bashkir National Movement Abroad, one of the founders of the -Bashkort- organization; Rafis Kashapov, Prime Minister of the Government of Independent Tatarstan in exile, a political prisoner of the Kremlin regime, Jambulat Suleymanov, a veteran of the wars with Russia in the Caucasus, the leader of the Chechen national liberation movement -United Force- and others. Political scientists and public figures currently serving in the Armed Forces discussed with them: Yuriy Syrotyuk, Yuriy Oliynyk, Mykhailo Basarab. Finally, the partner of this year's Bander readings, the Anti-Imperial Bloc of Peoples, held a panel of teachers and graduates of the University of Free Peoples under the title -Actual issues of the national liberation struggle of peoples enslaved by Russia at the present stage-. Should we die in Russian captivity, being a blind tool in the hands of the Kremlin, powerless on our land, deprived of language, history, identity or remember the glory of our ancestors and fight for freedom- &#8211; the convinced initiator of the Banderiv readings, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate Kyiv assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yuriy Syrotyuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/u-kyyevi-na-banderivskyh-chytannyah-obgovoryly-perspektyvu-rozpadu-rosiyi/	2025-02-10T07:51:03-08:00

The commanders assure: -But you will move quickly, at such a speed no one will be able to catch you.- The task is simple: to quickly cross the field under fire. To the accompaniment of explosions and epic music, the -assault group- rushes forward. However, the ending is predictable: the Ukrainian fighters precisely work on their goals, and the attack collapses right in front of our eyes. The command of the Russians watches the battle live and in desperation shouts into the radio: -Crawl! Don't lie for revenge! Burn alive now!- However, orders do not help - those who remain among the living cannot even reach the trenches. -No, it's some kind of circus,- the occupiers themselves summarize. -Exactly-. And then they remind themselves once again about the finale: -Im f*zda-.

Now it is much more difficult for them to do this. Firstly, due to barrel wear, and secondly, the Russians realized that their ammunition was not unlimited. -Here we should give very serious thanks to the long-range strikes on ammunition depots, which the Ukrainian side constantly inflicts. Therefore, when we see news that something exploded somewhere in the Russians, we should understand that everything that exploded there did not reach the front,- said Viktor Tregubov.

-History shows that ceasefires with Russia do not guarantee lasting peace-. An interview with Admira...	During his meeting with Ukrainian political and military leaders, Admiral Cavo Dragone discussed the needs of the Ukrainian Defense Forces and security sector reforms, and saw the capabilities and characteristics of Ukraine&#8217;s long-range weapons. In an interview with ArmyInform, Admiral Cavo Dragone spoke about the urgent needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, assessed Ukraine&#8217;s strikes on Russian military targets and the likelihood of negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the war. — What will be your priorities as Chair of the NATO Military Committee, and what are the key challenges now? — As Chair of the NATO Military Committee, my top priority will be ensuring that Ukraine will continue to receive the supports it needs to be in the strongest position, while maintaining NATO’s readiness to deter any threats to Allied territory. The situation on the battlefield remains difficult, with Ukraine holding parts of the Kursk region while facing ongoing Russian advances and air attacks on its power grid. The current key challenges include maintaining the strongest NATO momentum in support for Ukraine, countering hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and sabotage, and ensuring strong NATO defense capabilities. Russia's reliance on support from North Korea, Iran, and China highlights the global nature of the threats we face. Strengthening NATO's deterrence posture, particularly on the eastern flank, and increasing defense production remains critical. We are adapting to ensure we can deter and defend against a broad and evolving range of threats, including in the context of gray-zone or hybrid warfare tactics, with clear destabilization objectives. These threats include international terrorism and terror groups, threats from the South, and challenges in the Arctic, which demand a 360-degree security approach. — What do you see as the main challenges in maintaining Ukraine&#8217;s defensive capabilities? — The primary challenge is ensuring a continuous and predictable supply of military aid, including ammunition, air defense systems, and long-range strike capabilities. Ukraine's forces intercept Russian missile and drone attacks daily, but air defense stocks must be replenished. Another key challenge is Russia's sustained pressure on multiple fronts. Over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since February 2022. The introduction of North Korean troops is a dangerous development, demonstrating Putin’s reliance on external forces. Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure also weaken its defense production and energy sector. This is why at the Washington Summit last year, Allies agreed a robust package of support for Ukraine for the long haul: — What are the most critical types of military aid that NATO and its member states should prioritize for Ukraine? — Allies are strongly committed to further strengthen Ukraine's defense and we welcome any announcements to provide Ukraine with additional military capabilities. We saw great examples at the last meeting in Ramstein – from the US, Canada, Latvia, the UK and others. We see clearly that Ukraine needs advanced air defense systems, long-range precision strike capabilities, and increased artillery and ammunition supplies. Given Russia's continued missile and drone attacks, NATO and Allies must ensure Ukraine has sufficient air defense to protect its infrastructure. Ukraine also requires sustained deliveries of 155 mm artillery shells, armored vehicles, and long-range weapons to strike Russian military targets. To enhance long-term sustainability, NATO must also support Ukraine in developing its domestic defense production. — How does NATO assess the use and impact of F-16s on the battlefield? — The introduction of F-16s into Ukraine's air force has strengthened its ability to contest Russian air power, intercept enemy aircraft, and strike military targets effectively. These jets are particularly valuable in countering missile and drone barrages. However, their full impact depends on sufficient pilot training, maintenance capabilities, and continued supplies of weapons and spare parts. NATO has facilitated training and logistics support to maximize their effectiveness. — How do Ukraine's strikes on military targets in Russia affect the aggressor's ability to continue the war? — Ukraine's strikes on military targets inside Russia are a legitimate form of self-defense under international law. These attacks disrupt Russian logistics, weaken its ability to launch further assaults, and force Moscow to allocate more resources to its own defense. While these strikes alone may not end the war, they impose significant costs on Russia by targeting fuel depots, airbases, and ammunition stockpiles. Russia's growing battlefield losses, combined with mounting pressure on its defense industry, are gradually degrading its long-term military capabilities. — How long does NATO estimate Russia can continue its war against Ukraine? What are Russia's losses? — Russia has suffered over 700,000 casualties since February 2022, including killed and wounded soldiers. Thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft have been destroyed, and the Russian navy has been pushed out of large parts of the Black Sea. Despite these losses, Russia continues the war with support from North Korea, Iran, and China. However, sustaining such high attrition levels is unsustainable in the long run. Continued military support for Ukraine will further degrade Russia’s war-fighting capabilities, placing Ukraine in a stronger position when negotiations occur. Our focus needs to be on supporting the end of the war is to ensure Ukraine can enter any negotiations from a position of strength. — What is NATO’s assessment of North Korea’s involvement in the war? How can its support for Russia be stopped? — North Korea is supplying Russia with ammunition, missiles, and even personnel, escalating the conflict. This poses a significant threat, allowing Russia to replenish its stocks despite heavy losses. It is also another breach of UN Security Council resolutions and a dangerous expansion of Russia&#8217;s war. NATO has called on Russia and North Korea to cease these actions immediately. Stopping North Korea's involvement requires tightening sanctions, increasing diplomatic pressure on China, and intercepting arms shipments through intelligence and naval cooperation. Strengthening deterrence measures against North Korea is necessary to discourage further military collaboration with Russia. — What could be NATO&#8217;s role if individual member states decide to participate in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine? — Recommend to shift the focus towards bolstering support to Ukraine, so that it is in the strongest position possible when it reaches the negotiation table for peace talks. Discussions about what follows after this depend on how strong Ukraine's hand can be at the table. And to ensure Ukraine has agency in deciding ultimately what comes next once peace talks conclude, on Ukraine's terms. NATO's focus remains on strengthening Ukraine's military capabilities, rather than deploying peacekeeping forces in an active war zone. — Russia has been making statements about its alleged readiness to negotiate, but at the same time it has set the condition that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. Should talks begin under such conditions? — Ukraine has the sole right to decide the terms of any peace talks. NATO fully supports Ukraine's sovereignty and rejects any conditions that would force it to renounce its future security. History shows that ceasefires with Russia do not guarantee lasting peace. The best way to bring Russia to negotiations under favorable conditions is to ensure Ukraine remains strong militarily. Furthermore, Ukraine's path to NATO membership is irreversible, as affirmed at the Washington Summit. — If a new U.S. administration reduces military aid, is NATO prepared to compensate? — At the Washington Summit NATO committed to long-term support for Ukraine, with Allies pledging a minimum of 40 billion euros in security assistance for 2024. The NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) assumed responsibilities in December. While I will not speculate on potential changes in U.S. policy, NATO is working to ensure aid is evenly distributed and sustainable. The establishment of NSATU demonstrates NATO's commitment to long-term support regardless of political changes in individual member states. Ukraine's security is our security, and we remain steadfast in our support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/history-shows-that-ceasefires-with-russia-do-not-guarantee-lasting-peace-an-interview-with-admiral-giuseppe-cavo-dragone-chair-of-the-nato-military-committee/	2025-02-09T20:43:37-08:00
Arms supply, F-16 effectiveness and Russian losses in Ukraine: interview with the head of the NATO M...	He headed the committee only three weeks ago and made his first foreign visit to Ukraine. This is a clear signal that NATO will play an increasing role in the coordination and delivery of military aid to Ukraine, in particular through the new structure in Wiesbaden. At a meeting with Ukrainian political and military leaders, Admiral Dragone discussed the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and reforms in the security sector, as well as got acquainted with the capabilities and characteristics of Ukrainian long-range weapons with his own eyes. In an exclusive interview with ArmiyaInform Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone spoke about the urgent needs of the Armed Forces, assessed Ukraine's strikes on Russian military facilities and the likelihood of negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the war. — What will be your priorities as the head of the NATO Military Committee and what are the key challenges facing you? — As the head of the NATO Military Committee, my priority will be to ensure the further support Ukraine needs for to be in the strongest position while maintaining NATO's readiness to contain any threats to the Alliance's territory. The situation on the battlefield remains difficult: Ukraine holds part of the Kursk region, while dealing with a constant Russian offensive and airstrikes on the power grid. Among the current key tasks is to maintain the strongest NATO momentum in support of Ukraine, countering hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and sabotage, and the provision of powerful NATO defense forces and assets. Russia's dependence on support from North Korea, Iran, and China underscores the global nature of the threats we face. Therefore, it remains critical for us to strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities, especially on the eastern flank, and to increase defense production. We are adapting to ensure our ability to deter and defend against a wide and changing range of threats, including in the context of -gray zone- tactics or hybrid warfare with clear destabilization goals. Among these threats are international terrorism and terrorist groups, threats from the South and challenges in the Arctic, which require an integrated approach to security. — What do you see as problematic issues in maintaining Ukraine's defense capability? — The primary challenge is to ensure a continuous and predictable supply of military aid, including ammunition, air defense systems, and means for lesions over long distances. Ukrainian defense forces are intercepting Russian missiles and drones every day, but the stockpile of air defense equipment needs to be replenished. Another key challenge is the constant pressure from Russia on many fronts. Since February 2022, more than 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded. The involvement of North Korean troops is a dangerous development that demonstrates Putin's dependence on external forces. Russia's attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure are also weakening its defense production and energy sector. That is why, at the Washington Summit last year, Alliance members agreed on a powerful long-term support package for Ukraine: — What are the most important types of military aid that NATO and its member states should prioritize for Ukraine? — Alliance members are determined to further strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, and we welcome any announcements on providing Ukraine with additional military capabilities. We saw great examples at the last Ramstein meeting from the USA, Canada, Latvia, Great Britain and other countries. We clearly see that Ukraine needs modern air defense systems, the ability to deliver high-precision long-range strikes, as well as increased supplies of artillery and ammunition. Given the ongoing missile and drone attacks by Russia, NATO and Allies must provide Ukraine with sufficient air defenses to protect its infrastructure. Ukraine also needs stable supplies 155-mm artillery shells, armored vehicles and long-range weapons to hit Russian military facilities. In order to strengthen long-term stability, NATO should also support Ukraine in the development of its domestic defense production. — Half a year ago, Ukraine received the first F-16 fighter jets from its partners. How does NATO evaluate the effectiveness of the use of these aircraft? — F-16 aircraft, which have entered the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, have increased the ability to counter Russian air threats, intercept enemy aircraft and deliver effective strikes on military targets. These aircraft are especially valuable in countering missile strikes and drone strikes. However, their full the impact (on the situation at the front, — ed.) depends on sufficient pilot training, maintenance capabilities and continuous supply of weapons and spare parts. NATO contributes to the training of pilots and technical personnel and logistical support to ensure the maximum efficiency of these aircraft. — How Ukraine's strikes on military facilities in Russia affect the aggressor's ability to continue war? — Strikes by Ukraine on military facilities on the territory of Russia are a legitimate form of self-defense in accordance with international law. These attacks undermine Russian logistics, weaken its ability to carry out further attacks, and force Moscow to devote more resources to its own defense. While these strikes cannot end the war by themselves, they do significant damage to Russia, as their targets are fuel depots, air bases, and ammunition stocks. Russia's mounting battlefield losses, combined with increasing pressure on its defense industry, are gradually eroding its long-term military capabilities. — How long does NATO estimate Russia can continue the war against Ukraine? What are Russia's losses? - Since February 2022, Russia has lost more than 700,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft were destroyed, and the Russian fleet was forced out of most of the Black Sea. Despite these losses, Russia continues the war with the support of North Korea, Iran, and China. However, in the long term, it will be difficult for Russia to continue to ignore such a high level of casualties. Continuing military support for Ukraine will lead to further deterioration of Russia's military capabilities and will put Ukraine in a stronger position during negotiations. We must focus on supporting the end of the war to ensure Ukraine is able to enter any negotiations from a position of strength. — Have North Korean soldiers been involved in the war against Ukraine since the beginning of the year? How to stop North Korea from further supporting Russia? — North Korea supplies Russia with ammunition, missiles and even personnel. This poses a significant threat, allowing Russia to replenish its reserves amid heavy losses. This is also another violation of UN Security Council resolutions and a dangerous extension of Russia's war. NATO called on Russia and North Korea to immediately stop these actions. Ending North Korea's involvement requires increased sanctions, increased diplomatic pressure on China, and the interception of arms supplies through intelligence and naval cooperation. Strengthening deterrence against North Korea is necessary to prevent further military cooperation with Russia. — What might NATO's role be if individual member states decide to participate in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine? — We recommend shifting the emphasis to strengthening support for Ukraine so that it has the strongest possible position when it sits down at the negotiating table for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The discussion of what will happen after that will depend on how strong Ukraine's position at the negotiating table will be. And from the extent to which Ukraine will be able to independently decide what will happen after the end of the peace negotiations, on its own terms. NATO continues to focus on strengthening the military capabilities of Ukraine, and not on the deployment of peacekeeping forces in the zone of active hostilities. — There are statements from Russia about the alleged readiness for negotiations, but at the same time the condition is set that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. Should we start negotiations with such demands? — Ukraine has the exclusive right to determine the terms of any peace negotiations. NATO fully supports Ukraine's sovereignty and rejects any conditions that would force it to give up its future security. History shows that a ceasefire with Russia does not guarantee lasting peace. The best way to bring Russia into negotiations on favorable terms is to ensure that Ukraine remains militarily strong. Furthermore, Ukraine's path to NATO membership is irreversible, as confirmed at the Washington Summit. — If the new US administration cuts military aid to Ukraine, is NATO prepared to compensate? — At the Washington NATO Summit made a commitment to long-term support for Ukraine, with Alliance members pledging at least 40 billion euros in security assistance until 2024. In December, the NATO Security Assistance and Support Program for Ukraine (NSATU) began operating. I will not speculate on potential changes in US policy, but NATO is working to ensure that aid is evenly distributed and sustainable. The creation of NSATU demonstrates NATO's commitment to long-term support regardless of political changes in individual member states. The security of Ukraine is our security, and we remain steadfast in our support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/postachannya-zbroyi-efektyvnist-f-16-i-vtraty-rf-v-ukrayini-intervyu-z-golovoyu-vijskovogo-komitetu-nato/	2025-02-09T20:42:35-08:00
Save Private -Scooby-: Ukrainian soldiers pulled out a wounded brother from Britain from the battlef...	-The same thing would have been done for us,- they confidently assert, daily telling ArmyInform the unique story of the rescue of their brothers. -Nike-, -Cat- and Alexander are fighters of a grenade launcher that covered the front edge of the positions of the Defense Forces units. Three soldiers received a message about a wounded soldier who remained in a forest lane on the last line in front of the enemy from another one of the command and observation posts of the battalion. — I went to the guys, informed them about the situation, because their position was the closest. They knew very well that I would not ask them to do something that I would not have done myself under other circumstances. However, the decision was difficult, because their firing position covered the front edge and during the evacuation, it could stop working for one and a half to two hours, says a fighter with the call sign -Afghan-, who was on duty at the KSP. The fighters agreed without hesitation, so their sector was covered by additional surveillance from drones and neighboring positions. All the time, while the mission lasted, the evacuation group and the surrounding area were closely monitored by the battalion's reconnaissance drones. - First of all, we found out the soldier's call sign - -Scooby-, the nature of his injury and his whereabouts. It was clarified whether he remained in the same place where he was given primary medical care, or whether he could have already been moved. There was a danger that an enemy drone was watching the location of the wounded man, waiting for someone to come to evacuate him, says Naik, who was contacted by Afghan radio. The wounded soldier was about 200 meters from the position of the grenade launchers, but this distance was an open field between neighboring forest strips, which was extremely dangerous to cross during the day. However, after reporting that there were no enemy drones nearby and using EW suppression, the fighters rushed to help the wounded man. The terrain was hilly - between the higher forest strips there was a hollow, through which the trio of rescuers ran in a few minutes. An easy descent and a slightly more difficult ascent were made without any particular complications - the ground, frozen during the night, firmly held the infantrymen's heavy berets. — All the time our movement was accompanied by a drone, we kept in touch with the KSP by radio. This added confidence - we are being watched and will be warned about danger and will be told where to look for a fighter. They gave a reference point - a point in the landing, where the last location of the injured person was recorded, - says -Nike-. However, when the fighters reached the indicated place, they could not find the wounded man. The fact that he was there was evidenced only by a bloody stretcher and a checkered -arafatka- scarf. The fighter himself was neither there nor nearby, so the rescue team began searching, rummaging through the trees and bushes of the forest strip. While grenade launchers searched for the wounded on the ground, reconnaissance drones inspected the area from the air. The drone observers were lucky - they found the fighter half a kilometer away from the previous location. Having the strength to move, he tried to get out on his own and managed to crawl a considerable distance. Unfortunately, the efforts of the -Scooby- turned out to be not only useless, but also harmful - all the time it was moving towards the enemy, moving away from Ukrainian positions. Only the end of the line of trees, behind which the open space began, made him stop. Not knowing what to do next, the wounded man froze. — -Scooby- was detected from a drone at the intersection of two landings while the boys searched everything around his original location. Then, on the radio, I went to Naika and said: -He crawled down 500 meters from you, go there,- says -Afghan-. It was lucky to find the wounded person quite quickly - in about 10 minutes, but the time seemed much longer to the fighters of the evacuation team. -Cat- and Alexander assume that they had to search for Scooby in the forest strip for at least half an hour - the time in the high danger zone was unbearably long for them. — But if it is necessary, then it is necessary. No one but us could do it, so we would go and search as long as it took. We just did the human thing. And everyone thought at the moment when we were asked to do it that one of us could have been in his place. That's it, says Oleksandr. The fighters are sure that anyone from the Ukrainian military, being in their place, would have done the same - went to save their brothers, despite the risk. This is military karma, they explain - if you go to save the wounded, then someone will definitely help you in a difficult moment. — We just did our job, did what had to be done. They helped a person. For me, this is not the first time to pull out a wounded person - both -two hundred- and -three hundred- were pulled out. This is not the first time for me, so I went to the rescue without any questions, - continues the fighter with the call sign -Cat-. He earned his nickname -Cat- near Kupyansk, where he saved a kitten with a broken paw. He personally fed and treated the -three hundredth- furrier so that he could stand on all four legs. Since then, in memory of this story, his brothers call him -Cat- or affectionately - -Kitten-. Having learned about the location of the wounded, the fighters picked up stretchers and moved to him as quickly as possible. It was necessary to walk along the forest strip carefully - there were often things left by the fighters, remote mining of the area was not excluded. Bypassing dangerous objects, the fighters got to Scooby. - We were told that there was a drone hanging over -Scooby-, so it was not difficult to find it. They called him by his call sign, made eye contact to make sure he wouldn't mistake us for enemies. And then they provided help and began evacuation, says -Nike-. -Scuba- had a shrapnel wound to the leg, but the bleeding had already stopped, and the injured person's condition after checking according to the protocol was stable. Having secured the wounded man on a stretcher, the fighters marched back to their dugout, from where further evacuation could be organized. Plastic stretchers were arranged like an Indian haystack, into which all three fighters of the evacuation group were harnessed together with the help of belts. -And that's how three ZSUSH forces pulled on ZSUSHNA traction,- -Afghan- jokes. So, first along the forest strip, and then with a jerk across the open field, -Scooby- was brought to the firing position of the grenade launchers' calculation. Descending into the hollow from above was not so difficult, the fighters recall, but it was already very difficult to climb up - by the middle of the day, the frost had subsided and the soil began to turn into a swamp. — -Scooby- is generally handsome. While we were dragging him, he kept his cool, didn't scream. He cried out only once, when he was jumped on some hump. And he held on like that - when we asked him how strong the pain was on a scale from 1 to 10, he said that it was a 6. He was very happy that he was taken away, - recalls -Nike- after the end of the rescue mission. Extracting a wounded man in full protective gear was extremely difficult, so when the fighters reached their position, everyone was extremely exhausted, but extremely satisfied that they had managed to save a comrade in arms. Now -Scooby- is in one of the hospitals of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and -Nike-, -Kit-, -Afghan- and -Olexander- continue to serve in the 2nd International Legion. They do not consider themselves heroes, but they are happy that they were able to save the life of their brother.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/vryatuvaty-ryadovogo-skubi-ukrayinski-voyiny-vytyagly-z-polya-boyu-poranenogo-pobratyma-z-brytaniyi/	2025-02-09T20:34:57-08:00
Bradley anti-laser upgrade: the American infantry fighting vehicle will receive the latest ATGM prot...	As goes in the text of the release posted on the U.S. portal. Army, at the Yuma Proving Ground of the United States Army, the new Vehicle Protection System Base Kit (VBK) protection system was tested, which significantly increases the survivability of this BMP on the battlefield, ArmyInform reports. The statement says that the new system uses advanced sensors mounted on the corners of the Bradley turret. This allows laser threats to be detected around the entire perimeter, providing a 360-degree field of view, increasing the crew's awareness of potential attacks. VBK is designed to detect laser sights that are used to guide guided missiles and anti-tank weapons. If a threat is detected, the crew can quickly identify its source with the commander's vision device in order to take protective measures. -The system alerts the crew with an audible signal and a visual indicator,- explained Alan Vega, test officer. -This allows soldiers to decide whether to repel a threat with available weapons or simply evade it,- publication Defense Industry Europe said. Tests of the VBK system were carried out in the difficult conditions of the Hume proving ground. The total length of the test route was 6.5 thousand. miles (over 10,000 km). This test simulated real combat conditions, which made it possible to find out how the protection system copes with vibration, difficult terrain and other stress factors. In the course of testing, both static and dynamic combat situations were simulated, including movement under the threat of damage. According to the developers, such a comprehensive test demonstrated that the VBK is able to work effectively in the most extreme conditions. In addition, the system was tested for its ability to detect threats coming from shelters or from behind hills. -The VBK offers Bradley aircrews an increased level of protection,- noted Tracy Hafley, another test officer. -Providing this ability to make quick decisions is a significant advance for the safety of Soldiers.- The US Army said in a statement that the modernization of the Bradley, including the introduction of the VBK, is aimed at increasing its resistance to modern weapons, including precision munitions. This technology complements the vehicle's existing armor, providing an additional layer of protection for the crew. Overall, observers noted, the introduction of the Bradley Basic Protection Kit is part of a long-term modernization program aimed at ensuring that the BMPs remain effective and protected in future conflicts. As ArmyInform reported, in September 2024, the Pentagon signed a contract to purchase Iron Fist active protection systems (APS) for its Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Iron Fist (in Ukrainian - -Iron Fist-) APS is an advanced Hard Kill system aimed at increasing the self-defense capabilities of armored platforms against modern threats on the battlefield.

-Instead of lifeguards — buckets of water-: a new -sensation- from propaganda	Judging by the level of this -news-, Kremlin propagandists were inspired by post-apocalyptic films or simply forgot that science fiction is not their genre. Russian Telegram channels and media resources are spreading -horror stories- about the fact that rescuers are being -massively reduced- in Ukraine, so in the event of a fire, Ukrainians will be left without help and will have to fight the fire on their own - with buckets, pans or prayers. Of course, without any evidence or references to official sources. The State Service of Ukraine for Emergency Situations (SES) is working as usual. Moreover, Ukrainian rescuers daily eliminate the consequences of Russian attacks, dismantle rubble after missile strikes and extinguish fires caused by -liberators- with Russian passports. As for funding, despite the war, it remains stable. Rescuers receive new equipment, and their units receive equipment and equipment. And if optimization changes took place somewhere, this does not mean that Ukrainians were left to their own devices. As always, the purpose of such -news- is to sow panic. The enemy is trying to create a picture of the -collapse of the state-, saying that -everything is bad in Ukraine-, -no one will help-, -we must surrender-. But as practice shows, every such fake is a demonstration of the powerlessness of Russian propaganda rather than a real threat to Ukraine. After all, who really has problems with the liquidation of emergency situations is Russia itself. In Siberia, hectares of forest burn every year, and local residents really put out the fire on their own - with shovels and branches. Only the Kremlin TV prefers to keep silent about it. So the next time you hear another -sensational- Russian hoax, just laugh. Because this is the only reaction they deserve.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/zamist-ryatuvalnykiv-vidra-z-vodoyu-nova-sensacziya-vid-rospropagandy/	2025-02-09T20:02:13-08:00
-One summer in Ukraine-: a film about volunteers that will not leave you indifferent	This was reported by the representative of the International Legion of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Volodymyr in a conversation with Jenny Klochko for the podcast -Ukrainian Jenny meets&#8230;-. Volodymyr spoke about how the Ukrainian audience received the film about foreign volunteers. According to him, the tape does not get boring even after multiple viewings, because each time you discover new details for yourself. The audience is especially captivated by the humor, which is organically woven into the story of military everyday life. -I watched this movie in every new city. Every time I looked, I saw specific micro-details that I had not noticed before. And somehow I caught myself feeling that this film does not bore. [&#8230;] And one lady wrote on Instagram: -Why do I want to watch the movie again? The first is because all profits from the film will go to support the unit. The second is because this movie is sexy. The third is because this movie is very sexy,- Volodymyr shared his impressions. The representative of the Legion also noted that the audience's expectations may not always coincide with the reality depicted in the film. -Maybe some viewers expect more action scenes, you know, in the style of -John Wick- or -Black Hawk Down- - shooting, explosions. But we filmed the usual routine of Ukrainian fighters. It's a job. [&#8230;] Most of this film was shot in a fairly safe place, when the guys are training, eating, arguing, joking, cursing in Ukrainian - as we can see now, this is one of the funniest parts of the film,- he said. It is the depiction of ordinary, everyday moments from the life of fighters that makes this film particularly valuable and close to the viewer. It shows the war without embellishment, but also without excessive drama, with humor and optimism characteristic of Ukrainian defenders. Currently, work is underway to present the film -One Summer in Ukraine- at international film festivals for an English-speaking audience. This will be an important event for popularizing Ukrainian cinema and telling the truth about the war in Ukraine to the world community. As reported by ArmyInform, the premiere of the documentary film -One Summer in Ukraine- took place in cinemas of Ukraine fighters of the International Legion of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/odnogo-lita-v-ukrayini-film-pro-dobrovolcziv-yakyj-ne-zalyshyt-vas-bajduzhymy/	2025-02-09T10:53:00-08:00
Relieving stress through virtual reality: new methods of psychological support for fighters	This is discussed in a post on the brigade page. -Now you are watching our soldier go through this meditative technique with the help of VR glasses to switch, firstly, because our psyche is a little overloaded after combat. And in order to remove this burden, we use VR glasses. With their help, we can transfer the consciousness of servicemen to different places,- says a serviceman of the 61st OMBr. With the help of special virtual reality glasses, fighters can -meditate- in the mountains or near the lake, or -let out emotions- in active interactive games. This approach allows the fighters to distract themselves from the war and experience positive emotions. -We owe the VR glasses and the development of the software for them to the Ukrainian technology company Asichi, which helps to make it available to all servicemen and to work with their emotions, fears, anxiety, and also to relieve stress,- the 61st OMBr states. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the unmanned systems battalion of the 61st Mechanized Steppe Brigade eliminated the enemy's attempt to cut one of our logistics routes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/zvilnennya-vid-stresu-cherez-virtualnu-realnist-novi-metody-psyhologichnoyi-pidtrymky-bijcziv/	2025-02-09T10:34:58-08:00

We are launching a revolutionary project that will radically strengthen our brigades and scale up the experience of effectively destroying the enemy - the Line of Drones,- said Rustem Umyerov. This project envisages the creation of a new standard of war, where unmanned systems become a key element of combat operations, helping defenders to carry out the most difficult tasks. At the first stage, the -Drone Line- will cover five elite regiments and brigades: According to the Minister of Defense, the project combines infantry and UAVs into a single strike system, which will allow: -This will radically change the battle tactics, giving our soldiers a decisive advantage,- Rustem Umerov emphasized. The Minister of Defense thanked the President of Ukraine for the initiative and the entire defense-industrial complex, which develops unmanned technologies 24/7. -We are scaling the technological advantage. We are changing the course of the war. We are destroying the enemy,- Rustem Umyerov concluded. The launch of the -Drone Line- project is an important step in the development of modern military technologies in Ukraine and should significantly strengthen the country's defense capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, on the website of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine information appeared on the website of the -Drone Line- - initiative aimed at developing and scaling effective units of unmanned systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ministr-oborony-prokomentuvav-zapusk-liniyi-droniv-cze-kardynalno-zminyt-taktyku-boyu/	2025-02-09T10:24:36-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi: The Baltic countries have finally disconnected from Russia's energy grid	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated this in his evening address, emphasizing the importance of this step. -Ukraine carried out such a separation back in 2022, and today the Baltic states also got rid of their dependence. Moscow will no longer be able to use energy as a weapon against them. This also means that Europe has become even more integrated,- the President emphasized. The disconnection from the Russian energy grid became part of the EU's strategy to strengthen energy security and diversify the supply of energy resources. The Baltic countries, which were previously part of the Soviet energy system, depended on Russian power grids for a long time. Now they have become part of a single European system that guarantees stability and security of energy supply. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized the importance of further reducing the energy dependence of Central European countries on Russia. He called for strengthening cooperation with the United States in the supply of LNG gas, as well as expanding the import of energy carriers from the Caucasus, the Middle East and North Africa. -The less Europeans depend on Russia, the sooner it will be possible to guarantee reliable security for everyone in Europe,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. Separately, the President noted the role of Poland, which helped implement this step, stressing that cooperation between European countries is a guarantee of their independence. The move by Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia is yet another blow to the Kremlin's ability to use energy as a means of political pressure. Europe continues the course of strengthening its energy security and phasing out Russian energy resources, which is a key element in countering Russian aggression. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that the Russian army, starting with a full-scale invasion, is being replenished not by personnel officers and trained people, but by a large number of mobilized, who are used as -meat-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/volodymyr-zelenskyj-baltijski-krayiny-ostatochno-vidyednalysya-vid-energomerezhi-rosiyi/	2025-02-09T10:12:58-08:00
The hunt is open: how the soldiers of the Defense Forces landed the enemy -bird-	The video of combat work was published on the brigade's page. However, the Russian -bird- did not last long - one accurate shot, and the drone, worth tens of thousands of dollars, turned into a pile of scrap metal. Minus the drone is minus the threat to our soldiers. The defense of the sky remains a key task, as it depends on the success of the artillery and the advance of the infantry. As reported by ArmyInform, drone operators of the 5th separate assault brigade of Kyiv turned another offensive of the invaders. in the spectacle fiasco in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/polyuvannya-vidkryte-yak-bijczi-syl-oborony-pryzemlyly-vorozhogo-ptaha/	2025-02-09T10:07:48-08:00
-Royal Infantry- in action: how our soldiers prepare for battles during the Yar Times	Photos of combat training were published on the website of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Recruits of the 24th OMbr go through a young fighter course, where they practice the skills necessary for survival and successful performance of tasks in the conditions of modern combat. Special attention is paid to tactical training, because battles in urban areas have their own specifics. Fighters learn to navigate the terrain, move stealthily, use cover and hit the enemy effectively. An important element of training is fire practice. Recruits master different types of weapons, learn to shoot accurately and reload quickly. They also get knowledge of medical training, because on the battlefield every second can decide a life. In addition to physical and tactical training, fighters undergo psychological hardening. They are taught to cope with stress, keep calm and make decisions under high pressure. After all, success on the battlefield depends not only on physical strength, but also on psychological stability. As reported by ArmyInform, in Chasovo Yaru the enemy is actively using combined assault tactics. However, it advances into the city only when it completely wipes out the Defense Force fortifications from the ground.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/korolivska-pihota-v-diyi-yak-nashi-bijczi-gotuyutsya-do-boyiv-za-chasiv-yar/	2025-02-09T09:52:51-08:00
-If he does not want to fight, then they will have to-: the story of the platoon sergeant major with...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. As soon as the full-scale Russian invasion began, 30-year-old Ivan from Stryi, together with his father and brother, immediately appeared at the military commissariat. However, only the older brother was mobilized, the father was already over 60, and Ivan was told to wait a little. A year and a half later, he received a summons. After the training center in the Rivne region, Ivan got into the 128th separate Transcarpathian mountain assault brigade. He is now a platoon sergeant major, a sergeant with the call sign Fox. -At the training center, I met Roman from Khmelnytskyi (call sign Elephant), we became close friends, and we both decided that we would join the stormtroopers,- says Fox. — That is why, during the distribution, they asked for the 128th OGSHBr, about which we heard a lot. Do I have any regrets? No. After the training center, we had very good training already in the brigade, including with foreign instructors. There are some pluses,- the fighter jokes. After training, Fox, along with his brothers, began to perform complex combat tasks, which included assaults on enemy positions, mopping up and heavy defense. -Of course, it was scary. This feeling is always present during combat sorties. Everyone is afraid, and that's okay. Fear is one of the basic instincts for self-preservation. He who is not afraid does not live long. But fear must be overcome, especially when you are responsible not only for yourself, but also for your comrades. I went on a mission as a unit commander, and the biggest worries were for people. You need to talk to everyone, explain the combat mission, show routes, listen to questions, help, become a support. The most difficult and cruelest battles Fox experienced in Robotyn. -At first we stormed and cleared enemy trenches, and then we had to entrench and hold the defense. The Russians retreated to a neighboring position 70 meters from us and from there tried to regain what they had lost. But we didn't invite the -guests-, so we didn't let them in. Different fighters stood against us - pros, convicts&#8230; I saw enemy bodies with Wagner chevrons. Rats were gnawing at them, they had been lying there for so long. Many times I observed inappropriate behavior of Russians. They could go on the offensive, bypassing forest strips, at full height with minimal equipment. We mow them, and they still stick. One was wounded, you can see how a bullet pierced his leg, in a few seconds a vog exploded near his feet (a grenade from an underbarrel or an automatic grenade launcher), and he got up and walked on. He was definitely under the influence of some drugs.- During the defense of captured enemy positions, Fox and his comrades took a prisoner. -Aerial scouts reported that a Russian was walking nearby without a machine gun, and we decided to take him. He did not even resist, he began to explain that he was looking for the body of the commander in order to take the walkie-talkie. He is 40 years old, from the Russian hinterland. When we took him, I warned - if you say that you have a weapon, we will pass it on as it is, just tied up. He replied that he had nothing, but during the search I found a knife in his pocket. The prisoner received a light blow to the back of the head for lying, and then we transferred him to the rear. During the fighting, Fox was wounded several times in the back, shoulder and head. -The most dangerous wound was in the head, most likely from a mortar mine. One shrapnel hit the helmet, and the second (about the size of a thumb) flew under the helmet, grazed the head and lodged in the helmet on the inside. You could say I'm very lucky. When they brought me to the headquarters and took off the helmet, everything was covered in blood, although a hot piece of metal cauterized the wound, so the bleeding was not intense. I kept that shard, I even wanted to remelt it into some kind of symbolic decoration. In the war, unfortunately, not everyone is lucky, many of Fox's comrades died in the battles. -Our group went on an assault, and the Russians met us harshly - they fired at us with everything they could. A comrade was wounded in the arm, so I ordered him to retreat and wait for evacuation, accompanied by a soldier. A minute later, the wounded man came under the fire of a tank gun&#8230; The assault did not succeed, we were ordered to withdraw to the nearby positions where my friend Slon was standing. And the three of us with the Elephant and one more soldier dragged the deceased under fire to a trench where he could hide. He was heavy, about 120 kilograms, and when we dragged him 300 meters, I felt like I broke my back. That's why other boys took the deceased, in general, they had to drag him for about two kilometers. Recently, Fox's unit has been holding a defense in the Zaporozhye direction in one of the villages recaptured from the enemy. Due to the danger of drones, combat exits to -zero- have to be delayed, sometimes they last for several months. -We are in a confined space for a long time and in constant danger. From time to time I question my fighters - ask about peaceful life, relatives, hobbies&#8230; It is necessary for a person to speak out, then it becomes a little easier for him. When there is an opportunity, I do light physical education, I do exercises with a bra, so that the muscles do not atrophy. What is the most difficult position? One is superimposed on the other - a closed space, constant danger, lack of contact with relatives, concern for people. During vacations and rehabilitation after his injury, Fox made several visits to the home. I have seen healthy men who do not want to join the Armed Forces and are hiding. -One of them is my neighbor. Having met him once, he began to ask when all this would end. I replied that the war would not end without his participation. And he gave advice to teach his children how to handle weapons. Because if he doesn't want to fight, he will have to.- As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Alexander with the call sign -German- is the operator of a drone-bomber 128 separate mountain-assault Transcarpathian Brigade. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he worked at a mining and beneficiation plant in Kryvyi Rih.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/yakshho-ne-hoche-voyuvaty-vin-to-dovedetsya-yim-istoriya-golovnogo-serzhanta-vzvodu-z-pozyvnym-foks/	2025-02-09T09:36:25-08:00
-Drone Line-: The best unmanned units of the Ground Forces unite to strengthen the defense	The Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine inform you about this. This project is extremely important for ensuring superiority on the battlefield and saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. As noted in the message of the Ground Forces, the best unmanned units, such as -K-2-, -Achilles-, -RAROG- and -Birds of Magyar-, together with other UAV units, create a permanent line of drones that will strengthen our soldiers to zero, ensure total control over all enemy actions and their destruction. -Drone Line- is not about creating new combat units. It is about the development of the best and scaling of effective units of unmanned systems in various branches and types of troops. Also a member of the -Line of Drones- is a division of the State Border Service - -Phoenix-. The commanders of these units — Magyar, a system commander and an example for fellow soldiers, Achilles, a fearless tactician and master of lightning strikes, Veres, a charismatic and indomitable strategist, Hasan, an aggressive and unpredictable leader for the enemy — know their business, take care of the safety of the soldiers, destroy the invaders en masse, and master new technologies and tactics. The Drone Line project is an initiative of the President of Ukraine, coordinated by the Ground Forces Command, the State Border Guard Service, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the Ministry of Digital Transformation. We will remind you that earlier the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced this initiative, by publishing a corresponding video. This project is another step towards strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities and ensuring victory over the Russian invaders. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the commanders of the -Phoenix-, K-2, -Achilles-, RAROG and -Birds of Magyar- united in the joint project -Drone Power- and invite you to join their units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/liniya-droniv-najkrashhi-bezpilotni-pidrozdily-suhoputnyh-vijsk-obyednalysya-dlya-posylennya-oborony/	2025-02-09T09:33:45-08:00
Only paint and patches: the occupiers limited -repair- destroyed Severodonetsk	notifies the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. The occupiers admit that their -Country Doctor- program, which provided cash payments to doctors, has failed. The lack of doctors is especially felt in front-line cities and small settlements, where doctors refuse to go. If the corresponding law is adopted, then already from September 1, 2026, those who refuse the mandatory training will have to pay a fine that will exceed twice the cost of education. In addition, Russia is reducing funding for the pseudo-reconstruction of occupied Severodonetsk. So, in 2025, the occupiers plan to repair only 12 objects instead of 15, as promised last year. These are only cosmetic repairs - replacing windows, radiators and re-roofing. Full restoration or capital repairs are not foreseen. As ArmyInform reported, in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk Russians continue to implement their best corruption traditions. Now they have officially legalized the robbery of housing, handing over -ownerless- property to themselves, and at the same time, they have been -forgetting- to pay their debts to public officials for ten years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/lyshe-farba-i-latky-okupanty-obmezhyly-remont-znyshhenogo-syevyerodoneczka/	2025-02-09T09:07:34-08:00

-Blondie- on armor: the woman who tamed the tank	The defender's story was made public on the brigade's page. -Blondie- does not just support the fighting spirit of her siblings - she considers them superheroes, protects them like a real team mother, and also&#8230; drives the tank herself! -It's easy to start a tank and go. It's like riding a bicycle,- she says with a smile. Her path to the army began by accident, with a joke in the store: customers said that if she did not make a discount, they would take her to the army. Svetlana was not at a loss - and still kept her promise. There were fewer jokes on the battlefield. One day she decided to see how their tank worked, and at that moment an enemy shell flew nearby. -Looked up&#8230; I don't want anymore,- she recalls that moment. From communications to UAV operatorship, from psychological support to a tank mechanic, Blondie breaks all stereotypes about women in the military. -I would like to appeal to women who are thinking about military service: do not be afraid! If you set your priorities right, there is nothing to be afraid of,- she says, appealing to the ranks of the Armed Forces. And men are advised to treat women in the army with respect - because they stand side by side with dignity. Her son Konstantin, who is 10 years old, is waiting for his mother at home.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: the Russian army uses the mobilized as -cannon fodder-	He said this in an interview with ITV News. -Even in Kurshchyna, these 60,000 plus were not enough to push out our brigades, which were much smaller. Because their people are not so combat-ready,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. The president emphasized that it was important to show the whole world that the Russian army is not as strong as it seems. According to him, Ukraine feels sorry for its people, while Russia does not feel sorry for anyone. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized the need for unity with America and Europe in confronting Russian aggression. -You can't lose Europe. This is Putin, and this is a risk for all of Europe. I think that we should unite around this risk for our population, our states,- he said. The President of Ukraine emphasized that the frozen conflict will lead to the fact that Putin will return again with his aggression. -Then who will receive the awards? Who will then go down in history as the winner? But no one. And it will be an absolute defeat for everyone,- he noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized the importance of the war not just ending, but also making it impossible for Putin to start a war against Ukraine again. -Putin's victory is the loss of the Western world: both Europe and America. And it will never stop. And as long as he lives, he will take the lives of others, because he will continue to fight,- concluded the President of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the unique experience of the Defense Forces in the fight against Iranian drones is extremely valuable to its Western partners, including the United States.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rosijska-armiya-vykorystovuye-mobilizovanyh-yak-garmatne-myaso/	2025-02-09T08:14:32-08:00
The rag did not pass: how the Predators thwarted the Russians' attempt to hang the tricolor over Tor...	The video of the combat operation was published on the brigade's page. The first group of occupiers tried to plant a flag on the copper mine. However, the -Predators- struck with a drop shot from a drone, and adjacent units covered the enemy with artillery fire. As a result, the Russian invaders did not even have time to unfurl their flag. Another group of occupiers, looking for an easier way, simply threw the tricolor on one of the buildings in the city. However, here too they were met with failure. The bomber of the -Predator- brigade demonstrated high skill by knocking down the -rag- by dropping the VOG from the drone. This incident once again emphasizes the indomitability of the Ukrainian spirit and the determination of the defenders of Toretsk. The Russian occupiers are defeated not only on the battlefield, but also in their propaganda efforts. Toretsk is Ukraine! As reported by ArmyInform, is there a place for magic on the front? Fighters of the Defence Forces from the patrol police give an affirmative answer to this question and even demonstrate it in action.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ganchirka-ne-projshla-yak-hyzhaky-zirvaly-sprobu-rosiyan-povisyty-trykolor-nad-toreczkom/	2025-02-09T08:06:48-08:00

The former head of the workshop is today the commander of the group: the transformation of the Vikin...	The story of the fighter published on the page brigades Stocky and handsome, a real goatherd - that's what they say about Roman. From the outside, he may seem strict and unspeakable, but behind this exterior hides a person who does not care. His work requires calculation, precision and poise in every movement, and the nickname -Viking- best reflects his appearance and worldview. The former head of the workshop for the production of metal-plastic structures, during the three years of the war, Roman has come a long way - from ground defense to the commander of the engineering support group. The war and army positions shaped his attitude in life: he doesn't care! -The imprint on the personality and worldview postpones every exit to the position, every successful demining or demining. After all, this is a responsibility for completing the task and for one's people. That's why I experience the loss of siblings the hardest, Roman admits thoughtfully. -Every time it makes corrections to the worldview, sharpens the sense of justice, which sometimes covers up to madness, because you pass everything through the heart.- In 2022, when thousands of motivated men and women were standing in line for the TCC, Roman was among them. He knew where he was going and why. With each wave of mobilization, the need for explanations and work with people increased, but this has its positive results. In particular, in this unit, a wonderful team has been created, where brothers stand firmly for each other. The war made adjustments in the lives of many people. Someone decided to defend the country, and someone decided to sit back. -I decided to go to war to protect my family and friends. Someone, on the contrary, decided to sit down. This is everyone's personal matter, says Roman. — But they try not to communicate with me, because they have nothing to talk about. And for my part, I think so: you weren't there when I was bad, so why are you here now, when I'm fine?-. As reported by ArmyInform, a resident of Volyn, Lyudmila Kostyuk, has been serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the third year with her cat No Nickname Grigio.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/kolyshnij-nachalnyk-czehu-sogodni-komandyr-grupy-transformacziya-vikinga-na-vijni/	2025-02-09T07:32:25-08:00

The Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are the leaders in the use of electronic reports in ...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Over the past month, 100 military units of the Ground Forces submitted and successfully processed at least one electronic report for the first time. This indicates significant progress in the digitization of military documentation and the simplification of reporting procedures for servicemen. The Operational Command -West- of the Ground Forces was especially noted, which became the undisputed leader in terms of the number of reports submitted to the Armed Forces - more than 12,500! It is important to note that 100% of the military units that are part of this command already actively use -Army+- to process reports. Among all military units of the Ground Forces that actively use -Army+-, it is worth noting the top 5 brigades in terms of the number of fully processed reports: 23rd separate mechanized brigade - 1,347 reports; 44th separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Danylo Apostol - 1,113 reports; 15th Separate Black Forest Artillery Reconnaissance Brigade - 1,073 reports; 159th Separate Mechanized Brigade - 692 reports; 47th Separate Artillery Brigade - 677 reports. These figures testify to the high efficiency of using the -Armiya+- application and the active participation of servicemen in the process of digitalization of the Armed Forces. The introduction of electronic reports through -Army+- is an important step on the way to creating a modern, technologically advanced army. This application not only simplifies the procedure for submitting reports, but also contributes to increasing the efficiency of military management and reducing the bureaucratic burden on military personnel. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine continues to work on expanding the functionality of -Army+- and implementing new digital services to meet the needs of servicemen and increase the country's defense capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, a meeting was held in the Republic of Poland to discuss changes and coordinate further joint actions within the framework of the Main Planning Conference Framework Program for the Development of Operational Forces (OFDeF).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/suhoputni-vijska-zsu-lidery-z-vykorystannya-elektronnyh-raportiv-u-sichni/	2025-02-09T06:26:44-08:00
Ukraine increased drone production tenfold: 200,000 FPVs per month	told First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. Separately, Ivan Havrylyuk noted the development of unmanned systems. If at the beginning of 2024, the number of FPV attack drones used to attack the enemy was about 20,000 per month, now this figure has increased to 200,000. This indicates a significant increase in the technological potential of the Ukrainian army. In 2025, the supply level of unmanned systems, especially FPV drones, is about 200 thousand per month and continues to grow. -This applies not only to FPV drones, but also to other unmanned systems used by the Defense Forces. In particular, work is actively underway on the introduction of ground robotic complexes. Special attention is paid to their use for logistical tasks, demining and demining operations, as well as the evacuation of the wounded,- said the lieutenant general. According to him, performing these tasks is particularly dangerous for servicemen because they are in open terrain and are at the highest risk of injury. That is why these functions are planned to be transferred to ground-based robotic complexes so that operators can control them from safe places. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine surpasses Russia in the production of FPV drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ukrayina-zbilshyla-vyrobnycztvo-droniv-u-desyat-raziv-200-tysyach-fpv-na-misyacz/	2025-02-09T06:11:08-08:00

According to him, the Defense Forces made efforts to ensure that the occupiers had the opportunity to fully engage in such activities. -This process was turbulent as long as they had the opportunity to do it from Crimea, as long as they had the opportunity to drop mines remotely from airplanes. But after the destruction of such an aircraft and after they were forced to leave Crimea by combat units, their activity was made impossible. From that moment, we can say that we have not observed such cases for a long time,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. Despite this, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has enough work.

The Russian army has increased air terror: more than 2,000 strikes on Ukraine in a week	This was reported President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. According to him, Russian military production, which provides such massive terror, is based on three main factors: the President thanked international partners for strengthening sanctions and emphasized the need for more active work to reduce the capabilities of the Russian oil industry. Ukraine will also continue to increase the production of its own missiles and drones and calls on allies to invest in the Ukrainian defense-industrial complex, because this is an investment in the protection of human lives. As reported by ArmyInform, the Air Defense Forces stopped Russia's night terror: the enemy launched more than 150 drones over Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/armiya-rf-posylyla-povitryanyj-teror-ponad-2000-udariv-po-ukrayini-za-tyzhden/	2025-02-09T02:03:22-08:00
The fake capture of Toretsk: how the occupiers mask failures at the front	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the air of -Suspilne.Novyny-.

-Cadet classes-, -Russian eagles- and drone racing league: children in the occupation become a poten...	ArmyInform asked the Secretariat of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine how they record all these cases and violations of human rights, and, in fact, the destruction of Ukrainian identity. Currently, neither Ukraine, nor international organizations and the public sector have access to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, so it is difficult to assess the scale and consequences of the systemic policy of the Russian Federation on the destruction of the Ukrainian identity of children, the -mobilization- of Ukrainian children, and militarization. Thus, according to the data of the Kharkiv Institute of Social Research and the -Voices of Children- foundation, as early as 2021, 29,000 children joined the ranks of the Russian -children's and youth military-patriotic- organization -Yunarmiya- in Crimea alone, that is, every tenth student of the peninsula. And in the territory of the so-called -LDNR- there were about 7,500 children in the -Yunarmy- at the end of 2021. In particular, students of the eleventh grade who study on the territory of the TOT of Ukraine are offered training at the faculty of the rear of the Russian Federation of the state-owned educational institution -Perm Military Institute of the National Guard of the Russian Federation-. It is also known about cases when policemen at the TOT of Ukraine campaigned for children from boarding schools to enter specialized educational institutions of the Ministry of Education in the future or, even simpler, to go serve as policemen in occupation administrations without special education immediately after finishing school. The Russian Federation also plans to double the number of students in schools with military training in the occupied territories of Ukraine. In particular, on the base of the Nakhimovsky school in the occupied city of Mariupol, as of September 2, 2024, 240 children between the ages of 10 and 13 lived in the barracks of the military institution, in 2025 there should already be 560 such children. -It is important to note that militarization is one of the main directions of the youth policy of the Russian Federation. In 2023, the -Avangard- year-round training and methodical center for military-patriotic education was opened, on the basis of which 3 patriotic changes were carried out for 300 children and young citizens of pre-conscription age, i.e. high school students,- the ombudsman's office emphasizes. During these shifts, pre-conscription training was conducted for Crimean schoolchildren, they were told about -Novorossiya- as originally Russian lands, including with the participation of the -junarmy-. The Russian occupation authorities are not only militarizing schoolchildren. So, for example, in the sports complex of the Mariupol State University named after O. AND. Kunji- (created by the occupation administration of Mariupol), a master class on drone racing was organized within the framework of the project -All-Russian Student League on Drone Racing (unmanned aerial vehicles)-. -Regarding the fact that Ukrainian children, who by force of circumstances ended up in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, automatically become the -military reserve- of the Russian army, it is important to note that during the survey of children at the Center for the Protection of Children's Rights who returned from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, from deportation from the Russian Federation or forced transfer from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there are facts of popularization of joining the Russian army. It is a well-known fact that a child who has reached the age of majority in the Ukrainian Armed Forces signed a contract for military service in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during his stay in the Ukrainian Armed Forces,- the Secretariat replied. The available facts testify to the targeted policy of the Russian Federation in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine aimed at eradicating Ukrainian identity and imposing Russian militarized patriotism, they added. Representatives of the occupation authorities, as part of the project -Patriotic Education of Citizens of the Russian Federation-, -initiate- Ukrainian schoolchildren from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine into the -Eagles of Russia-. In addition, every Monday in all institutions of the Russian Federation and schools on TOT, the so-called -Conversations about the important- take place, during which children are taught -key aspects of a person's life in modern Russia.- -This program has been in effect since September 2022, it was introduced by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation (Russian: Минпросвещения-) for all schools in Russia and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. Classes are held every Monday, the first lesson after the mandatory lineup with the performance of the Russian national anthem and the raising of the Russian flag. Such -conversations- are part of the -patriotic education- of the aggressor country. At the same time, children participate in writing letters of support to the military, which forms psychological loyalty to the armed forces of the occupying country,- the ombudsman's office reports. They emphasize that such actions violate international norms, including Article 38 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. And since the beginning of the full-scale armed conflict and the occupation of the territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, as well as Donetsk and Luhansk regions in 2022, Ukrainian studies subjects and the Ukrainian language have been reduced, stopped or banned in schools, the educational process has been militarized, and out-of-school youth movements of -patriotic education- have started to work. Starting in September 2023, schools in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, as well as in Crimea, will be conducting the -cadet classes- program. Such paramilitary classes are opened on the basis of an agreement between the educational institution or the -ministries of education- of the regions of Ukraine occupied by Russia and the specialized bodies of the Russian Federation, often with the support of the regional office of the United Russia party. In the Zaporizhzhia region, the Russian Guard conducts military training for children, and in the Kherson region, the -cadet class- is opened by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation. There are currently 128 such classes on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea. Militarization of children is a policy of the Russian Federation aimed at forming the loyalty of minors to the use of force methods in the regulation of interstate relations, the ombudsman's team emphasizes. -It involves in-depth military training, including training with the use of weapons, additional lessons or extracurricular activities, participation in military sports, membership in military-patriotic organizations,- the response to the request states. According to the data of the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, the Russian Federation actively involves minors in the armed conflict in the role of spies and correctors of shelling, as well as in the campaign of forced mobilization of Ukrainian citizens in the temporarily occupied territories. A number of tools are used to recruit children: from video games to the militarization of education, recreation in military-patriotic camps, membership in the -youth army- and other military-patriotic movements. Such actions violate international law, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the involvement of persons under the age of 18 in hostilities, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which recognizes the involvement of children in hostilities as a war crime.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/kadetski-klasy-orlyata-rosiyi-i-liga-z-peregoniv-droniv-dity-v-okupacziyi-stayut-potenczijnym-vijskovym-rezervom-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-08T21:03:22-08:00
-Blockade of Leningrad 2.0-: Russia is again at war with imaginary enemies	But it doesn't matter - the main thing is that the audience grabs their hearts and shouts: -The fascists are coming again!- Propaganda media and Russian -militarists- are actively dispersing the news that -Czech politicians are calling for a new blockade of Leningrad- in view of the strengthening of sanctions against the Russian Federation. For confirmation, there is no official statement, only the twisted words of Czech officials and a little fantasy in the spirit of the Soviet historical drama. The reality, as always, is much less dramatic. The Czech Republic, together with the EU, really supports sanctions against Russia for its war against Ukraine. But no one proposed to repeat the blockade of Leningrad, because: First, to again exploit the theme of the -Great Patriotic War- - after all, in Putin's Russia, the past has long been more important than the present. Secondly, to put yourself in the role of -victim- - they say, -they want to destroy us again.- Third, to divert attention from their own problems - from mobilization, economic decline and total isolation. And if we talk about blockades, the real humanitarian catastrophe is not being arranged by the Czech Republic, but by Russia in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. But you will not be told about this on Kremlin TV.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/blokada-leningrada-2-0-rosiya-znovu-voyuye-z-vygadanymy-vorogamy/	2025-02-08T20:51:38-08:00
Integration of combat missions: Australian aeronautical engineers have created a long-range UAV comp...	As stated in the official release posted on the Innovaero portal, the combination of Insitu Pacific's Integrator reconnaissance drone and Innovaero's One-Way Loitering (OWL) barrage munition promises to significantly increase the effectiveness of military operations, providing flexibility and accuracy on the battlefield, ArmyInform notes. As Insitu Pacific Managing Director Andrew Duggan assures, such a tandem will provide the military with both wide opportunities for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and direct strikes at a long distance, without at the same time risking the lives of the crews of larger aircraft. Simon Grosser, CEO of Innovaero Group, explained that the Integrator/OWL pair will enable the military to detect targets at a long distance and immediately direct a kamikaze drone to them for effective destruction. -The versatility of the proposed combined ISR and strike solution will significantly shorten the sensor-shooter cycle to combat threats,- he emphasized. The basic concept of the system is to use the Integrator drone for reconnaissance, surveillance and transmission of target data. Equipped with modern optical and infrared sensors, it effectively monitors enemy activity, even in difficult weather conditions and at night. SATCOM BLOS (Beyond Line of Sight) provides control over hundreds of kilometers, making the system ideal for use in restricted access areas. Once the target is identified, the OWL kamikaze drone is launched from a ground catapult. Thanks to its folding wings, it is easily transported and deployed in combat conditions. Using built-in electro-optical and infrared cameras, the OWL is able to accurately target even moving targets. A variety of warheads, including armor-piercing and fragmentation warheads, make it a versatile tool for destroying equipment and fortifications. As reports Insitu Pacific (IPL) on its website, the Integrator is a modern device that provides UAV capabilities of groups 4 and 5 in a drone of group 3. To understand the picture, it is worth telling which means belong to these groups according to the classification of the US Federal Aviation Administration: - Group 3. Weight - more than 25 kg and less than 598 kg, flight height - up to 5.5 km, maximum speed - 463 km/h. - Group 4. Weight - more than 598 kg, flight height - up to 5.5 km, speed - no restrictions. - Group 5. Weight - more than 598 kg, flight height - more than 5.5 km, maximum speed - unlimited. The company emphasizes that it is thanks to the SATCOM satellite communication system that BLOS Integrator is able to operate at a great distance from the operator. The basic version is equipped with an electro-optical thermal imager, a medium-wave infrared camera, as well as an infrared marker for illuminating targets. As IPL representatives assure, the experience of such drones already includes more than a million hours, which makes these drones one of the most innovative and reliable unmanned aerial systems in the world. Integrator Specifications: OWL Specifications: A key element in the successful implementation of the new system will be the integration of a single Insitu Pacific ground control station and INEXA software. This solution will allow both drones to be used within a single operational network, minimizing management complexity and speeding up decision-making. Prospects for the application of this technology include border protection, suppression of key adversary nodes, and prompt response to threats. The developers' long-term plans include improving the autonomy characteristics and introducing artificial intelligence to increase the system's independence in combat conditions. The combination of Integrator and OWL drones reflects a modern approach to warfare where mobility, precision and speed are key. Australian engineers have created a long-range UAV complex for reconnaissance and strikes.

-Registration- at the position, exits -in gray- and Russians-zombaks: an infantryman of the 141st br...	Why is it better for a position to take more BC and less food? But how many times a day did you have to repel enemy assaults? The soldier told our correspondent about it. -In 2023, I was walking around the city, I was met by the military TCC. They offered to go serve. I say: -That's not a question!-. He got into the car with them and drove off. Later he ended up in the 141st brigade. During my term, I had the profession of a signalman. And already after the beginning of a large-scale invasion in his brigade, he learned what it is to be a real infantryman. Well, recently I started learning to fly a UAV for myself. Modern warfare demands it. First, in the year 2023, I performed a task on one of the southern directions. There, by the way, he was wounded and contused. So, in the south, the enemy stormed us in twos, as a rule. And I did not let their infantry closer than 100 meters to my positions. I was pretty pumped up at the time, let's just say. I had everything: I took 10 grenades with me, I had a receiver, and I took grenades on the receiver. I hardly took water with food, but I took a lot of BC (ammunition - ed.). We held our positions, but sometimes in the evening we went out -gray-, we could still storm something there. That is, if you spot an enemy somewhere, you need to go there, throw a grenade there, for example. And back then come back. There was a situation that we also went out into the field to storm. It was in the afternoon. And we had to jump into the hole to hide from the enemy. And there were many of their corpses in the pit. We hid under them for some time, covered ourselves so that we would not be noticed from the sky. Once I entered a position for three days and exited on the twelfth day. It's just that then the situation developed like this&#8230; Someone had to do the job. The guys who changed me joked then: -Did you register here?-. So, in the south, the enemy infantry came at us like zombies. You beat them, but they still go and go. As the rule of twos. It happened that they also drove in our direction on motorcycles. Enemy attacks were about six times a day. At first, their artillery fired for an hour. And then there was an assault. They crawled out of all the holes. And we kept it all. -Sontsepok- even beat us. Then I got out, looked, thought -Well, thank God I'm not there.- It hit 600 meters from us. There was also a case when I hit an enemy soldier three times with a machine gun: two in the armor and one in the body. He frowned, but went on. It felt like he was under the influence of some substances. Next to him, the discharge broke, this soldier first fell, and then got up and went on. But he reached the wood and fell down, began to wave a white handkerchief, saying that he was giving up. Each of them had such a white handkerchief. &#8230;And here, where we are standing now, on one of the eastern directions, about seventy percent are trained enemy attack aircraft, they clearly know what to do. Able to storm and take a stand. And here they don't go in twos, here around four people go with them. And if they get to the landing, then they continue to do their business. And here they hit more KABs, and after them their attack planes come. And they go almost 24/7. I don't know where they get people for this. All we do is bring a new BC to our positions. As soon as someone is injured, no one evacuates him. And they are there on the field and -come- by themselves.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/propyska-na-pozycziyi-vyhody-po-siromu-ta-rosiyany-zombaky-pihotynecz-141-yi-brygady-rozpoviv-pro-vorozhi-shturmy/	2025-02-08T20:34:50-08:00

According to the head of state, if now the Iranian -Shahedy- launched by the Russian Federation are flying to Ukraine, then in the future they will be able to cover much greater distances. -Iran with its drones is a threat to everyone. If their drones fly thousands of kilometers, what prevents them from flying 10,000 kilometers? Nothing. It's only time. A little time will pass - and they will have all this. And you must have protection: America needs protection, other countries, the Middle East — they need peace. Fact. Europe too. And where can you get this experience today? You can take it only from us.

From the driver of Ukrzaliznytsia to the commander of IRIS-T: the story of a Ukrainian warrior who d...	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -We received information about the air situation and knew that Russian missiles would enter the zone of damage to our complex. On command, we brought the IRIS-T launcher into combat readiness and destroyed the enemy target in a timely manner,- says Roman. — -Already after the completion of the combat work, they were happy that the Russian deadly iron did not cause any harm.- Before the war, Roman worked as a machinist at Ukrzaliznytsia. On February 28, 2022, he voluntarily joined the TCC and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He was the commander of the reconnaissance battalion branch of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As part of this unit, he fought in Kharkiv region and Donetsk region. -Our equipment intercepted hostile conversations on the radio. This information was essential for further planning of operations. It was useful and interesting combat work,- recalls Roman. Subsequently, he served in a separate battalion in the amphibious assault brigade as deputy commander of a platoon of anti-tank guided missiles. Took part in the liberation of Kharkiv region. -Our task was to destroy enemy armored vehicles. We went in groups to positions with anti-tank missile systems and destroyed Russian combat vehicles and tanks. Sometimes they sat in an ambush for hours to get a good shot,- says the junior sergeant. Once a cluster munition fell a meter away from Roman and did not explode. -I am a person of faith. I think the fact that I once served children in the temple saved me. My church service lasted ten years,- shares Roman. During the three years of the full-scale invasion, Roman destroyed the occupiers and enemy equipment both on the ground and in the air. The military man was awarded the award of the President of Ukraine -For the Defense of Ukraine-. Roman continues to defend his native land from enemy strikes from the air. -We have a modern and effective weapon in our hands. -I have enough strength to destroy the enemy and win,- the defender claims. As reported by ArmyInform, August 11 for paratroopers of the 82nd separate airborne assault brigade began with a task that was supposed to be another bold raid behind enemy lines. But a well-organized trap awaited them near the village of Safonivka, Kursk region. Enemy units, already ready for the Ukrainian offensive, deployed fire ambushes, threatening the complete destruction of two airborne assault companies. And it was at this moment that -Jack- - the commander of the 6th company - came to the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/vid-mashynista-ukrzaliznyczi-do-komandyra-iris-t-istoriya-ukrayinskogo-voyina-yakyj-nyshhyt-voroga-na-zemli-j-u-povitri/	2025-02-08T10:12:53-08:00

About this in the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the commander of the 429th separate regiment of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko told. For him in other words, it is possible to restrain the -rolling- despite the enemy's efforts to keep the momentum. Enemy armored vehicles end, then two-wheeled motorcycles and buggies drive. They are running out — manpower is leaving. Then they all renew their abilities and again repeat a kind of -carousel-. They stop the Russians by all possible means. For example, by mining. -Mines do not appear by themselves on the enemy's advance routes. In order for this mine to appear, the command post must plan where specifically to place the mine barrier. Night crews should use heavy bombers to install mine barriers. As a result, a significant amount of the enemy's equipment does not reach specified boundaries precisely because of remote mine-mining,- - noted the commander of the 429th separate regiment of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko. How reported ArmyInform, in Chasovo Yaru, the enemy is actively using combined assault tactics. However, it advances into the city only when it completely wipes out the Defense Forces' fortifications from the land.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/atrakczion-vgamuvaly-minamy-prosuvannya-voroga-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku-suttyevo-pryzupynyly/	2025-02-08T09:53:34-08:00
-Melman- is a combat medic who saves lives in Donetsk region	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the National Guard of Ukraine. Together with his brothers, Danylo performed combat missions in the hottest points of the front, in particular, in Donetsk region, providing assistance and saving the lives of guardsmen. More often he succeeds, but there are situations in which doctors are powerless. The most difficult thing, as Danylo says, is when wounded and dead people appear on your shift. -The most difficult period during my entire time in the military was when we moved from the Serebryansky Forest to the village of Nelipivka, where I stayed with my brothers from Azov for a week. I stepped into the ambulance at about 10:00 p.m., and in about an hour and a half I left for the first wounded man. We took him and handed him over to the doctors from Azov, after which we returned and went to rest. But in two hours I was woken up and told that I had to go for two more wounded. Fortunately, everything ended well this time. The most terrible thing happened on the second day of my duty, when we were informed about the death of the platoon chief sergeant named Petrovych. When I dragged Petrovych into the car, I could not believe that he was no longer alive. I realized this only when we brought him and handed him to the medical girls in the evacuation vehicle. -Unfortunately, every day I only heard the callsigns of my brothers: one is 200, the other is 300. It's very difficult,- Melman recalls. This story is just one episode of the difficult and dangerous work of a combat medic on the front lines. Every day, Danylo and his brothers risk their lives to save others. Their courage and dedication to their work deserve respect and gratitude. As reported by ArmyInform, the war has become a part of life for many, but for one man it has become a multi-year ordeal that stretches across different conflicts and continents. His call sign is -The Enemy-. This is not just a name on the front, but the result of many years of struggle, which began in Ichkeria, then continued in Afghanistan, and now he is defending Ukraine from invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/melman-bojovyj-medyk-yakyj-ryatuye-zhyttya-na-donechchyni/	2025-02-08T09:38:40-08:00

- Putin is not preparing for negotiations at all - — The President met with the new head of the NATO...	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced this on Saturday, February 8. According to him, one of the main topics during the meeting was the preparation for -Ramstein- and -the needs of our defense - our common defense.- -Now we know - our intelligence reports to us - that the Russians are creating new divisions, developing new military industries. Obviously, their cooperation with North Korea will continue to expand. -Unfortunately, Moscow is spreading modern war technologies to that region, in particular drone technologies,- the head of state noted. In his opinion, this can mean only one thing: -Putin is not preparing for negotiations, not for the coming of peace, but for the continuation of the war,- and not only against Ukraine. -They are now increasing their army by more than 100,000 soldiers. All partners must know about it and must see it. We are ready to pass on relevant information, and relevant communication is already taking place along the line of intelligence. We must see together what the threats are and what our countermeasures are. A clear understanding is needed: here, in Europe, every country will have to strengthen its defense, and the goal of 5% of GDP for defense will not disappear from the agenda,- emphasized Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian President told journalists the main goals of the Kursk operation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/putin-gotuyetsya-zovsim-ne-do-peremovyn-prezydent-zustrivsya-z-novym-glavoyu-vijskovogo-komitetu-nato/	2025-02-08T07:54:06-08:00

Oleksandr Syrsky summed up the results of the year of work as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Fo...	On this occasion, he decided to sum up his work during this time. -The composition of the military leadership of the Armed Forces was updated, new commanders were appointed. During the year, my deputies, the General Staff team, commanders and our soldiers and sailors, sergeants and foremen, officers and generals are in the ranks with me. Together, we stopped the enemy's offensive in Kharkiv Oblast, prevented the offensive in Sumy Oblast, and transferred the war to the enemy's territory. Together we restrain the ongoing offensive of the aggressor in the east. Together, during the year, we destroyed more enemy manpower, military equipment and military facilities than in the previous years of the war combined. Thank you to each and every one who loyally and courageously fights for our Motherland,- he wrote on Facebook. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces also recalled that a year ago, the heavy defense of Avdiivka continued. -Our units were semi-surrounded. One of my first decisions as the Central Committee was to order an organized withdrawal from the city destroyed by artillery and anti-aircraft guns. This is our key priority: saving people's lives. Therefore, the Armed Forces have developed and implemented a comprehensive program -Saving the lives of servicemen-. The key directions of the program are: technologicalization of the army, improvement of training of Ukrainian defenders, improvement of medical assistance at all stages,- the general explained. Another priority for him was the principle of -fight from afar-. -During 2024, the state has deployed more than 1.3 million drones to the front. We were the first in the world to create the Forces of Unmanned Systems, scaled the already existing legendary units -Birds of Magyar-, -Achilles-, -K-2- and others. We are developing directions of robotic platforms, land and sea drones. Over the course of a year, the number of targets hit by UAVs of various types exceeded 461,000,- Oleksandr Syrsky states. In addition, a year ago the advantage of Russian troops in artillery ammunition was about 1:10, while today this ratio has decreased to almost 1:2. According to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukraine owes this to its Western partners, domestic gunsmiths and counter-battery warfare (13,050 enemy artillery systems in 2024 compared to 8,400 in the two previous years. However, the achievements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the past year do not end there: Priority 3: to win, prepare. Despite the continuous pressure of the aggressor on the battlefield, we maximum effort to improve the training of Ukrainian military personnel. This made it possible to increase the training program, in particular, to extend the basic training to 2 months. In addition, I insist on providing 14-day adaptation course in military units after BZVP even before combat work.The more prepared and psychologically stable a soldier is, the stronger our positions will be at the front. This year, for the first time, training on foreign models of weapons and military equipment is carried out not abroad, but in Ukraine, which significantly optimizes costs and time. This became possible due to an increase in the number of instructors trained abroad. The share of sergeants and key specialists — snipers, sappers, combat medics — trained in Ukraine has also increased relative to foreign countries. Priority 4: Russia on fire. The escalation of strikes against military facilities on enemy territory continues. Military units, arsenals, storage warehouses, workshops of military-industrial complex enterprises, oil refineries that provide fuel for the Russian army, and other objects will be attacked as long as Moscow's aggression against our country continues. The DeepStrike strike distance deep into the territory of the Russian Federation has already reached 1.7 thousand. km We are preparing new long-range means, and they will be used. During this year, 377 military objects were the targets of successful complex fire damage on the territory of the Russian Federation. During the year, the Air Force and other components of the defense forces destroyed 9,200 air targets of various types, which is 2.4 times more than in 2023 (3,798). Priority 5: non-standard actions. Not only defense. Ukraine is capable of counterattacking, beating and chasing the enemy. This was proven by the defense of Kyiv, the Kharkiv offensive operation, and the liberation of the right-bank Kherson region. This was also demonstrated by the Kursk operation. We created a buffer zone in Kurshchyna, destroying the enemy's plan to launch a new offensive on Sumy and Kharkiv. This operation also eased the pressure on some areas of the front. During 6 months of active hostilities on the territory of the Russian Federation, the total losses of Russian troops in manpower amounted to more than 47 thousand people, of which more than 19 thousand were killed. Moreover, these are the most prepared Russian troops. A group of North Korean mercenaries was also defeated. During the operation, 924 soldiers of the Russian army were captured. Replenishment of the exchange fund made it possible to liberate some of our servicemen, in particular those who had been in captivity since the spring of 2022. The creation of new mechanized brigades helped to attract fresh units to the Kursk offensive. Thanks to this, we were able to withdraw three brigades of Airborne Assault Troops from Donetsk region to restore combat capability, re-equip and re-arm them, which gave the result: we have been holding hundreds of square kilometers of the territory of the aggressor country for more than 6 months. Priority 6: change to win. A year ago, we started auditing military units and military administration bodies, including the General Staff. According to the results of the audit, a number of military structures and institutions were disbanded or reduced, which made it possible to eliminate duplication of functions, remove extraneous functions and reduce unnecessarily bloated staff. The General Staff became an effective body of military management. At the expense of the released personnel, we completed the management of operational and tactical levels and combat military units. About 70,000 servicemen have been deployed to the combat zone as a result of the reduction (decrease) in the number of security, maintenance and support units. We introduced a system of promotion and appointment of officers for service in the military administration bodies, subject to the participation (experience) of servicemen in combat operations in the course of repelling the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. Intermediate management links were shortened and new military management bodies were formed. The personnel of the General Staff and the staff of the Commander-in-Chief were strengthened with experienced combat generals and officers. Significantly updated the command composition of compounds and units. The main criterion for appointment to positions is the ability to effectively perform combat tasks while preserving the life and health of subordinates. This year, the Armed Forces completely switched to NATO standards and principles in the training and management of troops. Priority 7: capacity building. During the year, the Armed Forces increased their combat potential, which allowed us to prevent the enemy's breakthrough and deter his offensive, despite the increase in the number of enemy troops by another 140,000. persons We created assault units (companies, battalions), which showed their effectiveness during active military operations (offensive), including in the Kursk region. Today, we are forming assault regiments on their basis. We also managed to significantly increase the capabilities of the Armed Forces to fight in the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, a radio-electronic warfare battalion, more than a hundred EW companies in brigades and EW units in line battalions of brigades were formed. The formation of a separate educational Center for the training of radio electronic warfare specialists has begun. The -Aisberg- EW equipment management system has been developed and implemented in the troops. The codification of 83 latest EW devices was carried out and tens of thousands of devices were delivered to the troops. Capacity building of the -Pokrova- REB subsystem was carried out. We have increased our fighter air cover capabilities through the deployment of F-16s. We are also strengthening our air defense with Mirage 2000 multi-role fighters, which have already been provided by our French partners. Countermeasures and destruction of UAVs have been improved due to the involvement of combined aircraft and helicopter detachments, crews of UAV interceptors. Countermeasures against guided aerial bombs and the destruction of air defense systems were strengthened by additional deployment of modern hardware and software complexes and EW means. Direct coverage of priority objects of critical infrastructure of the fuel and energy sector and industry was carried out. We ensured a ban on the actions of the enemy's surface forces in the western part of the Black Sea, thus creating the conditions for launching a sea corridor and exports from/to the ports of Ukraine. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was forced to withdraw virtually all warships, including the Caliber carriers, from Sevastopol and Feodosia to Novorossiysk. The experience of three years of combat operations against the overwhelming forces of the enemy dictates the need for changes in the formation of groups and the structure of the troops to a more stable and manageable one. We see it and understand it. Therefore, these changes will take place soon. In particular, I initiated the transition to the corpus system. We conducted a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of the existing management system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Based on its results, the NSDC decision put into effect the Concept of the reorganization of the Armed Forces in war conditions, developed by us with the aim of maximally realizing the combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We have practically already begun the formation of army corps, as the first step on the way to improving our army. Despite the fact that the reform has to be implemented simply on the march, we are consistently and confidently moving along this path. In the future, we will build a clear body structure. At the end of the third year of a full-scale war, we continue to fight, however difficult it is. We are streamlining mobilization, strengthening recruiting. At the same time, in the current conditions, we cannot do without the transfer and secondment of servicemen from non-combat military units to combat units. This process is currently ongoing. After all, if the front, as they say, -falls apart-, then all our plans will not be worth a broken egg. Priority 8: unity is the key to our stability. I spent this year with our soldiers. I regularly meet with them on the front lines, hear their suggestions and wishes, work together with them at control points on new solutions for the front. I know they are tired. For many, this war has been going on for almost 11 years. The last three years — without rest, in constant struggle. Are there any problems? Yes, there is. But we are aware of these challenges and are doing our best to overcome them. History proves that Ukraine will exist as long as its Armed Forces exist. And the Armed Forces will fight as long as the Ukrainian people stand side by side with them. Let us remember that unity is what got us through 2022 and what should lead us to victory now. I see this as my mission and fulfill it. And finally, but most importantly. When you see a tired Ukrainian soldier who has come from the front for a few days to see his family, approach him and say thank you. Because we are all family. Because this soldier is the only one standing between you and the ruthless Russian invader.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/oleksandr-syrskyj-pidbyv-pidsumky-svoyeyi-roboty-za-rik-na-posadi-golovnokomanduvacha-zsu/	2025-02-08T05:51:14-08:00
- We expect to ride on horses and donkeys - - the fighters of the 3rd OSH defeated the Russian elite...	This was reported by the 3rd separate assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Saturday, February 8. According to reports, the so-called -elite- Kantemyrivsk 4th Tank Division of the USSR attempted to break through with a column of armored vehicles with the participation of buggies. -Having come under artillery fire, the enemy lost the first two BMPs already at the crossing - the equipment simply drowned. The forces of the FPV brigade entered the work, which struck during the movement of the enemy column. The infantry disembarked from the vehicles unscheduled and were finished off with skirmishes and artillery. The epic assault of the Russians ended with the destruction of the BREM, which was driven to evacuate the -sunkers-, the report says. As a result, Ukrainian defenders destroyed 10 units of enemy tanks, BMPs and other vehicles. In addition, 10 occupiers were eliminated, and about 30 more were injured. -We are watching how the First Tank Army of the Russian Federation is confidently turning into the First Cavalry Army. And we expect new rides on horses and donkeys,- jokes the commander of the 3rd OSHB Andriy Biletskyi on this occasion. As ArmiyaInform reported, the fighters of the Defense Forces managed to stop the enemy assault on their positions before it started.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/ochikuyemo-nakaty-na-konyah-i-vislyukah-bijczi-3-oshb-rozgromyly-na-harkivshhyni-tankovu-elitu-zs-rf/	2025-02-08T05:37:39-08:00
-Youtube-, -Pastet- and -Zidan-: the story of three Ukrainian soldiers who destroyed the enemy in hi...	This is discussed in a post on the brigade page. They were tasked with occupying an observation post recently vacated by Ukrainian troops and replacing their comrades. Six kilometers on foot in full gear, trying to remain undetected, an extremely difficult task, but they made it. They equipped a -point- and spent a week there, watching everything fly over their heads that can only fly in such conditions. And then the assaults began. Armored vehicles of the occupiers moved forward. Our heroes remained in shelter, passing important information to the commander -Cat-. Meanwhile, Ukrainian artillery, together with drones, methodically destroyed the enemy. And what is interesting: the occupiers, despite the losses, repeated the same maneuvers again and again during the following days - and each time received a crushing blow. They did not even suspect that invisible -ghosts- were watching literally a few tens of meters from them. And our boys had a hard time. The enemy came upon them again and again, and they had to fight close quarters, repelling attacks. At one of these moments, YouTube, who went on a mission for the first time, fell into a trap: he believed that the occupiers wanted to surrender and was seriously wounded. And all the responsibility for the further battle fell on -Pate-. However, even after that, our scouts did not give up. They survived, fought, held on as best they could. They were constantly helped by drone pilots - they dropped water, food, BC, cigarettes and painkillers and antibiotics for the wounded. And when the first opportunity appeared, the command conducted an evacuation operation, and all three were able to get out. They killed at least ten occupiers, helped burn more enemy equipment and manpower, and, most importantly, returned alive. But there is one more important point. -Youtube- and -Pastet- are fighters who previously voluntarily left another unit (SZCH). But they returned. They understood: fighting is not just a duty, it is the only choice. Because someone has to defend Ukraine. Now they are serving in the 23rd separate mechanized brigade, treating their injuries and preparing for new tasks. As reported by ArmyInform, Yevgeny, known among his peers by the nickname -Instructor-, recently taught children at school in Kyiv Oblast. However, with the beginning of a full-scale invasion, he left his peaceful profession and took up the defense of Ukraine. Today he is the company commander of the rifle battalion of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/yutub-pashtet-i-zidan-istoriya-troh-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-yaki-tyzhden-nyshhyly-voroga-v-jogo-tylu/	2025-02-08T05:14:15-08:00

However, as you know, for the spell to work, a falling star is necessary, and the -Predator- brigade has plenty of them for the Russian occupiers. To confirm this, the patrol officers shared a corresponding video on their social networks, in which the invaders have a unique opportunity to use the magic of Ukrainian defenders to make their last wish. -FPVs fall, we make a wish. Predators have their own magic: one click - and the enemy's body is on fire. One more click and the occupier misses the head. Sometimes there are -talented- actors - they fall even before the impact,- law enforcement officers comment on the released footage. Moreover, as ArmyInform reported, Ukrainian drones are able not only to fulfill wishes, but also even resurrect the dead occupiers, though, not for long.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/u-hyzhakiv-svoya-magiya-patrulni-skydayut-na-okupantiv-fpv-zirky-a-ti-zagaduyut-ostannye-bazhannya/	2025-02-08T04:57:25-08:00
-Athena- in the service of the Defense Forces: a four-legged helper of heavy bomber drones	About the four-legged assistant it was told on the brigade page. Its owner Igor, alias -Rama-, says that he got the dog when he was still serving in the infantry, he wanted to go on assaults with it, taught him to jump into enemy trenches. But later the boy transferred to the UAV unit, and these skills acquired during the training of -Athena- were never needed. Instead, others came to the rescue - by delivering the necessary items to the position of the unit. -It happens that we are at a point, we are working, and we suddenly need something - you don't want to call a car for this and -burn- your position. — Narrated by -Rama-. — I communicate by radio with the guys who are on the spot, they attach a first aid kit, or batteries, or something else to Athena, then raise the radio to her, I give the command, and my little one flies to us like an arrow. In general, the Malinois breed is ideal for use in the military, for example they serve in the Israeli army. These dogs are easy to learn, clearly follow commands, are not demanding in care. -Athena- in me is generally smart: she does what she has to do without being distracted by any stimuli - be it gunshots, explosions, or just other dogs or cats. A true fighter will always follow the orders of the commander. And she is the best friend, faithful and reliable.- As reported by ArmyInform, senior driver of the mortar battery of the 32nd OMBr Viktor, a 46-year-old father of three children from Cherkassy, ​​is one of those humble heroes whose exploits are not always visible. His job is to deliver ammunition under a hellish rain from the sky, where mines, shells and anti-aircraft guns are pouring down.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/afina-na-sluzhbi-syl-oborony-chotyrylapa-pomichnyczya-vazhkyh-bombarduvalnyh-droniv/	2025-02-08T04:32:05-08:00

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated this in an interview with the Reuters agency. -This is one of the steps that was preventive: to prevent the Russians from capturing Sumy, the North, and capturing Kharkiv, the East. And it was there, in this region, that preventive actions of our military took place: they began the Kursk offensive. Their task was to disrupt the occupation of our cities. And our brigades took successful steps. They did everything beautifully. It was very dangerous,- the head of state explained. At the same time, he noted that it will be possible to fully assess the results of the Kursk operation only later. -Everything that the Kursk operation did, we will be able to properly evaluate only after analysis, probably after the end of the war, analyzing certain military, political, military-political steps,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said.

-Even trepanation didn't help-: the Russian rocket-killer -killed himself-	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The explosion that killed him did not go off in Ukraine, but in the rear of Shuya, Ivanovo region of the Russian Federation, where he was serving. On 3 January 2025, the captain sustained multiple injuries. Russian medicine tried to do the impossible, but even trepanation of the skull did not save him from his just fate. As the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine emphasizes, there will be inevitable retribution for every war crime against the Ukrainian people.

Since 2019, he has been serving in the ranks of the State Border Service of Ukraine, becoming a contractor, and has chosen for himself the difficult but critically important role of an explosives engineer. For him, war is a reality with which he lives not for the first time. From Ichkeria to the current front in Ukraine, his path was not easy, but he continues to stand in defense of his native land, because this is his mission. The video posted on the DPSU page reveals his thoughts and experiences. Dushman says that the destruction he saw in Ichkeria is now being repeated in Ukraine. According to him, the enemy has not changed: -They must be destroyed.- It was this that became his driving force when he learned of the death of his family during the war. -I don't care, I'm not afraid of anything,- he says. It became a moment when he had nothing to lose and decided to do what others could not. As an explosives engineer, he deals with high explosives, explosives and other explosive objects, creating means to destroy the enemy. He does not just perform the task, but also makes special means with the maximum effect himself. -We've already shown what we do ourselves, we crush ourselves,- he says. As he notes, the State Border Service of Ukraine is the -shield of the country-, and every soldier here is an important link in its protection. -We need you,- he tells the new recruits, to whom he imparts his knowledge and experience. For Dushman, the main goal is not only to neutralize the enemy, but also to return to his native Mariupol to be near those he loves. The war changed him, but it also imprinted in him an unshakable determination and belief in victory. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Viktor, a 46-year-old father of three from Cherkaschyna, a senior driver of a mortar battery platoon of the 32nd OMBr, is one of those humble heroes whose exploits are not always visible. His job is to deliver ammunition under hellish rain from the sky, where mines, shells and anti-aircraft missiles are falling.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/vid-ichkeriyi-do-ukrayiny-shlyah-prykordonnyka-na-psevdo-dushman/	2025-02-08T03:39:32-08:00

Help and support will also be provided to the families of the dead and the missing,- noted the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk.

Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the press service of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyny telethon. According to him, the enemy's tactics are now mixed. If earlier the enemy came in small groups of attack aircraft that literally walked kilometers to Ukrainian positions, now that has changed. Apparently, the enemy wants to save time, so they throw assault groups using large numbers of BMDs - amphibious assault vehicles. The -Royal Infantry- take turns burning these armored vehicles with infantry. -This infantry is hurrying, dispersing. Unfinished ones are then regrouped. And from the basements - we are fighting in the buildings - from the bushes and forests, they are trying to unite again. Renew your strength and attack,- Ivan Petrychak said. As ArmyInform reported, enemy attacks on the Seversky direction depend on the weather - during cold weather, equipment is actively involved, including tanks, BMPs, buggies, motorcycles and ATVs. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/bojova-mashyna-domovyna-v-chasovomu-yaru-rosijskyh-desantnykiv-aktyvno-palyat-razom-z-yihnoyu-broneyu/	2025-02-08T03:02:17-08:00
Fake from the enemy: Russia is preparing a provocation against the Coordination Staff on the Treatme...	They reported this on their page. The enemy plans to distribute forged documents with the emblems of the Coordination Headquarters, which will contain false information. These papers do not meet the standards of document circulation, contain fictitious names of officials and names of regional units. The purpose of such forgeries is to discredit the work of state institutions and to sow distrust among the population. The occupiers do not stop trying to manipulate the families of captured, missing and enslaved civilians. To do this, they use lies and substitution. In this regard, GUR urges citizens to be attentive and vigilant, not to spread misinformation on social networks and not to trust unverified persons and organizations that may offer assistance. Please report any attempt to demand money for -services- related to enslaved Ukrainians to the law enforcement authorities immediately. We emphasize that all the assistance of the Coordinating Headquarters specialists is free of charge. This incident is another example of how the Russian occupiers use dirty methods of information warfare to achieve their goals. It is important to remain calm and be critical of any information, especially if it concerns the sensitive topic of prisoners of war. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine addressed to the military personnel with an important appeal. Intelligencers ask to hand over samples of Russian scientific and technical products for detailed analysis.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/fejk-vid-voroga-rosiya-gotuye-provokacziyu-proty-koordynaczijnogo-shtabu-z-pytan-povodzhennya-z-vijskovopolonenymy/	2025-02-08T02:47:13-08:00

According to them, thermal imaging cameras helped them destroy the Russian invaders so effectively. -Thanks to the coordinated work of the crews on night cameras that tracked the targets' signatures, we accurately hit and eliminated the enemy's assault unit.

Serhiy Tsekhotskyi, an officer of the 59th separate mechanized brigade named after Yakov Handziuk, said this on the air of the -Edyni Novyni- telethon. According to him, now the enemy is throwing the maximum number of his troops there. The goal is to reach the Pokrovsk-Pavlograd route, gain a foothold there, and cut off the logistics of the Defense Forces. However, so far the enemy's achievements are such that hundreds of their fighters are dying in this direction. -Foot assaults mainly. They drive cars - Nivas, UAZs, buggies, motorcycles. 2-3 cars each. A goal is given - to one of our positions. They approach on these machines at maximum speed, land, and then they already have the goal of gaining a foothold somewhere in our already abandoned dugouts. And then we have to smoke them all night until the morning,- said Serhii Tsehotskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction, in the zone of responsibility of the Kara-Dag brigade, the situation remains extremely tense and complicated. The enemy relentlessly continues to storm positions along the entire front line, using the tactics of small groups of infantry. There are fewer mechanized assaults due to the fog.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/pihota-yide-na-legkovyh-avtomobilyah-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-kudy-rvetsya-vorog-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-08T02:26:26-08:00

-The main thing is to deliver BC-: how a driver with the call sign -Zhyvyy- risks his life every day...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -It's hard, but it's stimulating joy that we have something to shoot, which is to destroy the occupiers,- Victor says, calmly speaking of the constant risk and danger that accompany his missions. However, his biggest fear is not getting ammunition to the positions or getting his comrades off the battlefield. Called up for service back in 2014, Viktor received the call sign -Live- and since then has become an integral part of the 32nd Brigade. For his courage and bravery, he was awarded the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the Golden Cross. Despite this, he remained humble and noted that the real heroes are those on the front lines, and his role is only to help. To save life in conditions of constant danger, Viktor shares his advice for military drivers: before leaving, the car must be carefully prepared and refueled, it is important to have a charged EW to protect against drones. Helmet and bulletproof vest are a must. His secrets are maneuvering, being fast and always changing routes, as well as acting on intuition at night, when the effectiveness of aerial reconnaissance is reduced. The main talisman for Victor is the prayers of his mother and wife, and his motivation is the desire to return to his children. There is calmness in his words, but also the strength he draws from every road traveled and every shipment delivered. Victor is another one of the many who actually hold the front, risking their lives for the future of their country. As reported by ArmyInform, at this moment -Jack- - the commander of the 6th company - came to the front. His determination, cold calculation and quick decisions became what separated life from death for more than a hundred Ukrainian soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/golovne-dovezty-bk-yak-vodij-z-pozyvnym-zhyvyj-shhodnya-ryzykuye-zhyttyam-zarady-pobratymiv/	2025-02-08T01:48:51-08:00
- The law is like a bridle: where you turn, that's where it turned out - - the occupiers continue to...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. The so-called -People's Council of the People's Republic of China- adopted changes to the regional law regulating the use of real estate. According to the new rules, up to 35% of residential premises, which the court recognizes as municipal property, can be transferred to the federal property of Russia. Another 30% will be owned by -LNR-. And in order for everything to go smoothly, among those who will receive these apartments in priority order will be&#8230; judges The same ones who will decide on nationalization. While the occupiers are legalizing apartment raids, about 60,000 public sector workers in the occupied Luhansk region are still without salaries for 2014-2015. The total debt already exceeds a billion rubles, and the collection of documents continues. It is obvious that no one will see the money, because the occupiers have other priorities - the razing of real estate. Thus, the residents of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region received another -gift- from the Russian authorities: their apartments are taken, and their debts are not returned. But -Russian peace- promised something completely different, didn't it? As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers gave exactly three weeks to the residents of a high-rise building in the new districts of Severodonetsk, which is in the temporarily occupied territory. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/pakujte-valizy-ta-gotujte-gamanczi-okupanty-stavlyat-ultymatumy-zhytelyam-tot-luganshhyny/->for resettlement and removal of property.

When warming occurs, according to him, the enemy's tactics also change dramatically. They attack more in small infantry groups. The groups are heavily supported by artillery and aircraft. This situation is due to the ground not being sufficiently frozen due to the warm winter. -It is necessary to understand the specificity of the soils of Donbas. The weather is cold, but it seems like it. Therefore, infantry attacks are carried out, the equipment will not pass in such conditions. -The swamp is a key obstacle for equipment,- said Commander Barney of the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade Edelweiss.

The Black Sea Marines showed how they hunt the invaders in the steppes of Donetsk region	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The released footage shows how drones cover enemy positions with jewel-like accuracy, leaving the occupiers with minimal chances for rescue. The tactics of using drones allow Ukrainian fighters to effectively track enemy movements, adjust artillery strikes, and inflict point damage. In the steppe area, where the enemy is trying to gain a foothold, drones become a key tool in the fight. They make it possible to detect invaders even in camouflaged positions, and then to eliminate them in a timely manner. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 1st battalion of the 37th Marine Brigade conducted a successful operation to clear and destroy the enemy position. Black Sea marines showed exemplary coordination of actions, demonstrating real class in combat conditions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/morpihy-chornomorczi-pokazaly-yak-polyuyut-na-okupantiv-u-stepah-donechchyny/	2025-02-08T00:53:53-08:00

-Opto-fiber vs. REB-: how the drones of the Defense Forces are using a new type of drones	For more details on the advantages and features of using this type of drones, see report of Lieutenant Serhiy Lipko on Army TV. The commander of the unmanned systems platoon of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade with the call sign -King- said that the main advantages of fiber-optic drones are an uninterrupted picture for the operator and immunity to the enemy's electronic warfare (EW) equipment. -A drone is not really that complicated,- says King. — That is, it could be produced even earlier. And it solves two very serious problems for us: the first is the REE, and the second is that our area has very rugged terrain. That is, you need to fly into hollows, you need to fly into the forest, you need to bypass several obstacles on the way to the dugout, and many of our drones were lost due to the fact that the analog video signal simply disappears due to a bad radio horizon. And here there is no radio horizon - everything is transmitted by optical fiber.- According to King, the signal is transmitted via optical fiber, which ensures a perfect picture even when flying directly over the enemy's trenches. He also noted that the drone can be used in the forest without fear of getting caught in tree branches. However, fiber-optic drones also have their drawbacks. They are larger and less maneuverable, making them easier targets for the enemy. The only way to deal with such drones is to physically destroy them with small arms or other ammunition. -If he slows down, starts to get on target, there's a very good chance he's going to get hit,- King says. As reported by ArmiyaInform, correspondents of ArmyInform visited the testing of drones flying on optical fiber and learned about the advantages they will have these UAVs on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/optovolokno-proty-rebu-yak-dronari-syl-oborony-vykorystovuyut-drony-novogo-typu/	2025-02-07T23:41:06-08:00

-Jack- Who Defied Death: How One Commander Saved Two Companies of Paratroopers and Changed the Battl...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. In a situation where the enemy had an advantage in numbers and fortified positions, -Jack- managed not only to knock the enemy out of an ambush, but also to occupy a strategically important line. At that moment, the fate of two Ukrainian companies literally hung in the balance. When the commander of the 7th company was wounded, -Jack- took command, uniting the two companies into a single fist. The enemy, not knowing their exact location, recklessly continued to move, which allowed the paratroopers to deliver a devastating blow. Two enemy attacks were repulsed, and as a result of well-organized fire, the enemy lost up to a company of personnel and a significant amount of equipment. After a series of successful battles, it became clear: the equipment is knocked out, the enemy knows the location of Ukrainian soldiers, and the transport and evacuation routes are blocked. But for -Jack-, there was no -surrender- option - only breakthrough. The only surviving armored personnel carrier, he organized the evacuation of the wounded commander of the 7th company and part of the soldiers, while the rest had to break through swamps, rivers and enemy barricades on foot. — -I indicated people only the end point, not the route itself. By that time, we already knew we were being tapped,- recalls -Jack.- Two days of hell. Two days without sleep or rest, with constant battles and pursuit of the enemy. But thanks to the clear coordination of actions and indomitable spirit, the Ukrainian soldiers came to their own. They came out alive. During this operation, Jack's unit destroyed about three platoons of the invaders, four units of armored vehicles and a dozen vehicles. But the main thing is that he saved more than a hundred Ukrainian soldiers who could have become victims of an enemy trap. For this feat, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded -Jack- with the highest state honor - the -Golden Star- Order of the Hero of Ukraine.

They saved -Bogdan- under fire: -Sultan- spoke about the evacuation and repair of equipment at the f...	-Sultan- is a professional lawyer from Kyiv. Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he worked as the deputy director of the legal department of the Tax Administration of Ukraine, the director of the legal department of the State Commission for the Regulation of Financial Services Markets and the head of the legal department at the Deposit Guarantee Fund of Individuals. He has two years of experience in military service. As part of the 53rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he participated in the anti-terrorist operation in the Luhansk region near the settlements of Shchastya, Stanytsia Luhanska, and Krymske. Resigned from the service. From February 24, 2022, together with his eldest son, he took up the defense of the capital and Kyiv region. It was the 66th rifle battalion, formed on the basis of one of the TKC and SP Kyiv. After the liberation of Kyiv region, the unit was transferred to the Bakhmut direction. When the formation of the 48th artillery brigade began, he was offered to head the repair unit. -I have three platoons in my unit that are engaged in repair and technical recovery in their respective directions. The first platoon is engaged in the repair and maintenance of weapons. These are conventional small arms as well as artillery, except for the Bohdan self-propelled guns. Why don't we touch this art installation? Self-propelled guns are under the manufacturer's certification guarantee. Therefore, we do not have the right to do any repair and restoration work. All -repair manipulations- are carried out by the manufacturer's representatives in a safe and designated place. The -Bogdana- calculation only delivers or evacuates the car from the positions, if it is not technically sound and cannot reach the specified point on its own. In general, two enterprises of Ukraine are engaged in the repair and maintenance of the -Bohdan- self-propelled guns, while one restores the artillery part of the installation, the other - the undercarriage of the machine. Our specialists can do only minor repairs on -Bohdans-, without getting into the -guts and brains- of the machine, so to speak. What is it about? An easy repair is to get a fragment, for example, into the fuel tank of a self-propelled gun. By the way, we recently had such a case. The enemy wanted to destroy -Bogdana- with artillery strikes, fortunately, shrapnel from shells fell nearby. Then you need to quickly -fix- the problem. This is a fairly simple repair, but it must be carried out promptly so that the vehicle can leave the firing positions and leave the mission area before the arrival of a certified service, which will continue to service the vehicle in safe conditions. Thank God, this -Bohdana- is still -alive- and swarming with rasists. If the engine, gearbox, or something else in the undercarriage breaks down, or there are some deficiencies in the operation of the artillery on the -Bogdan-, you cannot climb there. There are guarantees from the factory workers, and if they -climb- there, there will be claims from the manufacturer and the repair will no longer be free. The second platoon is engaged in the repair and maintenance of automotive equipment, which is in the brigade's arsenal. There are different situations. Damaged equipment is located relatively close to the contact line or in more secure areas. It's not important. We are evacuating equipment from the dangerous zone. This is exactly the work of the third platoon, which performs the task of evacuation. If it is not possible to quickly evacuate the equipment or there is intense enemy shelling, in some places it is necessary to repair the equipment even in such difficult conditions. How our work is organized in general. The simplest example, a wheel shot out on the road or a pipe burst in the car. The repair team leaves. We have a specialized machine-workshop on wheels, with everything you need to carry out repairs in the field: tools, generator, jacks, spare parts for mechanisms that often break, welding machine and, most importantly, repair specialists, etc. That is, our task in such emergency cases is to provide quick assistance so that the car with the crew does not stay in the dangerous zone for a long time. Unfortunately, today we don't have special equipment that can pull out large and heavy cars, but we can evacuate small cars anywhere: whether it's a swamp or a reservoir, it's not important. The armed forces of the brigade have BM-27 -Hurricane- multiple rocket systems. We also repair them. Again, if it's some simple repair. More complex repairs, for example, overhauling the engine in the field, are simply impossible to do. The same applies to the armament of this installation. We send equipment to repair plants. But if, relatively speaking, candles or filters need to be replaced on the -Hurricanes-, then, of course, we restore them on the spot, in the area of ​​hostilities, in -waiting points- or areas where our artillery units are deployed. We can also solve the electronics issues of these RSZVs, we have a professional electrician who can do it. For example, some switch in a combat vehicle burned out. The repairmen of the unit risk their lives as much as the arthrocalculations of combat vehicles. The enemy conducts work within the limits of counter-battery combat, makes -marches-, calculates from where our -Bohdana- self-propelled guns will strike at the enemy. And sometimes he manages to detect the works of our gunners. the Rashists strike at the -Saushok- firing positions. We once had a case where the occupiers cut the installation with shrapnel, the machine caught fire. Our repair team needed to react quickly. After all, it was possible to save the valuable equipment, parts and mechanisms of the -Bohdana-. And the enemy continued to shell. The boys were working nearby that day and arrived quickly. Together with the crew, they saved everything that could be saved in this car. Then the specialist of the repair company was seriously injured. Combat work in our country continues around the clock and at risk to health and own life. &nbsp; The unit is made up of pros. Mechanics, auto fitters, electricians, welders, in short, people with experience in technology. There are people who, before the Great War, had never, so to speak, held tools in their hands. We have a guy in civilian life who worked in the regular department of -New Post-, now he is a good tire fitter, and the best at that. Another guy, who now mainly repairs car engines, before the invasion of the Russian Federation, worked as a loader in a private company in the Poltava region. Called up for mobilization about a year and a half ago. And now he is one of the best mechanics in my company. People do not sleep at night, repairing equipment so that it can return to the units in the combat zone as soon as possible. We try to -pump up- people who are drafted into the unit, except for the BZVP, with professional training. The other day, two boys were sent for professional training at the Armed Forces Educational Center. There they will master the repair of artillery weapons. Although in civilian life they were in no way tangential to repairs. Regarding recruiting issues. There are always not enough people. We are at war with Russia, not with some Shantrapa. We also urgently need repair specialists. The more professional specialists, the better the combat readiness of the units. This is an axiom. It is good that changes were made to the legislation of Ukraine in the fall. Now conscripts and volunteer reservists can choose a military unit for service without going to territorial recruitment and social support centers. A person can come to us directly, get the necessary information about vacancies. If everything is in order, the unit commander gives a referral to pass the VLK and that's it - the matter went further. Each conscript will be able to enter the service in the military unit to which he actually wanted to enter. This is the main thing. Our crew belongs to the priority equipment parts, so there should be no problems at all.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/ryatuvaly-bogdanu-pid-obstrilamy-sultan-rozpoviv-pro-evakuacziyu-ta-remont-tehniky-na-fronti-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-02-07T20:55:02-08:00
Burnt Tambovshchyna: how an attempt to get rid of the Moscow occupation led to three famines and dep...	Today, the Kremlin in Russia's Kursk region is destroying villages with the help of aviation and artillery, purposefully dropping guided aerial bombs on civilian shelters. ArmyInform wants to remind you how back in the spring of 1921, the Red Army under the command of Tukhachevsky destroyed villages and towns in its own Tambov province using artillery, armored vehicles and chemical weapons with no less brutality. Seizing power in Russia at the end of 1917, the Bolsheviks began to carry out the so-called -military-communist- policy of pro-distribution in the villages, that is, by force, with the help of armed -pro-departments-, they took away from the peasants bread and other food necessary for the existence of the Red Army and the urban population. This policy was accompanied by the mobilization of peasants for military service, various types of duties (labor, labor, etc.). Rich in chernozem, the Tambov province was the first to feel the full burden of food distribution. Already by October 1918 there were 50 sub-units from Petrograd, Moscow and other cities with a population of up to 5,000. persons No other province of the former empire had known such plunder. After the Bolshevik marauders raked the clean grain from the peasants, it often rotted at the nearest railway stations, the advance teams drank the grain, distilled it into moonshine. To this can be added the looting and closing of churches and other atrocities committed by the Moscow horde to this day. The first form of resistance to prodrazverstka was the -quiet protest- typical of the Russian population - the reduction of the peasant's own farm. If in 1918 in the black-earth Tambov province, one peasant farm cultivated an average of 4.3 tens of acres of land, then in 1920 - 2.8 tens of acres. Fields were sown in sizes needed only for personal consumption. But soon the peasants were forced to choose between starvation and armed resistance to the new government. The situation of the peasants worsened especially sharply in 1920, when Tambov Oblast was hit by a drought, and the level of poverty remained extremely high. In a number of counties of the Tambov province, residents were forced to eat quinoa, tree bark, and nettles. The uprising broke out spontaneously in mid-August 1920. in the villages of Khitrovo and Kamianka of the Tambov district, where the villagers refused to hand over bread and disarmed the prodzach. Within a month, popular indignation spread to several districts of the province, the number of insurgents reached 4,000 armed men and about 10,000 with pitchforks and scythes. A kind of -peasant republic- was formed on the territory of Kirsanovsky, Borysoglib and Tambov counties, with its center in the village of Kamyanka. At the head of the uprising was a burgher of the city of Kirsanova, a former parish clerk and a public teacher, the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Oleksandr Antonov (1889–1922). His biography included a combative SR past, imprisonment during the tsarist years, command of the Kirsanovsky District militia after the February Revolution. He left the post of the head of the district police voluntarily due to his rejection of the Bolshevik dictatorship and the policy pursued by the new government towards the peasants. Since the autumn of 1918. Antonov formed a -combat wife- and began an armed struggle against the Bolsheviks. His unit became the organizational core of the partisan army. Under the command of Antonov, the forces of the rebels grew rapidly. This was facilitated by the clarity of the goals of the uprising (slogans -death to communists- and -for a free peasant republic-), successful military operations in favorable geographical conditions (a large number of forests and other natural shelters), flexible partisan tactics of sudden attacks and rapid retreats. In February 1921, when the insurgent movement reached its peak, the number of fighters reached 40 thousand people, the army was divided into 21 regiments and a separate brigade. Rebels ransacked state farms and communes, damaged railways. The uprising began to go beyond the local borders, finding a response in the border districts of the neighboring Voronezh and Saratov provinces. Moscow's reaction did not take long. At the end of February and the beginning of March 1921, an -authoritative commission- headed by V.A. was formed. Antonov-Ovsienko. This is the same red leader who previously commanded the so-called -Ukrainian Soviet Army- that carried out the Bolshevik occupation of Ukraine. It was this -authoritative commission- that concentrated all the power in the Tambov province in its hands. Large military contingents, equipment, including artillery, armored units and aircraft, were removed from the fronts that ended hostilities (in particular, from Ukraine). The entire province was divided into six military districts with field headquarters and emergency authorities - -political commissions-. The number of Red Army soldiers increased to 100,000 within a few months. But before that, on February 2, 1921, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine (b) instructed M. Bukharin, E. Preobrazhensky and L. Kamenev to -develop and approve the text of the appeal&#8230; to the peasants of the Tambov province in order to distribute it only in this province, without printing it in newspapers.- It was a fake message, which announced the withdrawal of the product distribution and the permission of the local trade exchange of agricultural products. It began to be distributed already on February 9, which brought some confusion to the ranks of the rebels. 27 April 1921 at the suggestion of Lenin, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (b) adopted a resolution -On the liquidation of Antonov's gangs in the Tambov province-, according to which M. was appointed as the commander of the operation. Tukhachevsky. Along with him in Tambov region, the famous red punishers I. Uborevich, G. Kotovskyi, G. Yagoda, V. Ulrich, A. Levin (L. Bielskyi), Ukrainian collaborator M. Kakurin et al. A brutal military occupation of the areas controlled by the rebels began. The Red Army completely destroyed their farms and destroyed their houses, took hostages, including children, created concentration camps where the necessary information was extracted under torture, shot for disobedience, for hiding -bandits- and weapons, etc. It is estimated that during the so-called -repression of the rebellion- about 100,000 people were imprisoned and about 15,000 were shot, several dozen rural settlements were completely destroyed. In the summer of 1921, the main forces of Antonov were defeated. At the end of June and at the beginning of July, a final order was issued to them, according to which the fighting units were asked to split into groups and flee into the forests. The rebellion broke up into isolated foci, which continued to put up a desperate resistance until the end of the year. Antonov and his group were destroyed in June 1922. After that, Black Earth Tambovshchyna turned into a depopulated desert. As of 1922, 37% of the inhabitants did not have a roof over their heads, 54% did not have anything to cultivate the land, and in those farms that still held, compared to 1916, the number of working cattle decreased by 40%, sheep - by 63%, pigs - by 76%. As a result, at the beginning of 1925, Tambov region experienced a severe famine, as a result of which several thousand residents died. And then - even stronger, in 1932-1933. Despite the scale of famine and repression, the insurgent movement in Tambov region did not stop. In July 1942, during the Second World War, a partisan unit named after Antonov was formed. In Tambov, leaflets were scattered with a call to fight against the Stalinist government, and on July 26, investigator NKV Gershun was killed and a train with aviation fuel was blown up. After the Soviet government forcibly deported entire peoples from the lands where they had lived for centuries after the war, it settled in the vacated areas, just as forcibly, the so-called -legal population.- A significant number of them were -problem- residents of Tambov Oblast. In particular, about 2,000 farms were resettled from Tambov region to Crimea, in the Crimean Tatar settlement, another 2,000 to the Volga region, where Germans used to live, and 400 to Kaliningrad region. This deportation, which almost no one talks about, became the final punitive action for the population of the long-suffering region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/vypalena-tambovshhyna-yak-sproba-pozbavytys-moskovskoyi-okupacziyi-pryzvela-do-troh-golodomoriv-ta-deportacziyi/	2025-02-07T20:42:22-08:00
- By subletting - in 2025: how much will military personnel be compensated for renting housing	According to the decision of the Minister of Defense, from January 1, 2025, the amount of compensation is: For servicemen who have three or more family members, the amount of compensation increases by one and a half times. This is, in fact, compensation for housing rent at the place of service. It is paid if the serviceman does not have his own housing in this territory. We note right away that the procedure for issuing compensation is not very simple and fast. And it may also require certain expenses, in particular for obtaining certificates. The basis for payment is a serviceman's report, as well as list of documents, determined by Cabinet Resolution No. 450. But if you go this way and arrange everything, you can get quite a good compensation. Currently, this applies to servicemen serving under a contract or under the draft of officers. Mobilized servicemen do not have this opportunity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/pidnajom-u-2025-roczi-skilky-kompensuyut-vijskovym-za-orendu-zhytla/	2025-02-07T20:34:34-08:00
Modularity and adaptability: how the Swedish CV90 armored vehicle platform, known on the battlefield...	The topic of conversation about this tank, which is not too -hyped- in NATO countries, was the news that the defense department of Slovakia, as part of the modernization of its tank fleet, may choose a vehicle from BAE Systems when replacing the old Soviet T-72 tanks as an alternative to the more expensive American Abrams. At least this was recently reported by the Minister of Defense of Slovakia, Robert Kalinak, who was quoted by the Bratislava publication Denník N. This model is based on the CV90 platform, known for its modularity and adaptability, which allows the integration of various combat and technological systems, ArmiyaInform reports. As noted the experts of the Dutch defense technology research portal Army Recognition (AR), the aspect of budget savings may play not the last role in Slovakia's decision to purchase Swedish tanks. The CV90120-T has undergone several upgrades and the latest version is priced at €11.5 million per unit, roughly half the price of the Leopard 2A8. -While its competitive price and capabilities make it an attractive choice, the CV90120-T has yet to receive significant orders, but its affordability makes it an attractive choice for Slovakia's military modernization efforts,- AR said. Aside from the financial aspect, the CV90120-T offers additional benefits. Its integration into Slovakia's armored fleet could lead to increased industrial cooperation and standardization of the CV9035 infantry fighting vehicles already ordered by Bratislava. These potential synergies will not only improve operational efficiency, but also strengthen Slovakia's domestic defense industry by promoting increased local production. 120 mm gun CTG120/L50 (Compact Tank Gun — a compact tank gun) with a barrel length of 50 calibers was developed by the Swiss company RUAG specially for installation on light armored vehicles. To reduce recoil, the weapon is equipped with a muzzle brake. There is an ejector to blow the barrel after firing. The barrel of the weapon has a heat-insulating casing to increase the accuracy of shooting. The weapon is stabilized in two planes. The main reason for installing a 120-mm gun was the desire to combine the firepower of a tank with the mobility characteristics of a lighter vehicle. The combat weight of the CV90120-T is about 35 tons, while the vast majority of main battle tanks in the arsenal of NATO countries weigh almost twice as much. A 12-shot semi-automatic loader is mounted in the aft part of the tower. When using it, the rate of fire can reach 12-14 shots per minute. The rest of the ammunition (33 rounds) is mixed in the aft part of the hull and can be quickly loaded through the aft door. With this armament, the CV90120-T light tank has firepower similar to the Leopard 2 main battle tank, however, with a combat weight of 35 tons, the vehicle has better strategic and tactical mobility. Full ammunition is designed for 45 shots. The weapon's ammunition includes feathered armor-piercing subcaliber shells with a detachable tray (APFSDS). In addition, they may include high-explosive rounds developed by Bofors and Israel Military Industries for the Leopard-2 main battle tank. Due to the use of a digital fire control system, a high probability of hitting both moving and stationary targets with the first shot is achieved. The gunner is in control of UTAAS (Universal Tank Fire Control System, which provides for the possibility of firing at aerial targets) - a system that includes a stabilized day-night sight and a laser range finder. UTAAS is manufactured by SAAB. This system was also used in other platforms of the CV90 family. A Hagglunds company representative said that with UTAAS, the CV90 series vehicles -have higher fire accuracy than Leopard 2 tanks.- The commander's fire control system DNGS has about the same capabilities as the gunner, but his sight has the ability to change the magnification between 1.5x, 6x and 24x. In addition, there is another targeting system PLSS. It can be used by both the gunner and the commander. Moreover, the commander can search for targets and transfer them to the gunner for destruction. All crew members have monitors connected by a common data network, which increases the operational control of the CV90120-T in battle. The gunner has at his disposal a universal tank/anti-aircraft sight -Celsiustec- with day and night channels and a laser rangefinder, which is also produced for equipping other combat vehicles. The light tank CV90120-T has a layout with a forward engine compartment. This is because its chassis is a variant of the CV9040 infantry fighting vehicle chassis. This chassis was modified to fit aft of the triple turret. In addition, it has received increased booking in the front. CV90120-T frontal arc armor for the hull and turret provides protection against 30 mm armor-piercing shells and all-round protection against 12.7 mm ammunition. In addition to the main armor and the aerosol curtain deployment system, the CV90120-T was tested for the active protection system (active armor concept — AAC), which was developed for the Swedish army by the German company IBD Diesenroth Engineering together with the Swedish company Akers Krutbruk. Outside of Sweden, Diesenroth offers this system as part of its Advanced Modular Protection (AMAP-ADS or simply ADS). In Great Britain, it received the designation Hard-Kill DAS. Active protection of the tank protects against anti-tank guided projectiles. In addition, an improved on-board shield is installed to reduce the machine's signature in the infrared range. The machine has camouflage paint for operations in urban conditions. Active armor, as the developers say, is an -improved active protection system- that -detects, identifies and repels an attack at a short distance.- The system was successfully tested on the CV90 chassis. It covers the car from all sides and increases its mass by 400 kg. Using the AMAP-ADS active protection system and replacing more than 2 tons of passive armor, while maintaining the internal volume, allows you to reduce the weight of the car by 1.6 tons. The crew of the CV90120-T consists of 3 people - a commander, a gunner operator and a driver mechanic. The undercarriage of the CV90120-T (on each side) consists of seven twin support rollers, a forward drive wheel and a guide wheel mounted aft of the hull. The guide wheel has a hydraulic tensioning mechanism controlled from the driver's seat. The track consists of steel tracks with rubber running tracks. Tracks are connected with the help of a rubber-metal joint. Individual torsion roller suspension. Double-action hydraulic shock absorbers are installed on the suspension nodes of the first, second and seventh rollers. The motor-transmission compartment of the tank is located in the front part of the hull near the starboard side. It is equipped with a four-stroke V-8 Scania DI16 liquid-cooled diesel engine with a capacity of 670 hp. It drives the tank through a Perkins Engines Company/Allison X-300 automatic transmission, which has four forward and two reverse gears. CV90120-T light tank.

-We defeated everyone, but nothing happened-: how the Russian Federation -repelled- the attack of Uk...	Granted, there is no concrete evidence again, but when did that ever stop the fake factory? What was invented this time? According to Russian sources, a -massive attack by Ukrainian drones- was allegedly recorded over the Krasnodar Territory at night. The enemy seemed to be trying to strike at important targets, but the Russian air defense system did a brilliant job: all the drones were -shot down- or they -crashed against the rocks out of fear.- However, in the videos shared by the locals, instead of the wreckage of the Ukrainian drones, there is only a dark sky and cries of -bang, but we don't know what it is.- There is no confirmation from independent sources either. The facts speak for themselves: Everything is simple here: propaganda cannot show the real picture of what is happening, so it invents heroic victories. it is important for Russians to hear that they are -protected- and that -the enemy is powerless.- And if suddenly after a few days it becomes known about the destroyed ammunition depot or oil base, it will be possible to say: -This is not our base at all!- or -It was a planned explosion.- So the next time the Russians say they've -repelled a Ukrainian drone attack,- check the news in a day or two. Because it is quite likely that the -downed drones- somehow strangely got into their regular supply of ammunition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/my-vsih-peremogly-ale-nichogo-ne-stalosya-yak-rf-vidbyla-ataku-ukrayinskyh-droniv-u-krasnodarskomu-krayi/	2025-02-07T20:05:17-08:00
Drones and arms supply — the President talked about the results of the Stavka meeting	He told this during his evening video address. -Today there were reports on specific types of weapons and equipment.

Another important issue during the meeting of the Stavka was drones. -Drones are the technological basis of modern warfare. Ukrainians should be leaders in this field. And so much already exists. Today there was a meeting with the commanders of the units of unmanned systems. They are among the best. And the experience of all our best will scale. These are the people who are writing a new doctrine of technological protection for Ukraine,- the President noted. According to him, relevant decisions in this direction have already been adopted. -And the importance of drones should become such that they make Russian assaults more and more impossible. The Ukrainian state will spare no resources for this, because it is the preservation of the lives of our people,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy added. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the President shared photos of the production of Ukrainian unmanned systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/drony-ta-postachannya-zbroyi-prezydent-rozpoviv-pro-pidsumky-zasidannya-stavky/	2025-02-07T11:52:59-08:00

The Defense Forces said when the waves of shelling decrease and when they increase	Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyni-. According to him, -waves- of shelling occur according to a clear algorithm - they increase for three to four days, then decrease several times for the same period of time. This, Vadym Mysnyk is convinced, indicates the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes deep into Russian territory. Long-range drones hit warehouses with ammunition, logistics and equipment. -But the enemy also accumulates, regroups, and then tries again. They practically use the existing arsenal of weapons. But, for example, unguided aircraft missiles from helicopters or multiple rocket launcher systems — we record individual cases. That is, they are very limited in such combat equipment,- said the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-. As reported ArmyInform, in the Lyman direction the enemy continues to use tactics of assaults in small groups, as well as enemy artillery and aviation are actively working against the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/obstrily-vidbuvayutsya-hvylyamy-v-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-koly-vony-zmenshuyutsya-a-koly-zrostayut/	2025-02-07T09:12:08-08:00

Civil aviation of the Russian Federation is on the verge of collapse: technical problems with planes...	Such data are provided in the GUR of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Only at the beginning of December, three Superjet 100 aircraft experienced technical malfunctions during flights. The beginning of 2025 was no less -productive-: in two weeks of January, there were five emergency landings due to equipment failures. On January 4, two planes encountered technical problems at the same time: Airbus-A321neo of Ural Airlines flying from Sharm el-Sheikh to Yekaterinburg had to return to the airport of departure. And the Boeing-737 of the NordStar airline interrupted the flight on the flight Volgograd — Yekaterinburg. On January 7, a Boeing-737 of the UTair airline company, which was traveling from St. Petersburg to Samarkand, was forced to land at the Vnukovo airport due to a technical malfunction. On January 11, 2025, this airport gave the go-ahead for an emergency landing of a plane heading from Moscow to Dubai. The reason for the return was -change in hydraulic fluid level-. There were 240 passengers on board. For all of them, this flight could be the last. On January 17, the Superjet-100 of the Red Wings airline, which was on its way from the Ministry of Water to Yerevan, made an emergency landing at the airport of departure. There were 90 people on board. The reason for the emergency return was a malfunction of the air conditioning system. On November 23, 2023, military intelligence gained access to the internal documents of the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency, known as Rosaviatsia. Even then, intelligence officers established that due to the influence of sanctions, Russian civil aviation was confidently approaching collapse. According to the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, among the data obtained as a result of the hack was a complete list of daily reports of -Rosaviation- regarding non-statutory situations with Russian aircraft for more than a year and a half. -Moscow, exposing its population to mortal danger, is trying by all means to hide an endless pile of problems with civil aviation,- the intelligence said. Before the start of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian aircraft fleet numbered 1,031 aircraft. Aircraft produced by Boeing and Airbus accounted for about 67% of Russian aviation. US and EU sanctions banned the maintenance of these aircraft, as well as the supply of new liners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/czyvilna-aviacziya-rf-na-mezhi-krahu-tehnichni-problemy-z-litakamy-pryzvodyat-do-ekstrenyh-posadok/	2025-02-07T07:01:09-08:00

The Ministry of Defense said who should be responsible for mobilization	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -The issue of mobilization is based on the realities in which Ukrainian society as a whole lives. Our information space is focused on the negative, narratives about -Busification- and bad -TCKashniks- are imposed on society. We see more negatives than positives about the need to protect the country and the state,- he said. As he noted, a significant number of Ukrainians are sure that the territorial recruitment and social support centers are solely responsible for mobilization, but this is not the case. -The Law of Ukraine -On Mobilization Training and Mobilization- clearly defines all participants in the process, their tasks and area of ​​responsibility. Most of the tasks of mobilization measures are assigned to the authorities and the police,- Ivan Gavryliuk emphasized. According to him, if conscripted citizens of Ukraine during the legal regime of martial law do not appear at the TCC, then local authorities and the police must ensure their delivery. -It is also important to carry out appropriate information work in communities to convey to people the importance of protecting the country. You understand that without mobilization we will lose the country. -No matter how many robotic complexes, weapons, weapons and military equipment we have, all this is controlled by a person,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine plans to reform territorial centers of recruitment and social support, in particular, to divide the functions and tasks assigned to them rely on	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/u-minoborony-rozpovily-hto-maye-vidpovidaty-za-mobilizacziyu/	2025-02-07T04:58:16-08:00
Reforming TCC and JV: the MOU explained how their functions will be divided	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -For example, the first component – ​​social issues – should be separated. The second component is TCC itself. They will continue to keep track of reservists and all conscripts, call them to retraining courses, send them to the relevant meetings,- he said. According to him, the third component is the issue of preparing the population for service in the Armed Forces or units of the Security and Defense Forces. This feature is also planned to be spun off. As reported by ArmyInform, conscripts will be able to receive electronic direction for passing VLK through the Rezerv+ application without the need to visit territorial recruiting centers. The Ministry of Defense plans to have the corresponding mechanism up and running by the end of February 2025. In order to undergo an examination to determine fitness for military service, it will no longer be necessary to go to the TCC and SP for a paper referral.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/reformuvannya-tczk-ta-sp-u-mou-poyasnyly-yak-rozdilyat-yihni-funkcziyi/	2025-02-07T04:34:11-08:00

According to him, infantry attacks continue around the clock. The enemy in the conveyor mode launches groups of 2-3 people, the purpose of which is to get closer to the positions of the Defense Forces. Stormtroopers are of two types - well trained and poorly trained. -Poorly educated people are usually ex-convicts or from disadvantaged families. And they -open up- our firing positions, after which well-trained personnel join in, seeing where the attack began to repel. The attack on our positions begins. Live fishing. That's how they catch our guys on their baits,- said the head of the communications department of the 60th separate mechanized brigade. As he noted, there have been fewer mechanized assaults because they constantly fail. Recently there was an example of one of these rare attacks. -A single tank that left to strike our positions. It was neutralized with the help of FPV drones. It cannot be called a mechanized assault. Semi-mechanized assault. Who choked,- said Maksym Bilousov.

Already 100 units are reporting through Army+ about enemy damage — how it works	As reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, confirmation of damage or destruction of targets takes place in the DELTA combat system. At the same time, it is noted that the first 100 units began to report in this way. Commanders or their subordinates submit the damage report for the past day to Army+ once a day, after which the data is checked by analysts of the Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense. -The digitized analytical report will be available to the military high command. Paper reporting still remains. However, on the basis of the digital report on the damage, it is planned to implement in Army+ the submission of a report for receiving a reward for destroyed equipment quickly and conveniently,- the message reads. Units record destroyed or damaged objects on their own secure layers in the DELTA system, which has been put into operation in the Defense Forces and has successfully passed the information security check according to NATO standards. With DELTA, damage objects are added to Army+ automatically. -Information about the type of equipment and other parameters are pulled automatically using a QR code generated in DELTA. You can add a single object or a group at once. This speeds up the process and makes it more convenient. At the same time, Army+ does not store data about objects, and the generated report is deleted after signing and sent in encrypted form to the Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense,- the Ministry of Defense explains. They also added that the units that were not included in the list of the first to report to Armiya+, but wish to join, can contact the support service in the DELTA system or Army+. -This is a big step in creating relevant and transparent analytics of military operations. The launch of digital damage reports allows units of the Armed Forces and the National Guard to transmit objective information about enemy losses without delay. Thanks to the interaction of Armiya+ and DELTA, we ensure accurate accounting and reliability of information. The transparency of data will allow decisions to be made based on facts, not assumptions,- emphasized Kateryna Chernogorenko, deputy minister for digitalization. As reported by ArmyInform, The ground forces have become the best in implementing electronic reports in the Army+ application.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/vzhe-100-pidrozdiliv-zvituyut-cherez-armiya-pro-urazhennya-voroga-yak-cze-praczyuye/	2025-02-07T03:34:20-08:00

The corresponding entry was published on Friday, February 7, by the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade. Judging by its content, another meat assault of the occupiers failed, which led to panic among the personnel. In turn, the Russian commanders, realizing that the offensive was stalled, and their subordinates had also lost their equipment, began to get mad, threatening them with punishment if they -mowed down- even more. -The occupiers can retreat when it gets hot (run out or something?), but when they -move down-, they will stay in position for a while for 20 days. The spectacular work of our artillery and our drones adds to the local flavor,- the 63rd OMbr noted, commenting on the radio interception released to the public. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Russians complain about the commanders of the USSR, who ignore all their attempts to find out the fate of their missing relatives missing in the war against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/okupanty-panikuyut-yihni-komandyry-skazheniyut-radioperehoplennya-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-07T03:13:37-08:00
Ukraine surpasses Russia in the production of FPV drones — Ivan Gavrylyuk	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -If we talk about the production of FPV drones, Ukraine is currently ahead of the Russian Federation. The field of drones in Ukraine is developing at a breakneck pace. Both development and production,- he said. Since February 24, 2022, more than 1,300 new samples of weapons and military equipment produced by Ukrainian enterprises have been codified for the needs of the Defense Forces. Among them, the largest group is BpAK and ammunition for them. Only last year, more than 250 new models of UAVs of various types and purposes were approved for use in units of the Defense Forces. -But one must understand that the determining factor is not only the number of developed and manufactured drones. The most important thing is the efficiency of their application and the speed with which developers can react to changes,- noted Ivan Gavrilyuk. According to him, you can have hundreds of thousands of drones, but they will be powerless against enemy countermeasures. -In a cluster of drones - a month or three, and the effectiveness of one or another sample decreases. It is necessary to look for new ways to maintain efficiency. The technological -duel- between manufacturers of drones and EW tools clearly illustrates this. And here the advantage is on the side of the one whose engineers will sooner offer a technological solution to which the adversary will not have a ready answer,- he explained. The First Deputy Minister of Defense added that Ukraine currently needs help from partners, especially in supplying those types of weapons that it does not produce itself or produces in insufficient quantities. For example, air defense systems, heavy armored vehicles, NATO caliber ammunition, etc. -But at the same time, our domestic manufacturers of anti-aircraft guns are also increasing production volumes, mastering the production of new types of weapons and equipment. The government order is increasingly oriented towards the domestic manufacturer,- he noted. For example, last year almost 2/3 of the contracts for the purchase of anti-aircraft guns for the Armed Forces were signed with Ukrainian gunsmiths. -We managed to reduce dependence on imports, in particular special armored vehicles, and Ukraine is approaching self-sufficiency in the production of drones. I really want to note the production of long-range drones. Long-range strike drones today are a substitute for long-range missiles,- he summarized. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Ministry of Defense codified and allowed for operation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine a new modification of the domestically produced mobile washing-bath complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/ukrayina-perevazhaye-rosiyu-u-vygotovlenni-fpv-droniv-ivan-gavrylyuk/	2025-02-07T03:09:41-08:00

In the MOU, it was noted that last year DOT introduced a fuel procurement model based on a regional principle, expecting greater interest from market participants, taking into account the specifics of logistics chains depending on the region. This model provided for the division of supply into four regions: Eastern, Southern, Central and Western. Each region is divided into the following areas: -The number of bidders and the level of savings at auctions (reductions) confirmed the effectiveness of this procurement model. That is why, in order to increase competition and optimize the logistics processes of potential suppliers, the State operator of the rear is deepening the regional model,- the MOU said. Previously, the region covered 4 to 6 supply points. From now on, the number of lots will be doubled: instead of four large regional lots, there will be eight smaller ones with fewer supply points (from 1 to 2). Director of the fuel and lubricants program of the DOT, Maryna Yeremeyeva, noted that the fuel market in Ukraine is marked by significant security risks due to the constant threat from the Russian Federation. Therefore, suppliers do not store large volumes on the territory of Ukraine. -The deepening of the regional model makes it possible to reduce security risks for business, reducing the amount of fuel required to participate in the auction. This opens up opportunities for new market players and increases the level of competition, which, in turn, has a positive effect on the cost of defense products,- she explained. As a result of auctions for the purchase of Arctic diesel, on lots where there was only one bidder, the savings from the expected cost was on average 2.7%, while on lots where there were more than 2 bidders, the savings were on average 7.5%. In monetary terms, this made it possible to save 15.8 million hryvnias. The total savings on Arctic diesel auctions is more than UAH 82 million. -Arctic diesel fuel differs from winter diesel fuel in its higher resistance to low temperatures and is less present on the country's market,- said the MOU. At the same time, from April, DOT will start providing summer fuel, which, according to the Ministry of Defense, should increase the presence of other market participants in the auctions. It is noted that the introduction of an in-depth regional fuel procurement model will contribute to fair competition, better prices for the state and new business opportunities. For the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the DOT, it is fundamental to ensure the uninterrupted supply of fuel to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in 2024 implemented a large-scale plan to provide servicemen with the necessary footwear by purchasing and supplying various models of footwear for a total amount of over UAH 3.1 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/vyshhe-konkurencziya-nyzhche-vartist-dot-udoskonalyuye-zakupivli-palnogo-dlya-vijskovyh/	2025-02-07T00:55:42-08:00

A large mobilization in the Russian Federation, an unsuccessful North Korean debut and minus 46,000 ...	How does this relate to a possible peace negotiation process? But how does the current weather affect the enemy's ability to conduct assaults? This was told by military expert Petro Chernyk. -Interesting events are taking place now in the Pokrovsky direction in the part related to enemy losses. If at the beginning of January they were losing 300-360 people per day, now these numbers have decreased. A natural and profound question arises: why so? A few serious points. The first is the really big geopolitics. The enemy is regrouping forces. An active phase has begun - behind the scenes so far - negotiations on how to exit this phase of the war. We have no doubt that the Russians will become active when they understand that they need more serious arguments in the negotiation process. A big negotiation process has been declared: literally from today until the middle of April, when Trump should finally meet with Putin, with President Zelensky in Saudi Arabia. So at least it is declared. The second is purely technical. It's really cold, really damp, even though the Russians never expected it. But from a review of the first position: they still have to be counted, because you need to save strength. And there is one more cut. We have shown fantastic results in the extermination of their personnel in December of last year and in January of this year. This is more than 46-48 thousand per month. This is very serious. And the Russians enlist no more than 42-44 thousand. That is, they really haven't announced a big mobilization yet. I think that it will not be announced until Putin understands in the negotiation process what, how and to what end. Let's not forget the shameful defeat of the North Korean troops in Kurshchyna: more than 4,000 casualties. That's an incredible amount. And the enemy is forced to take all these moments into account. Plus, despite the fact that this infantry is not spared, the weather does not allow the use of heavy armored vehicles, because it gets stuck in the ground. This explains the decrease in enemy losses as such.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/velyka-mobilizacziya-v-rf-nevdalyj-pivnichnokorejskyj-debyut-ta-minus-46-000-rosiyan-ekspert-pro-boyi-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-06T21:41:55-08:00

Why -Mercedes- is better than -Zhiguli-, or How German -Leopards- crush the invaders near Pokrovsk	German -Leopards- are hidden in one of the numerous forest plantations of the Donetsk region. Locations are carefully camouflaged between trees, cars in hoods. Nearby we see the tank crew: the commander, the mechanic-driver, the gunner and the loader. The boys only performed combat missions at night. Currently under recovery. Let's meet: the commander of tank platoon 155 of the separate mechanized brigade of the -Anna Kyivska- ZSU, Dmytro, with the call sign -Green-. From Lviv. In the army since last August. He studied at the National University -Lviv Polytechnic-, majoring in -Automotive Transport-. -At one time, he graduated from the military department of the Lviv Polytechnic and became a reserve officer. When I enlisted, the formation of the 155th -Anna of Kyiv- brigade was just in progress. Therefore, I was immediately appointed to the position of tank platoon commander,- Dmytro says. Special training began at one of the training grounds in Ukraine, then the units of the brigade were sent for 1.5-month training abroad. Crews were formed there, Leopards were mastered and trained there. If the German Leopard tanks are compared with the Soviet T-64, T-72 and the British Challenger and the American Abrams, they are medium in size. Because the Challenger and Abrams are large and massive tanks that are much wider, taller and, accordingly, heavier. The T-64, T-72 are made with a lower landing, but the Leopards are slightly larger than these tanks. But in general, these combat vehicles are distinguished by their high mobility, speed, maneuverability and, most importantly, the accuracy of destroying targets. These advantages are especially felt over Soviet tanks. It's like comparing a German Mercedes with a Soviet Zhiguli. The tank has a fairly powerful diesel engine, so it is easier to maintain and repair, unlike, say, the Abrams. -Leopard- can accelerate up to 80 kilometers per hour, but only on the road. The guys squeezed more out of him. Off-road, of course, the speed will be lower. It can make a full turn on the spot in 10 seconds. Can go up to 30 km/h in reverse when coasting. This is very important when working with direct aim at the enemy, when you need to quickly strike and roll away. For example, in the same T-72, the reverse speed does not exceed 5 km/h. The machine is easy to maintain, the engine runs very quietly. This helps with combat deployments. A hundred meters away, no one will understand that this tank is moving. The roar of the engine, for example, T-64, is not to be confused with anything. In the winter, you can turn on the stove, and in the summer, the air conditioner, in short, everything is made for the crew in the tank, with comfort. Another advantage of this tank is its accuracy of hitting targets, unlike Soviet vehicles. Tanks have powerful weapons - a 120 mm gun manufactured by Rheinmetall, like the Abrams tank. Her ammunition is 27 shells. The effective firing range is up to 4 kilometers. The tanks are equipped with an electronic fire control system. This allows the crew to adjust shots, set ballistic corrections, projectile corrections, select the desired projectile, distance to the target, weather conditions, and the like. This is why the Leopards have such a high hit rate against moving targets. To aim, you simply place the marker on the target. The system also has a thermal sensor that helps detect hidden targets. A thermal imager is installed for shooting at night. In general, -Leopards-, for example, from a distance of 2 km, can easily deliver targeted strikes on enemy infantry, structures, fortifications, shelters, and military equipment. Shooting is conducted both by direct fire and from closed firing positions. Even a helicopter can be shot down from the tank's armament. If the rotorcraft flies at a certain speed and, relatively speaking, hovers, the fire control system selects a target and focuses. The computer calculates the possible distance that the projectile must travel to hit the point where the helicopter is expected to reach after a certain period of time. There is no such possibility in Soviet tanks. The Rashist helicopters have not yet been shot down near Pokrovsk, as the enemy does not use them. But we are always ready. Tankers call this leopard's technical ability dynamic advance. This system allows you to shoot tanks or any other moving armored vehicles with perfect accuracy, no matter at what speed. It all depends on the gunner, if he does everything right, then from the first shot he immediately hits the enemy equipment. Somehow, the command gave us the coordinates of the Russian targets. A column of enemy equipment was moving, the speed was approximately 40-50 km/h. The crew from the -sink- left for the area of ​​combat missions. So, with the first shot, we stopped the BMP. They took the target -point-blank-, a shot, the equipment is on fire. What is interesting, the cannon can aim at individual parts of the target. For example, to stop the movement of an enemy car, you can hit the undercarriage, and to -blow up- the tower - aim at it, hit and all. The accuracy of the gun is simply amazing. In addition to the thermal imager, the gunner uses a laser rangefinder to calculate the range to enemy targets. All this is done automatically and much faster than, again, in Soviet tanks. With its help, you can accurately aim and hit the target at a distance of 3-4 km. A very cool thing is the technical possibility for the tank commander to switch from his own sight to the gunner's sight, that is, to use his fire. There are different situations in battle. If I see a higher priority target or a target that threatens the life of the crew, then I can calmly take control and fire a shot myself. Likewise, I can easily hand control over to the gunner. The charging mode in this tank is manual. That is, how it happens: the gunner measured the target, the loader loaded the projectile and pressed the button - which projectile will be used. Then the on-board computer of the tank works, the -technical moments- of the shot are calculated and -voila- - you shoot and hit. The shells are separated from the crew by an armored partition and are located behind the tank, while in the Soviet ones, on the contrary, they are located in special compartments in the hull and turret of the tank. This increases the chances of survival of the -Leopard- crew in the event of a projectile hitting the tower, unlike the T-72. Tanks have good armor that provides a high level of protection for the crew. For example, a turret armor plate 650 mm thick. In addition, dynamic protection is installed, which covers the frontal part of the machine and the tower, as well as most of the side of the hull. The junction of the tower and the hull is additionally covered. Withstands hits from cluster bombs, grenade launchers and drone drops. The tank is equipped with anti-drone protection and a EW device. In a combat situation, the -barbecue- installed above the car saved the crew from FPV drones. The cumulative burst when it collided with the welded structure, but the tank continued to move. In general, the survivability of the crew in the tank is about 99.9%. Without exaggeration, it feels like you are sitting in an -armored capsule-. Can it withstand the impact of anti-tank guided missiles? I do not know and I hope that I will not find out! Here in the Pokrovsky direction, we work against the enemy mostly with -direct fire-. Just the other day, we received the coordinates of the location of the occupiers from the command. It was a forest plantation, more than 500 meters wide, which had to be cleared urgently. The Rashists had shelters there, preparing for an assault on the positions of our infantry. We quickly left, the target was more than 1 km away, set up and opened fire. They worked very intensively, to put it bluntly, they practically destroyed this forest plantation together with the Russians. There was no living space left there. Almost 70 percent of the perimeter of the hundred was destroyed. They could have done more, but it was necessary to quickly roll back, as enemy FPV drones were flying into the area. We don't get too close to the contact line, but it's not necessary. The combat capabilities of the tank allow you to effectively destroy the enemy at a distance of up to 2 km. We regularly destroy small assault groups, some enemy shelters. We do everything so that the enemy does not advance, grind him in places of concentration. This is our daily combat work, technically we fight much less often.- A few words about the combat situation on the front line important for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As Yuriy, the head of the communications department of the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the -Anna Kyivska- Armed Forces of Ukraine, told ArmiyaInform, the Pokrovsky direction accounts for almost half of all combats on the front. -The Russians are now not going to the city in the front, but are attacking on the flanks. They are trying to cut the main highways that lead to Pokrovsk from Kostyantynivka and Pavlograd. Recently, particularly heavy fighting has been going on in the direction of the administrative borders with the Dnipropetrovsk region. Katsaps advance in infantry groups supported by drones, tactical aircraft, tanks and artillery fire. Units of the 155th -Anna Kyivska- brigade are fighting hard battles with the enemy in their area of ​​responsibility, -unwinding- the enemy, inflicting huge losses in manpower and equipment. Combat work does not stop either day or night,- the officer said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/chomu-mersedes-krashhyj-za-zhyguli-abo-yak-nimeczki-leopardy-troshhat-okupantiv-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-02-06T21:07:02-08:00
Protect your own and attack a stranger: CROWS combat modules have been relevant for more than a deca...	For the first time, according to the authors of the military-historical portal ABN Newswire, the creation of a prototype of a remote-controlled weapons system that would protect the gunners of combat vehicles while moving in a convoy or directly on the battlefield was thought about in the USA back in 1988, ArmyInform notes. Then they began to design a remote control system for small arms fire (JSSAMP) for the Pentagon. The project received acceptable solutions in 1996, when it was possible to achieve the introduction of motorization and stabilization of weapon aiming, after which it was possible to -hide- the gunner directly in the hull of the armored vehicle. And finally, these works were completed before the start of the campaign of the US and coalition forces -Operation Iraqi Freedom- in 2004. In general, CROWS (English - Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station) is the general name for combat modules with remote fire control. As the authors of the defense portal BuildingTECH remind, CROWS is an integrated system consisting of a stabilized weapon mount, a set of advanced sensors, control modules and software for accurate shooting. Stabilization allows you to fire even while the vehicle is moving, which is especially important in dynamic combat conditions. The sensor kit includes a daytime video camera, a thermal imager for night operations and a laser range finder. At the same time, these devices provide the operator with the ability to detect, identify and accurately engage targets at any time, regardless of weather or lighting conditions. The CROWS system was developed to install medium and small-caliber weapons and additional equipment on it. Intended for installation of any existing platforms. The line of sight in use (DLOS) allows the operator to maintain his sight on the selected target regardless of the ballistic characteristics of the weapon in use or its ammunition. The system is fully stabilized, which ensures the possibility of interaction of various weapons and accuracy of targeting. The versatility of the CROWS system is achieved due to its compatibility with a wide range of weapons. She can operate machine guns such as the M2 .50 Cal, M240B, MK19 and M134 Minigun, as well as light machine guns including the M249 SAW. To combat an armored target, integration with the Javelin missile system is provided. Additionally, the CROWS supports grenade launchers such as the M320 and M307, making it an effective tool for close combat and anti-vehicle combat. The CROWS system has an intuitive control interface, which facilitates its operation even for operators with minimal experience. The crew can easily aim weapons on the target, fire accurately and quickly change weapons depending on the mission. This makes the module an essential component of the modern war machine, providing a strategic advantage on the battlefield. One of the legislators of a kind of military fashion for remote modules is the Norwegian company Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. For more than two decades, KONGSBERG has been the world's leading supplier of remote-controlled combat modules. Their experience is millions of hours of operational use in various conditions on the basis of more than 20,000 delivered systems for almost three dozen countries. In particular, its PROTECTOR module is constantly being improved to meet higher requirements, using technological advances to meet today's threats. With its ability to increase crew situational awareness, minimize risk and reduce reaction time, CROWS is becoming an indispensable tool for armies. The remotely controlled combat module is used not only for defensive tasks, but also for active support of ground operations, patrolling and base protection. In conditions where soldiers' lives depend on precision, speed and safety, technologies such as CROWS are becoming critical elements of military strategy.

Propaganda again -defeated- mercenaries in an empty hotel	Now for some reality. The hotel in question has been empty for years. It had not been used for a long time, everything was falling apart inside, and the windows had been broken during previous shelling of the city. And this abandoned house suddenly became a -military base-! Truly an invisible army that only the best minds of the Kremlin could calculate. If Russian propagandists are to be believed, every building in Ukraine is a headquarters, every apartment is an ammunition depot, and every resident is either a -Nazi- or a -mercenary.- Well, if the evidence does not match, it can simply not be provided. Well, another -grand victory- in the treasury of fakes. the Russians are again at war with their own imaginations, bombing ruins and capturing cities that cannot even be found on the map.

-Yariy-: the marines presented a documentary film about the fierce battles in the Kursk direction	This is discussed in a post on the brigade's page. -Yariy- is not just a movie, it is a reflection of the reality of war, where under continuous enemy fire, our defenders are fighting for every piece of their native land. The film tells about the evacuation of wounded comrades, fire suppression of the enemy and support of assault groups. Viewers will be able to see how the devastating circumstances make adjustments to the planning of operations, but are unable to stop the Marines' will to victory. -Yariy- is a testimony to the indomitable spirit, courage and heroism of Ukrainian soldiers who risk their lives every day for the sake of the freedom and independence of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, aerial reconnaissance of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky's drops and FPV drones hit the Russians who tried to attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/yaryj-morpihy-prezentuvaly-dokumentalnyj-film-pro-zapekli-boyi-na-kurskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-06T11:59:00-08:00

They burned -Zoopark- - mountain drones left the enemy without a radar	The video of combat work was released on February 6 on the battalion channel. The enemy hid the radar in the landing, where it was found and hit by our pilots. They had to waste several FPV drones to get the radar to finally light up. -This enemy system was a serious threat to our troops, because it allowed the enemy to detect and determine the location of our artillery. Its destruction is a big step towards victory, which will significantly weaken the enemy and strengthen our positions,- the battalion commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the Galician Squad 1 unit of the 10th rifle battalion of the mountain assault brigade -Edelweiss- repelled a powerful assault of several dozen enemy motorcyclists in the Siversk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/spalyly-zoopark-girski-dronari-zalyshyly-voroga-bez-rls/	2025-02-06T11:39:03-08:00

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this on Thursday, February 6. According to the plan of the aggressor country, the so-called roskomnadzor should create a new -data processing center- and modernize the existing server facilities in order to increase the effectiveness of monitoring and blocking of -unwanted- content. -As always, Russia seeks to achieve the highest possible level of information isolation and completely cut off the population from the truth. A means of the aggressor's control over the information environment in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is also the launch of more than 2,500 sites for the occupation administrations and other so-called authorities,- warned the GUR. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Russian propaganda is trying to destabilize the socio-political situation in Ukraine in order to disrupt mobilization and split among citizens.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/nye-boltaj-u-gur-poyasnyly-yak-rf-posylyuye-informaczijnu-izolyacziyu-okupovanyh-terytorij/	2025-02-06T11:31:34-08:00
-We know, we find, we destroy-: exclusive footage of the battle of the special unit -Artan-	The video of combat work was published on the unit's page.

Two higher educations and two SAMs — how a political scientist and jurist began to shoot down enemy ...	About the fighter told on February 6 Air Command -Center- of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Denis joined the Air Force in December 2022, inspired by the feat of our defenders. Before his service, he had a civilian job, 2 higher educations in -Political Science- and -Jurisprudence-. All this only strengthened his ability to master both the old Soviet S-300 system and the modern NASAMS anti-aircraft missile complex. Even with the S-300, Denys knows that there is nothing better than seeing the control sign -Miss is normal- on the indicator (the height and speed of the target are falling) and realizing that another enemy threat has been neutralized. The combat work of his team on the S-300 is about 20 destroyed enemy targets, including cruise missiles and drones. Sometimes one shot was enough to shoot down two missiles at the same time - this is the result of the coordination and skill of the combat service. Denis calls to join the Air Force and become a guardian of our sky.

-Doctors recognized the 200th-: Junior Sergeant -Bandera- returned to the front after being mortally...	The story of one of these soldiers was shared on Thursday, February 6, by the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Meet junior sergeant -Bandera- - senior gunner of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade. -At war from the first days. In the summer of 2022, while defending the village of Blagodatne in the Mykolaiv region, he was fatally wounded in the head by an enemy sniper. The doctors recognized him as -two hundred-, but in a few minutes he regained consciousness and managed to get to the evacuation point with the help of his comrades,- the military said. At the same time, despite such a complex injury, after the recovery of -Bander- he again joined the ranks of the Armed Forces. However, this is far from the only adventure that he remembered during his service. The Ukrainian defender recalls how he and his comrades captured the Russian BMP-2, which the occupiers left in the middle of a reservoir near Torsky in Donetsk region. The armored vehicle was completely under water, but after an enemy shell hit the dam, the water level fell and there was an opportunity to seize it. -As far as I know, they were leaving somewhere in 2022&#8230; They completely left -beha- with BC. Fully charged. We had about six exits. Our role was to swim up and see what condition she was in,- Bandera shared his memories of that operation. But see how it went in the plot. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian sniper under the nickname -Laughter- proved that there is no safe distance for the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/likari-vyznaly-200-m-molodshyj-serzhant-bandera-povernuvsya-na-front-pislya-smertelnogo-poranennya/	2025-02-06T10:56:49-08:00

Major Anton Zakharchuk, deputy commander of the air mobile battalion of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, gave this assessment of the situation in this area on Army TV. -The situation in the brigade lane is difficult, but under control. The enemy is not currently conducting mass and active assaults, but local assaults by small tactical groups are present,- the Ukrainian officer said. Commenting on the information about the withdrawal of the North Korean troops in this direction, he explained that the absence of large-scale assault actions just shows that -some forces and means of the enemy have been withdrawn.- -Now this allows us to better organize our defense system, especially in terms of engineering, conduct retraining and further prepare for future assault operations,- said a representative of the 95th ODSHBr. He also noted that conducting hostilities on -their own land- does not affect the motivation of Russian troops in general, so there is little difference from their approaches on Ukrainian territory. -They act as, for example, in Donbas. The same is true in the Kursk region,- Anton Zakharchuk stated. As ArmyInform reported, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky honored Ukrainian soldiers participating in the operation in the Kursk region with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/aktyvnosti-rf-zagalom-znyzylas-bijczi-zsu-pidtverdzhuyut-znyknennya-soldativ-kndr-na-kurshhyni/	2025-02-06T10:48:35-08:00
The evaders got stuck in the mud, trying to escape to Moldova	On Thursday, February 6, reported in the DPSU press service. -In order to implement the idea, the men turned to the Telegram channel administrator for help, who for a fee provided advice on crossing the border without hindrance. Without any guarantees of successful remittance, the violators transferred a total of $10,000 to the -advisor's- crypto wallet, the report says. However, their journey turned out to be far from as cloudless as they had hoped. During an attempt to illegally cross the border, the car with dodgers got stuck in the mud, so they -reclassified from passengers to pedestrians.- Meanwhile, the driver himself, having freed himself from his fellow passengers, sped towards the border, but he was also detained in the end. -For an attempt to illegally cross the state border, administrative offenses were filed against five men Article 204-1 of the Code of Administrative Offenses (illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine), the case has been sent to court,- the border guards added. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use vacancy aggregator in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/uhylyanty-zastryagly-u-bagnyuczi-namagayuchys-vtekty-do-moldovy/	2025-02-06T10:43:53-08:00
The cultural code of Slobozhanshchyna: how the native land shapes the worldview of fighters -Azov-	This is discussed in posts on the brigade page. The heroine of the second episode was the medical supply officer and head of the escort service of the 12th Azov brigade - -Rina-. She talks about her hometown - Kharkiv, about Slobozhanshchyna and its significant cultural contribution to the formation of the Ukrainian nation. -Rina- was born in Kharkiv, a city that has always been a center of education, culture and intellectual development. It was here in the 19th century that one of the first universities in Ukraine appeared, which became a center of scientific and cultural thought. Kharkiv gave the world unique artistic phenomena. The Kharkiv school of photography, which gained international recognition in the 20th century, deserves special attention. The traditions of this school continue to inspire modern Ukrainian photographers. Theater art also found its way in Kharkiv. The legendary theater -Berezil- under the leadership of Les Kurbas opened new horizons for the Ukrainian stage. Modern Kharkiv directors, in particular Andrii Zholdak, continue to develop this trend at the European level. A separate layer of Kharkiv's cultural life is music. Ukrainian black metal was born in the Northern Saltivka region, and underground clubs became the center of the musical movement. One of the most famous was the Zhivot club, where young people listened to alternative music and experienced their first concert emotions. Today, rock and metal are giving way to the electronic scene. The local cultural platform -Kulturizvuk- has become a hub for fans of modern electronic music and vinyl. While studying in Kyiv, Rina discovered the rich world of ethnic and neofolk music. Ukrainian bands of the late 20th century, in particular -Sugar, White Death-, became part of her cultural self-identification. This process of deeper immersion in one's own roots is a reflection of the common path of Ukrainians — learning about one's history, reviving traditions and realizing the national cultural code. The Genesis project does not just tell stories - it demonstrates how culture becomes a weapon and a source of strength for those who defend Ukraine. After all, we are born, live and die with the cultural code of our native land. As reported by ArmyInform, to the Day of the National Assembly of Ukraine, the 12th special purpose brigade -Azov- in cooperation with the public organization AZOV.ONE and a musical band -DahaBrakha- presented a unique cultural project called -Genesis-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/kulturnyj-kod-slobozhanshhyny-yak-ridna-zemlya-formuye-svitoglyad-bijcziv-azovu/	2025-02-06T10:31:32-08:00
Once in the Luhansk region, our pilots bombed another enemy city	The video of the defeat was released on February 6 on the regiment channel. The occupiers were moving at high speed, but this did not save them from a precise reset. According to the drone operators, it is not an easy task to hunt down MLRS, because the enemy usually uses the -strike-withdrawal- tactic: the firing positions are located in one place, and the hiding place is in another, at a distance of tens of kilometers. However, high-quality intelligence and careful planning allow our operators to carry out such operations with high efficiency. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the 412 Nemesis Regiment detected and delivered a precise strike on the Russian Tor anti-aircraft missile system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/odnogo-razu-na-luganshhyni-nashi-piloty-rozbombyly-chergovyj-vorozhyj-grad/	2025-02-06T10:20:38-08:00
-Soldiers are disposable material- — in Kurshchyna, Russian generals storm - with walkers -	This was told by Stanislav Krasnov, platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade, on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon. According to him, the enemy is constantly changing tactics. This is due to heavy losses in armor and manpower. Some units are completely destroyed by our forces, new ones come. -They recently stormed in large groups of infantry. As it is known from open sources, these were North Korean soldiers. Suffered huge losses. At this moment, the Russians returned to their classic assaults in smaller groups,- Stanislav Krasnov said. Periodically, the Russians still use armored vehicles. The task is simply to get the landing party to our positions. As a rule, in most cases this armored vehicle is burned, and few people are lucky enough to return from an enemy landing. -The losses are really huge. I have not observed such large losses in other directions. They don't spare their life force here at all. Soldiers are used as disposable material, as &#8220;expendables&#8221;. Our team published statistics not so long ago. In the area, 5,000 servicemen were destroyed by our brigade during the Kursk operation,- said the platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade. As reported ArmyInform, in the Lyman direction, the enemy uses a large number of various UAVs, including fiber-optic drones.

A Russian agent who blew up the house of an Armed Forces veteran was detained in Kharkiv	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. For the conspiracy, the agent used wigs, and after committing the crime, she tried to destroy her clothes. However, it did not help her. SBU counter-intelligence quickly identified and detained the perpetrator in her apartment. The investigation established that the unemployed woman from Kharkiv was recruited remotely because of her anti-Ukrainian comments in Telegram channels. The Russian curator gave her instructions: to take an improvised explosive device from a hiding place and plant it in a car tire near a military man's house. The agent also planted a disguised mobile phone across from the victim's yard, through which the enemy monitored the veteran's movements and remotely activated the explosives. During the searches, a mobile phone containing correspondence with a Russian curator in an anonymous messenger chat was seized from the detainee. The investigators of the SBU informed the perpetrator about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (terrorist act that led to serious consequences). She faces up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. She is currently being held without bail. The operation to expose and detain the Russian agent was carried out by SBU officers in the Kharkiv region together with the National Police under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office. As reported by ArmyInform, The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) warns of new tactics of Russian special services. They are recruiting citizens of Ukraine to carry out sabotage, in particular, to blow up territorial assembly centers (TCC) and then destroy the performers to cover their tracks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/u-harkovi-zatrymaly-rosijsku-agentku-yaka-pidirvala-budynok-veterana-zsu/	2025-02-06T09:43:20-08:00
-Here fate brings unexpected people together-: the story of a marine -Kuma-	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the army, -Kum- met people with whom fate would hardly have brought him together in civilian life. -Captains of long-distance sailing, teachers, athletes, entrepreneurs, builders,- lists a serviceman of the 126th separate brigade of the 30th Marine Corps. — Such an interesting circle of communication. And everyone is like one big family. Complex characters, different life experiences, social status&#8230; They can be harsh and do not always express themselves culturally. But these are just, honest people who you can rely on and who will cover your back in a critical situation.- Before the large-scale invasion, the Odessa man -Kum- worked as a private security guard. On March 25, 2022, he went to the TCC and mobilized. He says that he was prompted by the atrocities committed by the Russians in Mariupol, Buchi, Irpen, and other cities and villages of Ukraine. -It really shocked me. I love my family, my daughter, my country. -I love people, that's why I joined the army to protect them from the arbitrariness and cruelty of the occupiers,- says -Kum-. He held the defense of the right bank of the Kherson region, carried out combat missions on the Dnieper islands. This is a very specific area - a swampy area where it is difficult to dig in. The enemy actively uses all possible weapons here, especially unmanned systems and artillery. -There are an extremely large number of drones - they are scouts, FPV, and -maviks- with resets,- says Kum. - They work around the clock, so first of all we have to arrange a shelter so that the enemy cannot see us from above. This is a very difficult task. However, we must carry it out in order to hold our positions, prevent the Russians from occupying them and cross over to the right bank of the Dnieper.- The most emotional moment is, of course, returning from a combat exit. -I haven't been in touch for three weeks. My youngest daughter was the first person I called. Her words -I love you, daddy- are probably the most expensive gift,- says the soldier. According to -The Godfather-, no matter how strict, unmovable and iron-clad the warriors may be on the outside, they remain ordinary people. -We get tired, it hurts, it's uncomfortable, it's physically and emotionally unbearable. And it's scary. Even if we don't admit it. But I don't think it's a bad thing. Everyone has their own fears that need to be overcome. You don't always do what you want. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do. In the case of the military, it is the execution of an order. This is our job, we joined the army for this,- he is convinced. Recently, -Kum- was seriously injured and is currently in the hospital. However, his comrades wish him a speedy recovery and remind him that he can always count on the support and help of his large military family. As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers. He went through a difficult battle path, destroying many enemies, and became a true professional in his field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/tut-dolya-zvodyt-z-nespodivanymy-lyudmy-istoriya-morskogo-pihotynczya-kuma/	2025-02-06T09:32:14-08:00
We brought the war home to Russia — the President on the Kursk operation	This was announced by the President on February 6 in his evening address. -Today, I awarded the participants of the Kursk operation: two boys - Heroes of Ukraine, I also presented -Crosses of Combat Merit-, orders of Ukraine. I want to thank every Ukrainian soldier, all our units, which are involved in the Kursk region and which have shown the whole world that we can act actively, unexpectedly and effectively, even in conditions of limited resources. We detect a Russian bluff as a bluff. We protect our cities — Sumy and Kharkiv. We have significantly replenished the exchange fund — these are hundreds and hundreds of Russian soldiers, whom we are exchanging in order to return Ukrainians from captivity. We also have North Korean soldiers in captivity - now they are undergoing treatment, they were wounded in battles. Serious injuries. But they are proof that Putin has drawn another state into this war — North Korea — and is teaching that state to wage modern warfare. This is a threat to everyone, to every country in East Asia. And I am grateful to all partners who understand how important it is to stop Russia now — now, so that we don't have to fight years from now,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He noted the brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that are involved in Kurshchyna: soldiers of the 80th, 82nd, 95th, 22nd, 61st brigades, 36th marine brigades, 17th tank, 47th mechanized, 129th infantry brigade, soldiers of the Special Operations Forces, soldiers of the Security Service of Ukraine, all the involved forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. -I also want to thank Chief of Staff General Sirsky for planning the Kursk operation. The significance of the Kursk operation will be reflected both in the diplomacy that will take place and in the history that will be written by Ukrainians — our people, not the occupiers.- Volodymyr Zelensky also thanked France, personally President Emmanuel Macron, for fulfilling the agreements. -Our Air Force is now supplemented with Mirages, French aircraft, and this is another stage in the development of Ukrainian military aviation. We will be able to perform more tasks. I also thank the Netherlands - there is a new supply of F-16, and this is significant,- the President assured. He also talked about the meeting with the president of the EBRD, who is currently visiting Ukraine. -I am grateful for Ukraine's support - the programs of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are aimed at many important directions. And today, we talked with the EBRD, in particular, about the need to support Ukrainian migrants - our internal migrants, all those who were forced to leave their homes because of the war, who lost their homes. It is necessary to help these people in a new place to get normal apartments or houses: this is the most important issue for millions of Ukrainian migrants - their own home. And our partners definitely have a resource to help with that. Today, he also assigned relevant tasks to Finance Minister Marchenko and Deputy Prime Minister for Reconstruction Kulebi. Within two weeks, there should be a clear program — a program to support internally displaced people that is effective and understandable to people. I thank everyone who is with Ukraine!- Volodymyr Zelenskyi concluded his speech. As reported by ArmyInform, the President awarded the participants of the Kursk operation with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/my-povernuly-vijnu-dodomu-u-rosiyu-prezydent-pro-kursku-operacziyu/	2025-02-06T09:23:07-08:00
Divers of the TSP -Omega-: how elite fighters are trained for special operations on water	This is is discussed in a post on the unit page. -Divers of the Omega CSP can become a determining factor in the success of combat operations. They are not just ready to work on the water - they change the course of events thanks to their unique skills,- Major General Pavlo Yatsyuk emphasized. Diving groups have been operating as part of -Omega- since the creation of the division in 2003. In 2015, taking into account the needs of combat operations and geographical features, an additional group was created in Odesa, which made it possible to work more effectively in maritime conditions. -We constantly analyze the possibilities of expanding diving groups, optimize their structure and prepare for new challenges. The war forces us to adapt and improve in order to be one step ahead,- noted the head of the Central Security Service. Divers of the TSP -Omega- work in the most difficult areas of the front, performing a wide range of tasks: Personnel operate along the entire front line. Their work is critical, especially given that much of the battle line runs along bodies of water. -Only specialists trained in water warfare are able to effectively perform such tasks. Our divers understand the responsibility assigned to them, and make a significant contribution to the defense of Ukraine,- emphasized Pavlo Yatsyuk. Special forces divers are trained taking into account real combat conditions. Instructors carefully practice all possible scenarios to prepare personnel for the most difficult challenges. -Our fighters train as they will work on the battlefield. Their professionalism and level of training is extremely respectable. I am grateful to everyone for their dedication and willingness to act where it is most dangerous,- added the head of the Omega Central Security Service. As reported by ArmyInform, the special-purpose divers of the Omega Special Operations Center continue to improve their skills even in winter conditions the cold For five days, the fighters practiced difficult tasks in reservoirs adapted for diving and working on water.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/vodolazy-czsp-omega-yak-gotuyut-elitnyh-bijcziv-dlya-speczoperaczij-na-vodi/	2025-02-06T09:17:44-08:00

The invader attempted to cross a puddle and was struck by our FPV drone during this difficult operation. -The crew of Slayers is working, kudos to these Cossacks. We destroy the enemy every day!-, the battalion commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv direction fierce fighting continues. Fighters of the -Hydra- unit from the 2nd mechanized company of the 2nd mechanized battalion of the Third Assault Brigade conducted a successful operation to clear the enemy dugout where the Russian occupiers were holed up.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/geroyizm-ne-propyesh-na-harkivshhyni-rosijskyj-shturmovyk-zagynuv-pry-forsuvanni-kalyuzhi/	2025-02-06T09:03:49-08:00
Shark -ate- -Hyacinth- - a long-range Russian cannon was hit	The video of the defeat was published on the unit's channel. The Russian self-propelled gun can fire effectively at a distance of more than 33 kilometers, so it is usually placed quite far from the front line. This time, the Russians hid their long-range -flower- in the landing, but this did not prevent our aerial scouts, who, with the help of the Shark reconnaissance UAV, spotted the enemy artillery system and transmitted its coordinates. Not long after, Hyacinth-S flew by. Judging by the power of the explosion, the ammunition package also detonated. We hope that the crew also did not leave their combat vehicle in trouble. As reported by ArmyInform, thanks to M777 hit the enemy minus two -Hyacintas- in the Zaporizhzhya direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/shark-zyiv-giaczynt-urazheno-dalekobijnu-rosijsku-garmatu/	2025-02-06T08:47:42-08:00
Soledar - his pain, Ukraine - his struggle: the story of a soldier on the call sign -Donbas-	At the age of 18, Vladyslav signed a three-year contract with the ZSU. He knew he wanted to become an artilleryman and chose to serve in the 23rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, which received NATO equipment. First, he was a service number of a self-propelled howitzer, then a — driver-mechanic. He is now a senior gunner in the self-propelled artillery division, working on the M109L. Despite the difficult conditions and constant battles, Vladyslav, who is called -Donbas- by his brothers, knows that the most important thing is the people around him. A real brotherhood prevails in the brigade, which unites them in the struggle for every piece of native land. -Together we are stronger. Everyone has to protect their land and family. Warriors are not born — they become warriors,- — says the fighter. Soledar, Donbas, Ukraine — his pain, his struggle. And he fights for those who remained under occupation and for those who no longer have a home. As ArmiyaInform reported, the role of a psychologist in the war for survival is difficult to overestimate. Not only the body, but also the soul of warriors are wounded. Lieutenant Sergey Rostikov heads the combat stress control group in 21 separate mechanized brigades.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/soledar-jogo-bil-ukrayina-jogo-borotba-istoriya-voyina-donbasa/	2025-02-06T08:32:42-08:00
-Pack your suitcases and prepare your wallets-: the occupiers give ultimatums to the residents of TO...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. Residents have to solve the issue of transporting things and finding a new home on their own. Russian contractors are not responsible for the possible disappearance of personal items that may be -found- during the so-called demonstrative repair. While some are forced to look for new housing, others are outraged by new -improvements- from the occupation authorities. In the so-called LNR, since February 1, the cost of travel in city and intercity transport has been significantly increased - the fares have doubled. This also applies to communal transport in Luhansk, where there has been a shortage of drivers for a long time. By raising prices, the occupation administration is trying to make transport companies more attractive for work. However, according to local residents, the quality of transportation remains far from satisfactory. Promises to improve living conditions in the temporarily occupied territories once again turn out to be empty words. People are forced to leave their homes and pay more for the same or even worse services. As reported by ArmyInform, collaborators who went to serve the occupiers found themselves in a difficult situation in the temporarily occupied Luhansk Region. Employees of the so-called state cultural institutions have not received salaries for almost two years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/pakujte-valizy-ta-gotujte-gamanczi-okupanty-stavlyat-ultymatumy-zhytelyam-tot-luganshhyny/	2025-02-06T08:12:17-08:00

Marines from the 37th brigade cleared and destroyed one of the enemy positions in the Novopavlovsk direction. Under the cover of an Oshkosh M-ATV armored car, our fighters forced the Russians to take cover. Then part of the marines took up positions while other fighters planted explosives and blew up the Russians in their hiding place. A group of four Russians decided to go for a walk to storm our positions. Drone operators from the -Charter- brigade decided to disperse the hostile tourists. It took them only 13 minutes to destroy the entire group of Russians. Another Russian decided to go for a walk without his friends. So our drone went for a walk with him. The occupier did not try to drive away his new friend, or even shoot back, he just calmly accepted his death. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - Lieutenant Serhii Lipko and Junior Lieutenant Volodymyr Kravchuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/okupant-vtratyv-golovu-vid-drona-ukrayina-otrymala-novi-vynyshhuvachi-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2025-02-06T07:54:28-08:00
They crossed the border at the beginning of summer — the special forces told about the secrets of th...	This was reported by the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on February 6. This application led to multi-layered pressure on the Russian troops and created conditions for the rapid advance of the main forces in Kurshchyna. When in June 2024, Russia continued to carry out loud airstrikes in the Sumy region, small CCO groups entered the enemy rear in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. Two months remained before the start of a large-scale operation in Kurshchyna. SSO operators advanced early through the territory of the Russian Federation as part of preparations for the Kursk operation long before the world learned about the main offensive of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Through careful reconnaissance and strikes against the enemy's rear structures, they destroyed the key elements of the Russian defense in the border region. Thanks to planning, the destruction of Russian air defense systems and ammunition depots did not leave the enemy the opportunity to react quickly. Point strikes on enemy strategic objects and logistics made it impossible to quickly transfer reinforcements. This performance allowed the SSO to bring the main contingent of Ukrainian troops along the prepared routes. The August offensive in Kurshchyna began with minimal resistance from the Russian army. This is the only time since the Second World War when foreign troops crossed the borders of Russia. And its military-political leadership proved unable to respond promptly to the changing situation and the asymmetry of the war. As the main units of the Ukrainian army advanced deep into Kurshchyna, special purpose groups and the SSO Resistance Movement carried out raid operations, ambushes and sabotage, blew up bridges and crossings in the enemy's rear. Combat work was coordinated with friendly units of the Defense Forces. Swarms of drones also did their thing in a sky clear of enemy air defense and EW. BpAK SSO pilots destroyed Russian logistics convoys, heavy equipment and military personnel. Not only kinetic actions were used. At the same time, units of Psychological Operations of the SSO wreaked havoc among civilians, and the Russian military was disorganized through the operation codenamed -Seneca-. However, the Russians tried to reverse the course of events by involving North Korean troops in the hostilities at the end of autumn. However, the special forces quickly adapted and inflicted some of the biggest losses on North Korean troops since the end of the active phase of the Korean War more than 70 years ago. Repelling another North Korean assault, the SSO unit was the first to capture the documents and weapons of the North Korean troops. The trophies revealed details about the level of their combat, physical and ideological training. Despite good equipment and high morale, North Korean troops were unprepared for modern warfare. FPV drone strikes only confirmed this. The North Korean special agent, who was the first to be captured by SSO operators, is already testifying in the SBU and providing valuable intelligence information. Ultimately, the deep autonomy and high training of the SSO units during the months of work during the Kursk operation allowed the Special Operations Forces to operate without the need for constant support from other units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. And smart application, mobility, coordination of actions and high-tech equipment of the SSO prove that the defense of the prevailing enemy can be effectively undermined and achieved success. -The Kursk operation continues. We continue to work!-, said the message of the SSO of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, half a year after the start of the Kursk operation, President honored its participants with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/peretnuly-kordon-shhe-na-pochatku-lita-speczpryznachenczi-rozpovily-pro-tayemnyczi-kurskoyi-operacziyi/	2025-02-06T07:46:19-08:00

As noted, the main technical characteristics of the drone are that it easily overcomes a variety of landscape obstacles, so it will pass without much effort even to the most difficult-to-reach places. -Technical characteristics of the Terminator: it will easily overcome various landscape obstacles and pass through difficult terrain without much effort. Invisibly for the enemy, it replaces the terrain and can transport up to 8 anti-tank mines on itself,- the message reads. And a machine gun can be installed on this drone so that it fires from an ambush or during offensive operations destroys enemy infantry and suppresses firing points. In addition, this platform is able to deliver ammunition, provisions, medicines and even carry the wounded. -What is the meaning of his work? After all, such combat tasks can be performed by ordinary infantrymen. Of course they can. But the combat work of one such minefield robot can replace up to four servicemen — and in this case there is an opportunity to perform a combat mission without risking the lives of fellow combatants, whose preservation is a priority,- the military emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the 33rd OMBR shared a selection where Ukrainian FPV drones organized a real hunt for the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/znajomtes-terminator-zsu-rozpovily-pro-nazemnogo-drona-yakyj-mozhe-minuvaty-misczevist-ta-nyshhyty-okupantiv-z-kulemeta/	2025-02-06T07:36:44-08:00
A treacherous singer went to court, from whom more than 9 hectares of land and 9 songs were taken	This was announced on February 6 by the Prosecutor General's Office. The accused left for Russia in 2014, now lives in Moscow and conducts creative and entrepreneurial activities there. In 2023, she received Russian citizenship. The investigation established that, having conscious anti-Ukrainian ideological motives, the artist actively supports the President of the Russian Federation. In particular, he participates in various political actions. The accused willingly gives interviews to propaganda media in which she glorifies Russian military-political ideals and humiliates Ukrainians, calling them -zombified Nazis.- According to the materials of the prosecutor's office, the High Anti-Corruption Court made a decision to collect from the state income the assets belonging to the accused: — seven land plots in the Kyiv region with a total area of ​​9.3 hectares; — a residential building with a total area of ​​442 square meters. m; — home ownership with a total area of ​​101 square meters. m; — two vehicles; — four units of weapons; — property rights to music and words for up to 9 works.

Six months after the beginning of the Kursk operation: the President honored its participants with s...	This was reported by his press service on Thursday, February 6. The head of state noted that thanks to the Kursk operation, which began exactly six months ago, it was possible to prevent a new Russian attack on Sumy and Kharkiv, returning the war to the territory of the aggressor country itself. -Aggressors and criminals can and should be beaten at home. The occupier can and should be surrendered on his territory. And it is not only fair, it is also effective — for the protection of life in our country and in Europe in general. The Kursk operation clearly explains the meaning of the principle -peace through strength,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, the Kursk operation gave Ukraine a significant replenishment of the exchange fund and drew strong Russian units to the territory of the Russian Federation. In addition, the President thanked the soldiers and commanders who ensure the effectiveness of the operation in Kurshchyna, namely: the 80th separate amphibious assault Halytsia brigade, the 82nd separate amphibious assault Bukovina brigade, the 95th separate amphibious assault Polish brigade, the 22nd separate mechanized brigade, the 61st separate mechanized Steppe brigade, the 36th separate marine infantry brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinskyi, the 17th separate Kryvyi Rih tank brigade named after Kostyantyn Pestushka, the 47th separate mechanized brigade and the 129th separate brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the SSO, SBU and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Hero of Ukraine Lt. Col. Oleksandr Bohonchyk (SBU) and Captain Pavlo Yazlovetskyi with the -Golden Star- orders. Olexandr Bohonchyk participated in the development of an aircraft-type drone, which has already proven its effectiveness in destroying Russian UAVs and contributed to the development of a new direction of countering drones. On the night of August 6, Oleksandr Bohonchyk's group eliminated all six enemy anti-aircraft missiles in the area of ​​responsibility. Thanks to this, units of the Defense Forces entered the territory of the Russian Federation virtually unnoticed. In total, 169 drones were destroyed in the Kursk area under the leadership of Oleksandr Bohonchyk. In addition, he trained seven groups that are now independently participating in combat operations and eliminating Russian drones. Pavlo Yazlovetskyi is the commander of the airborne assault company of the 82nd ODSHBr. Last year in August, he conducted raids in the Kursk region, during which his unit was caught in three fire ambushes, but was able to occupy the designated border. Pavlo Yazlovetskyi organized the occupation of the circular defense and set up an ambush for the Russian invaders. 102 soldiers under his command traveled dozens of kilometers through enemy-controlled territories for two days and were able to get out of the encirclement. The unit destroyed about three platoons, four units of combat armored vehicles and about ten units of motor vehicles. The President also awarded four defenders with the -Cross of Combat Merit-. It was received by: Major Ivan Bakrev. As the commander of the artillery division of the 82nd ODSHBr during the offensive and search-and-strike operations last year in August on the territory of Kurshchyna, he prevented shelling by Russian aircraft and artillery, saved the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and inflicted losses on the enemy. During this operation, 17 Russian occupiers were destroyed, MT-LB, automobile equipment, a tank and a mortar were damaged. Colonel Viktor Bilozyorov (SBU). As part of combined groups of the Security Service of Ukraine in Kurshchyna, he carried out a series of measures to destroy enemy fortifications and strongholds and destroy the occupiers' columns. As a result of combat operations, in particular, 84 fortifications, 36 firing positions, six ammunition depots, fuel and lubricant depots, 73 units of motor vehicles, six BBMs, five tanks, a radar station and an artillery system were liquidated. Captain Artem Kulachevych. As the commander of a company of unmanned attack aircraft systems of the 82nd ODSHBr, he provides reconnaissance, fire damage and support of units during the offensive. In total, it was possible to destroy five BBM, three armored personnel carriers, 22 units of automobile equipment, five mortars and five guns. Senior sergeant Oleg Sobutsky. He set up an ambush in Kurshchyna and prevented the advancement of reconnaissance and advanced Russian groups.

Under enemy fire, Oleg Sobutskyi organized the evacuation of seven units of his unit's damaged equipment. Sergeant Alexander Tarkovsky. In the Kursk region, he managed the actions of advanced assault groups and fire support groups, conducted aerial reconnaissance with the help of UAV operators. The units destroyed several infantry units, armored vehicles and cars, captured about 10 occupants and received important information about the location of enemy forces and assets. In addition, the head of state awarded the defenders with the orders of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi and -For Courage-. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also handed passports of citizens of Ukraine to foreigners who are fighting for the independence of our state on an equal footing with Ukrainians, to soldiers from Belarus and Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/pivroku-vid-pochatku-kurskoyi-operacziyi-prezydent-vidznachyv-yiyi-uchasnykiv-derzhavnymy-nagorodamy/	2025-02-06T07:05:33-08:00
-Mirages- fly - what will they do: about the Mirage 2000 mission in Ukraine	ArmyInform in October of last year published material on the capabilities of the French multi-purpose jet fighter of the 4th generation. We offer to recall it today. F-16 Fighting Falcon is currently the most famous Western fighter in Ukraine. However, it is not the only one, the transfer of which is discussed during the dialogue with partner countries. The list of aerial fighters also includes the Dassault Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation multi-purpose jet fighter. Developed in the 1970s by Dassault Aviation, it became the main combat aircraft of the French Air Force in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As the French like to remind, it was their Mirage that became the only plane in the world that was confirmed to have shot down the invincible F-16 in air combat. ArmyInform already wrote about this unique historical battle. Back in June 2024, the transfer of Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to Ukraine was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron. Later, this was also announced by the French Minister of Defense Sebastien Lecornu, informing about the time of the handover of the fighters — already in the first quarter of 2025. The head of the French defense ministry did not specify the number and modification of the aircraft, but noted that the transferred fighters will be equipped with new technical means for air-to-ground combat and electronic warfare protection. However, in the short post of the Minister of Defense of France, there is still information that allows us to reasonably assume what tasks the French Mirage 2000 will perform when repelling the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The phrase -combat air-sol- used by the head of the French defense department suggests that the main task of the Mirage 2000 multi-purpose fighters will be striking ground targets. In view of the noted mention of new technical equipment specifically for delivering strikes from the air on the earth's surface, it can also be assumed which modification of the fighter-bomber will be transferred to Ukraine. Previously, the media, based on the statement of French President Emmanuel Macron, talked about the Mirage 2000-5 — a modernized export version of the aircraft. It is also possible that, in addition to it, Ukraine will receive an attack fighter-bomber of the Mirage 2000D modification, for which striking ground targets is the main purpose. Taking into account these assumptions, it is worth taking a closer look at what kind of ammunition and how the -Frenchman- in the Ukrainian sky will be able to beat the Russian invaders on Ukrainian and Russian land. The use of the Mirage 2000 as a close air support aircraft, that is, as an attack aircraft directly above the battlefield, should be immediately rejected due to the high saturation of the theater of operations with enemy air defense (APD), in particular, man-portable anti-aircraft missile systems (MANPADS). For the same reasons, the possibility of using the Mirage 2000 to drop aerial bombs in free fall should be ruled out. After all, in the event of an aircraft appearing directly above the line of battle or, even more so, in the enemy's rear at any depth, it will be a priority target for damage, which will be very difficult to avoid. Therefore, air-to-surface missiles and guided (adjusted) gliding aerial bombs remain suitable for active use. The same goes for the F-16 Fighting Falcon, so all the considerations made for the Fighting Falcons are quite valid for the Mirages as well. However, with an important amendment on what kind of ammunition the Mirage 2000 will be able to use to strike ground targets. For the F-16, as of today, it may be primarily about the AGM-154 JSOW high-precision, medium-range glider guided bombs. In the case of the Mirage 2000, it is not known for sure what -standard- ammunition Ukraine will be able to get for it, or what air-to-ground missiles or aviation bombs the aircraft can be equipped with. Most likely, the plane can be -armed- with SCALP-EG cruise missiles and Hammer cruise bombs, which are already used by the Ukrainian military aviation. However, given the high compatibility of weapons, military equipment and ammunition of NATO member states, there may be other interesting options.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/mirazhi-letyat-shho-budut-robyt-pro-zavdannya-mirage-2000-v-ukrayini/	2025-02-06T06:42:15-08:00

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Sweden thanked for the opportunity to take over the experience of our army in repelling Russian aggression. He also assured that he received good feedback, which will help to improve samples of Swedish weapons and improve military equipment.

We have a tough job ahead of us, but we have to go this way and win. With us is the stability and unity of the people and the support of allies, among whom is our loyal and reliable friend - the Kingdom of Sweden!- Oleksandr Syrsky concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/golovnokomanduvachi-zs-ukrayiny-ta-shvecziyi-obgovoryly-sytuacziyu-na-fronti-ta-pidtrymku-syl-oborony/	2025-02-06T01:46:54-08:00

I understand everything, but they must know - from which part and where did they go? Well, how is it? Did someone direct them?! [&#8230;] It is unclear. What a mess!- - laments the woman.

According to him, now in Chasovoy Yar, the Siverskyi Donets - Donbas channel, around which fierce battles continued some time ago, has lost its significance. The enemy then tried to attack using the concrete pipes of the canal. Now the enemy is concentrating troops in the Northern region. -Now we can say that moving through canal pipes is no longer relevant. The enemy made three passes in the Siverskyi Donetsk channel in order to distract our attention. We must attract an additional resource to control these passages with the help of drones, as well as remote mining,- said Dmytro Zaporozhets. According to him, during the past month, the Russians actively threw armored vehicles into battle. It was on it that the landing party was sent to the southern part of the city, to the area of ​​the -Avangard- stadium. -In January, at least 10 units of armored vehicles were destroyed.

€597 million of investments: how - the Danish model - strengthens Ukraine's defense industry and wha...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. It is noted that the so-called -Danish model- became one of these tools. This mechanism allows the funds of partner states to be channeled into the production of Ukrainian weapons to ensure the priority needs of the Ukrainian army. The Ministry of Defense talked about the specifics of this format of cooperation, its participants and other similar mechanisms of support for the Ukrainian army. In 2024, Ukraine and Denmark introduced a new mechanism for financing arms purchases for the Armed Forces through reimbursement of contracts with Ukrainian manufacturers. According to this scheme, the Ukrainian side forms a detailed list of projects that need financing, and Danish experts conduct a detailed assessment of the capabilities of the recommended companies and analyze their previous experience in executing contracts. Back in 2023, the Ukrainian defense industry significantly increased its production capacity. However, the country faced two significant challenges: limited government spending on arms procurement and a gradual decline in international military aid. By that time, the partner countries had already transferred a significant part of the existing reserves, but their production capacities did not have time to adapt to the new needs. In this context, the -Danish model- offered an effective solution: channeling financial resources of the allies directly into the Ukrainian defense industry, which quickly proved its effectiveness. As stated in the MoU, the uniqueness of this approach lies in the fact that it not only ensures the prompt supply of the necessary weapons to the Ukrainian military, but also creates a powerful incentive for the development of the domestic defense-industrial complex. This, in turn, significantly strengthens the economic stability of Ukraine in the conditions of martial law and forms a solid base for the further development of the defense industry. The name of this mechanism is directly related to Denmark's decisive role in its development and implementation. It was this country that became a pioneer in introducing a system of direct financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises, establishing a fundamentally new format of cooperation between partners and Ukraine in the field of defense. The decision to launch such a mechanism was made after the Danish stockpile of weapons available for transfer to the Ukrainian military was exhausted. At the first stage, Denmark allocated a tranche in the amount of 50 million euros, which was aimed at the production of 18 self-propelled -Bohdan- artillery installations. The result was not long in coming: two months after the conclusion of the implementation agreement, the equipment arrived at the combat units of the Defense Forces. Subsequently, the funding was expanded to establish the production of other strategically important types of weapons: long-range drones, anti-tank and anti-ship missile systems. In general, thanks to the coordinated work of all participants of the initiative, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already received weapons for a total amount of almost 597 million euros. Of these, 175 million euros came directly from Denmark. The MOU said that the successful implementation of the -Danish model- contributed to the expansion of financing of the Ukrainian defense industry by other countries. In 2024, Sweden and Iceland joined the mechanism. The parties provided financial support to the initiative in the amount of 20 million euros and 2.7 million euros, respectively — directly through Denmark. An additional result was the decision to finance the production of Ukrainian weapons at the expense of interest from frozen Russian assets. In 2024, 390 million euros were allocated to these needs. This was made possible thanks to the active diplomatic support and assistance of the Danish government, which once again underlines the strategic importance of this partnership. For 2025, the EU allocated 1 billion euros from the revenues from frozen Russian assets, and Canada - about 67 million euros. Denmark has also reserved 130 million euros for further investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. In addition, Norway is expected to provide about 43 million euros for the implementation of projects within the initiative, and Sweden announced the allocation of $178 million. Within the framework of the -Danish model-, it is planned to focus on expanding the range of manufactured weapons. Special attention will be paid to the production of high-tech long-range UAVs, modern missile systems and artillery installations. The MOU noted that the -Danish model- will benefit not only individual manufacturers, but the market as a whole. After all, the financing of one enterprise allows the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to direct the released funds to the purchase of other weapons. At the same time, the Ministry of Defense is working on scaling the -Danish model- for the production of rear-end products. The implementation of this initiative can significantly accelerate the provision of the necessary assets to the Defense Forces. Along with the -Danish model-, other mechanisms of support for the Armed Forces are also actively functioning. Traditionally, partner countries provide weapons directly from their arsenals, and also participate in joint military equipment maintenance programs and conduct comprehensive training for Ukrainian servicemen. As noted in the MOU, an equally important form of cooperation is the creation of joint defense enterprises on the territory of Ukraine, the number of which is about 40. Among the partners are world leaders such as the German Rheinmetall AG, the Franco-German KNDS and the American Boeing. Such enterprises not only provide production and maintenance of advanced equipment and ammunition directly in Ukraine, but also contribute to the attraction of significant investments in the state's economy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/e597-mln-investyczij-yak-danska-model-zmicznyuye-opk-ukrayiny-j-chogo-ochikuvaty/	2025-02-06T00:31:41-08:00

Half a year of the Kursk operation: the enemy lost almost 40,000 soldiers and hundreds of pieces of ...	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. The task of the Kursk offensive operation was to prevent a new offensive of the enemy in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions. And during these six months, the operation successfully fulfills this function. Thanks to it, the Russian occupiers were forced to transfer significant resources to the Kursk region, which weakened their position in other areas of the front. Russia even asked for help from North Korea, which sent 12,000 of its servicemen to Kurshchyna. However, the losses of the North Korean contingent amounted to about 4,000 people, which led to the destruction of one of the three conditional brigades and the incapacitation of the other two. Currently, units from the DPRK have been withdrawn from the front line. In general, during 6 months of active hostilities in the Kursk region, the Russian occupiers lost approximately 39,900 lives, of which about 16,100 were killed. In addition, the enemy lost a significant amount of equipment, in particular: During the operation, Ukrainian forces captured 909 Russian soldiers, which significantly replenished the exchange fund and allowed hundreds of Ukrainian defenders to return home. The Kursk offensive operation is an example of sudden, asymmetric and successful actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, which make it possible to inflict significant losses on the overwhelming enemy and seize the initiative on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/piv-roku-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vorog-vtratyv-majzhe-40-tysyach-vijskovyh-ta-sotni-odynycz-tehniky/	2025-02-05T22:35:00-08:00

-Barabashovo- under attack again: the Russian occupiers do not stop trying to destroy the largest ma...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to preliminary data, the attack took place around 11:30 p.m. on February 5. As a result of the hit, trade pavilions caught fire. This is not the first time that the Russian invaders have tried to destroy Barabashovo. In March 2022, the market was already subjected to severe shelling from -Hrads-, which led to a large-scale fire and turned it into a charred place. Then, while the fire was being extinguished, Russian troops fired at the market again, injuring the rescuers. This time, in 2025, Russian terrorists used Geran-2 drones to attack. As a result of the explosion, dozens of trade pavilions were damaged. Fortunately, there were no victims, but the security guards who were at the scene — were injured. The consequences of the attack are still being determined. However, it is already clear that the Russian occupiers continue to purposefully destroy Kharkiv's civilian infrastructure, causing significant damage to local entrepreneurs and city residents. We remind you that the Barabashovo market is not only the largest market in Eastern Europe, but also an important economic center of Kharkiv. Thousands of entrepreneurs work here, providing work for many Kharkiv residents.

The Armed Forces are switching to a corps system: the expert named the pros and cons of such a step	How will such a step be useful for our Armed Forces, ArmyInform asked a lawyer, a serviceman of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko. The interlocutor reminded that the Ukrainian army is going through the path of reforms not only taking into account NATO standards, but also based on how the combat situation is formed, what experience is gained and, accordingly, what conclusions are drawn. -Based on this, assessing the state of the troop management system during a large-scale invasion, an in-depth analysis of the system that exists and how it can be improved to make it even more efficient, better and more effective. Accordingly, a decision was made and a system was developed by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, which provides for the transition to corps in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It was proposed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief to the President of Ukraine with explanations and justifications,- says Oleksandr Musienko. Yes, the transition to a corpus system is dictated, in fact, by the experience of the Defense Forces. -First, it is necessary to improve the efficiency, manageability and organization of processes. Accordingly, in order to take into account the experience that was in both OTU and OSUV, it is the army corps that can improve their work, where there will be an appropriate number of brigades that will be combined into corps; there will be a command, a clear hierarchy, there will be a corps area of ​​responsibility, and the corps will serve and repel Russian aggression,- the expert says. And he continues: -Secondly, it can solve the issue of so-called seconded units: when in fact we have units from different brigades and they can work in different directions of the front. Accordingly, this will improve the situation. In addition, the corps system will allow commanders on the ground to understand and calculate the number of forces and assets and a clear area of ​​responsibility that they will cover.- In addition, according to Oleksandr Musienko, it will improve the efficiency of management and organization. -Another point to consider: the size of the Defense Forces increased under a full-scale Russian invasion. Therefore, the corps system was chosen for the Armed Forces as a system that exists in many partner countries of Ukraine in NATO. Such systems exist in the USA, Great Britain, France, Australia, and New Zealand. Even China has such a system. She justified herself, proved herself well. And it must respond to the challenges facing the Armed Forces of Ukraine today,- Oleksandr Musienko summarized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/zsu-perehodyat-na-korpusnu-systemu-ekspert-nazvav-plyusy-i-perevagy-takogo-kroku/	2025-02-05T21:03:58-08:00
Creeping -Cockroach- with striking -Saber-: what ground robotic complexes are capable of at the fron...	Andriy with the call sign -Dais- told ArmiyaInform about how ground drones work instead of people and help people at the front. Cockroach ground drones are Andrii's favorites. Like the insects that give them their name, these drones are hardy, durable, highly maneuverable, and can become virtually omnipresent when needed. And they are also versatile and perform a wide variety of functions. - These are our most favorite universal ground robotic complexes. Passability, price, a very simple design that can be modified, a very versatile base, emphasizes the military. The easiest way to use -Targan- is to deliver cargo to the front line. Where it is dangerous to use other equipment or, even more so, to go to the fighters, the -Targan- can become irreplaceable. — They can carry up to 200 kilograms. We use precisely such -Cockroaches- to perform logistical tasks. And there is also -Targan 3K- - it is much larger and can cover a greater distance, work in worse conditions. For example, it can even evacuate some ground units or aerial drones that have fallen, Dice says. In general, Andrii emphasizes, the use of a ground drone is limited only by the imagination of developers and operators. For example, in the near future, it is planned to use -Cockroaches- as a platform for the delivery of FPV drones, which will be able to launch as close as possible to enemy positions without any risk to the pilot. On the -Targan- you can also install a remote-controlled Saber combat module, with the help of which fire suppression of the enemy is carried out. — Here you can see drones with different modifications, including turrets installed on them, called Saber. They can be used in different ways right on the battle line, says Dice. To control such a complex, which is called -Thermite-, two operators are needed. One of them controls the movement of the drone, the other fires. — One controls the Saber itself from the steam deck of the controller, i.e. fire and guidance, and the other operator controls the drone itself, Andrii explains. These systems have already managed to be tested in combat conditions, but it is not yet possible to tell about all the details of their application. In addition, a confident military man, the most daring operations of the -Cockroaches- with the -Sabres- are still ahead. Another possible way of using the ground robotic complex is to blow up enemy fortifications with the help of an explosive charge mounted on a drone. — We also used drones as kamikaze. If we needed to completely demolish some enemy fortifications, then we used one of the drones, which was called -Ratel,- says Andriy. Now drones of this modification are no longer being made. Although they performed quite well, those ground robotic platforms needed improvement. — Each model is created for its own separate task. For example, if it is a kamikaze drone, you need to reduce the weight of the drone itself and increase the mass of explosives it can carry. That is why we, as military personnel who already have experience in this field, need to constantly complete, rework, and modify ground robotic complexes, - explains Andriy. On the basis of the -Targan- base, it is also possible to create a robotic complex designed to evacuate wounded fighters. Such drones can also take out their damaged mechanical -brothers- - both ground and air - from the -gray zone-. - We try to save our drones from damage. For this, we use a modified platform that has the ability to pull the drone to itself or somehow grab it, says Dice. In this way, -Targan- was able to save the heavy Vampire hexacopter, which the Russian occupiers call -Baba Yaga- out of fear. The video with the rescue of a heavy night air bomber has gone viral on the Internet. Such an evacuation, the military emphasizes, is a real special operation that requires accurate calculations and the work of experienced engineers and drone operators. After all, only qualified specialists are able to take into account all the nuances and make accurate calculations, and then do what no one anywhere has ever done before them. A special mining system is installed on one of the -Targans-, which allows the transportation and installation of anti-tank mines. - Mines are installed from it, after which the drone leaves the place of the task - -Dice- explains the principle of operation of the -Targan- miner. In this way, the drone sapper allows not to expose military personnel to danger, taking upon itself not only the delivery, but also the installation of mines. - The developers of -Targan- assure that it can drive 20 kilometers, but we drove much more. It all depends on the modification of the drone, the weight it carries and the quality of the batteries. We can install better batteries on it, and it will -live- longer, go further and perform more combat missions, -Dice- explains. For the further development of ground-based robotic complexes, there is currently a shortage of qualified specialists. -If you really have skills, just come to us, we will find you a place where you can realize all your technical fantasies and do things that are very unpleasant for Russians,- jokes -Andriy-. He assures that, with the desire and ability to learn, anyone who makes the necessary efforts can master the profession of a ground drone operator. He himself transferred to the engineering and sapper division, which had ground robotic complexes, from the infantry. Having learned how to fly the -Cockroaches- and gained experience using ground-based drones on the front line, he now imparts his knowledge, skills and expertise to other fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/povzuchyj-targan-z-razyuchoyu-shableyu-na-shho-zdatni-nazemni-robotyzovani-kompleksy-na-fronti/	2025-02-05T20:41:24-08:00
700,000 hours of testing: the US Army received the latest unmanned aerial reconnaissance system	As noted in a release posted on the official portal of the US Army, the MK 4.8 HQ airborne sounding system from its developer, Textron Systems, is an important milestone in the rapid prototyping program, ArmyInform reports. -This achievement was the result of a complex two-year development and testing process, which included extensive technical research, acceptance tests on the ground and in flight, as well as the joint efforts of the supplier and the United States government,- the US Army emphasizes. In turn, Textron Systems, known worldwide for its powerful brands such as Bell, Cessna, Beechcraft, Pipistrel and a number of others, revealed that the MK 4.8 Hybrid Quad (HQ) drone is now part of the US Army's Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (FTUAS) program. -The Aerosonde® family of unmanned aerial vehicles from Textron Systems has been developed for complex missions both on land and at sea, and has been proven by more than 700,000 hours of test flights in the harshest environmental conditions, including desert heat and arctic cold,- the UAV manufacturers emphasized. The two-beam Aerosonde Mk 4.8 UAV is designed according to a hybrid scheme with a straight wing, four lifting screws with an electric drive and one screw with a drive from an internal combustion engine of the company -Lycoming-. Maximum take-off weight 93 kg, payload weight 14 kg, flight duration up to 14 hours. This drone is equipped with Hybrid Quadrotor technology that provides vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), making it independent of traditional runways. Designed specifically to operate in challenging environments and austere areas, Aerosonde HQ offers increased flexibility for military missions with its ability to rapidly deploy and be operated by just two operators, making it easy to transport by UH-60 helicopters or tactical vehicles. The system has a flight endurance of 14 hours and can reach altitudes of more than 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) above sea level. The use of a heavy fuel engine (JP-8) which is widely used in the army for both land and air vehicles in all NATO countries. This simplifies logistics on the ground and reduces the need for additional support equipment. Aerosonde Mk. 4.8 HQ is also designed on the basis of a modular open system approach (MOSA), which allows easy integration of new technologies and innovations, while optimizing needs and avoiding unnecessary costs. This combination of features makes Aerosonde HQ a reliable and adaptable solution for the reconnaissance and surveillance missions required by modern military operations. Specialists of the development company claim that the drone can be deployed and launched in less than 30 minutes of preparatory work. It is capable of carrying electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) cameras, radar systems and signals intelligence (SIGINT) assets, providing operators with real-time intelligence both day and night. The FTUAS project team will now continue to train Army personnel on the new equipment so they can qualify as instructors and operators at Redstone Test Center on the MK 4.8 HQ Aerosonde system. This training is expected to be completed by early February 2025. The U.S. Army said the FTUAS program will provide brigade combat teams with organic capabilities for intelligence and surveillance operations that will allow them to gather, develop and communicate operational intelligence. This will allow BCT commanders to maintain dominance during multi-domain operations. In the draft budget for 2025 The Pentagon has requested funding in the form of $129 million for the construction of seven FTUAS devices. The start of re-equipment of combat units of the US Army with FTUAS devices is expected in 2026. It is difficult to call FTUAS massive, since one ground forces brigade will have only 20 such devices.

the Russian Federation is dispelling the fake that the Armed Forces of Ukraine en masse catch and ea...	Propaganda resources launched this -information release- in the spirit of Russian fiction: they say that there is a lack of food at the front, so the Armed Forces decided to switch to a four-legged diet. It is clear that for people who believe in a -crucified boy-, -NATO combat mosquitoes- and -biolaboratories in Ukrainian pigeon houses-, such a story sounds quite plausible. However, there is a small problem: there is no shortage of food in Ukraine, the military is provided with rations, and volunteers regularly deliver everything from stew to fresh baked goods to the front. Ukrainian military personnel often rescue animals themselves during the war. The front line is not the best place for defenseless dogs and cats, so they are taken to the rear, given to volunteers or simply taken into care. Each unit has its own -mascot- - a cat, a dog, and sometimes even a crow or a raccoon. Unlike the Russian army, which even steals toilets in the occupied territories, the Ukrainian military is not looking for -alternative sources of protein.- This is a classic scheme of Russian propaganda: to dehumanize the Ukrainian military, to show them as subhuman in order to justify aggression. If Ukrainians -eat dogs- in their imagination, then perhaps they deserve to be -denazified-? This is how the Russian machine of lies works. The next time you hear about -bloody Ukro carnivores-, remember that this is the same propaganda that once talked about the -crucified boy- and -baby organs in jars-. Russian media turned into a cheap circus a long time ago. So don't be surprised if their next -sensational report- is about the fact that Ukrainians feed exclusively on unicorns and ghosts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/rf-rozganyaye-fejk-shho-zsu-masovo-vidlovlyuyut-i-yidyat-bezprytulnyh-sobak/	2025-02-05T20:03:54-08:00

Military psychologist Serhii Rostikov: -Next to some stories, cinema seems uninteresting-	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In civilian life, he ran a small business and was a public activist. He has economic and technical education, and now he is studying psychology. Completed training courses in Great Britain. He has experience of fixed-term and contract service, in particular in the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent in Iraq. In the first days of the full-scale invasion, Rostikov, then still a sergeant, returned to the army. -I was a deputy platoon commander, I commanded people, I saw how differently they react to circumstances, and how some need support. At the end of 2022, I was offered to take an officer's course in military psychology, and I immediately agreed. Even in civilian life, I was always interested in psychology, and already during the war I saw from my own experience how its understanding is important for the effective management of a unit,- says Serhiy. The officer considers communication with people to be the most interesting aspect of his work. He says that there are such human stories next to which cinema seems uninteresting. -The strength of spirit of some people is impressive, despite the enormous fatigue and sometimes inhuman workload on the battlefield, they still maintain peace of mind and a sense of humor,- Serhii says. Arriving at positions, a training ground or a medical facility, a psychologist helps soldiers find peace of mind, accept the circumstances of war, and teaches soldiers how to provide psychological first aid to each other. In the Main Department of Psychological Support of the Armed Forces personnel, they carefully study the work of psychologists in the field, generalize best practices and disseminate them among colleagues. But they also see problems and look for ways to solve them. Today, there is a need for qualified military psychologists in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Civilian psychologists who are called up for military service do not always have experience with combat psychotrauma, which causes them confusion and uncertainty when providing psychological help to military personnel. At the same time, civilian experience and a fresh perspective sometimes become a significant factor in the development of effective changes in the training and work of military psychologists. The main administration introduced advanced training courses on the funds of the Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, where psychological officers of personnel psychological support structures acquire the necessary knowledge, exchange experience and develop creative ideas in the field of military psychology. In the conditions of the shortage of psychologists in the units, the workload of the psychologist himself and an adequate understanding of his work in the war acquire special meaning. In a subdivision, you can't say, -I'll listen to six, and the others next time.- Sometimes you have to work as much as the circumstances require. Of course, such a load is difficult to compare with constant stay in positions during shelling, however, the work of psychologists in war is quite difficult and exhausting. Stress, like general fatigue, has the ability to accumulate, and many people simply do not know what to do with it all. Stereotypes also add pressure: they say that men should not complain, men should not ask for help, crying is a sign of weakness, and much more. The task of a military psychologist is not only to stabilize the psycho-emotional state of a serviceman, but also to help him find internal and external resources necessary for quality recovery, to find his own purpose of being in the war, to understand the basics of communication with relatives, with the family, etc. Each new day brings new challenges for the military psychologist, and he must be ready for them. For some people, a psychologist is a hidden hope that they will be heard, that they are not alone with their problems, that there is always a way out, even in the most difficult life situations. This is how Serhiy Rostikov sees his work. And people trust him. As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers. He went through a difficult battle path, destroying many enemies, and became a true professional in his field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vijskovyj-psyholog-sergij-rostikov-poruch-z-deyakymy-istoriyamy-kino-zdayetsya-neczikavym/	2025-02-05T11:58:36-08:00

Instead of a ball - a machine gun: how -Footballist- changed the football field to the battlefield	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. On February 9, 2023, Andrii voluntarily joined -Staleva Sotka-. At that time, he already had the experience of military service, so he quickly mastered military affairs. -I had the title of senior soldier since I was drafted. He became a junior sergeant quite quickly, but by no means under pleasant circumstances. When the commander of our department died, I had to take his place and, accordingly, receive the rank of junior sergeant. And in a year, another rank of sergeant,- says Andriy. Despite the offer to become an officer, -Footballist- decided to stay in the post of sergeant. He believes that this gives him more opportunities to communicate with the personnel, transfer his knowledge and combat experience to his comrades. -You need to constantly communicate with the boys, take an interest in their problems and look for ways to solve these problems together,- Andrii shares his method of work. -After all, you can go to the range together in your free time from combat missions and just shoot at targets to your heart's content - in many cases, by the way, this helps to relieve internal tension.- The -Footballist- considers trust in fellow players to be the main factor of success in battle. -If you are sure that there is a person standing next to you shoulder to shoulder who will always help, always cover, and if necessary, even take you off the battlefield, your confidence increases many times,- he says. His wife and five-year-old son are waiting for Andrii at home. -With my wife and son, we really like to go on vacation, especially to the Carpathians. But to such places, where there are not many people, - says -Footballist-. — Currently, my family is more than a thousand kilometers away from me. Of course, we miss each other terribly and dream of the time when we will be together again and have the opportunity to go to our beloved Carpathians at any moment!- As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers.

10 years behind bars: the court sentenced a collaborator from Kozachai Lopan	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. The court found him guilty of collaborative activity (Part 5 of Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) for maintaining a public accusation by the prosecutors of the Dergachy District Prosecutor's Office of the Kharkiv Region.

Saboteur for 9 thousand hryvnias: a man will be tried in Kharkiv for arson on the railway	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, the man, on the instructions of the Russian special services, set fire to the relay cabinets of the signaling, centralization and blocking systems of Ukrzaliznytsia in Kharkiv. These cabinets ensure the safety of railway traffic and the operation of automation. The attacker, using a crowbar, broke the metal doors of the relay cabinets, doused the electrical equipment with fire-starting liquid and set it on fire. He recorded his actions on photos and videos, which he then sent to a representative of the Russian special service via messenger. It was established that the man had recently arrived in Kharkiv and was living with his fiancée. Before that, he lived in Odessa, and even earlier - in Lviv. It is known that he is already being prosecuted in Odesa for selling narcotics and was serving a sentence for attempted murder and robbery.

Recruited and killed — the Russian special services began airdropping their terrorists	reported this on February 5 First Deputy Head of the SBU Serhii Andrushchenko during a joint briefing with the Chief of the National Police Ivan Vyhivskyi. In this way, the Russians actually liquidate the perpetrator of -darkness- in order to remove the witness of the crime and not pay him the promised money. -Russian special services simply use these people for their purposes as consumables. The FSB officer doesn't care what happens to them after the task is completed,- Serhiy Andrushchenko remarked. He said that the executors of the special services of the Russian Federation are recruited through instant messengers and online communities for making quick money. Young people or the unemployed often agree to cooperate, to whom curators will later inform the location for committing a terrorist attack and the storage location of an improvised explosive device prepared by another group of agents. -We establish the entire chain: from recruitment to preparation of the crime. As a rule, we work on prejudice — we detain criminals when they take explosives out of a cache,- Serhiy Andrushchenko said. He emphasized that blowing up buildings of the TCC and other objects are serious crimes, which the Criminal Code of Ukraine classifies as a terrorist act. They are subject to strict criminal liability — 15 years in prison or life imprisonment. In order to counter the recruitment of citizens, in mid-December the SBU launched the official chatbot -Spaly- FSBeshnyk- in Telegram. It is possible to report suspicious contacts from the special services of the Russian Federation to it, as well as to the -hotline- of the Security Service. And as of today, the chatbot has already received almost 2.3 thousand. notification of recruitment attempts.

Vacation, benefits, legal aid: what the state guarantees to those who have been released from captiv...	ArmyInform tells what rights and opportunities those who have gone through captivity have. Servicemen released from captivity may resign from service. This is provided by Art. 26 of the Law of Ukraine -On Military Duty and Military Service-, amendments to which entered into force on May 18 of this year. At the same time, it does not matter when exactly the serviceman was released from captivity. If a serviceman decides to use the right to discharge, he can also count on upon dismissal. It is 50 percent of the monthly allowance for each full calendar year of service. If a serviceman who has returned from captivity wishes to continue his service, he has the right to 90 days holidays. Such leave is not divided into parts, and during it the allowance continues to be accrued. Such leave can be revoked only with the consent of the serviceman. Those released from captivity are entitled to one-time assistance of 100,000 hryvnias. This applies to both civilians and military personnel. It also provides for the payment of anannualfinancial aid for those who were in captivity. This is 100,000 hryvnias for each year of detention. How to get? In order to calculate such payments, it is necessary to establish the fact of deprivation of liberty as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine. The establishment of this fact is handled by a special commission under the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. One of the mandatory documents that must be provided to the commission is a certificate of being in captivity. It can be obtained from the National Information Bureau. The request should be sent to the e-mail of the bureau: info@nib.gov.ua Citizens released from captivity have the right to legal assistance. And given all the bureaucratic factors that exist in our country, such help will definitely not be superfluous.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vidpustka-vyplaty-pravova-dopomoga-shho-derzhava-garantuye-tym-hto-zvilnyvsya-z-polonu/	2025-02-05T06:48:22-08:00
Putin is gathering an army of children: the youth army was subordinated to the Ministry of Attack of...	The Minister of Culture and Strategic Communications of Ukraine Mykola Tochytskyi said about this. -Children will be trained to organize aid to the Russian army, and in the future, to participate in hostilities against Ukraine. On February 3, the Russian president signed a decree strengthening the activities of the Soviet totalitarian remnant called Dosaaf, fully subordinating the organization to his -Ministry of Attack of the Russian Federation-. This is not an ordinary document, but part of the global Russian plan to carry out assimilative genocide of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation,- the Minister states. Our colleagues from the Center for Journalistic Investigation have drawn attention to the report of the occupying -Ministry of Youth Policy- on the TOT of the Zaporizhia region, in which they boast that they have attracted about 1,000 children to the so-called -youth army-. -The founder of the -junarmy- is the already mentioned -dosaaf-, which was administratively strengthened by Putin's decree. Thus, the program of indoctrinating children into the beliefs of the -Pobedobesiya- sect is a consistently planned Russian policy,- Mykola Tochytskyi emphasizes. ArmyInform reported that due to the Russian propaganda processing in the occupied territories, at least 1.5 million Ukrainian children. -By indoctrinating Ukrainian children in the occupied territories, instilling in them hatred of Ukraine and its people, Putin and his clique are carrying out an assimilative genocide of the Ukrainian nation. We demand that the Russian authorities immediately stop this criminal practice and appeal to the Ukrainian media, public organizations and our foreign partners to pay attention to Russia's war crimes and to take measures to document these activities so that the perpetrators will sooner or later suffer the deserved punishment,- wrote the Minister of Culture and Strategic Communications of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/putin-zbyraye-armiyu-ditej-yunarmiyu-pidporyadkuvaly-ministerstvu-napadu-rf/	2025-02-05T06:33:38-08:00

We are dealing with a Russian agency and a targeted destabilizing campaign: an expert on explosions ...	This was told to ArmiyaInform by an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, a candidate of political sciences and a military serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yury Oliynyk. -We are dealing with a clear action of Russian agents and a targeted campaign aimed at discrediting the mobilization in Ukraine and inciting a civil conflict between civilians and the military,- says Yurii Oliynyk. According to him, the explosions are part of a long-term plan that has been in place for several years. -At first, there was informational incitement - the spread of manipulations, fakes about the brutality of TCC employees, their demonization, then - the inciting of enmity between the -evaders- and the military. And now the moment was prepared to demonstrate the supposed civil confrontation. All these explosions in Rivne, Pavlohrad, and Kamianets-Podilskyi had been prepared for a long time. Agents were waiting for the right time to implement them, so that they entered a single information wave. The trigger for this was the events in Poltava - the tragedy when a serviceman died,- the expert noted. Yurii Oliynyk believes that these explosions have one signature and are aimed at inciting hysteria, further demonstrating that the population of Ukraine is allegedly opposing the army, and creating informational chaos. As ArmyInform reported, Russian special services use Ukrainian teenagers and ill-informed youth who crave easy money to carry out sabotage, ultimately eliminating them as extra witnesses. -Recruited saboteurs are simply used and thrown away by the Russians. The Security Service of the Russian Federation and the FSB of the Russian Federation promise money to saboteurs against the military in Ukraine, but they fool the perpetrators of the crimes, do not pay them, and also do not inform the perpetrators that they often plan to activate the explosives they carry, even while the terrorists are performing the task Russian curators,- explains the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/mayemo-spravu-z-rosagenturoyu-ta-czilespryamovanoyu-destabilizuyuchoyu-kampaniyeyu-ekspert-pro-vybuhy-v-tczk/	2025-02-05T06:23:51-08:00

Charter drones: how the eyes of the Ukrainian army work	The video of the combat operation of the calculation of Ukrainian drones was made public on the channel of the 13th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter-. The drones of the -Charter- brigade perform a mission that the military themselves call -the eyes of the unit.- They transmit real-time images from places where an ordinary soldier cannot reach. This allows receiving critical information about the movement of enemy equipment and manpower. -We convey the picture, show what is not visible from the ground,- the fighters say. They fly around the clock - 24/7, regardless of weather conditions, although even fog can be a serious obstacle to sightings. Operators not only find targets, but also coordinate their destruction. If the drone detects the movement of enemy infantry or equipment, the decision to strike is made literally in a few minutes. If stationary shelters are found, such as dugouts or basements, they can be destroyed by artillery. Russian troops are actively trying to fight Ukrainian UAVs. They use anti-drone guns and electronic warfare devices, try to shoot down or intercept FPV drones. However, Ukrainian operators are also improving their tactics and skills, reducing the risk of equipment losses. -This is a kind of drone-on-drone, bash-on-bash battle,- says the military, explaining that their advantage lies in the speed of response and the accuracy of strikes. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 13th operational brigade of NSU -Charter- destroyed 15 Russian invaders as well as an ammunition depot, a cannon, and an enemy shelter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/dronari-hartiyi-yak-praczyuyut-ochi-ukrayinskoyi-armiyi/	2025-02-05T04:51:56-08:00

This is against the background of undermining of TCC in Rivne, Pavlograd and Kamianets-Podilskyi told the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, lieutenant Andrii Kovalenko. According to him, Russian curators promise recruited performers -easy money-, assuring them that they will only be couriers, and then -they just use and throw away-. -GRU of the Russian Federation and the FSB of the Russian Federation promise money to saboteurs against the military in Ukraine, but they fool the perpetrators of crimes, do not pay them, and also do not inform the perpetrators that they often plan to activate the explosives they carry, even while the terrorists are performing the tasks of Russian curators,- he explained Andriy Kovalenko. As ArmiyaInform reported, on Wednesday, February 5, an explosion rang out in the premises of the TCC in Kamyanc-Podilskyi, as a result in which one person died and several others were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vybuhy-u-tczk-speczsluzhby-rf-duryat-vykonavcziv-i-sami-zh-yih-pidryvayut-czpd-rnbo/	2025-02-05T04:36:50-08:00
-Family circumstances- - candid stories of border guards who voluntarily returned from the North-Wes...	Their candid stories were published on Wednesday, February 5, by the State Border Guard Service. So, a fighter of the -Revenge- brigade Maksym under the pseudonym -Suyeta- voluntarily returned to the service after 9 months of military service. -Last year in March, he took part in battles in the Swativ direction, was an anti-drone gun operator. Within a month, his mother fell ill, constant relocations and seven years of service also affected him - Maksym voluntarily left the military unit. However, after solving family problems, he returned — he took advantage of the law, which gives the opportunity to resume his service,- said the DPSU. According to Maksym, in his case, the cause of SZH was a moral and psychological condition. Alexander has a similar story, who volunteered for service with two minor children and a disabled wife, and then left the military unit to help his family. -I asked myself. I went to the Military Commissariat and asked to volunteer. It was in 2023&#8230; I have family circumstances. A disabled woman of the second group, two minor children&#8230; The garden is very big there, someone had to cultivate it,- the man explains. For his part, the head of the legal support department of the -Revenge- brigade, Justice Major Andriy Bakrev, reminds that, according to the law of Ukraine, for military personnel who went to the SZH, there is an opportunity to resume service until March 1, 2025 and avoid criminal liability. -This opportunity is available to those servicemen who voluntarily left the military unit before November 29, 2024. Those who do not take advantage of the law face imprisonment for 5 to 10 years. Returning to the military unit voluntarily is the best way out of the situation. You will be able to return to the service and avoid criminal liability,- the DPSU notes. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said, how to quickly return to service after voluntarily leaving the unit without criminal responsibility.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/simejni-obstavyny-vidverti-istoriyi-prykordonnykiv-yaki-dobrovilno-povernulysya-z-szch/	2025-02-05T04:22:18-08:00
Street fights and -bandzai-attacks-: how the battle for Chasiv Yar and Toretsk continues	Dmytro Zaporozhets, the spokesman of OTU -Luhansk-, told about this on the air -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, most of the fighting in Toretsk currently has the character of street fights. -The fighting is taking place mainly in the central part of the city, as well as in the mining areas,- the spokesman said. He emphasized that the Ukrainian defenders were able to hold their positions thanks to the prepared fortifications, but the number of enemy attacks increased significantly. -Relative to December 2024, the number of assaults in the Toretsk direction increased by 30%, and in the Chasovoy Yar direction - by 97%,- Dmytro Zaporozhets reported. At a time when Ukrainian society expected changes in the international arena, Russian troops, on the contrary, increased the pressure. The situation is similar in the city of Chasiv Yar. The enemy became more active in the north of the city, trying to break into the central part, in particular in the area of ​​the -Avangard- stadium. -The adversary is actively deploying smoke screens and using drones to guide units into relatively unscathed buildings to continue the assault,- the spokesman explained. According to him, it is becoming more and more difficult for the defenders of Ukraine to find suitable positions for effective defense. -Unfortunately, both in Toretsk and in Chasovoy Yar, there are few options for building a stable line of defense. At the same time, the enemy is constantly moving from shelter to shelter, which makes it difficult to destroy him,- the spokesman added. Zaporozhets also drew attention to the change in tactics of the occupiers. If earlier they tried to break through the flanks, now they are forced to carry out frontal attacks. -Both in Toretsk and Chasovoy Yar, the fighting is mainly in the central part of the cities,- he said. In the Seversky direction, the enemy somewhat reduced the activity of assault operations, probably due to the need to regroup. -The enemy is most likely preparing for a new wave of attacks. According to intelligence data, the movement of the command staff of the 3rd Army was recorded in this direction,- Dmytro Zaporozhets reported. Despite the difficult weather conditions, the enemy continues to use maneuvering equipment. -Mud does not stop the enemy. They rarely use armored vehicles, instead they actively use ATVs and motorcycles,- the spokesman said. He also said that the Russian military is carrying out desperate -banzai attacks- using civilian vehicles converted to transport infantry. -We watched how the enemy used cars to break into our positions at high speed. However, thanks to the effective actions of the defenders, one of these vehicles blew up on a mine, and the enemy infantry was forced to hurry, after which part of this infantry was destroyed by FPV drones, and one occupant decided to commit suicide, probably because of the fear of being hit by a UAV,- the spokesman said. As reported by ArmyInform, fierce fighting continues on the front line Chasovo Yar. The Russian occupiers changed the assault tactics in Chasovoy Yar, trying to deliver their stormtroopers to Ukrainian positions as quickly as possible. Now, instead of foot attacks, they mass attack infantry on armored vehicles to reduce movement time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vulychni-boyi-ta-bandzaj-ataky-yak-tryvaye-bytva-za-chasiv-yar-i-toreczk/	2025-02-05T04:11:25-08:00

Terrorist attack in the TCC building in Rivne: the Russian Federation eliminated the perpetrator as ...	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine on Wednesday, February 5. According to the case file, the Russians prepared in advance the elimination of their agent as an -extra- witness. -He was deliberately detonated along with the explosives he used to enter the building.

A Swedish soldier on Ukrainian soil: the story of a fighter of the International Legion	The story of the soldier was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This serviceman is from Sweden. Before the full-scale invasion, he had no military experience, working as a cashier and security guard in a store. However, when the great war began, -Viking- decided that his place was next to the Ukrainian people in the fight against the aggressor. -It was natural for me, since two branches of my family equally dislike Russia because of the war in Spain during the Franco period and because of the war in Finland. I understood the actions of the Russians in Ukraine through my own history,- explains the legionnaire. -Viking- began his combat career as a machine gunner, and later moved to reconnaissance units, where he further honed his skills. He took part in fierce battles in the Kharkiv region and Luhansk region, in particular in the Kupyansk region, in Klishchiivka and Petropavlivka. According to him, he had to meet with various units of the enemy - from the -Wagnerians- to paratroopers and special forces. One of Viking's most vivid memories is the mission during which he was wounded. Then he and two other fighters cleared a difficult landing, being under active fire from FPV drones. The clearing was carried out successfully, but during the advance to the enemy trench they were covered by tank fire. -Viking- received a wound in the left hand, but, fortunately, everything went well. Currently, -Viking- is a specialist in the use of FPV drones. He uses his skills and experience to deliver precise strikes on the enemy and help his comrades on the battlefield. -russia is still here. And as long as she's here, until we win the war or I die, I will fight!- - declares the Swedish warrior. -Viking- is an example of courage, dedication and true patriotism. He is one of those who did not stand aside when war came to Ukrainian land. As ArmiyaInform reported, a machine gunner with the call sign -Yankee- is fighting in the 33rd separate mechanized brigade in the Zaporizhzhia direction. He went through a difficult path from a recruit to an experienced commander who skillfully leads his platoon and destroys the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/shvedskyj-voyin-na-ukrayinskij-zemli-istoriya-bijczya-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-02-05T02:51:54-08:00

The Underrated Helper: Why a Weapon Light is a Vital Item in a Special Ops Gear	This is stated in the publication on page 73 of the special-purpose maritime center named after Kosh chieftain Antin Holovaty. According to the fighter with the call sign -Festival-, their unit uses two types of lights: full-fledged lights and built into sighting units. The latter usually have an infrared (IR) spectrum and are intended for use with night vision devices (NVR). -IR lights are used exclusively with PNB. In conditions of complete darkness, these lights provide active illumination of targets,- notes -Festival-. Important characteristics of the flashlight are its compactness, lightness, compatibility with weapons, resistance to shocks and drops, as well as convenient controls that prevent accidental activation. 73 Center fighters receive weapons with standard Inforce lights that have both visible and IR modes of operation, as well as SureFire sighting units with a laser pointer and a plain white light. -I install the light on the right side because I'm right-handed. A flashlight on the left side would interfere with the grip and worsen weapon control. And when carrying a weapon on a belt, the flashlight does not create discomfort and does not cling to the equipment. I use a remote control button placed on top of the fishing rod, which allows you to conveniently control the light with both the right and left hand,- shares -Festival-. Lanterns are especially useful during urban combat. In Bahmut, they helped assess the state of buildings, look for temporary shelters and positions. -During the evacuation of the groups, the IR flashlight marked positions for the vehicles, which significantly reduced the contact time and made it possible to get to the evacuation point without making a mistake,- says the soldier. Weapon lights are mandatory for special forces, because in a complex with PNB, they give a technological advantage and increase the efficiency of operators. Stormtroopers fighting at close range also need lights to quickly assess the terrain, spot the enemy, and save time. At the same time, for infantry, lanterns are not a primary necessity. Their weapons often do not include a lantern, and fighting takes place in open terrain where a lantern can only unmask a position. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 73rd Naval Special Purpose Center, who perform extremely difficult tasks, need reliable and effective weapons. The senior operator of the center with the call sign -Den- talked about his choice of an assault rifle and shared the secrets of its care.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/nedooczinenyj-pomichnyk-chomu-lihtar-na-zbroyi-zhyttyevo-vazhlyvyj-element-sporyadzhennya-speczpryznachenczya/	2025-02-05T02:28:25-08:00

Defense Assistance and Future Force Strategy: Defense Minister meets NSATU leadership	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 5. NSATU is a structure created within NATO to strengthen NATO's role in coordinating international military assistance and training personnel and units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. During the visit to Ukraine, the NSATU delegation visited a number of military facilities to assess the current needs of the Defense Forces.

The parties also discussed priorities in receiving international military aid and agreed on directions for further joint actions. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov and the Head of the NATO Mission in Ukraine Patrick Turner discussed the key issues of cooperation with the Alliance, which remain strategically important for the defense of our state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/oboronna-dopomoga-ta-strategiya-future-force-ministr-oborony-zustrivsya-z-kerivnycztvom-nsatu/	2025-02-05T01:48:22-08:00
A new enemy tactic in the Temporal Ravine: armored stormtroopers go for the kill	Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the telethon -Yedini Novyny-. According to him, the enemy has somewhat changed its tactics. If earlier the occupiers advanced in small groups, now the Russian command tries to save time and sends assault units directly on armored vehicles. -The enemy wants to save time and throws enemy groups with a large amount of BMD, that is, on armor,- explains Ivan Petrychak. In one of the battles, a Ukrainian tank destroyed a Russian BMD-4 from a distance of only 30 meters. This once again confirms that tanks play a key role in deterring enemy attacks. The enemy also uses mixed tactics: after disembarking from armored vehicles, the Russian infantry disperses, tries to gain a foothold in the basements of buildings and among the ruins, and then regroups for new attacks. In this direction, the presence of the -Akhmat- unit, which is fighting side by side with the 98th airborne division of the Russian Federation, was recorded. However, there are reasons to believe that some of the Kadirov soldiers still perform the functions of blocking units, controlling defectors among the Russian military. -According to our data, they are fighting, but the question is different - how do they motivate the Russian infantry? Captured occupiers say that for refusing to go into battle they can be thrown into a pit, beaten or simply not paid,- Ivan Petrychak notes. Financial payments and the possibility of avoiding criminal punishment remain the main factors that force Russians to fight. Despite heavy losses, the occupiers do not stop their assaults. They operate according to the principle of scorched earth: if they cannot advance with infantry, they destroy everything in front of them with aircraft, artillery and drones. -The enemy destroys possible areas where our soldiers can hold their defense, and then again throws waves of infantry into the attack,- explains the representative of the brigade's press service. The Ukrainian military continues to heroically defend itself, despite the colossal number of attacks. Chasiv Yar is not only a strategic point on the map, but also a symbol of the resilience of our soldiers, who prove every day that the enemy will not be able to win an easy victory. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo are heroically defending Chasiv Yar, repelling constant attacks of Russian invaders, in particular detachments -Ahmat-. Soldiers hold their positions daily and inflict heavy casualties on the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/nova-taktyka-voroga-v-chasovomu-yaru-shturmovyky-na-broni-jdut-na-zabij/	2025-02-05T01:34:18-08:00
The law enforcement officers detained the suspects in carrying out the terrorist act in Pavlograd	The Prosecutor General's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, a resident of Pavlograd, fulfilling the tasks and instructions of a representative of the special services of the Russian Federation, made an improvised explosive device and left it in a designated place. After some time, two Odessans who were also recruited by the special services of the Russian Federation arrived in the city. They took this explosive device and moved it to the building of the Pavlograd RTCC and SP. There, the suspects set off the explosives. During the terrorist attack, they recorded everything on video in order to report to their supervisors. In addition, it was established that the suspects were preparing to commit a terrorist act in another location. The suspects cooperated with the aggressor in order to make quick money. The police detained the suspects. Currently, the question of choosing preventive measures for them is being decided.

Zaporizhia rock and roll: how -Yankee- and his Browning make the occupiers dance	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -Yankee- did not immediately get to the front. At first, he applied to the TCC, passed the VLK, but due to the large number of people willing to fight, he had to wait a little. When it was his turn, he joined the 33rd brigade, the machine gun platoon. Prior to that, -Yankee- served under the draft in the State Special Service of Transport, where he had no weapons, but only a shovel and a crowbar. So I was pleasantly surprised by the number of Western weapons in the brigade. He worked his way up from a service number to a unit commander, and after the battles near Robotyny, he became the chief sergeant of a machine gun platoon, acting as a commander. Now he is training recruits for his platoon. The Yankee's signature weapon is the Browning machine gun. He met him while studying at -Desna-. -I liked that he was really knocking. They shot at 900 m and pierced the BMP beautifully. The thing is good, the thing is accurate. The whole platoon fell in love with her,- says -Yankee-. In the Zaporizhzhia direction, when the enemy infantry entered the forest strip, the -Yankee- simply deployed a Browning, put two boxes there - and the enemy retreated with a screech. Five soldiers of his unit were awarded Golden Crosses. -My platoon commander even worked on a dance floor. It was beautiful, it was effective! And no one even wanted to get out of that dance. One occupier's hand was torn off by a bullet. That's all, there was no further movement!- - recalls -Yankee-. Browning pierces the armor of a -one- or -two- with their -grills- at 900-1000 m with an ordinary armor-piercing incendiary bullet. -Nothing compares to a large-caliber machine gun. And the sound, and the speed, and the shooting itself is just a thrill!- - says -Yankee-. Once -Yankee- evacuated his platoon leader with two broken legs from a difficult place by ATV. -Now we communicate every day. The most pleasant thing is when the people you pulled out of positions, brought out, brought out, say hello, -says -Yankee-. As reported by ArmyInform, Sergeant of the Air Force Yevhen Pogozhih knows what a real risk is. In the Kharkiv direction, under heavy fire from the enemy, he carried out a wounded comrade from being hit by an enemy FPV drone, despite mortar fire and a fatal danger	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/zaporizkyj-rok-n-rol-yak-yanki-ta-jogo-browning-zmushuyut-okupantiv-tanczyuvaty/	2025-02-05T01:02:18-08:00
-Claster4Defence-: Ukraine joins forces to develop military innovations	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. This event was aimed at establishing cooperation between the Ukrainian military and manufacturers of dual-purpose goods. It was attended by representatives of the Ukrainian army, government, business, international organizations from the EU and NATO, as well as directly by manufacturers of dual-purpose goods in the field of robotics, automation, IT and other key areas. The -Cluster4Defence- initiative is a Ukrainian cluster alliance that includes 40 clusters, among which more than 10 are directly related to the production of dual-purpose technologies.

According to him, the Russian troops are striving -from trench to trench- to break through the defense line and gain a foothold in new positions. This is accompanied by almost continuous artillery fire. -Artillery works almost 24 hours a day,- the soldier said. Unlike other areas of the front, where the occupiers try to avoid night attacks, in the Northern Region they fight both during the day and at night. -The enemy is trying to storm around the clock - morning, afternoon, dusk, evening,- Stepan Barna stressed. The Russians focused special attention on the positions of Ukrainian drone operators, trying to suppress their activity with the help of artillery and airdrops. Voiskovy noted that the situation forces our defenders to act flexibly and constantly change positions: -There should be many positions. It is a vital necessity.- Stepan Barna emphasized that the most important task for Ukrainian soldiers now is to -dig, dig, dig-, because well-prepared trenches and dugouts save lives and help withstand the onslaught of the enemy. As for weather conditions, precipitation can make it difficult to use unmanned systems, but currently the situation is favorable: -Now there is minimal precipitation, so the weather helps the operation of our drones.- The military also confirmed that the occupiers have significant reserves and can quickly pull them up: -There were cases when the enemy concentrated a large number of personnel and equipment in a matter of hours, after which the assault immediately began.- Despite the difficult situation, the Ukrainian defenders continue to hold the defense and inflict losses on the enemy.

The coalition of states defined the legal basis for the creation of a special tribunal regarding Rus...	This is reported by the President's Office. They also identified the most important elements of the draft Schuman statute, the main legal document that will regulate the tribunal's activities. The Ukrainian delegation at the meeting was headed by the deputy head of the Office of the President Iryna Mudra. -This applies not only to Ukraine.

One dead to two wounded: Volodymyr Zelenskyi named the losses of the Russian army in Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said this in an interview with journalist Piers Morgan. -These are approximate numbers. The casualty ratio is one dead to two wounded because their field medicine is weaker. They often leave their wounded soldiers on the battlefield,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. The head of state added that despite these losses, Russia is not ready to end this war. -They don't want peace. Next time, they will say that they are ready for direct negotiations with President Trump. They will say that Ukraine is not needed, that it is a global war between Russia and NATO, and that they will negotiate only with the USA. But this is just another reason to continue the war. Putin's only goal is for Ukraine to cease to exist,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmiyaInform, in January 2024 the -I want to find- project, created by the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, recorded a record number of appeals from families of Russian servicemen who went missing in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/odyn-zagyblyj-do-dvoh-poranenyh-volodymyr-zelenskyj-nazvav-vtraty-rosijskoyi-armiyi-v-ukrayini/	2025-02-04T23:34:21-08:00
Novopavlovsk direction: the Russians storm - on buggies - but finish in black bags	Lieutenant Colonel Vitaly Milovidov, head of the information and communication service of the 15th brigade of the Kara-Dag NSU, told about this on the Suspilny broadcast. — In the area of ​​responsibility of the units, the night passed relatively stably, as the enemy makes fewer assault attempts in the dark, he noted. - However, the attacks have continued since the morning, accompanied by intense artillery fire. According to him, the enemy's tactics remain unchanged: he continues to use small assault groups, trying to compensate for losses with a large number of personnel. -On the main lines of attack, the enemy has pulled up additional reserves that ensure the advance of these groups,- the military officer explained. — Despite the loss, the occupiers continue their offensive, because the constant replenishment of manpower allows them to maintain the pace of attacks. The situation in the area of ​​Dachny remains extremely tense. According to the representative of the National Guard, in addition to infantry attacks, the enemy is actively using airstrikes, guided bombs and artillery. -The enemy uses the entire range of reconnaissance drones, trying to inflict maximum losses on our positions and equipment,- Milovidov emphasized. An increase in enemy activity near the Zaporozhye-Kurakhove highway is also recorded. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian forces are making maximum efforts to cut off key logistical supply routes. -The enemy wants to make it impossible to provide quality support to our units defending in this area,- Milovidov explained. Ukrainian defenders inflict significant losses on the enemy's manpower every day. -On average, the enemy loses up to a platoon of personnel every day, and sometimes more,- said a representative of the National Guard. As for armored vehicles, their use in the direction is limited. -The enemy rarely uses heavy equipment, but periodically uses buggies and motorcycles to quickly transfer infantry groups to forward positions,- Milovidov noted. Despite the constant replenishment of reserves, the logistics of the occupiers are not perfect. Ukrainian forces are actively working behind enemy lines, striking with long-range weapons and aviation. -The counter-battery fight is being conducted at a high level, and our forces are doing everything to slow down the enemy's replenishment and logistical support,- the military officer emphasized. The so-called drone war is also actively underway. — The enemy uses all possible drones: from the Orlan and Zala reconnaissance complexes to strike drones and fiber-optic drones, which are difficult to disable by means of radio-electronic warfare, Milovidov noted. Worsening weather conditions also affect the course of hostilities. — Bad weather does not exist for the enemy. Even in difficult conditions, they continue assault operations, especially using infantry groups, the military said. At the same time, the decrease in temperature may make it difficult to use heavy armored vehicles, which will additionally affect the tactics of the Russian troops. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue to hold the defense and inflict significant losses on the enemy, preventing him from achieving his goals. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces repelled two enemy attacks in the Novopavlovsk direction. The occupiers tried to advance near Rozlyv and Zelenivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/novopavlivskyj-napryamok-rosiyany-shturmuyut-na-bagi-ale-finishuyut-u-chornyh-paketah/	2025-02-04T23:27:07-08:00

In the Gulyajpil direction three attacks by invaders were repelled by Ukrainian defenders near Novosilka. The enemy also carried out airstrikes on Gulyaipol and Novopol. In the Orikhov direction, our defenders successfully repelled one attempt by the enemy to advance in the area of ​​the settlement of Novodanilivka. On the Kursk direction, Ukrainian defenders repelled 11 enemy attacks. In addition, the enemy carried out 46 air strikes, shooting down 67 anti-aircraft missiles, used unguided air missiles six times, carried out 365 artillery attacks on the positions of our troops and settlements. In the Seversky and Dnieper directions the enemy did not conduct active operations. The soldiers of the 118th Separate Mechanized Brigade and the 126th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade were recognized for their effective and professional combat work at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who effectively destroy the enemy and cause him irreparable losses in manpower and equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/u-genshtabi-zsu-nazvaly-try-najgaryachishi-napryamky/	2025-02-04T21:11:26-08:00
KABs overhead, queues at the pharmacy and four hours to live: ArmiyaInform report from front-line Ko...	What kind of destruction the city suffered, how its inhabitants live in the conditions of approaching the contact line, and why Kostyantynivka is so important for the enemy, further in the material. Every day, the Russian aviation attacks the city with aerial bombs, with artillery strikes, the Rashists destroy high-rise buildings, private houses, social institutions, educational institutions, industrial enterprises and objects of critical infrastructure. Enemy reconnaissance UAVs are in the air and are adjusting fire. The contact line came closer to the city by less than 10 km, and to the ridges about 6-7 kilometers. This is if you take the distance from the Temporal Ravine, in which heavy battles are going on. Some villages and settlements of the Kostyantyniv community, which are located along the front line in the direction of Toretsk, have been completely destroyed, others are subject to unprecedented shelling and destruction. About 17,000 people remain in Kostyantynivka, and more than 1,000 residents live in the villages of the community. By the way, almost 80 thousand people lived in the city before the invasion. The closer we get to Kostyantynivka, the fewer civilian cars there are, mostly military pickups on the road. The central road, which runs alongside the railway, actually divides the city into two parts. The industrial part is on the plain, to the left, if you are moving from Druzhkivka, on the heights are private sector houses and multi-apartment buildings, to the right - behind the industrial facilities, on the hill is another part of the residential sector of the city. So, this part of the city, which is closer to Chasovoy Yar, suffered the most destruction. All around destroyed houses, shops, gutted educational institutions and kindergartens, glass from broken windows everywhere, destroyed production facilities and workshops of industrial facilities. Once upon a time, before the Great War, many enterprises worked successfully in Kostyantynivka, among them, for example, a bakery, a milk factory, and a glass factory. Now they lie in ruins. We approach the former building of the Kostyantynivska City Council. In front of it, you can see the explosions from the Russian anti-tank missiles, the building is ransacked, like everything around in this area. Nearby is a shattered school. The least number of people live in this part of the city, but single silhouettes of residents can still be seen on the city streets. Lyudmila Mykolaivna lived in Kostyantynivka all her life, a pensioner. -It's very scary, especially when the weather is sunny, then the Russians hit the city much more. I still have water, gas and electricity in my house. There are problems with the light, power grids are destroyed, they are fixed, of course. Interruptions with heating. My friends are already living without electricity, water and gas. But it is good that relatives are moving to Dnipropetrovsk region. -Many people still have stoves in their homes, so they heat and cook with them,- the woman says. Almost a year ago, the Russians hit the S-300 on Kostyantynivka and destroyed the railway station. In addition, a temple, private and apartment buildings, shops, market pavilions, three educational institutions, administrative buildings and a post office were also destroyed in this area. Now there are some shops and even open pavilions with products, there are vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, fish and dairy products. Agricultural goods are sold. In other areas of the city, there are also small shops where you can buy products. All the big supermarkets have already been destroyed by roaches. There are several points of dispensing free drinking water in the city. People come on bicycles, with wheelbarrows and -pushchairs- to conveniently carry bottles of water. Bread is brought, as in other settlements of the community. Pharmacies work, most of the necessary medical drugs are there, so people, for example, with cardiovascular diseases, are provided with pills. Ukrposhta branches, polyclinics, even queues at ATMs for cash are open. There is a minibus that runs around the city once an hour and takes residents to different districts of Kostyantynivka. The Kostyantynivska community has a strict curfew: it lasts 20 hours a day — from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. the next day. That is, only at this time residents can be on the street and actually have four hours for everything: to buy groceries, collect drinking water, go to the pharmacy, and so on. But just to breathe fresh air. When the electricity goes out in the city after shelling the occupiers, generators are turned on in shops and pharmacies. Even if the city is shelled, residents still go shopping, they say they are used to it. -Of course it's scary. But we have nowhere to go, there are many single people, they need to at least buy bread. For example, my relatives moved to Odeshchyna, I am here alone, I have to take care of myself. They call to me, I will finish my business here and go,- says Anastasia, a resident of the city. There are -points of unbreakability- in Kostyantynivka, volunteers bring hot food, distribute -humanitarian food-, plus you can get warm clothes here. -Everything you need for life in the city is there. We pray to God and ask him to give strength to the Ukrainian army to stop the Russian occupiers, - adds a grandfather and grandmother walking along the sidewalk, - we have lived here all our lives, where should we go, we have a home here, two pensions are still enough and we don't need much. There is food and water, the TV is working. And it will be spring soon, and it will be warm there, the smell of flowers and the trees will turn green. Let's go further. There is a queue at the pharmacy, people complain that there is not enough time to live. -Four hours to solve all current issues is very little. It's good that the hospital is still open, so help is available. There are qualified doctors, but we don't know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,- residents say. In the conditions of war, city utility workers do everything possible to improve the lives of residents. Sometimes they even work under enemy fire. Utility workers are trying to eliminate the consequences of shelling and destruction as soon as possible. Serhiy Gorbunov, the head of the Kostyantyniv city military administration, said that the city still has gas, electricity and partially water supply. -There is no water supply in some areas of the city, because the enemy destroyed one of the water mains, we are delivering water. After each shelling, the entire infrastructure is destroyed, we try to restore everything immediately. We provide people after shelling with construction materials for the preservation of residential premises and civil infrastructure. Volunteers help a lot,- said Serhiy Gorbunov. The center for providing administrative services of the Kostyantynivska hromada works in the mode of recording people's statements regarding destruction, surveys and entries in the registers of information about damaged and destroyed property. It is good that all the children were taken out of the city to a safe place. Schools, of course, are not functioning, schoolchildren study remotely. Entrepreneurs and owners of small shops are reluctant to communicate, do not want to be photographed. For the most part, their business is on the verge of closing, there is no revenue, so they work on their own enthusiasm. They say that while people are still in the city, they will be open to residents. The city remains one of the potential targets for the aggressor, in particular because of its railway hub. Rail logistics make it much easier for the occupiers to deliver troops and ammunition. Moreover, the probable occupation of Kostyantynivka will open the way for a further attack on the large Kramatorsk-Druzhkiv agglomeration. Kremlin seeks to achieve its goal of full occupation of Donetsk region. But the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroy the occupiers on the contact line and prevent them from advancing. The enemy is suffering losses, almost every piece of Ukrainian land on the front line is littered with corpses of Russian invaders. &#8230;When ArmiyaInform journalists were working in Kostyantynivka, the enemy attacked the city with barrel artillery and anti-aircraft guns. As a result of the strikes, private houses, a gas pipeline line, the electricity network and cars of residents were damaged. Recently, the enemy has been striking the city with the use of attack UAVs. Every day, the local city military administration calls for the need to evacuate the civilian population to safer regions of Ukraine! Take care, evacuate in time! For questions about evacuation, please call: 050 567 88 87, 093 420 18 83.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/kaby-nad-golovoyu-chergy-v-apteku-ta-chotyry-godyny-dlya-zhyttya-reportazh-armiyainform-z-pryfrontovoyi-kostyantynivky/	2025-02-04T20:51:01-08:00
500 bullets at the enemy with one -shot-: a mine-explosive master class from -Bach-	- The call sign appeared very simply - they came up with the guys when they started in the sapper company. How do callsigns appear? If you don't come up with something yourself, then something will be stuck on you and that something may not be the best. That's why they came up with something related to the sabotage business, detonations, - explains the soldier with a smile. -Bach- comes from the town of Hlyboka in the Chernivtsi region. The future sapper volunteered for the army in the first days of the large-scale invasion. Together with their cousin, they rushed into battle, although they did not have any military experience or long-term service in the Armed Forces. -I came with my cousin. Before the war, we went to the same job and were abroad for almost four years together. On the third day, it was my brother's birthday and I came to his room in the morning and said: -Well, -Boy- - he had a call sign even before the war - I kind of thought I'd go.- And he says that he also made up his mind, and we are a military commissar together,- recalls Nikita. Training at the Yavoriv training ground in Starychy, in contrast to the modern one-and-a-half-month BZVP, was less long, but every extra day in the -textbook- was perceived by the fighters as little more than a punishment, because they wanted to get to the front as soon as possible. -We imagined that the training would be like in the American movies - an obstacle course in the swamp, survival in the forest, urban battles&#8230; In fact, it was not so little, but we were very afraid that we would not make it to the war, we were very excited. We were preparing for VOS 100 as infantry and we hoped that we would be like Rambo in the trenches putting out fuckers - just like in the best blockbusters,- says -Bach-. During the formation of the brigade in Zolotonosh, Nikita and his brother were enrolled in the sapper company, but -Bach- began to fully master the mine and explosive business under the guidance of more experienced colleagues already during the hostilities in the Donetsk region. The fighter got there at the beginning of April 2022. He fought in the Severodonetsk region near Voivodeship. -Our first combat sorties were tough. It's hard for a person from a -citizen- when you don't distinguish between -exits- and -arrivals- - it seems that everything is flying around you. At first, we marched like a company of sappers, because we had to kill the whole -squad-, but in fact we were infantry. Only in the time free from fighting, sappers and contractors came to us, told us, showed us what to do, gave us some kind of basic course,- says the fighter. He gratefully remembers his comrades hardened in combat operations during the ATO/OOS, because they could give useful advice, prompt and show what and how to do. After all, a confident military man, every infantryman must master the elementary things of working with an explosive device. -Each infantryman should at least be able to set an anti-personnel mine. Of course, anyone is afraid to touch a mine, but in fact it is as safe as possible if you handle it competently and carefully,- says -Bach-. What's more, the sapper emphasizes, competently installed mine barriers not only do not pose a danger to their own infantry, but also save their lives. -The modern tasks of sappers are to install mine-explosive barriers. For example, infantry is entrenched and sits on observation posts, that is, it holds some area of ​​responsibility. We are moving forward, setting mines of the MON type in a controlled manner. This is how we -sewing up- our own infantry, so that the enemy cannot approach our positions without losses,- explains the sapper. Even the smallest of the MON-50 anti-personnel mines can stop the advance of a large group of the enemy, because its explosion provides a directed explosion and the impact of half a thousand pieces of debris in a certain sector. -You just press one button and 500 bullets will fly in one sector. We are laying mines along the front to occupy the entire area. Then instead of shooting 20 stores, you can press one button. You see, there's a group coming. Click and the group lay down. The first two of the group fall automatically, because you have already sifted through them. And others will not crawl further, because some of them are -300-, and others are frightened and must evacuate the wounded. Although they met in the Kupyansk direction of -storm-zet-, they simply have no choice to go back there - only forward, because behind them are -blockades-, explains -Bach-. -I personally did not participate in the offensives, but we cleared paths, worked with SSO groups, with the DRG, with intelligence colleagues who were preparing for offensive actions,- the military man says about the role of sappers in preparing for offensive actions. The so-called -gray zone- between the positions is very densely mined both by us and by the enemy, so before the fighters can start an assault, sappers must both remove their own mine barriers and clear the way to the enemy's positions from enemy mines as much as possible. -In order for the group to pass covertly without losses, we climb out first and clear all the mines. If there is an opportunity, we use mine detectors. If there is none, then simply by crawling, with feelers. First, we made a corridor in our barricades, crawled, made as much as possible to the enemy's positions - and then the group can enter through a safe corridor,- says the sapper. A path for armored vehicles is also cleared in a similar way, but mechanized means such as demining units can be used there. They make it possible to lay passages about 4 meters wide in enemy minefields, which is enough for the movement of a tank. The sapper emphasizes that an infantryman must be able not only to detect, but also to set mines. The damage that can be inflicted on the enemy by laying mines of directed action can in many cases be fatal for him. This is how you can destroy and stop entire groups of Russian infantrymen: -As practice shows, people are taught how to handle weapons, shooting, tactics, and tactical equipment at the BZVP. For engineering training in general, there may be only 1‒2 hours for the entire course. But in today's realities, the infantry must be able to lay mines. Now there are many mines of the American model of the M18A1 Claymore type. In our military, it is considered engineer ammunition, and in the US army, it is infantry ammunition. It goes just like a one-shot RPG, just like grenades. The same goes for -Claymore- - a small handbag, an anti-personnel mine and a net with a ready-made detonator. You may not have a sapper with you in the trench every second who can supply you. But there may be several claymore mines. Then he climbed out carefully, put it down. I have acquaintances from the assault brigades, and they tell me that there were cases when our guys held the defense with the help of such mines and repelled several assaults. The assault group simply goes, they put a mine behind the parapet, click - and the group lay down. Stopped smoking, recharged. You see the group again - the mine was placed, click. And whoever remained alive was shot. That is, in skillful hands, you can do serious things.- Since August 2024, -Bach- has served in the 115th separate mechanized brigade as an instructor in mine and explosive training. He teaches newly arrived infantrymen not to be afraid of mines, demining explosive objects and setting mines in combat conditions. -We let you feel every live mine, every detonator, every -fly-, every detonator. We explain and show how to blow up, what are the blasting machines and so on. Everyone felt everything, made several attempts to install it. Of course, without detonation, but the fighters get basic experience and will be able to use it in combat conditions,- says the sapper. During his service as a mine and explosives instructor, he and his brother with the call sign -Monk- have already trained several hundred fighters. -Bach- is sure that thorough comprehensive training of Ukrainian soldiers is one of the key keys to victory. After all, it is not enough to be motivated and have the necessary weapons - you should be able to use them skillfully. Therefore, the service of the instructor is an important contribution to the victory over the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/500-kul-u-voroga-odnym-postrilom-minno-vybuhovyj-majster-klas-vid-baha/	2025-02-04T20:38:52-08:00
Term service in Chechnya, or rape by Buryats: how they force Ukrainians on the TOT to sign a contrac...	Mobilization processes in the occupied Ukrainian territories are already ongoing. For example, conscription is already being held there. As the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported at the beginning of January, from October 1 to December 31, 2024, in the temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, the aggressor state Russia mobilized about three hundred people. -The occupation administrations intensified pressure with the aim of increasing the volume of conscription in the enslaved communities of the Kherson region and the Zaporizhia region - they require all men under the age of 60 to register for the so-called -military registration-. Those who try to avoid participating in the war against Ukraine are threatened, in particular, with the deprivation of earnings and means of livelihood,- said the message of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Also, in the occupied territories, they are actively working with the population to sign a contract for service. According to the data published by the Center of National Resistance, for almost 10 months in 2024, about 10,000 of Ukrainians living in the temporarily occupied territories became servicemen of the Russian army. And in general, according to the Russian plan, at least 150,000 recruits should be added to the ranks of the occupation forces. Among them, a significant share falls on temporarily occupied Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region and annexed Crimea. Intensification of mobilization in the occupied territories began in 2024. In particular, in the fourth quarter, for the first time with the start of the conscription campaign, military commissars in the occupied territories received strict mobilization tasks, says Petro Andryushchenko, head of the Center for the Study of the Occupation. These tasks were transferred to the occupation authorities, so that they would send the workers of communal enterprises to the military commissariats. And then they tried to force these people to sign a contract for service in the Russian army. For example, such cases were first recorded in the Mariupol district, and later spread to the Melitopol and Berdyan districts. -The conscription campaign began in October. Military commissars went around the villages, collecting boys under the age of 23. They were brought to the Military Commissariat and the blackmail began. They threatened that they would now be conscripted and sent to Chechnya or to the Buryats. And there they will be raped and the like. And such threats worked. Some guys signed a contract. We know about 15 such facts in the Mariupol district alone,- says Petro Andryushchenko. Also, the occupiers constantly -process- those who were called up for long-term service. They try to -motivate- to sign the contract in different ways. -They were also locked up in military commissariats and forced to sign a contract. They said that they would not be sent to the front. They will be cooks, drivers. They offered 800,000 rubles for signing a contract and from 200,000 rubles a month. These are smaller amounts than offered in the regions of Russia. But this is a lot of money for the occupied territories. They are also -pressing- even in the military units themselves. For them to sign contracts. And it worked too. Because we have data on prisoners from the same Mariupol district. That is, as soon as someone signed a contract, he almost immediately found himself at the front. And if they were lucky, they were captured,- says Petro Andryushchenko. By the way, the treatment of conscripts from the temporarily occupied territories in the Russian army is a separate story, which we have already discussed they wrote. According to Petro Andryushchenko, the situation will only worsen in the near future. The spring draft is approaching, which will have even more aggressive plans for mobilization. In addition, the occupiers have a need to increase the number of mobilized. -Why do I come to this conclusion? On average, the occupiers gather 30-35 thousand people for the army. And they lose from 40 to 45 thousand every month. There is also a clear drop in the number of people willing to sign a contract on the territory of Russia. Therefore, it is unlikely that they will be able to significantly increase this mobilization under such conditions. And this means that coercive measures must be included. And where to do it? In past years, they did it at the expense of their marginals, convicts and migrants. Society approved it. Now this can be done at the expense of occupied territories. -Busification- in conditional Berdyansk or Mariupol will be perceived normally by the same Muscovites. Like, you wanted to join Russia, so go now and fight,- says Petro Andryushchenko. Meanwhile, everything is ready for this in the occupied territories. Military registration is available, the data has been updated. Locking people in the occupied territories is easy. -Block exits to Crimea and the territory of the Donetsk region, and that's it - mobilize as much as you want. And it will happen sooner or later. The Russians have everything ready there. And they are able to collect the necessary number of people by coercive measures,- believes Petro Andryushchenko. In 2022, several tens of thousands of Ukrainians joined the ranks of the Russian-controlled LNR and DNR groups. Forced mobilization there began about a week before the full-scale invasion began. Usually it happened like this - orders came from the military commissariat to the enterprises that the men should appear at a certain time, like for -retraining-. And there they immediately issued weapons, uniforms and sent to the units. And then these very people went to storm Ukrainian positions in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, they were transferred for the so-called -consolidation- and maintenance of territories captured by the Russians in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson regions. It was the residents of Luhansk region and Donetsk region that were captured by Ukrainians in large numbers. For example, near Mayorsk, the Ukrainian military managed to capture 10 mobilized men from the occupied Horlivka. All of them worked in educational institutions. And all of them were forcibly mobilized and thrown into battle without preparation. Interviews with some of them was once published by journalist Volodymyr Zolkin. Aggressive forced mobilization in the occupied territories continued throughout 2022. People were taken away not only from enterprises, but also raids were arranged through the streets of occupied settlements. Many people got into the occupation army simply by going out into the street for some need. The SBU wrote about one of these stories. Here are literally two quotes from the interrogation of this prisoner, which demonstrate how mobilization in the occupied territories took place at that time: -I went to the store to buy food, they packed me right on the street and brought me to some building. Then they loaded it into a dump truck and took it with the others further.- -They told us to fight. But when the shelling began, I climbed into the tank with the others and hid. They don't shoot because they don't even know how to shoot.- And there were a lot of such stories in 2022. It is not worth counting that nothing like this will happen again. The only guaranteed possibility of not getting into the ranks of the occupying army is to defend ourselves and not allow the enemy to occupy our country. By the way, the mobilization of the adult population in the occupied Ukrainian territories is only part of Russia's plan to replenish its mobilization resources. Another component is militarization of Ukrainian children who are supposed to be there mobilization reserve of the aggressor state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/strokova-sluzhba-u-chechni-abo-gvaltuvannya-buryatamy-yak-prymushuyut-ukrayincziv-na-tot-ukladaty-kontrakt-z-armiyeyu-rf/	2025-02-04T20:32:58-08:00
Aiming at nuclear deterrence: France develops new hypersonic missile to reach Mach 7	As informs the specialized defense portal Zone Militaire, this project, implemented by MBDA France with the support of the ONERA aerospace research center, is aimed at creating a weapons system that will provide the country with the ability to withstand challenges from Russia and China, ArmyInform reports. The special feature of the ASN4G is its combination of hypersonic speed, stealth and long range, making it an unrivaled deterrent tool. In turn, the experts of the Army Recognition site detailed the plans of the French gunsmiths. This product should replace the existing medium-range missile ASMPA and will be compatible with Rafale F5 fighters. The claimed range of ASN4G is 1K. km, and the speed will reach 8.6 thousand km. km/h ASN4G is expected to reach speeds of Mach 6 to Mach 7, far exceeding ASMPA's capabilities. This speed, combined with improved maneuverability, will allow the missile to avoid radar detection and interception by modern air defense systems. The range of the ASN4G is claimed to be twice that of the ASMPA and will provide greater operational flexibility. The missile will also have stealth characteristics achieved through the use of specialized materials that reduce radar visibility and withstand extreme aerodynamic and thermal conditions during flight. The ASN4G engine is based on a supersonic jet engine developed under the PROMETHEE program. This propulsion system uses mixed combustion technology to transition between subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speeds, ensuring the rocket's ability to maintain high speeds over long distances. The inclined X-shaped tail (aerodynamic rudders) with -camber- angles of about 120 degrees, as well as the -zigzag- edge of the tail part of the ASN4G airframe should maximally reduce the EOP of the missile when irradiated by the enemy's ground and air-based radar from the rear hemisphere. At the same time, the area of ​​aerodynamic rudders is very significant, which indicates the possibility of performing anti-aircraft maneuvers of medium intensity even in the upper layers of the stratosphere (35-38 km). The architecture of the ASN4G on-board radio electronic equipment, including the guidance system, attracted considerable interest from experts. Based on the sketch, there is (in addition to the inertial navigation system and radio altimeters) a wide range of radio reconnaissance sensors for the detection of radiation sources and their identification, with further comparison with templates from a preloaded database. This is evidenced by the presence of large radio-transparent panels on the sides of the fuselage that form the nose. Passive antennas of the radiation warning station can also be placed behind them to alert the BCOM (Board Digital Computing Machine, - ed) of the missile about -capture- by illumination and guidance radars of the air defense system, or active search engines of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles of the -air-to-air- class. The development and use of the ASN4G sketch variant for France will mean the appearance in its armed forces of not a conventional 4th-generation multi-purpose hypersonic missile with nuclear -equipment-, but a multifunctional strike-reconnaissance hypersonic platform. The missile's compact design ensures compatibility with existing platforms, including the Rafale F5 fighter and future systems such as the Future Combat Air System's Next Generation Fighter (NGF) (FCAS). Development of ASN4G began in the 1990s at the same time as the modernization of ASMPA. In 2014, the French Ministry of the Armed Forces approved the program, with initial research focusing on two key approaches: stealth and hyperspeed. The choice in favor of hypersonic speed was based on its effectiveness in overcoming increasingly sophisticated restriction and denial of access and maneuvering systems (A2/AD). ASN4G is part of France's broader strategy to modernize its nuclear deterrent capabilities. It will be integrated with the Rafale F5 fighter and compatible with future platforms. Its deployment will strengthen the airborne component of France's nuclear deterrent, which is operated by the Strategic Air Force (FAS) and the Naval Nuclear Air Force (FANu). The missile's ability to perform complex maneuvers at hypersonic speeds ensures its effectiveness against modern missile defense systems. In parallel, related efforts include ArianeGroup's development of the V-MAX hypersonic glider, which complements the ASN4G program objectives. ASN4G is expected to be operational by 2035, and its service life will last beyond 2050. Its development is a continuation of France's commitment to maintaining an independent and reliable nuclear deterrent. With the integration of a hypersonic engine, improved stealth and increased range, the missile is designed to ensure the effectiveness of France's deterrent position in an increasingly contested security environment.

Russia made up -a discharged veteran of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- from -Cirque du Soleil-: analys...	The fake spread quickly through pro-Russian Telegram channels and, as it usually happens, crumbled at the first verified fact. According to the version of Russian agitators, the unknown -Ukrainian fighter- decided to become a circus performer after serving in the Armed Forces. His talent impressed everyone, but then the administration allegedly found out that he was -ex-military- and immediately got rid of him, citing some -political reasons-. Some versions of this fake even contained unique -details- - it was said that circus artists were afraid to work next to him because -he was too good with a knife- and -reacted too quickly to sudden movements.- It sounds like a script for an unsuccessful drama on a second-rate propaganda channel, but in fact it is another clichéd product of a factory of fakes aimed at discrediting Ukrainians in the world. Russian fakers are constantly working to create the impression that Ukrainians are becoming -dangerous to the world- because of the war. Their goal is to sow fear and mistrust, portray the Ukrainian military as aggressive, unbalanced, or even unadapted to normal life. This is part of their information war, which has little to do with reality. -Cirque du Soleil- does exist, but -discharged veteran- does not. The only thing that can be confirmed for sure is that real clowns are sitting in the Kremlin. And if someone really lost their job, it is the Russian propagandists, who can no longer make even their fakes convincing.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/rosiya-vygadala-zvilnenogo-veterana-zsu-z-czyrk-dyu-solej-rozbir-novogo-fejku/	2025-02-04T20:04:38-08:00
They killed the howitzer - there was one less enemy muzzle in the Pokrovsky direction	The video of the combat work was released on February 4 on the channel of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

Russian agents were preparing a terrorist attack against the police in Bukovina	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on Tuesday, February 4. According to the investigation, two attackers were preparing to blow up a police team in the Vyzhnytskyi district, which was supposed to arrive after a fake call to 102. -To commit a terrorist attack, the perpetrators planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in an abandoned farm building, equipped with self-tapping screws for maximum damage. The explosive device was hidden in a garbage bag, and nearby in a juice box was a mobile phone that filmed the entrance to the building. Using remote access to the gadget, the occupiers planned to activate the SVP when the police entered the building. By this time, the agents should have gone into hiding,- the message reads.

He also added that currently the enemy is trying to move mainly during the day. -The Russian troops currently have a shortage of night optics, and our drones, known as -Baba Yaga- or -Vampire- — are active at night — heavy bombers. Since they are easy to see during the day because of their large size, they work mainly at night,- explained the representative of the 155th OMBr. In turn, the commander of the 59th separate assault brigade named after Yakov Handziuk of the Forces of Unmanned Systems with the call sign -Bird- notes that, despite the huge losses, the Russian invaders do not stop, but try not to enter into a head-on collision with Ukrainian units, but to bypass them. -The enemy uses different tactics, tries to carry out assault actions in different ways. On armored vehicles, on lightly armored vehicles or, in general, with ordinary vehicles that they have available, such as buggies. Tries to use different tactics. Tries from one side - the brigade fights back decently - tries from the other. Maneuvering,'' said the combatant of the 59th OShBr.

Everyone is thrown into the attacks - some debtors, some convicts, some mobilized go into the attack. They cook for one or two weeks. -Their system is built on losses. They perfectly understand the shortcomings of this system, it is adapted to these shortcomings. The latest trend is that they don't even say to storm a target.

-Training is the key to success-: Marine -Mickey- on preparing for battle	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Mickey- together with his family had to stay in occupation for several months. When they were lucky and were able to go to the territory controlled by the Ukrainian troops, the boy immediately went to the territorial center of recruitment and social support to join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -There was absolutely no thought that I could do it differently. I swore an oath to the Ukrainian people, served a term of service. Besides, I have seen plenty of how the occupiers behave on our land,- the young scout shares his thoughts. At TCC -Mickey- he was immediately offered to join the then 124th separate territorial defense brigade. First, he got into the car company, and then continued to serve in other logistics units. However, from the first days, the fighter dreamed of serving in intelligence. -Intelligence is a very interesting place of service, here a lot depends on ingenuity, ingenuity, non-standard approaches to tasks. You are constantly on the move and forced to improve,- the warrior notes. A junior sergeant's unit and really special. Marine scouts perform complex and very important tasks. They often operate independently, without the support of adjacent units, on the front lines and behind enemy lines. Reconnaissance is not simply about observing the positions of the occupiers. Scouts pave a safe way for infantry to positions, scout for mine-explosive barriers of the enemy, analyze changes in the general situation in the area of ​​their responsibility, and, of course, are directly engaged in the destruction of manpower and equipment of the Rashists. -During combat missions, mostly everything depends on you. How did you prepare, how was the task plan drawn up, what factors were taken into account, what equipment was selected based on the specifics of the task. We pay a lot of attention to personnel training, especially to young recruits. I train them myself, constantly, every day, unless we are on a combat mission. If a fighter successfully completes a training task, well, well done. If not, let's train further,- the young commander smiles broadly. There is a place for both dreams and hopes in war. And it should be so because it gives strength to continue our struggle for our country, the liberation of its territories and our people, who are waiting for us in the Ukrainian lands occupied by the Russian invaders. Despite the difficult years spent in the war, -Mickey- does not lose optimism. He dreams of returning with his mother to his native village and planting a vegetable garden again. And he definitely wants to visit Henichesk and ride the water slides there. The man is convinced that this will definitely happen.

This is the same man from Poltava who the year before last spat at a veteran, provoked a conflict with military personnel of the Poltava TCC and SP, and later posted a video on his Instagram showing the middle finger to the Ukrainian military. Someone will say that almost two years have passed, everyone has already forgotten about this character, and the Ukrainian court has only now made a decision. Yes, the millstones of the legal process grind slowly, but relentlessly. Especially since such cases are not frequent in our country. And, one way or another, the culprit will be imprisoned for the next 6 years and half of his property will be confiscated. -The sentence for Roman Zavoloka is quite expected and fair. We hope that the sentence for the murderer of our serviceman will be just as fair. It is only a pity that the guilty verdicts are not able to change the attitude towards the military servicemen of the TCC and SP, who faithfully and faithfully perform their duties,- the Poltava Regional TCC and SP commented on the event. It may seem that the sentences really will not change the attitude towards the military from TCC and SP. But this is only at first glance. It is only necessary to create a precedent. If the society sees that the state awards 6 years of imprisonment for a middle finger to the military forces of Ukraine, then whoever wants to repeat Zavoloka's -feat- is unlikely to raise a hand to do so in the literal sense. And with this, believe me, comes a change in attitude towards military personnel serving in the TCC and SP. Those whom the state does not allow to be insulted, sooner or later, the part of the country that, according to the Law, is considered conscripts, begins to respect. And it is not for nothing that in the comments of the Poltava TCC and SP expressed the hope that the sentence for the killer of their colleague from the regional Poltava territorial recruitment center would be just as fair. We are talking about the crime committed by the suspect Vadym Kuzub on February 1 of this year, shooting at a military man who was accompanying the mobilized to the educational center. -It is unacceptable that people of various levels of influence and media influence - from Russian bots and agents to people's deputies - are trying to justify the very fact of the murder of a soldier by a civilian in 2025. It is unacceptable the phenomenon when, instead of working on solving problematic issues, instead of planned and immediate work with the goal of eradicating systematic contempt for military personnel of the TCC and SP, there is a detailed examination of the identity of the killed soldier and a discussion of whether he was sufficiently -military,- Poltava emphasized. TCC and joint venture. Yes, Russian bots in social networks did a lot to blacken the image of the deceased. But, you must agree, after today's sentence to Roman Zavolotsa, confidence increases significantly that any citizen who dares to attack a soldier of the TCC and SP will certainly be punished. ArmyInform earlier reported that the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, expressed his position regarding the latest cases of attack on the military in the rear. According to him, the killings of servicemen are a red line that cannot be crossed, and society should not silently watch the disrespect for the defenders of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/za-serednij-palecz-u-bik-zsu-6-rokiv-tyurmy-u-poltavskomu-tczk-spodivayutsya-shho-i-dlya-vbyvczi-vyrok-bude-spravedlyvym/	2025-02-04T07:02:27-08:00

-Instructor- back in battle: the story of a school teacher who became a company commander on the fro...	Fierce battles on the front line Since 2023, Yevhen has been serving in the 58th brigade, where he joined from the reserve unit. During this time, he passed the hottest points of the front — the Avdiiv and Vugledar areas. Among the most tense battles, he mentions Krasnohorivka, Stepove and Ugledar. The assaults here continued from morning to evening, and the task of the Ukrainian soldiers was to restrain the enemy. Yevhen notes that the enemy's tactics remain the same - the enemy's troops are acting head-on, trying to take quantity, not quality. A feature of the battles in the Vugledar region was the active use of motorcycle groups by the Russians: fighters on high-speed motorcycles broke through to the positions of the Ukrainian troops, throwing grenades into the trenches. Despite the difficult conditions, the motivation of the fighters remains high. -We have been fighting for independence for more than a thousand days. Who but us?- Yevhen emphasizes. He is convinced that Ukrainians are a nation capable of adapting to any conditions and fighting for victory. According to him, representatives of various professions are currently fighting in the ranks of the Armed Forces - teachers, doctors, mechanics, agronomists. -Man is a creature that knows how to survive. And if there is motivation, we will win,- he adds. The commander emphasizes the importance of rest and moral support of the military. Exhausted battles require regular rotations and attention to the psychological state of the fighters. At the same time, he believes in victory: -We want to return to the borders of 1991, and we will work on it. But the main thing is to prevent this war from happening again in a few years.- Addressing civilians, Yevgeny urges them not to be afraid of mobilization and to join the ranks of the Armed Forces. -War is not good, but one must protect one's land, one's children, one's women. We will stand, because the truth is with us,- concludes the officer. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian special services and the military are increasingly trying to influence the families of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Numerous cases have been recorded when the occupiers contact relatives immediately after taking the defender into captivity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/instruktor-znovu-v-boyu-istoriya-shkilnogo-vchytelya-yakyj-stav-komandyrom-roty-na-peredovij/	2025-02-04T06:04:10-08:00

Russia uses explosive drones to terrorize civilians	informs the State Emergency Service of Ukraine about this. If you see a suspicious object that looks like an explosive drone, under no circumstances approach it or try to touch it. Instead, report the find immediately to 101 or 102.

Transfer through Army+: the MOU explained the difference between orders and orders	In the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine explained what are the differences between these documents and how their implementation is controlled. For officers, the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces prepares a transfer order. At the same time, there are orders for private, senior and non-commissioned officers. Both documents are mandatory. Orders and transfer orders can currently take up to two weeks to form and finalize. However, it is important to distinguish between these documents. When contacting the military unit, the soldier or sergeant should ask for the transfer order itself. In Army+, cases are recorded when the order is already ready, but the soldiers are still not transferred, waiting for the order. When changing the place of service, the order does not indicate the position of a military person. Only name, title, part number and taxpayer card number are provided. Thus, if a position has changed within one military unit, this is not an obstacle to transfer. This is a violation of the right of a serviceman, because orders and orders are mandatory. The Central Office for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights together with the military administration bodies respond to possible cases of commanders ignoring the execution of orders and monitor their execution. If the military unit received an order or order, but ignores their implementation, it is necessary to report this to Army+. The MOU noted that the Central Department for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights will receive the appeal and will monitor the implementation of the order or transfer order. Previously, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published an explanation of the transfer mechanism in the Army+ application, as well as the reasons why delays may occur.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/perevedennya-cherez-armiya-u-mou-poyasnyly-chym-vidriznyayutsya-nakazy-j-rozporyadzhennya/	2025-02-04T05:06:13-08:00

A record number of Russians are looking for their missing people in Ukraine: the -I want to find- pr...	This is reported by Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. During the month, 8,548 requests for information on missing soldiers of the army of the aggressor country were received. This is 22% more compared to the previous month, which is the highest figure for the entire duration of the project. -I want to find- is a separate project of the Coordination Headquarters, which was launched in January 2024 with the goal of facilitating the exchange of prisoners of war. During the project's operation, it received more than 60,000 inquiries about missing Russian servicemen. It is important to note that this figure does not include the dead and is only part of the real number of missing Russians. According to experts, the total number of missing Russian soldiers may be 2-3 times higher, since not all families turn to the Ukrainian project. However, even this statistic is impressive. Of the 60,000 applications received, the project confirmed the captivity of 1,790 soldiers of the aggressor country, 408 of whom have already been exchanged for Ukrainian defenders. These figures are also lower than the actual number of POW invaders, as they are based solely on applications received. The increase in the number of -I want to find- requests from Russians is an eloquent testimony to the huge losses suffered by the enemy in Ukraine. This is not surprising, because Russian commanders are increasingly resorting to the tactics of -meat assaults-, sending untrained soldiers to the front, -zeroing- them and leaving the wounded on the battlefield. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian special services and the military are increasingly trying to influence the families of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Numerous cases were recorded when the occupiers contacted relatives immediately after taking the Defender into captivity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/rekordna-kilkist-rosiyan-shukaye-svoyih-znyklyh-bezvisty-v-ukrayini-proyekt-hochu-najty-otrymav-hvylyu-zapytiv/	2025-02-04T04:07:00-08:00

They spied on the military under the guise of volunteering: two people are suspected in the Kharkiv ...	About this informsSBU on February 4. According to the case file, the accused worked as a couple. They turned out to be a local unemployed man and his roommate. -For the conspiracy, the agents posed as volunteers who help homeless animals. For this, they even equipped an improvised -shelter- in their own yard. Under the guise of trips to search for abandoned animals, they went around the area and fixed geolocations for fire damage,- the SBU said. Among the potential targets were reserve deployment points and checkpoints of the Defense Forces, as well as medical facilities where wounded Ukrainian soldiers were receiving treatment. -All additional information was obtained by the traitors -in the dark- from local residents whom they met during reconnaissance trips. The received intelligence agents transmitted the game by phone to a militant they know, who is fighting on the eastern fronts and cooperates with the Russians,- the report says. SBU counter-intelligence timely exposed the agent couple, documented their crimes and detained them at their place of residence.

-People are scattered like consumables- - in Vovchansk, the enemy does not stop trying to attack	Oleksandr Danylenko, head of group of interaction with the media of the brigade of the State Border Service -Hart-. According to him, the losses of Russians in the direction amount to about one hundred people per day. These are both irreversible and sanitary losses. -The losses are quite serious, but we know the human resources of the occupying country. So it's nothing to them. They are scattered by people as consumables,- said Oleksandr Danylenko. Russian units are concentrated in the northern part of the city of Vovchansk. From there, they constantly try to -bother- the Defense Forces. -The northern part of Vovchansk, north of the Vovcha River, remains under the control of the occupiers. But there is not much to hide there. The city was practically destroyed. The infantry, as well as manpower, which is brought in periodically and goes on assaults, is accumulated in those ruins,- said the head of the media interaction group of the State Border Service -Hart- brigade.

We need specialists who have the latest technologies, know how to work with drones, understand cyber security and information protection,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk. According to him, military education is constantly adapting to these challenges. -We are updating training programs to prepare those who will ensure the superiority of the Armed Forces on the battlefield: on land, in the sky, on water and in cyberspace,- he assured. Specialties that have the greatest demand in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for which the training of military specialists in high schools was increased after the start of the full-scale invasion: All these specialties began to be taught in Ukrainian high schools after 2014, and some of them - after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation.

A representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade told - Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. According to him, it is necessary to knock out the enemy not so much from trenches and fortified traditional fortifications, but from deep holes. -Charter- in this process is helped by high-quality planning of operations and drones. Ground drones are a direction that is actively developing at Charter. -We have created a separate unit, opened a separate recruitment and training of both pilots and engineering technicians. Recently, a large operation was carried out, where several dozens of both aerial and ground drones were used simultaneously. The further we go, the more we understand the role of logistical tasks, fire damage, mining and demining. Where we can replace a person with a ground drone,- noted Volodymyr Degtyarev. As ArmyInform reported, in the Kharkiv direction in the Liptsi-Hlyboke zone, the front line remains stable. The movement of infantry, as well as the movements of enemy equipment, are not recorded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/roboty-vykuryuyut-rosiyan-z-glybokyh-nir-same-tak-vyglyadaye-prosuvannya-syl-oborony-na-harkivshhyni/	2025-02-04T01:19:52-08:00
-Too risky-: the story of a fighter who brought his comrades out from under enemy fire	The story of the fighter's heroic deed was made public on the page of the air command -East-. The village of Liptsi, which was liberated from the invaders by the Ukrainian military for the second time, is of strategic importance. From here, the enemy could direct artillery fire on Kharkiv, so holding positions is critical. Daily artillery duels, drone attacks and small assault groups of Russians make the situation extremely tense. Logistics and unit rotation are complicated — enemy FPV drone operators control the roads. It was in such conditions that Sergeant of the Air Force Yevhen Pogozhih, together with his comrades, found himself under heavy fire when entering the position. When 50 meters to the destination, the enemy FPV drone dropped a grenade. One of the soldiers, an Air Force fighter with the call sign -Doc-, was seriously wounded. He had to be evacuated urgently. -The brothers shouted that it was too risky,- says Yevgeny. — But there was no other way out. Together with his friend, he began to carry the wounded, hiding behind the trees. However, a Russian drone spotted them and corrected the mortar fire. — The real mortar horror began. The mine fell a few meters away from me. He was wounded in the knee and face. If it weren't for the means of protection, I wouldn't have survived, Yevhen recalls. Despite the danger, the brothers managed to be carried to the evacuation vehicle. Ukrainian soldiers continue to put pressure on the occupiers, causing them significant losses. According to Yevhen, the motivation of Ukrainian defenders is extremely high, and each of them knows what they are fighting for. Sergeant Pogozhih has been in the Air Force since 2006. After his release in 2019, he briefly returned to civilian life, but with the start of a full-scale invasion, he again joined the ranks of the defenders. His wife also serves in the radio engineering troops, so she understands well what it means to be in the military at this time. Yevhen is currently undergoing treatment. The medical commission and doctors' decisions are ahead. But his fighting spirit remained indomitable: - There is something to fight for. So go for Victory! As reported by ArmyInform, when the full-scale invasion began, George - bijczya-shho-ne-znaye-slova-vidpochynok/->pensioner, military reserve- did not hesitate for a minute. He immediately applied for service in the Steel Border border brigade and returned to the fight for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/zanadto-ryzykovano-istoriya-bijczya-yakyj-vynis-pobratyma-z-pid-vorozhogo-vognyu/	2025-02-04T01:06:09-08:00
National resistance: how Ukraine is building a comprehensive defense system	This is about in the notification of the Ministry of Defense. From the experience of repelling the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, Ukraine has rethought its approaches to protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state. One of the powerful tools for countering the Russian aggressor was the concept of national resistance, a system that unites the efforts of the military, civil authorities and citizens in the fight for the independence of Ukraine. -For the third year already, our military has been restraining the enemy Russian army, which has carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. All citizens of Ukraine should help the Defense Forces,- emphasized First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. According to him, this is both the maintenance of law and order and countering saboteurs in the government-controlled territories, and assistance to the Special Operations Forces in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian lands. -In order for Victory to come closer, every Ukrainian must realize his role in the defense of the state during hostilities and in emergency situations. We must strengthen military-patriotic education, which forms a stable motivation to protect the Motherland,- he assured. National resistance is a set of measures aimed at protecting Ukraine by maximally involving its citizens. National resistance gives every Ukrainian an opportunity to contribute to the defense of the state. The main goal is to increase the state's defense capability, provide Ukraine's defense with an all-encompassing character, and help ensure the readiness of Ukrainian citizens for national resistance. The system of leadership of the national resistance is built in such a way as to ensure clear coordination of all components of the resistance. At the head is the President of Ukraine as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, who exercises leadership through the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. National resistance has three components, each of which performs its specific tasks. The first is territorial defense, which protects important facilities, maintains law and order, and counters subversive groups in controlled territory. The second component is the resistance movement that operates in the territories where Ukrainian sovereignty needs to be restored. This may include both information operations and physical opposition to the occupiers. The third component is the preparation of citizens for national resistance. This component of the system provides people with the necessary knowledge and skills to protect their land. It includes both military training and emergency training. Territorial defense units perform a wide range of tasks: from guarding important facilities to countering subversive groups. In emergency situations, they help rescuers and ensure the safety of the civilian population. An important task of territorial defense is also participation in strengthening the protection of the state border and creating conditions for the safe functioning of authorities. In wartime, ground defense units often become the first line of defense for their communities against various threats. Territorial defense also takes an active part in information confrontation, carrying out measures to counter enemy information operations. In addition, it helps in the provision of assistance to the population, which is especially important in the conditions of martial law. Territorial defense has three interrelated components: The military component includes military management bodies, military units of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other forces and means of the Security Forces and Defense Forces involved in the performance of territorial defense tasks. The civil component includes bodies of state power and local self-government. They provide administrative support, coordination of the population and resolution of territorial defense measures. The military-civilian component is the headquarters of territorial defense zones (districts) and voluntary formations of territorial communities. They are a connecting link between military and civilian structures. The territorial defense management system is built on a clear hierarchical principle. At the national level, leadership is exercised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces. Within the borders of the land military zone, leadership is exercised by the heads of regional military administration bodies through the relevant headquarters. Each zone and district of territorial defense has its own leaders and headquarters, which coordinate actions at the local level. The resistance movement is a component of the national resistance, which operates where it is necessary to restore the sovereignty of Ukraine over the temporarily occupied territory. Its main tasks include forming a resistance network, conducting special operations and creating obstacles to the actions of the occupiers. An important function of the resistance movement is to carry out informational and psychological operations and to carry out intelligence activities. Specific work methods are protected by state secrets. The leadership of the resistance movement is carried out by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Special Operations Forces. The preparation of citizens for national resistance is aimed at forming citizens' patriotic consciousness, mastering practical skills and skills to protect their state. The main tasks include the formation of citizens' understanding of their role in the defense of Ukraine, training in actions in the conditions of hostilities and emergency situations. Special attention is paid to military-patriotic education, which forms a stable motivation to protect the Motherland. The leadership of the preparation of Ukrainian citizens for national resistance is carried out by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine through the relevant central bodies of the executive power.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/naczionalnyj-sprotyv-yak-ukrayina-rozbudovuye-vseohoplyuyuchu-systemu-oborony/	2025-02-04T00:51:11-08:00
-TCKashniks- do not exist: language betrays the enemy	Many of these terms betray the enemy immediately, because their meaning and purpose are obvious. If someone uses the terms -Ukrainian Nazis-, -Ukrainian militants-, -hokhlopiteks-, -banderlogs- and the like in their speech or in posts or comments on social networks, it is clear to everyone that this is done by the Russian occupiers or their henchmen. However, there are apparently neutral terms that are aimed at distorting reality and filling it with meanings beneficial to Russian propagandists. For example, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the mass propaganda media of the Russian occupiers tried to use the term -ZSUShniks- to designate the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Used exclusively in a negative context, this term did not take root in Ukrainian social networks, because despite its pretended neutrality, it tried to replace and stand in for other objective and positive definitions in the speech: -Ukrainian military-, -servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, -defenders- and others. Having failed in the task of discrediting the entire Ukrainian army and its servicemen, enemy propagandists and numerous bots have focused their efforts on undermining its foundation — the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. The main goal of the enemy was the disruption of mobilization, and the means used by Russian propagandists were provocations against servicemen of the TCC and SP and artificially exaggerating in the information space those cases when the servicemen of the Armed Forces were unable to resist them. From just a few isolated cases to hundreds of thousands of calmly and correctly mobilized conscript citizens of Ukraine, Russian propagandists have created a fictitious image of demonized -manhunters- who seem to only do what they do by twisting and beating civilians in the rear. At the level of language, this image of the enemy was fixed with the help of the term -TCKashniki- to denote servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are serving in the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. Russian propagandists began to artificially contrast -TCKashniks- with defenders from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Instead, in fact, the opposition of military personnel who serve in the TCC and SP and all other structures, parts, units and units within the Armed Forces of Ukraine is artificial and harmful in nature. There are no -TCC cashiers- — there are servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are currently serving in the TCC and SP. And before that, many of them served in combat units and were injured during combat missions. It is impossible at the same time to support the Armed Forces and throw mud at the servicemen of the TCC and SP, applying the derogatory term -TCKashniki- to them. Anyone who denigrates servicemen from the territorial recruitment and social support centers is actually directly opposing the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This means that Ukraine is a direct enemy of the Ukrainian people and the state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/tczkashnykiv-ne-isnuye-voroga-vydaye-mova/	2025-02-04T00:32:10-08:00

Especially many different UAVs. -If they launch FPV drones, they launch several dozen of them at once. These drones reach populated areas such as Myrnograd, Pokrovsk. If they do not find military equipment on the road, then they can work on local residents and ordinary local cars,- he said.

He didn't ask if he could - he just stood up: the story of a fighter who doesn't know the word -rest...	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Giorgii says that his decision to return to the army was completely conscious: -When I heard that the Steel Border was being created, I immediately applied. I was waiting for orders and was ready to engage in combat work.- The combat routine of his unit is a daily confrontation with the enemy, who uses the latest technology, intelligence, drones and advanced weapons. However, Ukrainian defenders constantly adapt and find effective methods of struggle. The enemy tries to test his weapons on Ukrainian soldiers, but our soldiers quickly analyze his tactics and give a worthy response. -Ukraine is a place where the aggressor tests the maximum of its innovations. But we don't just keep hitting, we learn and improve our tactics.- According to George, high-quality fire support is of great importance. Drones, artillery, mortars and strike drones help destroy the enemy and protect our soldiers. -The calculations of the attack drones -Vampire- showed themselves very well in battle. They allow not only to inflict fire damage, but also to remotely mine the territory where it is impossible for sappers to reach.- When enemy equipment moves to Ukrainian positions, fighters can remotely install up to a hundred mines, which greatly complicates the enemy's offensive. Despite the high combat training and coherence of the unit, George admits that the hardest thing is losing comrades. -When you send people on a mission, and you don't know if they will return. This is the hardest part. It's incredibly difficult.- The Russian army fights en masse, not counting its losses, but for the Ukrainian military, every fighter is not just a soldier, but a person behind whom family, friends, and a whole life stand. When asked what his greatest desire is, George gives a short answer: -To hear the word 'Victory'.- That's the most important thing for all of us.- He believes that the Ukrainian army will be able to stand and win back every meter of native land. As reported by ArmyInform, Vadim with the call sign -Popil- never planned to become a soldier. Before the Great War, he lived a quiet life in Khmelnytskyi, worked in a private firm, traded in dairy products.

During the last days, BBS pilots of the 63rd brigade destroyed the Ural, an SUV, a -loaf-, a buggy, several ATVs and motorcycles. -For some reason, the Russians have lost their armored vehicles in the Lyman direction, so they are increasingly using conventional vehicles,- the brigade said in a statement. Ukrainian defenders humorously add that they are waiting for the appearance of a -self-propelled stove-, -airplane carpet- and -a hut on chicken legs- among Russian equipment. As reported by ArmyInform, a unique special operation was carried out by fighters of the 106th battalion of the 63rd mechanized brigade, which captured the enemy BMP-2, which stayed two years under water.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/bezstrashna-buhanka-proty-ukrayinskogo-drona-spojler-vona-zgorila/	2025-02-03T22:28:25-08:00

Rescuing the wounded in the dark and under enemy fire: ArmiyaInform report from takmed exercises	It is almost impossible to see something in the dense darkness - it is early in Donetsk region. Actually, that's why the fighter came out right now, because it was too dangerous to do so. -I'm here, I'm the -three hundredth-!-, we hear a few meters from the exit from the shelter. Archer is injured and needs help. Fortunately, all this is just an imitation of a possible situation during real hostilities - a final check during tactical medicine exercises in the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. ArmiyaInform visited the final class and talked with the fighters and instructors. An intensive two-day training in tactical medicine for the soldiers of the Defense Forces is an initiative and one of the main areas of activity of the All-Ukrainian Association -Patriot- Public Organization. Classes are conducted by highly qualified specialists, the purpose of which is to provide primary or significantly improve the already existing skills and abilities of combatants. -Our manager and founder of the foundation, Hanna Maiboroda, has been involved in this community since 2014, since the time of the ATO. The main direction of the NGO -Patriot- is medical, training for both military and civilians. Now we go to different destinations and work with everyone who comes to meet us, because the demand and need for such trainings is extremely high,- says Nils, a representative of the organization. He is a former fighter of the 4th brigade of operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard of Ukraine, was a combat medic in the -Force of Freedom- battalion, so he not only perfectly knows the theory, but also has considerable practical combat experience. Nils emphasizes that such trainings with soldiers, who are taken on rest during rotations, are extremely important, because they allow to constantly update their knowledge of tactical medicine. Important features of the trainings are work exclusively with small groups of 4-6 people, good supply of consumables and training dummies, as well as maximum approximation to real combat conditions. During the final exercise, fighters must render aid to a wounded comrade while simulating intense shelling of the position, in the dark and under conditions of heavy smoke. -Why is it important to implement this kind of approach? Because it is absolutely incorrect to train military personnel only in hothouse conditions for the reason that, unfortunately, there will not be ideal conditions in war. Soldiers need to be mentally and physically prepared for those moments that will arise during their real work,- explains former serviceman of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, tactical medicine instructor Andrian. That is why the fighters spend the second day of training -in the field-, helping the wounded in full combat gear and with weapons in their hands. The training is so close to reality that they need not to remove, but to cut off the uniform from the wounded - training clothes, as well as all other consumables, are provided by the NGO -Patriot-. -We use individual first-aid kits of fighters and various mannequins - for tamponade with simulated bleeding, for needle decompression, fully equipped in accordance with all requirements and standards. In the final session, we dress the wounded in second-hand clothes that can be cut, and also add simulation of explosions and smoke using airsoft and smoke grenades,- says Nils. The instructors are very satisfied with the work of the fighters during training. This is not surprising, because even an outside observer immediately notices how the students do not just perform a number, but take the initiative and ask the instructors to further explain some aspect or practice an educational exercise. -The guys are very well involved in the work. I really like that they always have questions, they talk about some situations from their own experience, they ask to comment on unclear points. Often at first they believe that they already know everything and we will not teach them anything new. But then during classes, we see how their eyes light up, how they want to work,- says Andrian. The final session must be held late in the evening, because, as experience shows, the front freezes during the day and all the events take place at night. Therefore, it is very important that fighters know how to provide first aid in the dark. Also, in the evening, after intensive training, they are already tired, and they will have to rescue a wounded comrade when they are tired. -Today we worked all day in the field in full ammunition, worked out the full MARCH algorithm and individual elements of assistance. And now (during the final class — ed.) we gathered all our knowledge together and fully practiced rescuing the wounded, giving him first aid and preparing him for evacuation,- says one of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion, who just completed training. He is satisfied with his studies, but he hopes that he will not need to use the acquired knowledge in real life: -Thank God, all these are now stickers, shams, dummies. In reality, it would be terrible. However, it is better to know and be able to never need it, than not to know what to do when the need arises.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/poryatunok-poranenyh-u-temryavi-ta-pid-vorozhym-vognem-reportazh-armiyainform-z-navchan-po-takmedu/	2025-02-03T20:46:52-08:00
A fighter on miniatures: the appearance of a UAV interceptor drone, similar to a fifth-generation ai...	As noted, not without a certain amount of boasting, on the official portal of the developer firm from the American city of Brighton , in Colorado, this next-generation jet-powered interceptor shares common features with the Lockheed F-35B stealth fighter and F-22 of the 5th generation, ArmyInform reports. The device has a length of 1.8 m, a wingspan of 1.5 m and flies at speeds of up to 320 km/h. A jet engine simulator is installed on it - an electric motor rotates turbines, which creates thrust. According to the plan, the machine will receive its own vertical takeoff system (eVTOL, Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing). It is designed to detect, track, identify and neutralize enemy drones. According to the plan of the developers, the CobraJet will have the possibility of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and a nozzle with a thrust vector, which provides increased maneuverability. The interceptor is equipped with VIPER air-to-air missiles, each of which has a PYTHON warhead to neutralize kamikaze drones. The authors of the UAS Vision profile site about unmanned aerial vehicles stated that the CobraJet is powered by solid-state batteries with a high energy density and equipped with flight controller/autopilot with artificial intelligence, day/night camera and inertial sensors for autonomous flight in 24/7 mode. In addition, it is powered by an -electric jet engine-, a system consisting of in-duct turbines driven by an electric motor to create thrust. VTOL capability allows the CobraJet to launch from mobile platforms such as trucks, ships or other aircraft such as C-130. The SkyDefense Command and Control (C2) control system integrates VRAM (Visual Real-Time Terrain Monitoring). VRAM uses an artificial intelligence-based operating system to quickly analyze data from CobraJets and involve operators in decision-making. In addition, CobraJet drones are designed to maintain operational efficiency even in challenging electromagnetic environments, thanks to advanced anti-jamming radios and GPS receivers that provide reliable communication and navigation in jammed conditions. To further enhance their capabilities, satellite communications systems such as Starlink are being explored, offering the potential for uninterrupted communications and increased effectiveness in electronic warfare scenarios, even in remote or highly competitive areas. -Our CobraJet neutralizes enemy UAVs with airborne munitions and returns to base to rearm. This approach significantly reduces the cost of counter-drone operations, while maintaining stealth and effectiveness against new threats, including unmanned ground vehicles,- SkyDefense President Nick Verini was quoted as saying by American news resource on unmanned aerial systems UASweekly. The product also offers a mobile configuration suitable for law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security and Defense and military applications, according to SkyDefense. In this configuration, the C2 and VRAM systems are housed in tactical or militarized cyber trucks designed to operate in extreme environments with low acoustic and thermal signatures to avoid enemy detection. If you believe the promises of SkyDefense, its new device should be presented to potential customers already in the second quarter of 2025. In this case, it will become a revolution in the military, since this device is a universal hunter for drones and ground robots. Intrigue is fueled by the fact that, apart from low-quality renderings, the manufacturer has not shown anything yet. In the future, according to the assurances of the SkyDefense management, it is expected that the technologies used in the CobraJet will develop in the direction of increasing its flight range, expanding the capabilities of autonomous control and integration with more complex combat control systems. In addition, SkyDefense plans to adapt its platform for civilian tasks, such as territory monitoring or emergency response. Graphic presentation of the CobraJet unmanned drone interceptor.

-Operation -Phantom subpoena-: how Ukrainians in Europe are deported by invisible special agents-	It would seem that what could be a more reliable source of information than Telegram channels with names like -Pravda UA- or -Lawyer for all-? Well, or the same -anonymous sources in the State Border Service- who work exclusively in the fantasies of panic lovers. According to the mythology of these experts, mobile groups are already operating somewhere in Poland or Germany that search for men, instantly hand them a summons and, if possible, deport them to Ukraine on the spot. Eyewitnesses (anonymous, of course) even saw men being dragged into buses similar to those taken to the resort, but without Wi-Fi. The problem is that no real case of such -extradition- has yet been confirmed. And from a legal point of view, this is just nonsense. There is no mechanism of -instant deportation- at the request of the Military Commissariat in international law. Ukrainian legislation also does not provide for the possibility of abducting its citizens on foreign territory. A separate -sensation- is the fact that Ukrainian embassies allegedly transfer the data of evaders to the local authorities, which gladly help to deport them. The reality is that embassies do not have access to lists of conscripts (otherwise they would not ask to bring documents for consular registration by hand). Also, European countries are not very happy to run around with summonses from Ukrainian cafes, because they have more important things to do. Although, perhaps, the latest Ukrainian technology actually works: summonses are transmitted via Wi-Fi at the level of a biometric passport, and they are automatically signed in the phone through Diya. That is why it is so important to go only to McDonald's, and not to suspicious Wi-Fi zones! Some even say that Ukrainian men are no longer being released from Europe without the permission of the Military Commissariat. In particular, there were several stories about the refusal to board flights due to the fact that the -passport is in the database-. And here it is interesting: if someone is already in Europe, why should he be -not released-? Does it work like this: -Sorry, you can't fly to Egypt, but we will help you - Warsaw-Kyiv flight-? The answer is simple - everyone who benefits from creating chaos. Russian bot farms that are happy to fan panic. Dodgers who are looking for an excuse. Telegram channels that need more subscribers. If these horror stories are to be believed, soon subpoenas will be sent through Privat24, and Ukrainian men will be hunted down in European supermarkets, where they are hiding among cheese discounts. But for now, the reality is this: no one issues summonses at the border, no one is deported on the lists, and Ukrainians in Europe can sleep peacefully (unless it's not very peaceful if you have to pay for an apartment in Berlin).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/operacziya-prymarna-povistka-yak-ukrayincziv-u-yevropi-deportuyut-nevydymi-speczagenty/	2025-02-03T20:04:19-08:00
In Kyiv, they said goodbye to the Belarusian sniper: the story of Maria Zaitsava, who died for Ukrai...	Maria asked not to cry and not to bring flowers to her as a farewell if she dies, said reserve colonel Ruslan -Santa- Myroshnychenko, ex-commander of the Second International Legion: -Maria was a strong girl, a soldier, a volunteer. She commanded us to be courageous, strong, to fight the enemy. So, please don't cry. These are not my words, these are what she said. Let's not cry, gather together and fight. And we kill! Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!- Maria joined the International Legion in November 2022. She was a combat medic for a long time. -I noticed that such a fragile girl appeared, a child in fact. I immediately paid attention, because then I thought, what is a high school student doing in my combat unit? But this high school student, relatively speaking, has a very well-formed personality, mature thoughts, and a well-formed determination to fight. She repeatedly repeated that she is not an object of pity, she wants to be a specific subject of struggle and she proved it every day,- said Ruslan Myroshnychenko. At first, she worked in the medical evacuation crew, and then as a combat medic directly at the positions. She was always very goal-oriented and constantly studied, recalls Maria, her fellow health instructor at the medical center, Sergeant Ruslan Boychuk. -She and I came to the Legion almost at the same time. They were in the same crew together, they took positions together. So we have a situation where some women become stronger than men. Men hide, but women even come from abroad. Maria could live peacefully in the Czech Republic, she lived there, she had a residence permit, but she came here,- recalls Ruslan Boychuk. According to Ruslan Myroshnichenko, he did not want to let her go directly to the position. But she convinced him that she could do it. And she saved the lives of several servicemen thanks to her coolness and composure. During one of the trips to the position, Maria was wounded. A fragment of a mine fell into her hand. But after treatment, she immediately returned to the unit. And she said she wanted to become a sniper. -So she firmly told me that that's enough, -Santa- is enough, I'm ready to kill. She had a desire to take revenge for her brothers,- recalls Ruslan Myroshnychenko. And Maria began to train as a sniper. At first, it was an improvised training ground in the East of Ukraine, and then she was sent to sniper courses. After returning from training, she performed combat missions in the Chasovoy Yar region, and then in the Pokrovsk region. She was an effective sniper. -This girl has struggled her whole life. And she died during a combat mission. She was in position until the last,- said the commander of the Second International Legion, Major Oleksandr Yakymovych. According to him, the unit presented Maria Zaitsava with the award -For Courage- (posthumously).

International partners have provided military ecologists with advanced equipment for chemical analys...	About this informs on February 3 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The equipment was transferred as part of international aid with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Swedish government. The official ceremony took place in Kyiv with the participation of the First Secretary of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden in Ukraine, Nils Dahlquis, who handed over the equipment to the head of the Center of Excellence for Mine Action and Environmental Safety, Colonel Oleg Ryabchuk. Now in the arsenal of Ukrainian military ecologists there is an MX908 mass spectrometer and a Raman Serstech Arx substance identification analyzer. The MX908 is a multi-purpose portable mass spectrometer for real-time chemical detection and identification, which will be used for chemical and explosive detection. -This high pressure mass spectrometry (HPMS) device detects and identifies compounds at the residue level with exceptional sensitivity and selectivity,- the statement said. The Serstech Arx Raman analyzer is developed on a modern software platform and in the Quick Scan mode allows you to get accurate results faster for military and industrial explosive devices, military poisons and toxic materials. In his -library- there are more than 2,200 dangerous substances. -Thanks to these devices, we will be able to accurately determine chemical threats in the studied territories, and therefore, plan measures to reduce the negative impact on the natural environment and ensure environmental safety more quickly,- said the head of the environmental safety department of the Main Directorate of Mine Action, Civil Protection and Environmental Safety colonel Yury Sytnyk. Colonel Valery Weber, the deputy head of the Main Directorate of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security, thanked the representatives of UNDP and Sweden for their constant support to Ukraine in its confrontation with the Russian aggressor and for technical assistance in the investigation of territories contaminated by dangerous remnants of war. As reported by ArmyInform, during January 2025 the demining units of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine terytorij-u-sichni/->cleared of explosive objects 8,755 hectares of de-occupied territories.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/mizhnarodni-partnery-peredaly-vijskovym-ekologam-peredove-obladnannya-dlya-himichnogo-analizu/	2025-02-03T04:44:44-08:00
If someone does not want to serve in his army, he will be -meat- in the Russian army: an expert on f...	Now the experience of wild -safari-mobilization-, tested since February 2022 in ORDLO, is being repeated there. The other day GUR released a video abuse of forcibly mobilized Ukrainians in the Russian armed forces. About why illegal conscription in the occupied territories is another war crime of Russia, says an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, a candidate of political sciences and a military serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yury Oliynyk. ― First of all, it is a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions and other international documents that prohibit the mobilization of the population in the occupied territory of a state with which there is a war (in particular, Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court - AI). In this way, Russia cynically violates internationally accepted norms. The population that remained in the occupation is brutally used as meat, obviously targeted by people from Russia for control. This is usual for the occupier to instill fear, which is intensified by inter-ethnic confrontation - a practice that has been used for decades and even centuries according to the principle of -divide and conquer-, - believes Yuriy Oliynyk. He says that a typical example of this situation is one of the peoples of the Caucasus, the Chechens. ― In the 1990s, they fought for their freedom, in the 2000s, Moscow was able to overcome them, and many people succumbed to Russian propaganda that soon there will be peace and tranquility, there is no need to fight. Now, instead of fighting for their own freedom, they shed blood for the interests of the invader. In addition, Chechens are specifically demonized in the eyes of other enslaved peoples of the empire in order to instill fear and so that there is no trust in them, the expert explains. It is also a clear example of what can await the population in the occupied territories if the occupied territories continue to expand. ― Against the background of the Russian propaganda campaign that is currently being conducted against the mobilization in Ukraine, against the TCC and SP, we see how they will actually act if they occupy a larger territory of Ukraine. They will not take into account the opinion of the population, but will carry out forced mobilization of everyone they catch. Therefore, if someone does not want to serve in his army, then in the event of the capture of Ukraine by the enemy, he will be used as meat for the needs of the invader.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/yakshho-htos-ne-hoche-sluzhyty-u-svoyij-armiyi-to-bude-myasom-u-vijsku-rf-ekspert-pro-prymusovu-mobilizacziyu-na-tot/	2025-02-03T04:44:00-08:00
A Russian combatant was destroyed in Velika Novosilka	This was reported on February 3 on the brigade channel. Our fighters posted two photos, in one of which an enemy combatant bravo poses with a weapon, and in the second - he tries to hide in the reeds from our drone. -Our drones left him to rot in those reeds forever. In the last minutes of his miserable life, he asked for salvation and prayed towards the quadcopter. It did not help the occupier. We have a bullet and a drone for every invader. The enemy will be defeated!-, the 110 brigade assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the battalion of unmanned systems of the 110th mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka hit immediately 5 towed artillery systems of the enemy. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/u-velykij-novosilczi-znyshhyly-rosijskogo-kombata/	2025-02-03T04:37:06-08:00
-Begins to hang on his opponent-: why Pokrovsky's defense resembles the 10th round of a boxing match	The spokesman of the operational and strategic Major Viktor Tregubov of the -Khortytsia- troop group. According to Viktor Tregubov, the enemy's ambitions remain unchanged — to capture the city, cut the routes to it and leave the defenders of the city without supplies. However, now the Russians do not have such a great advantage that would allow them to effectively introduce offensive actions. -If they suddenly have some new powerful reserve. If they suddenly become an absolutely unlimited number. If they have an unlimited number of vehicles, an advantage over drones, then of course this could somehow change the situation,- said the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. But, Viktor Tregubov is sure, the situation looks like there is no such great advantage now. And an offensive for the Russians is a guaranteed four-digit number of losses in just one day. -It's a bit like a boxing match that goes to the 10th round. When both boxers are tired. But the one who attacked more actively, attacked more actively at the beginning, he was already a little more tired. He just doesn't have enough energy. And he is already starting to hang on his opponent. This is what is happening here with the Russians,- Viktor Tregubov noted. As reported by /a> ArmyInform, fighters of the 13th operational brigade of NSU -Chartiya- destroyed 15 Russian invaders, as well as an ammunition depot, a cannon, and an enemy shelter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/pochynaye-vysity-na-svoyemu-supernyku-chomu-oborona-pokrovska-nagaduye-10-j-raund-bokserskogo-poyedynku/	2025-02-03T04:24:24-08:00

Also, the pilots of the brigade destroyed equipment, fortifications, warehouses and antennas of the enemy. -Everything that the occupiers considered -reliable- turns into rubble. This is a new era of war, where the technology and skill of Ukrainian soldiers change the rules of the game,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 77th Airborne Dnieper Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine showed the work of their drone -Kazhan-.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi shared photos of the production of Ukrainian unmanned systems	President Volodymyr Zelensky shared new photos from the process of manufacturing unmanned systems on his page. The head of state emphasized that Ukrainian weapons not only help the military gain an advantage on the battlefield, but also save their lives. -Our Ukrainian weapons help protect the lives of our soldiers and achieve results on the battlefield. Our defense production, which includes both equipment and projectiles, increases the space of our security and our arsenal of capabilities,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. According to him, Ukraine will increase this potential every year, which is the strategic perspective of the state. The military-industrial complex is expanding thanks to the efforts of the public sector, private companies and international partners investing in the Ukrainian defense industry. The development of technological weapons, in particular unmanned systems, is critical to the conduct of modern warfare. Ukrainian manufacturers are constantly improving their developments, adapting them to new challenges at the front. -Thank you to everyone who makes our army technological,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the partners for the new packages -myru/->military aid and hopes for new announcements next week.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/volodymyr-zelenskyj-podilyvsya-svitlynamy-z-vyrobnycztva-ukrayinskyh-bezpilotnyh-system/	2025-02-03T04:01:19-08:00

FPV drones on fiber optics: the SBS commander talked about ways to counter them and similar developm...	The Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Colonel Vadym Suharevsky told about itin an interview with Radio Liberty's -Donbas Realities- project. -If I'm not mistaken, we recorded the first use of such drones by the enemy at the beginning of summer. Then there was a certain decline and now an active phase again. This is exactly the stage of the Cold War, when the arms race is based on the fact that something effective is invented, and the other side will come up with a way to counter it,- he noted. According to him, it is now a step behind the Ukrainian side. -We must use this technology to our advantage and find an effective means of combating it. I will announce in advance that certain ideas and results are already planned. After a journey of testing and scaling, I think we'll get there. Yes, this is a really dangerous weapon,- said the SBS commander. Vadym Sukharevskii noted that this is, on the one hand, a revolutionary approach, since all EW systems, on which billions of money have been spent, are ineffective against FPV drones on fiber optics. On the other hand, this tool constrains the occupiers in a maneuver, so the way to fight it can be effective when building a normal countermeasure system. -Our guys are already learning, they're already adapting to these drones. Yes, unfortunately, at a high price. As for us, in just the last few weeks, various agencies have already codified more than 14 manufacturers of fiber-optic drones with general parameters from 10 to 15 km with coils of various types,- he informed. In his opinion, Ukrainian diplomats should ask their partners to limit the supply of optical fiber to Russia. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces of Ukraine during January 2025 rosijskyh-vijskovyh-obyektah-u-sichni/->delivered two dozen blows to military and industrial objects on the territory of the Russian Federation involved in a large-scale war against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/fpv-drony-na-optovolokni-komanduvach-sbs-rozpoviv-pro-shlyahy-protydiyi-yim-j-podibni-rozrobky/	2025-02-03T03:41:48-08:00
-Stolen heritage-: GUR presented a database of cultural values ​​stolen by Russia	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The event was attended by representatives of the European Commission, UNESCO and 28 partner countries, 19 of which were represented at the level of ministers and deputy ministers of culture. The public database -Stolen Heritage- was created by the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Ukraine, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, and the expert community. It became operational at the beginning of October 2024 and is available on the War &amp; Sanctions. Currently, the database contains information on 828 objects of cultural heritage stolen by the Russian occupiers and almost 300 individuals and organizations involved. The information is constantly updated and supplemented. -The destruction and appropriation of the cultural heritage of Ukraine is an element of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression. Russia's goal is to deprive the Ukrainian people of their right to exist by destroying their national memory and identity, appropriating history,- said a representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine during the presentation. The publication of information about cultural values ​​and works of art stolen by Russia is an important tool in the fight against their illegal circulation and the policy of cultural genocide on the part of the aggressor state.

The Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Colonel Vadym Suharevsky told about itin an interview with Radio Liberty's -Donbas Realities- project. -As for planning and intelligence - yes, it is there, it is being conducted. And I dare say that it is conducted even with the active participation of international partners. It's effective, and we really know, can and know how to detect different types of systems and hit them accordingly,- he said. According to him, the -Baba Yaga- drone-bomber, infamous for the enemy, hit the Russian -Buk-M3- at a distance of 57 kilometers from the front line. -What's more, he was found literally 40 minutes before his injury. Our -bombers-, the units that use them, show an example of extraordinary efficiency,- added Vadym Sukharevskyi. He noted that in the last two months alone, the Nemesis unit hit more than 15 units of the precious BUK-M3, Thor and other enemy targets. -Just yesterday, our unit effectively hit an enemy tank at a depth of more than 34 kilometers. It's an FPV,- the SBS commander said. He said that the confirmed and possible depth of operation of the Unmanned Systems Forces today is more than 2,000 kilometers. -Accordingly, depending on the tasks, we will develop technologies in the future. My task is to make the state and the army strong, ready for any future war,- Vadym Sukharevskyi emphasized. The commander of the SBS noted that the path taken by Ukrainian production in terms of technology development is simply colossal. There are already several samples of Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles, which are completely made of our components.

-The guys at the gun are counting on me-: the story of the wounding and return to the front of a sol...	The story of the fighter published on the page of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Airborne Assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On February 23, 2022, he was at the -No Limits- concert, feeling an uneasy feeling. The next morning the war began. The first thing Vadim did was to evacuate his family. Friends and acquaintances who passed the ATO advised not to rush to the military commissariat - -your turn will come.- And it came in the spring of 2023. Vadym was designated as a driver in the artillery brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops at the Military Commissariat. -I've been driving all my life, so this position didn't come as a surprise,- he recalls. But the war quickly taught that the ability to drive is only a small part of the tasks that have to be performed. Every week, Popil and his brothers drive more than a thousand kilometers with ammunition on broken roads and sticky fields. He not only delivers the shells, but also helps move the guns after the battle. Rollover is always a danger, because the enemy has already calculated the position and can strike at any moment. -Sometimes we invest in 15-20 minutes, and sometimes we get stuck for an hour,- he says. Another feature of the job is constant waiting. -We can sit in the landing at midnight with a full body of shells, waiting for the moment when the enemy will give us a window for safe unloading. Sometimes you have to hide and wait for shelling, because you can't retreat - the infantry is counting on us.- Also, a lot in the lives of gunners is weather dependent. -We are constantly monitoring the weather. If, for example, there will be a full moon at 11:00 p.m., we need to do everything before the enemy gets better visibility.- But this is a two-sided game - the Russians work according to the same principle. War does not allow relaxation. -It was even calmer in Zaporozhye. But not now. FPV drones have become our daily threat. Air defense and electronic warfare do not see everything. On the day when an FPV flew into our car, we were already far away from the firing range, we were driving without headlights with a night lamp, and even the command said that there was no threat. But an enemy drone found us and hit the roof.- The impact came between him and the driver. -My left side was injured, his right side. Shrapnel wounds, lacerations, contusions. They helped each other, our pick-up truck picked us up and quickly took us to the headquarters.- Despite the injuries, Vadim returned to his work. -It was difficult. When I was driving on a fire road after treatment, I even had a panic attack. But the fear passes. When it's hard, I think about my relatives and about the guys at the gun - they count on me, and the infantry counts on the artillery. Here, everything is interconnected.- Work without days off. In addition to shells, they carry food and parcels. Constantly optimizing routes to make them faster and safer. And every night before going to sleep, Vadim remembers the day he experienced. -When CABs fly nearby, you are covered with earth and debris, and even the windows of the cars are intact - you understand that God protects us.- For his service, Vadym was awarded the Iron Cross medal. -What does she mean to me? It's more for my baby. Dad's pride.- As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Oleksandr with the call sign -German- is drona-bomber operator 128 separate of the Transcarpathian Mountain Assault Brigade. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he worked at a mining and beneficiation plant in Kryvyi Rih.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/hlopczi-bilya-garmaty-rozrahovuyut-na-mene-istoriya-poranennya-ta-povernennya-na-front-bijczya-z-pozyvnym-popil/	2025-02-03T02:43:45-08:00

In particular, the collaborator conducted the Internet to the locations of the Russian military and representatives of the occupation administration in the buildings of the local court, police, customs, and also to educational institutions. The entrepreneur arranged in his office a place to access the Internet for making calls, for the use of which local residents paid directly on the spot. On one of the server collaborators implemented a special application for communication, which was controlled by representatives of the occupation administration and the military of the Russian Federation.

Instead of the ring, the front: how the kickboxer -Aras- stood up for Ukraine	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Denys recalls that the military theme fascinated him since childhood: -In kindergarten, when there were performances, they asked what you want to be when you grow up.

This was reported by the commander of the 429th separate regiment on the -Suspilne.Novyny- broadcast. of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko. According to Yuriy Fedorenko, having a huge number of personnel, the enemy uses -quite interesting- tactics. People are the cheapest expenditure material for them, so it is constantly thrown forward. -The enemy is constantly trying to conduct combat reconnaissance in order to find us on the front line. And in the case of detection, fire damage begins to be actively carried out in the place where the fire came from. Due to its drones, artillery and many other things. The Defense Forces are used to such tactics,- he said. In addition, in order to accelerate the offensive, from time to time the Russians continue to use armored vehicles.

A saboteur who was preparing a terrorist attack on the railway was detained in the Rivne region	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. However, the attacker did not even have time to install the SVP, because the SBU detained him near the track -in the act of red-handed-. According to the case materials, the agent turned out to be an unemployed 23-year-old resident of Lviv Oblast, who had already been prosecuted for vandalism at the burial sites of Ukrainian soldiers. He came to the attention of the FSB as an ideological supporter of racism and because of his desire to leave for Russia, which he repeatedly wrote on social networks. As the investigation established, the suspect received step-by-step instructions from his Russian curators: to arrive in Rivne region, take the explosives from the cache and install them according to the specified coordinates on the tracks. During the investigation, evidence was obtained of the suspect's performance of another task — he collected information about the locations of the bases of units of the Defense Forces in Lviv Oblast.

How to choose a weapon that will not let you down: tips from a special agent -Den-	This is discussed in the post on the brigade page. According to -Dan-, his favorite assault rifle is the Colt M4. He calls it a -simple, time-tested classic- and notes its reliability, ease of use and -survival-. -More than 50% of its reliability, survivability, etc. depends on the operator himself,- says the fighter. He emphasizes that weapons must be carefully cared for and protected from external influences, especially in an aquatic environment. -Dan- said that working in the water requires the use of sealed bags or summaries that contain quality lubricant, cleaning agents and a special nozzle to prevent dirt from entering the barrel. Regarding the choice of weapons for various tasks, the fighter noted that he takes the M4 both for land and underwater operations. Although, he said, he might occasionally use the 5.56mm M249 SAW light machine gun. -I find the AR-15-based carbine with a barrel up to 12 inches, with a gas tube instead of a piston, to be the most versatile for a wide range of tasks. -In my case, it's an M4 carbine with an 11.7- barrel,- -Dan- said. He also shared his experience with various weapons including the Canadian C8, SCAR, Haenel and Daniel Defense. -My main principle for choosing a weapon is that it should be tested by time and harsh operating conditions, and it should be based on accumulated practical experience of use by other shooters in different situations. I don't want to learn about the -nuances- of the weapon sample already during the task. A banal delay when shooting at one operator can frame the whole group,- the fighter emphasized. According to him, operators can have different rifles in one group, but the whole group can also be equipped with the same rifles in the same configuration. The choice of weapon depends on the task, the time of day, the area of ​​operation, as well as the attachments on the rifle, such as the LCV, optical/collimator sights, thermal imaging attachments/thermal sights, and flip-up magnifiers. As the Army reported, fighters of the 73rd SSO center in Kurshchyna /->hit the enemy's personnel and equipment with all available means.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/yak-obraty-zbroyu-yaka-ne-pidvede-porady-vid-speczpryznachenczya-dena/	2025-02-03T00:29:29-08:00
