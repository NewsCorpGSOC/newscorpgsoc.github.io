- When we jumped out, she shouted: - Help!--: the Russians shelled Slavyansk with anti-aircraft guns	The consequences of enemy shelling were recorded by ArmyInform. The occupiers hit the Cherevkivka microdistrict located on the outskirts of the city with two aerial bombs. The shelling took place around 16:50. The ammunition exploded at intervals of a few seconds in the neighboring streets. -One house was completely destroyed, dozens were damaged. Cars were also damaged,- succinctly informed about the consequences of the shelling by Chief Slav Yansk city military administration Vadim Lyakh. — Two KABs arrived. One on that street, after a minute there was a break, and one here. Shortly before five in the evening, says local resident Serhii, who was in his own homestead, located just 15 meters from the site of one of the hits. He helped rescue an elderly woman whose house was completely destroyed by an explosion. She miraculously survived and was quickly helped by local residents, but after the terrible explosion, the condition of the victim is serious. — When we jumped out, she shouted: -Help!-. At first there was no one there but us. Here she was, right near the pit, next to this log. She was sitting facing her, Serhii points to a deep ravine next to a completely destroyed house. There were children in houses near the hit sites who were under acute stress and in need of help. The youngest child is about 2.5 years old, she was with her parents at the time of the explosion. However, there are also older children who were struck at home alone and were helped by neighbors. Several nearby buildings near the epicenter of the explosion were also almost completely destroyed - their roofs were not only destroyed, doors and windows were knocked out, but also the load-bearing walls were moved. Obviously, some of them are not recoverable. The force of the explosions and the scattering of debris were such that windows and roofs were broken in dozens of buildings located a few dozen or even tens of meters away from the places of impact, and in those closer to them, strong outer doors and gates to yards were even torn off and bent. On a neighboring street, a bomb hit an open area near the houses, but the few closest ones were of little help, missing windows and parts of their roofs. — It is necessary to close the roof and keep the windows. It will rain, snow&#8230; Everything will be now&#8230; -We still can't get to the roof,- says a local resident. Her trouble is shared by all the neighbors, three dozen of whom the street gathers from. People are waiting for building materials from local authorities and charitable funds, with the help of which it will be possible to somehow temporarily patch up housing. There is no real repair yet - to begin with, at least the broken windows and doors must be closed, and the roofs covered.

The soldiers of the 95th brigade of the DSHV have repeatedly watched how enemy attack aircraft calmly try to shoot down Ukrainian UAVs with assault rifles, and when the paratroopers begin to destroy them with rocket launchers, only then do they understand that these are not just reconnaissance drones. Convinced with their own eyes that the aircraft are dangerous, they start to fuss and try to hide. -Let's emphasize that we still have no confirmation that these soldiers are from North Korea. We will be able to confirm that these are Koreans when we capture them or find the relevant documents. -So far, we have received passports that state that these mercenaries are from the Republic of Tuva, which is a subject of the Russian Federation,- the report says. As reported by ArmyInform, in Kurshchyna in the defense lane, the enemy -tuvyncziv/->conductspermanent assault actions - in large and small groups, actively uses drops from drones and strikes with barrage munitions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/zagon-samogubcziv-novoprybuli-najmanczi-rosiyi-sherengamy-jdut-na-shturmy-j-ne-boyatsya-droniv-poky-ti-ne-zroblyat-pershyj-skyd/	2024-12-21T00:27:17-08:00

They promise to silence -In the times of communism-: the US space force is preparing to deploy a sys...	According to the article, posted on the portal of the Bloomberg news agency, the system was developed by the American company L3Harris Technologies Inc. The latest equipment, which is declared under the name Meadowlands (-Meadows-, or in another version of the translation -Times of Communism- - Ukrainian), is a lightweight and mobile version of the existing -Counter Communications System-, which was officially put into operation in 2020. Meadowlands can receive software updates and is able to jam a wider range of frequencies, which makes its application more flexible. However, according to Bloomberg reporters, it will be delivered to the troops more than two years later than planned. The reason for the postponement is technical problems, which the manufacturing company did not disclose. Currently, according to representatives of the Space Force, -Meadowlands- has passed all the necessary system tests and is ready for delivery. This -jammer- is designed to interfere with spacecraft communication systems and acts directly on satellites. And unlike most similar stations, including the Russian 14Ц227 -Tobol-, which jams GPS in Europe, it is made on a mobile chassis. While bringing the Meadowlands EW station to combat-ready samples continued, their developer, the American giant L3Harris, managed to produce as many as five such complexes. They will be transferred to the electronic warfare unit of the US space force Space Delta 3, which specializes in protecting US space systems from profile threats. Specialists of IKK Defense Express noted that Meadowlands is the result of system development , which is known as CCS (Counter Communications System) 10 and its implementation in the Block 10.2 version, the contract for the development of which L3Harris received back in 2014. At the same time, the CCS Block 10.0 launch version was first deployed in 2004 in the number of three systems. Its upgraded Block 10.1 version had seven systems. At the same time, initially Block 10.2 was planned in the amount of 16 units, but apparently the order was doubled. And thanks to the mobility, as well as the number of such systems, which means the possibility of rapid deployment of Meadowlands in certain areas and the formation of continuous zones where the enemy will not have access to their spacecraft, the United States plans to gain a significant advantage over the enemy. In particular, leave it without satellite communication or navigation systems. After all, even in a publication in a Western publication, it is clearly stated that the main targets of this system are satellite groups of the Russian Federation and China. In particular, we are talking about military satellite communication equipment, which in the Russian Federation is represented by a fairly significant number of spacecraft, in particular, the Rodnyk-S series (similar to the civilian Gonets-M), Meridian-M relay satellites, etc. In addition, such systems as Meadowlands should also affect satellite navigation. In the period from January to March 2025, the Space Force will assess the readiness of the first five of the planned 32 units of the system for operational use. Coincidentally, the authors of the Bloomberg portal said that China now uses more than 300 remote sensing satellites with different sensors, -improving the Chinese military's ability to monitor US aircraft carriers, expeditionary strike groups and deployed air units,- the United States Space Force said in its next review of space threats. -Despite the fact that Russia has some of the most powerful remote sensing satellites in the world, their number in the Kremlin is limited compared to the United States and China,- the Pentagon said. &nbsp; Suppression systems for hostile satellite radio signals for the US Space Force from the L3Harris company.

There are no -unknown soldiers- in Israel: about the experience of the IDF in identifying the bodies...	— What is the algorithm of identification, collection of primary information for further identification of the bodies of dead soldiers in Israel? — Identification of the dead is based on four biometric features. These are the testimonies of friends, fingerprints, teeth and DNA. There are several situations where people die. For example, when a fighter died on the battlefield. He is alone or there are several of them, but they died, say from bullet wounds or something near them was torn apart, and the bodies remained intact. In this case, the recognition algorithm is as follows. There must be two people who will say that this soldier's name is so-and-so, and another is called so-and-so. Then they will be able to sign a special identification form. This happens if there are comrades or commanders with them who can recognize them. Then the testimony of two people can replace one of the biometric methods of identification, but in reality this is very rarely the case. - Why does this happen occasionally? - Simply because the dead are usually taken somewhere outside the battlefield. For example, if they are in Gaza, they are taken over the fence to Israel. There is a casualty collection station and other people working there who already have the appropriate forms and all the necessary equipment to do all the necessary procedures. And on the battlefield they simply prefer not to linger, and therefore such recognition happens infrequently. The evacuation of both the wounded and the dead is carried out by special teams whose main task is evacuation. Their task is to load the wounded into a vehicle as quickly as possible and take them to a safe place. This is usually any place where a helicopter can land, where it will fly in a few minutes and take the soldier to the hospital. This is the same -golden hour- for evacuation, which is well known all over the world. If it is the body of a dead soldier, it is taken to a collection point for the dead in the territory of Israel, and there the people from the Rabbinate take on further transportation. This is done only by the Military Rabbinate, because it is this institution in our country that is responsible for burials and for providing religious services to other religions as well. In addition, people who work at such a point have special devices that they carry with them, and they can take fingerprints for the first stage of biometric recognition right on the spot. These devices are connected to the service phone and the victim's fingerprints in electronic form are immediately sent to the database, and usually within, well, literally half an hour, an answer is received about the probable identity of the victim. - Why likely? - Two methods are required for definitive identification. When conscripts go to the army for the first time or to a reservist meeting, they are required to give their fingerprints. They must also have a panoramic photo of their teeth, photos of both jaws, and a blood test for DNA. Due to the fact that many of our citizens were once in the army, even civilians are in the army database. - What happens after that? - Fingerprints have been used for initial identification. And with some probability they found out that this is the same fighter. And as soon as a suspect is identified, officers are usually sent to the victim's family to inform them that this has happened. At the same time, the body of the deceased is transported to the military morgue and immediately informed that such and such a soldier, with such and such a personal number, is heading to you and is already on his way. This is done so that it is possible to already look in the military database, what information is available about these soldiers regarding, firstly, the teeth, and, secondly, to get from the database a DNA sample that this soldier once gave. When soldiers donate blood for DNA, nothing is done with these samples immediately, they are simply archived. they are analyzed only when there is a need for it. Analyzing a DNA sample takes several hours and is the slowest method of detection. By the time a soldier arrives at the morgue, we, that is, the identification team — dentists, doctors — already roughly understand what awaits us. We know if we have pictures, if we can even try to identify from the teeth or pictures, if there are none at all, and we don't even have to look at the teeth first, but immediately take DNA and things like that. Or at all they tell us that his friends have identified him, there are fingerprints and everything, and you just have to examine the corpse, record all the injuries and everything, and you can send it to the funeral team. That is, the task is actually quite difficult, because according to the Jewish religion it is very important to bury the deceased as soon as possible. This, of course, depends on the wishes of the family, sometimes there are relatives abroad who need to come. But there were cases when a soldier died during the day and the family expressed a desire to bury the same night. And we left for the funeral at night, at 23:00-00:00. — Vladislav, one more question. Let's say it's a person who has suffered a landmine blast injury. The face is distorted, the jaws are broken, a fragment flew into the face. That is, it is impossible to take a picture of the teeth. Fillings were mixed up there, part of the teeth were lost, a piece of the jaw was lost. How do they do it in such a case? - First, when we receive casualties after explosions, usually if there is a fragment of the jaw, I, as a dentist, can recognize by the anatomy of the teeth which teeth they are. Even if there is one human tooth lying in front of me, I may not know who it belongs to, but I know what tooth it is by number. By the way, an individual tooth can also be sent for DNA analysis. If we are talking about explosive injuries, then we have a different problem, because according to the Jewish religion, all the pieces of a person must be buried together. And so it's usually about doing a lot of DNA samples from different tissues and then matching them with the initial DNA sample of this or that soldier and deciding that it's his, and maybe it's not his, but it's his. a friend This happens when a crew dies or when several soldiers die nearby. We had an explosion of an armored personnel carrier in which there were 10 people. Unfortunately, no one could be identified by their teeth, and a lot of samples were compared for DNA with the sole purpose of burying each one in his own grave.

How -Sovietness- and -Star Wars-: Sergeant -Lucas- about BZVP a quarter of a century ago and today	The sergeant-instructor of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Lukas- shared his experience and thoughts on the training of new recruits from ArmiyaInform. -Lukas- began his military career with his military service in 2000 - he served in the 95th separate airborne assault brigade. After completing the -term-, he signed a contract with the State Border Service, later also worked in a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Despite peacetime, from a review of the specifics of the service, even before 2014, he gained serious combat experience. — in 2014, as part of the unified unit of the Zhytomyr region, he participated in the anti-terrorist operation, working then in the Shchastya district, Stanytsia Luhansk. And in 2017, he transferred to the newly formed 148th Artillery Division to the position of commander of the fire support department, the military man recalls. -Lukas- says that already at that time, the division began to turn to the use of UAVs, formed a platoon of unmanned aerial systems. After leading this unit, the military man of 2019 received training on working with UAVs at one of the training centers. At that time, it was about reconnaissance drones of the -wing- type, while drones of the copter type appeared much later - already after the beginning of a large-scale invasion. — We do not stand still. Even those complexes that have been in service since 2019 are being updated - manufacturers are improving the software, eliminating flaws. Even when we were in the OOS, they came to us on the front line, worked together with us. We took off and they watched, everything is going well, what are the problems in the application of the complex, says the instructor. He is convinced that the experience of using UAVs during the anti-terrorist operation and anti-terrorist operation became an important basis for the widespread use of drones after the beginning of a large-scale invasion: - I think that if there was no experience, it would be much more difficult. Those people who worked on the UAV in 2014-2015 taught us in 2019, and later we passed on our experience to the next ones. — Since 2019, my path as an aerial scout began. In 2021, we entered the zone of the Joint Forces Operation, and a large-scale invasion was met by the crew of reconnaissance UAVs at positions near Shchast. Then they fought for two months in the Severodonetsk region, says -Lukas-. Over time, the military man had to fly both large Ukrainian-made Furia UAVs and small Maviks and Autels. In the Zaporozhye region, he fought as a platoon commander of unmanned aerial systems of the artillery reconnaissance unit. After being wounded, VLK decided to leave the service in the Armed Forces, but decided that his knowledge and experience could be useful to new recruits. He is convinced that this can be done in the best possible way in the 199th educational center of the DSHV, because the most favorable conditions have been created for this. — We try to teach everything we know ourselves, we give more than is required according to the papers. As soon as there is some free time, we try to conduct additional classes. Everyone gives 100%, we pay a lot of attention to fire, tactical, engineering training, we study tactical medicine, says the instructor. Considerable attention is paid to combating enemy UAVs - bombers and kamikazes, because now a lot of enemy -birds- are regularly circling over the combat engagement line. -Lukas- is convinced that it is not enough to theoretically explain to the soldiers what should be done during a meeting with a Russian drone - the soldiers must automatically, without trying, perform the worked-out algorithm: - Everything must be practiced to the point of reflexes. A fighter does not have to stand and remember what he should do, what the instructor told him. He must first do, survive and remain intact, and then in a calm environment to think and understand what and why he did exactly what saved his life. — I have an older son, he is 17 years old. Therefore, recruits who come to us are like children to me. We want to give them everything they need to be able to save their lives during the fight, know and be able to know as much as possible - not only what is written in the program, but also everything that we know ourselves, -Lukas- emphasizes. The instructor is convinced that it is not age that is important in the attitude towards new recruits, but their perception not only as soldiers, but also as people who must not only protect Ukraine, but also return from the war alive. - This is one of the most important, in my opinion, elements of training - we must protect our boys. For this, they should be prepared with the highest possible quality. We are able to do this because all our instructors have combat experience, he assures. For some of the cadets over 40 years old, Lukas says, it can be difficult to get through the purely physical part of the training. Then it is necessary to facilitate something, to simplify the task a little. However, he is sure that the psychological adjustment and motivation of the fighters are more important than physical endurance. — Everything depends on desire, on attentiveness. If a fighter comes and prepares with the right attitude, age will not be an obstacle for him. If there is no mood, then nothing will help a young person, no matter how physically healthy he is, he says. In view of this, one of the tasks of the instructors is the psychological preparation of recruits, the heart of their will. To train a real fighter, the instructor must be not only a deep professional in his field, but also a psychologist and a teacher. Speaking about the changes in the Armed Forces, -Lukas- notes a significant improvement in material support, food, medical drugs, and the availability of the latest Western-made weapons. Comparing military service a quarter of a century ago with training today is like comparing the Soviet Union with Star Wars. — There are many changes for the better. It is enough to look at the provision of military personnel. When I served in 2000, there was almost no such provision. Now, a recruit has everything he needs, and if it's not the most expensive brands, it's still very high-quality, solid,- says the instructor, pointing to the line of cadets who are passing by us. He sees the same positive developments in the plan of training cadets. Now, says -Lukas-, there is no shortage of ammunition or other consumables during training - the fighters have everything they need to get quality training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/yak-radyanshhyna-i-zoryani-vijny-serzhant-lukas-pro-bzvp-chvert-stolittya-tomu-i-sogodni/	2024-12-20T20:25:24-08:00
A fake about Santa Clauses from the TCC in Odesa: the quilters can't take it	First, what are Santa Clauses? This Soviet rudiment has long gone out of fashion. It is attended only by children from particularly wealthy families. Summons should be handed out in the costumes of St. Nicholas - this would be our way! It turned out that, in fact, this video has nothing to do with the work of the territorial picking centers. The recording shows volunteers who were conducting another charity event. Such fakes are used to undermine trust in the TCC and SP, create a negative impression of mobilization, and spread panic among the population. Propagandists often use similar manipulative techniques to distort real events and discredit the Ukrainian authorities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/fejk-pro-didiv-moroziv-z-tczk-v-odesi-vatnykam-ne-jmetsya/	2024-12-20T20:10:23-08:00

He also said that today he listened to the report of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky, about the situation in Donetsk region and the Zaporizhia region. -Special attention is paid to the fighting in Kurshchyna: more and more North Korean soldiers have been killed there. And this shows that Russia is trying to pass off these North Korean soldiers as representatives of national communities living on the territory of Russia itself. This is Moscow's complete contempt for the indigenous peoples and for the Koreans themselves as well,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He reminded that the Russian missile strike in the morning, which resulted in one death, damaged houses, the Church of St. Nicholas, as well as 6 diplomatic missions at once. -Obviously, such Russian madness should not be taken for granted by the world — everyday terror deserves ever-increasing pressure on the terrorist. Russia must answer, and even if they are led by a completely inadequate person, the Russian state, thanks to the pressure on it, must feel what reality is and how reality can punish international criminals. Greater sanctions against Russia are needed,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He thanked all Ukraine's partners, who are responding to this and other Russian attacks by being ready to provide more air defense systems, more weapons that can protect against terrorists. -We have now returned from Brussels with new agreements on air defense. Also, Germany has already handed over an additional IRIS-T system — thank you,- the President said. He also informed about the meeting of the governments of Ukraine and Lithuania. -The new Lithuanian government is in full force in Ukraine for the first time immediately after the appointment, and this is a clear priority of Lithuania for the alliance between our countries; we in Ukraine appreciate it very much,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He announced that he had approved the list of new Ukrainian ambassadors. -I agreed to more than 30 decisions.

They take off and wait - the enemy has developed a special tactic for its fiber-optic drones	The head of the public relations service of the 110th mechanized brigade named after General Khorunzhy told on the ArmyTV stream Mark Bezruchka Major Ivan Sekach. -We missed this moment with optical fiber and, frankly, we don't know how to deal with it,- said Ivan Sekach. According to him, recently our BMP was hit, which was equipped with EW, but it is powerless against optical fiber. The enemy drone was hanging at a height of 2-3 meters and was just waiting for our equipment. The fighters managed to hear him, opened fire, but the drone was on the side of the sun, so they could not hit him. As a result, the BMP was burned together with the electronic bomb. Now the 110th brigade is fighting in the area of ​​Velika Novosilka in the south of Donetsk region. As reported by ArmyInform, the battalion of unmanned systems of the 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka greeted commemorating the Day of the Land Forces of Ukraine by destroying several units of the enemy's light vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/vylitayut-i-chekayut-protyvnyk-rozrobyv-speczialnu-taktyku-dlya-svoyih-droniv-na-optovolokni/	2024-12-20T11:36:17-08:00

He came under fire, fainted, took the prisoner and went out to his people! — the incredible story of...	The post about the fighter was published on December 20 on the brigade channel. -We drive up to the trenches - they start working on us in batches. I jump out of the car and see a flash in front of me, another flash and darkness. Lost consciousness. Came to my senses. A fragment flew into the jaw below the ear and cut the right hand. I look around - but there is no one around. Probably, the Evac didn't notice me in the dark,- -Grandfather- said. According to him, the man had never had such fear. -The point was squeezed in such a way that words cannot convey it. When KABs, hailstones, and tanks are moving, it's all scary, but not so when you're left alone. This is the worst thing that can happen in war. Got to an empty dugout. Found cigarettes and water. Suddenly I hear a voice: -Is there anyone?-. I say: -Yes, yes! In the West!-. And I remove the fuse... And he shouts: -I'm a Russian, I've come from a dealer.- Fuck your mother, I was born in a shirt!-, -Grandpa- still violently experiences those events. It turned out that the Russian was a prisoner. -That's all, I think, Khan - I'll blink for a second and my neck will twist. But he was also wounded and contused. He says they don't have food or water there - he couldn't stand it, he chose captivity. We went to ours. That Muscovite was holding me back a lot - he was walking slowly, he hadn't even heard a scream yet, so he was constantly shouting. I say: -Shut up!-. And I'm thinking - now I'll quietly shoot him and that's it. He seemed to feel it, began to beg: -Don't shoot! I'm begging you, don't shoot.- And I could not It's not so easy to shoot a living person when you see him in front of you, even without a weapon,- -Grandfather- explains. On the way, they were met by an evacuation vehicle. -The doctors immediately recognized me and rushed to the Muscovite. I say that he is a prisoner. So they all went crazy there! It was then that I lost my point&#8230; I thought my heart would jump out. Feeling as if it was all a terrible dream, and now it's some kind of fairy tale. God gave me this chance — and I took it,- Grandfather concludes his extraordinary story.

The prosecutors of the Dergachev district prosecutor's office proved that during the occupation of the village by Russian troops in June 2022, the accused agreed to become the so-called headman. The occupiers presented him as the new -leader- of the village at a -ceremonial event-, after which the man began to perform the functions assigned to him. During the trial, the person involved denied his guilt, saying that he took the position only to help his fellow villagers, and also acted under duress. He claimed that the Russian military beat him and kept him in a pit. However, the court did not take into account these arguments due to lack of evidence. The man was detained by Ukrainian law enforcement officers in October 2022. The investigation of the case was carried out by investigators of the Kharkiv District Police Department No. 2 under the operational support of the SBU Office in the Kharkiv region.

The Central VLK told how many servicemen with limited fitness have already passed the review	He reminded that after the changes in the legislation, the term -limited fitness- no longer exists. And citizens who received this status by February 5, 2025 must undergo a review. This applies to both active servicemen and conscripted citizens. -After making the changes, we worked out a plan within the Armed Forces, counted all these people, distributed them evenly over periods and organized such a review. As of now, among active servicemen, more than 83 percent have already passed this review. We still have December and January. So we have to finish it by February 5,- Dmytro Miroshnychenko emphasized. As for the review of conscripts, i.e. civilians who received the status of -limited suitability- in a certain period, the numbers are somewhat smaller. But this comes with a lot more people to look at. -The number of people there is much larger. They must be reviewed by commissions of TCCs and joint ventures. Given that mobilization does not stop for a single day in our country and the commissions work with those who are mobilizing, the review procedure of limited conscripts is stretched over time. Therefore, the numbers there are somewhat smaller. But the process is ongoing,- noted Dmytro Miroshnychenko. As a reminder, the legislation currently provides for up to 5 statuses: — suitable for military service; — suitable for service in the TCC and SP, higher military educational institutions, logistics units, communications medical units, etc.; — temporarily unfit who need treatment or vacation; — not applicable with revision after 6-12 months; — unfit for military service As reported by ArmyInform, conscripts will be able to receive an electronic referral for passing the VLC through the Reserve+ application without the need to visit territorial recruitment centers.

This is a safeguard that prevents attackers from accessing the information in the application. In the new version, the data has cryptographic encryption, which strengthens the security of the application. Active users who log into Army+ at least once a month do not need to re-authorize. Eventually, the application will also save information for electronic reports, in particular, the Army ID of the commander or the title of the position, so that you do not have to enter them every time when submitting documents. -We received many comments and comments on the need for constant in-app authorization from our users. Thanks to cryptography technology, we have strengthened data security. And we no longer need to require re-authorizations for active users. Digital services from the state should be as convenient as possible,-, said Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization Kateryna Chernogorenko. A new criterion was also added to Army+, according to which the system will automatically check the status of a serviceman and allow entry into the application. This will speed up data processing and reduce the burden on operators. The number of successfully processed authorization requests will now automatically increase. -Make sure your app is version 2.0.5 or higher. Download Army+ only from Play Market and App Store. Links are also available on the official page of the application: https://aplus.mod.gov.ua/- , the Ministry of Defense said in a statement. As reported by ArmyInform, the direction to the VLK will be available through Reserve+.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/v-armiya-dodaly-novyj-metod-zahystu-danyh-i-prybraly-povtorni-avtoryzacziyi/	2024-12-20T08:18:16-08:00

Ruined cities and high tariffs: the new reality of the occupied Luhansk region	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. According to information, in 2025 the occupying -Ministry of Construction and Housing and Communal Services- plans to create a capital repair fund. To do this, they will develop a legal framework and establish a minimum cost of the overhaul tariff. Residents of high-rise buildings will be forced to pay additional funds monthly, which will accumulate in the fund. Only after that, they will consider the possibility of starting repair work. In addition, residents of cities close to the front, such as Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne and Kreminna, continue to be oppressed. According to the decision of the occupation authorities, mobile communications were turned off in these settlements. Residents are forced to travel 30-50 km from their homes to make calls. At the same time, one of the telecommunications operators introduced per-minute pricing, which significantly increases the cost of services. Mobile Internet costs 12 kopecks per megabyte, 1.8 rubles per minute to landline numbers, and 3 rubles to other Russian operators. For example, two or three hours of active use of a smartphone can be much more expensive than the previous subscription fee. The occupation administration continues to create artificial difficulties for the residents of the temporarily occupied territories, depriving them of basic services. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian occupiers began mass demolition high-rise buildings in Siverskodonetsk, which they themselves damaged during the storming of the city in the spring of 2022.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/zrujnovani-mista-i-vysoki-taryfy-nova-realnist-okupovanoyi-luganshhyny/	2024-12-20T07:36:57-08:00

North Korean solitaire: an expert told whether the Kimchens are really so formidable	What threats does it pose? But are the soldiers of this country really as terrible as they are depicted in propaganda? Military expert Petro Chernyk said: &#8220;The defense forces of Ukraine cannot, of course, ignore the 11,000-strong corps (of North Korea - ed.), but along with that, as it turns out, North Korean soldiers can also die. Why is this important? Because Russian propaganda before the introduction of this corps raised the level of tonality to such an extent that, they say, these are some kind of soldiers who don't take a few bullets. If you look carefully at the video, where there is a direct fact of their deaths and injuries - by the way, quite high figures in the range of at least 500 people - then their equipment raises very, very huge doubts. And there is no need to talk about preparation at all. Why? Because the Russians used a classic infantry shaft without providing these units with almost any equipment. Several armored personnel carriers and trucks, as well as buggies, are not considered full support. The general conclusion in the combat component: does not affect this contingent on any very solid combat schedule. However, there is one dangerous thing about this North Korean solitaire. What does it consist of? Sources that I personally trust say that the North Koreans can deliver a whole range of mortars to the battlefield. Let me remind you that North Korea is the largest operator of 60 mm, 82 mm, 120 mm mortars. And they have a rather interesting Chinese development called the Type 63, a caliber of 107 mm: a kind of rocket-propelled volley fire system in a mortar version, which can inflict damage at a range of up to 8.5 km. There are fragmentation projectiles that fragment into more than 1200 fragments. This is quite a dangerous weapon, and if you understand that there are 12 guides, then they can hit, conventionally, an area the size of a football field. Summarizing the military component, I repeat my opinion once again: at this moment, the soldiers of North Korea have not demonstrated any special type of combat and have not become a serious decisive force. True, there is another serious geopolitical cut here. It is truly serious, fundamental and historic. In general - and we do not question this - North Korea has entered into a de facto war with Ukraine. I emphasize, not de jure, but de facto. That is, the so-called tyrannies continue to challenge world democracies, and only our allies can give a full answer to this question. Although my personal point of view: there will not be any global, comprehensive answer yet. The only thing we can count on is an increase in funding and perhaps a slight increase in the flow of weapons, especially in this segment, because it is necessary to respond symmetrically. Our allies also have a whole nomenclature of a wide variety of mortars of various types. The bottom line: It did happen. So, to some extent, the phenomenon that I keep talking about as an expert—the growing potential for our conflict to escalate into a Great World War—has indeed begun. We are still in the conventional October of 1939.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/pivnichno-korejskyj-pasyans-ekspert-rozpoviv-chy-dijsno-kimchenynivczi-taki-grizni/	2024-12-19T21:07:22-08:00

On the F-16 - in Romanian: why training Ukrainian pilots in the east of NATO is beneficial for every...	ArmyInform tells about the context of the creation of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania and its significance for the training of Ukrainian pilots. In Ukraine, the creation and activities of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania are considered mainly in the context of the -F-16 Coalition- - an international association designed to ensure the supply of F-16 fighters to the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the training of pilots, technicians and personnel for maintenance of these aircraft. This is quite justified, because it was the need to help Ukraine repel a large-scale Russian invasion that really played a significant role in the establishment of the training center in Romania. However, the Ukrainian factor became a catalyst rather than the root cause of the establishment of a special training center for the training of F-16 pilots in Eastern Europe. The primary reasons for the creation of the F-16 training center in Romania lie in the need for new users of the -Fighting Falcons- to train their own pilots, technicians and support personnel to maintain these fighters in the face of a significant reduction in training programs by those countries that are switching to the F-35 Lightning II. For example, in August 2022, the Netherlands closed its F-16 pilot training center in Tucson (Arizona, USA). This center, which has existed since the 1980s, has lost its relevance since the Royal Netherlands Air Force retired the F-16 fighters and eventually switched to the F-35. The reduction of training programs for F-16 pilots and technicians in a number of countries of the world coincided with the emergence and growth of demand for the training of these specialists on the part of those states that became users of the -Combat Falcons- relatively recently - first Poland, then Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. After a large-scale attack by the Russian Federation, Ukraine also joined this club of states — new F-16 operators. In the context of repelling Russian aggression, the Ukrainian request for Fighting Falcons and trained pilots and personnel for them opened a window of opportunity for both former and new users of Fighting Falcons. The less prosperous countries of the NATO bloc benefited primarily from the current situation, which were able to take advantage of the context of assistance to Ukraine from the richer states of the North Atlantic Alliance. The opening of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania fits this logic as well as possible. Romania began the transition to the Combat Falcons from the aging MiG-21s in 2016-2017, acquiring 12 modernized F-16AM/BMs from Portugal. In 2020-2021, the Romanians purchased 5 more Portuguese Fighting Falcons, and in 2022 they concluded an agreement to purchase 32 more fighters from Norway. The purchase of so many fighter jets and the associated costs for their basing, maintenance and training of pilots and personnel became a very expensive pleasure for Romania. For example, the value of the agreement concluded in November 2022 for the purchase of Norwegian F-16s amounted to 454 million euros. In this context, basing the European F-16 Training Center on the territory of Romania has become very beneficial for the country. After all, the Netherlands, having taken the initiative /a> created the cell, provided it with its own aircraft and equipment, and ensured the coordination of efforts to support it on the part of all members of the -F-16 Coalition-. The first five Dutch F-16 fighters ->arrived in Romania at the beginning of November 2023. -Together with Denmark and with the support of the United States, the Netherlands is responsible for coordinating European efforts to create an F-16 capability for Ukraine,- the Dutch Ministry of Defense said in a statement on this matter. November 13 the official opening of the European F-16 Training Center at the 86th Air Force Base took place Air Force Lieutenant Gheorghe Mochornice of the Air Force of Romania, located near the town of Fetești in the Borča commune of the Celeraş county in the south of the country. Romanian pilots were the first to start training. The media assumed that the Ukrainians would join the Romanian aviators by the end of 2023, but in practice it happened later. It is officially a fact that Ukrainian pilots are training in Romania z-ministrom-oborony-rumuniyi/->testified the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov based on the results of the telephone conversation with Romanian counterpart Angel Tilvar on September 12, 2024. -The number of F-16s in Ukrainian skies will also increase: a group of our pilots is already undergoing training in Romania,- the head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry noted at the time. Rustem Umyerov thanked his Romanian colleague, the people and the government of his country for supporting and strengthening Ukrainian air defense. Shortly afterwards, at the end of September, the French armed forces notified that the first group of Ukrainian pilots completed training on Alphajet jet training aircraft and will go to training center in Romania to master F-16, since France does not have these aircraft. Therefore, Ukrainian pilots began training at the European F-16 training center from the fall of 2024. Romania is providing a training base, supplies and logistics, the Netherlands is providing aircraft, machinery and equipment, and F-16 manufacturer Lockheed Martin is sending instructors. As reports The Ministry of Defense of Romania, December 12, the Minister of Defense of Romania Angel Tilvar and the Minister of Defense of the Netherlands Ruben Breckelmans signed a Letter of Intent in The Hague, in which the commitment of the two states to strengthening and deepening cooperation within the scope of the European F-16 Training Center was confirmed. Therefore, the opening of the European F-16 Training Center is beneficial to Romania primarily because it allows the country to modernize its own Air Force. For the Netherlands, supporting Romania and Ukraine is strengthening NATO's eastern borders in the face of the Russian threat. How much the Ukrainians benefited from the creation of the European F-16 training center in Romania with the decisive support of the Netherlands is unnecessary to explain. We can only thank the Romanians and the Dutch, because during almost three years of large-scale invasion, these two nations have supported Ukraine most consistently and effectively.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/na-f-16-po-rumunsky-chomu-navchaty-ukrayinskyh-pilotiv-na-shodi-nato-vygidno-vsim/	2024-12-19T20:53:01-08:00
Will fly 10 thousand km: the Hungarians boasted of the development of a giant drone with the abiliti...	As informs the MSN portal, the aircraft is extremely durable, capable of performing a wide range of tasks and boasts an impressive flight range of up to 9,980 kilometers, notes ArmyInform. In turn, the researchers of the defense site Army Recognition, who investigated the drone developed by engineers from Budapest stated that in the background with the rapid development of aeronautics, PHANTOM becomes a stealthy and effective option for complex missions. Designed to push the boundaries of what drones can do, it combines advanced technology and adaptability, setting new standards in aviation, particularly with its range. The technical characteristics of this UAV from the Hungarian UAVIATOR Drones Ltd make it a promising player in the field of drones, capable of meeting a variety of needs, from surveillance to critical logistics missions. With a structural weight of 600 kg, the PHANTOM is designed to carry a significant payload of up to 500 kg. This significant capacity allows for a wide range of operations, from the transportation of specialized equipment to the delivery of essential goods. The total take-off weight of the drone reaches 1,100 kg, which is a testament to its robust construction and optimized design for long-range missions. Its 14-meter wingspan provides excellent stability in flight, ensuring reliable maneuverability even in difficult weather conditions. PHANTOM also stands out for its high-altitude capabilities, reaching a maximum flight height of 6,000 feet. meters At this altitude, it can cover impressive distances with a range of up to 10,000 km, making it suitable for large-scale international operations. A slip ratio of 52:1 provides optimal efficiency, reducing energy consumption and maximizing gliding efficiency. These qualities make the PHANTOM a valuable tool for operations that require both caution and endurance. The introduction of stealth technology further enhances its potential in sensitive environments where avoiding detection is critical. -PHANTOM's ability to blend in with the horizon while remaining undetectable by traditional detection systems provides a strategic advantage for users. For surveillance, reconnaissance or logistical support, PHANTOM provides efficient operations while maintaining a low profile.- — emphasize Hungarian engineers from UAVIATOR Drones Ltd. In addition, PHANTOM is designed with modularity in mind, allowing the configuration to be easily adjusted to meet specific mission requirements. The ability to equip or remove non-essential components makes it an extremely versatile drone suitable for a wide range of operational applications. The integration of LEDs and modular components also supports night missions and low-visibility operations. Presentation of unmanned aerial vehicles from the Hungarian manufacturer Uaviator.

Vampire hexacopter on the front lines: how a fast and long-range heavyweight drone works	ArmyInform learned about this after attending a demonstration and training flight of the heavy night UAV Vampire in the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. The crew of the Vampire aircraft complex consists of three people - the crew commander and at the same time the first pilot, second pilot and engineer. Now they are preparing their rather large nocturnal -bird- for flight. The goal is to practice the mechanics of ammunition drops and demonstrate the capabilities of a powerful UAV. — In combat conditions, we wait for an indication of the target and process the data, that is, we look at the horizon, the wind, how much to fly, how much -batka- we will spend - we take everything into account. Depending on the target, we select the BC to hit it - -shrapnel-, -cumulum- or something needs to be burned, - says the crew commander of the heavy night drone Bohdan with the call sign -Rambo-. The distance to the target, the battery charge (battery), weather conditions, the weight of fragmentation (-fragments-) or cumulative (-cumulus-) ammunition - all this must be carefully taken into account for the effective performance of a combat mission. Only after that, the crew advances to a pre-selected position and begins combat work. The weight of the entire Vampire unmanned aircraft complex is more than 30 kg, and a heavy-duty UAV is capable of lifting a 15-kilogram load into the air. However, these are -passport- data that may vary depending on actual conditions. - In combat conditions, he carries 20 kilograms - and he is fine. The main thing is to take into account the costs of the -batka- so that it is enough depending on the temperature, humidity, and wind. I personally flew 12 kilometers in favorable weather conditions at good altitudes and carried 6 kilograms. We then hit the target, says Rambo. However, he recalls, one of his brothers already managed to break this record - he flew 14 kilometers and successfully bombed and returned. As the crew chief talks, the co-pilot and the engineer secure the munitions, this time two of them: a home-made FAB and a hand grenade equipped with a special release shank. -Now there is a self-made 8.5-kilogram Ukrainian-made FAB and a manual cumulative grenade of 1980 production, which the infantrymen were supposed to throw manually according to the technique,- explains the pilot. Ammunition for drones is made by specialists, they do not do it themselves. But to attach two landing gear of different weight to the UAV, balancing the weight accordingly, is already the task of the engineer and the pilots. — The bird does not like sudden movements, because it all makes the -father- sit down. If you fly such long distances, you must fly very gently, be very careful with it, so as not to waste the -batka- for nothing. And don't spin - it rose and popped at the working height, explains the drone commander. The altitude at which the Vampire operates depends on the terrain and the combat environment. Changing it arbitrarily is not worth it, because it drains the battery and destabilizes the drone once more. — If I am at the top, then in order not to spend the -batka- as much as possible, I will rise to 30 meters and swim at this height. If there are any obstacles or obstacles on the way, or I know that the EW station is standing, then I go up 150 meters and bypass the dangerous area, says -Rambo-. He says that sometimes even enemy snipers hunt for a combat drone. The invaders call the Vampire UAV -Baba Yaga-, -Staraya-, -Kostlyavaya- - that's how scary and deadly it is for the invaders. — The speed of the drone can reach 80 kilometers per hour, if there is no wind. If the wind blows at my back, it will go 100 kilometers or even faster. It is more difficult to fly against the wind, but according to the passport, the drone can overcome the wind at a speed of 12 m/s, and in reality even 15-17 m/s, says the pilot. Today, the combat hexacopter was previously developed as a peaceful agricultural UAV, which was supposed to spray fertilizers or poison against agricultural pests over the fields. Now it has been improved and it destroys the Russian invaders just as effectively. Due to its original purpose, the drone -jumps- a little after the bombing, because while spraying fertilizers, it was released from its weight gradually, and the ammunition is dropped -with a jerk-. However, thanks to the improvements of the engineers, the drone quickly stabilizes. In general, in order to turn a civilian -bird- into a military drone, it had to be significantly improved - more powerful engines were installed, mounts for dropping four ammunitions were installed, and other features were used, which are not worth talking about in general. -Vampires- engineers monitor the progress of the war and constantly improve the drone, says -Rambo- and assures that these changes are quite noticeable in combat conditions. In addition to home-made FABs and grenades, the -Vampire- crew had to drop 16-kilogram 120-caliber mortar mines and install 10-kilogram PTMK and TM-62 anti-tank mines. — We pass in the same way. We bring in anti-tank mines at night and place them on the road. Then enemy equipment comes, runs over and blows up, says -Rambo-. Also, the drone performs logistical tasks, delivering everything necessary to the fighters to the forward positions. — We deliver water, provisions, cartridges, medicines, candies. We drop everything the guys need, says the pilot. While we were talking, the co-pilot and engineer finished preparing the UAV for takeoff and the Vampire was taking off. In a few minutes, the drone moves to a safe distance and the first powerful explosion is heard, followed by the next one. Having completed the task, the hexacopter royally proudly and solemnly returns from a successful mission, and -Rambo- tells that in civilian life he worked as a prospector in a mine and never thought that he would deal with the sky and flights. However, he loves his current job. - You need to carefully prepare BC, love -Vampire-, take care of him - and then everything will work. Because it is very unfortunate when you make an accurate drop - right into the hatch, and there is no explosion. This, unfortunately, happened, says the pilot. He has been working with the Vampire UAV for about a year. During this time, we had to work on the enemy's manpower, shelters, and armored vehicles. At first, 4-5 sorties were made per night, but when the intensity of hostilities increased, the number of combat missions could increase significantly. — The most we made was 35 flights per day. Back in a circle after that, says Rambo. However, the crew survived even this extremely intensive combat work, and the Vampire proved its reliability and efficiency. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/geksakopter-vampire-na-peredovij-yak-praczyuye-shvydkisnyj-i-dalekosyazhnyj-dron-vazhkovagovyk/	2024-12-19T20:25:21-08:00

Despite the narrative of Russian propaganda about the -improvement- brought by the Kremlin to the temporarily occupied territories, the reality in numbers is different. Currently, the budget of localities and regions for TOT is being formed, and the general picture shows a lack of life. 80% of revenues are subsidies from Moscow, in second place is personal income tax (from the salaries of public sector employees, which are also financed by the Kremlin). Thus, we are not talking about business or investment. Everything produced in the regions after their capture by the Russian Federation is propaganda on an industrial scale.

15 years per stream for the enemy: how a traitor with webcams got into the prison air	notifies the Security Service of Ukraine. In order to monitor the locations of Ukrainian vessels, the agent installed several webcams at technological facilities near the local port. These video devices were supposed to capture sea and river traffic in real time with remote access to Russian intelligence. During a special operation in February of this year, the SBU timely detected and deactivated the hidden cameras, and then detained the attacker when he tried to install another video device. During the investigation, it became known that an additional task of the Russian agent was to identify ground facilities of the Defense Forces, in particular, military hospitals, training centers and checkpoints. According to the investigation, the attacker turned out to be an electrician from a local port company, who was recruited remotely by the occupiers at the end of 2023. He came to the attention of the occupiers due to his activity in the pro-Kremlin Telegram channels, where he approved the armed aggression of the Russian Federation. After the recruitment, the agent communicated with his Russian supervisor through an anonymous chat on the popular instant messenger. During the search, a mobile phone with evidence of his communication with the aggressor was seized from the detainee. Tools for mounting video cameras and their boxes were also found in the suspect's possession. According to the materials of the Security Service, the court found the intruder guilty of ch. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law).

Corresponding changes to Resolution No. 1291, initiated by the Ministry of Defense, were approved at the Government meeting. From now on, when changing the place of service, the military position will not be indicated in the transfer order. Only his name, rank, part number and tax payer card number will be shown. The designation of the position itself allowed military units to create obstacles to transfer in individual cases. For example, a serviceman was transferred to another position within the unit. This made it possible to refuse to change the place of service, since the positions in the order and the staff list did not match. The resolution adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers will change this. Also, this resolution ensures a more accurate distribution of powers in the process of preparation and signing of transfer documents. -We are gradually improving the process of changing the place of service. Initially, this service was launched in Armiya+, which removed several bureaucratic obstacles. Further, we continue to improve it and pay attention to all the details that can be manipulated and not to the benefit of the defender,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization. According to her, the Ministry of Defense strives for the service of the Ukrainian military to be effective and not held back by artificial restrictions.

Corporate bankruptcies await Russia	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In 2025, they may cover more than 12% of companies, which will account for about 20% of revenue. The problems will mostly concern the spheres of transport, communication, construction, coal industry and trade. In addition, the high rate has already exceeded the profitability of working capital, which makes it difficult to attract investments and leads to the reduction of development programs even in state monopolies. Further growth of the discount rate also increases the probability of a crisis in the banking sector. This is caused by such factors as: The probable bankruptcy of companies that generate almost a fifth of the income of the Russian Federation will have a significant negative impact on the economic stability of Russia. Among the consequences of a long-term increase in the accounting rate is a decrease in production capacity, an increase in unemployment, and a decrease in tax revenues. This will lead to a chain reaction that will intensify the economic crisis in the Russian Federation. We remind you, GUR published the losses of mobilized Russians according to the occupiers' calculations since September 2022.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/19/rf-ochikuyut-korporatyvni-bankrutstva/	2024-12-19T04:37:53-08:00

About the turn of the war at sea, new corvettes and the elite club of missile manufacturers. Intervi...	The war at sea has now reached a completely new level, and this is exactly what the Commander of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, told in an interview with ArmyInform. - How it was possible to deprive Russia of dominance in the Black Sea for 2022 - 2024? - In general, this is a fruitful work of all the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The first such successful experience was the use of the Neptune missile complex. And later, during a joint operation of the Navy and the SBU, we used kamikaze naval drones that entered the Sevastopol Bay. At the time, it was a sensation, because no one had done this before. It is interesting that on October 29, 1914, even at the same time, the so-called -Sevastopol Awakening- was taking place, when Turkish ships approached the city and attacked it with ship guns&#8230; A century has passed, and we attacked the enemy in our Sevastopol with naval drones. In addition, it is worth highlighting the strikes of our Air Force with missiles from partners -Storm Shadow- and -Scalp-. This is quite fruitful, multi-stage cooperation with the involvement of absolutely all Defense Forces of Ukraine, which made it possible to first deprive the ships of the Russian fleet of the opportunity to operate in the western part of the Black Sea, and then we forced them to withdraw from the bays of occupied Sevastopol to Novorossiysk. We also made the Sea of ​​Azov dangerous for maneuvers. — How do naval drones affect the course of war now? Will modern technologies allow us to change tactics? — Maritime drones are a revolutionary path, but not a panacea for war at sea. Of course, they are a danger to the enemy, but they are also preparing something similar to strike at us. The enemy already has some developments, but as the war continues, we are also improving our technology. Of course, it was the creation and use of naval drones that changed the course of the war, because even now they are not just kamikaze drones, they are real platforms for other drones or types of weapons. - How does the modification of the Neptune missile complex take place? - We have entered the elite club that produces cruise missiles. After we sunk -Moscow-, the Navy of the Armed Forces even won the championship in this club. I head the state commission for accepting these missiles. In fact, all modifications take place in front of my eyes. We are working diligently and are in constant contact with the Hero of Ukraine Oleg Korostelev, who is constantly inventing new modifications that will increase the missile's range and improve accuracy. Unfortunately, I cannot reveal all the secrets and new characteristics, because this may play into the hands of the enemy, but I can definitely assure you that the Neptunes of 2022 and 2024 are already different missiles. - Can we involve partners from NATO countries in the future for demining the waters of the Black Sea? - In general, we approach this issue very gradually. The first stage is demining without the involvement of partners. The second is to build up mine countermeasures capabilities with the help of partners. Yes, in 2023 we were given two mine countermeasures ships (Great Britain), in 2025 we will receive three more ships (two from the Netherlands and one from Belgium) and three boats. Then, at the end of 2025, we will have a full division of 5 battleships and three boats, which are completely renovated, equipped with modern anti-mine systems, with a trained crew, but the most important thing is that we will have a headquarters, because arms and legs do not work without a head. This is one of the directions we are currently taking in the conduct of hostilities. Of course, complete demining is possible only in peacetime, because now we search for mines, including -drifting- ones, and carry out demining under the enemy's sight. As for our partners, the NATO countries that have access to the Black Sea, which are Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, have created a tripartite Mine Action Task Force, which began its operations focusing on -drifting- mines in the waters of these countries. We have common views, and with their help we can do it even faster. I personally met with the naval commanders of these countries, and we discussed the direction we should move. Of course, partners can help to conduct a large-scale demining operation, and then demining will be faster, but if we have all these means, then we ourselves demine the Ukrainian waters of the Black Sea, just not as fast. —How is the training of mine countermeasures experts carried out?—Currently, the main training takes place abroad in Great Britain, Denmark, and Germany. Our divers, specialists without crewed anti-mine systems, crews of ships that will be handed over to us already next year are trained there. Our mine countermeasures ships -Cherkasy- and -Chernigiv-, their crews have completed a full training course. Next year, they will undergo a full evaluation according to NATO standards and will be able to conduct searches not only for demining the Black Sea, but also as part of NATO mine countermeasures naval tactical groups. This is quite a serious step that we are taking for our future, because we have to become members of NATO. The training of ship crews for future actions is carried out with the help of partners both in training centers and on ships of NATO countries. Rehearsing of joint actions together with the ships of partner countries and certification of our ships according to NATO standards takes place at the -Sea Vreeze- exercises. These are Ukrainian-American studies, they are open to other countries. Due to the full-scale aggression of Russia, these exercises are being held for the second year in a row not in Ukrainian waters, but in the waters of Great Britain, Romania and Bulgaria. — What is the role and place of application of ADA type corvettes in the system of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? — We started this project back in 2021 by the decision of the President of Ukraine. Our first corvette -Ivan Mazepa- is currently undergoing trials and will soon be included in the composition of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the second - -Ivan Vyhovskyi- - was launched this year. As I said earlier, not all problems can be solved by maritime drones alone, even air defense issues. To protect civilian ships at sea following sea routes far from the coast, you need to have a fairly powerful air defense system, and it is very large and heavy. Our corvettes are already equipped with powerful weapons for reconnaissance and air defense. These ships also have missile strike weapons, which will be used at a long distance to strike coastal targets. In addition, we are considering corvettes for participation in NATO and EU operations (missions), because the Armed Forces Navy must contribute to international security not only in the Black Sea, but also, for example, in the Mediterranean. Our ships will be involved in NATO's maritime tactical groups. In addition, corvettes are platforms for unmanned and unmanned systems, they are equipped with torpedoes, as you can already understand, they have a lot of functions and purposes, which is why they are called multi-purpose. Today, there is a trend in absolutely all navies of the world to create such corvettes that will be equipped with such powerful weapons. - Ensuring the operation of the -sea grain corridor- is one of the key tasks of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. What can you tell us about it? - One of the key moments for the opening of the sea corridor, which provides civil shipping, was the sinking of -Moscow- and the liberation of Zmiiny Island. In August 2023, we opened an alternative grain corridor without the Russian side, because before that the so-called -Grain Agreement- was in effect with the participation of the UN, Turkey and Russia. Colossal work was then carried out on demining organized corridors, formation of convoys and their support. We started then with one such a day, and now we have them functioning both during the day and at night. Civil shipping is extremely important, because it is our economy and geopolitics. There are many countries that primarily need wheat, so it is hard work around the clock for our sailors, UAV pilots, scouts and divers. It should be taken into account that the territory may be mined, hostile DRG groups may make attempts, so this is all a big job. Moreover, the enemy uses new technologies during the installation of mine barriers, and we are actively fighting this. We managed to destroy more than 1,000 mines and ensure, from August 2023 to today, the passage of more than six thousand civilian ships through the combat zone to the ports of -Great Odesa- and vice versa, which made it possible to export more than 82 million different cargoes to 45 countries of the world. And we are talking about the fact that this is not all our capabilities yet, because we are only moving further. The adversary also understood that he was losing his possible dividends, and just then, in the summer of 2023, he increased the number of missile strikes and kamikaze drone strikes specifically on the port infrastructure, but we coped with it. — How can you comment on strengthening the capabilities of the national fleet at the expense of international military and technical assistance from partner countries, namely in terms of ship and boat crews, naval aviation, marine infantry units and coastal missile artillery units? — If we talk now, for example, about the marines, then we used to have two full-fledged brigades. We have now tripled that number. The guys showed themselves in battles in absolutely all directions: Eastern, Northern, Southern, and now even in Kurshchyna they continue to repel the enemy. Our marines have more than 20,000 destroyed Russian soldiers, more than 400 tanks, 900 artillery systems and more than 1,500 destroyed vehicles. Also, Navy fighters from air defense units and mobile fire groups destroyed several warehouses with Shaheds. In total, they have more than 400 destroyed aircraft: they are Shaheds, cruise missiles, and even airplanes. Our pilots were the first to use -Bayraktar- against surface targets, and even successfully destroyed a helicopter that had just landed on Zmiiny Island. When the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi was still in the position of the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces, he proposed to create a river flotilla, because such support from the river was necessary, and therefore it was implemented. Thanks to our partners, we already have two divisions of modern boats, which are equipped with appropriate weapons and are actively used on the Dnipro River and other areas. —How did the naval coalition affect the development of the Armed Forces Navy?—In general, the Naval Capabilities Coalition was created on December 11 a year ago on the initiative of Great Britain, Norway and, of course, Ukraine. Currently, the Coalition, together with Ukraine, includes 19 countries. The maritime coalition is actually one of the largest in terms of the number of participating countries and areas of effort. We are waiting for other countries to join us, because, as I emphasized earlier, the sea is economics and geopolitics, and everyone is interested in being a part of such a great moment. During this period, we managed to fully form a river flotilla, equip it with ships, we received Sea King helicopters, we are increasing our anti-mine, amphibious capabilities, we are working on marine equipment and watercraft. The coalition is working very well according to the working map, I cannot tell you the details. It is worth understanding that a fleet requires a lot of money and time, because a good ship is built from 2 to 5 years, and then another year is needed for the crew to acquire capabilities. Therefore, in order to have a powerful and strong fleet in 2035, we must build ships today, as well as platforms and other activities. We are conducting three key phases and are emphasizing priority needs: EW and EPP, firepower, intelligence, marine weapons, and aviation. Partners also understand the importance of providing us with the necessary equipment on time, and I am personally impressed by the systematicity of our coalition's work. —Recently, gas production platforms near Crimea, where the occupiers installed surveillance systems, were struck. How long has this operation been planned? - This is not a one-day operation, and it will be extended. We cannot allow the enemy to have awareness at sea, we cannot allow our civilian or military ships to be followed, and we cannot understand the situation at all. We work on those towers not only with our naval drones, but also with other types of weapons. We know that the enemy has left special forces there, but they are limited logistically, so they only have air support with the involvement of helicopters. We will continue to work on such towers. - Will the destruction of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation make it possible to de-occupy Crimea and the south of Ukraine in general? - The destruction of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, if we talk about complete destruction, will be a strategic blow to Russia and will really have huge consequences for the war. The events that the whole world has now observed in Syria prove that the enemy will behave as cautiously as possible, because the fleet that they drove to Novorossiysk actually remained the only base closest to the Mediterranean Sea. Especially since they are constantly expecting us to hit. - Can we talk to you about anti-aircraft defense? - It is worth noting right away that it is controlled by the ground commander. Yes, we saw with the naked eye Russian ships near Odessa, but then we did not have the kind of weapons we have today. The amphibious landing was possible only under the condition that the enemy passed Voznesensk and entered the Odesa-Kyiv route. In fact, then Odesa would be semi-encircled and it would be possible to land an amphibious assault from the sea. The 80th DSHV brigade did not allow passage to Voznesensk, and other units, together with the marines, were ready to act in case of need. In general, the enemy tried to conduct only demonstrative actions such as: -We will land now-, but this was impossible to implement. Moreover, our -Neptunes- and, in the future, other striking means were ready to hit enemy ships. That is, no commander will send people if he understands that they are far from our coast, and a cruise missile is already coming at them, that's why they retreated.

Tactics -small infantry corps- and assault tanks: the CEO of the company - an FPV pilot told about t...	ArmyInform asked Roman about how the crew of FPV drones manages to extinguish small assault groups of Russians in the Pokrovsky direction, how many enemy military targets are destroyed by our defenders in one day of combat duty, what is the most difficult thing in the work of operators, and why did the general director of a large company become a simple FPV pilot? -The shift starts early in the morning. At night, we go to positions, change guys, debrief and set tasks, and then there is heavy, as we call it, operational work. The crew arranges a workplace underground, because the Russians spare neither effort nor means to find and destroy our pilots. Ideally, reconnaissance of the front edge of the enemy is first carried out, the locations of enemy forces and assets are determined. Coordinates of priority targets are transmitted. We are FPV drone pilots, fast combat missions. The objectives are different: they are manpower, dugouts, some shelters, weapons and military equipment. In short, we destroy everything we see. Our job is simple - kill the invaders, do everything to make them less. We work day and night mainly at a distance of up to 5-6 km deep into the enemy's battle formations. We can fly up to 20 km, depending on the technical components of the drones. Usually we use fragmentation projectiles for enemy manpower, and high-explosive drops for other purposes. Everything depends on the combat mission and the characteristics of the targets to be hit. The drone can carry up to 3.5 kg of explosives, and a heavier warhead has also been attached. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Rashists use the tactics of -small infantry corps-. The novel tells: Russian attack aircraft come in small groups of 5-6 people, try to advance on our positions, make landings, probe for weak spots in the defense, but suffer losses. We eliminate them, of course, this does not stop the enemy, he then sends the next assault group, which already attacks the bodies of -his comrades-. Photo: Natalia Kravchuk / ArmiyaInform In some places, katsaps come forward to attack on armored vehicles, but recently they use motorcycles, buggies, and even some self-propelled wheelbarrows. Here they concentrate groups of 10-12 people. Enemy EW that the enemy installs on their vehicles almost always works, but we try to quickly change frequencies and inflict fire damage. the Rashists have set up the work of trench EWs quite effectively and it is not always possible to hit the targets. But we are working. I will say this from my own experience: now in some places we even use the frequencies on which all drones flew a year ago. Then the enemy began to actively press them, which forced the FPV crews to switch to other frequencies. What is interesting: we have less losses from controlling drones on those, let's say, -ancient- frequencies than the rest. They may have been forgotten, but this is a fact. What is the logic of the Rashists? First come those who are not sorry. Next, the more professional military of the Russian Federation, who are supposed to gain a foothold in the locality, are pulled over the corpses. There were days when the -meat attacks- of the Russians continued without stopping. And we simply did not have time to destroy them all. The crews of FPV drones of the unmanned systems battalion -Predators of Heights- of the 59th brigade destroy more than 100 occupants in just one day of work in the designated area of ​​responsibility in the Pokrovsky direction. And this is confirmed data. We eliminate more than half of the rashes immediately, the rest are serious injuries. the Russians do not spare their own, no one takes the wounded from the battlefield. Plus about 15-20 more occupiers, whom we cannot clearly establish: whether they were killed or wounded. Because among the racist corpses it is generally difficult to determine what is wrong with them there. One solid flesh and torn bodies all around. And there is no time to do it. There are many tasks, because small infantry groups are still climbing. That's right, we work in this mode. To say that we are tired is to say nothing. If you count the losses of the Russians for a week, then the enemy loses an entire battalion-tactical group only in our area of ​​work. Is it a lot? I think so. We work for three or four days on combat duty, then we are replaced. A great desire to learn is required. And constant training. Not everyone is good at flying FPV right away. You have to learn to be an integral part of the team: look for targets, record hits and help the operator navigate in space. But the most important thing is the experience of piloting and hitting targets. It is difficult to control the drone in bad weather conditions, such as rain or snow. Electronics can fail. I will be 50 in half a year. I remember: 6 people were selected for drone piloting courses. Only two people successfully completed the training and received certificates. The key is practice, you need to keep practicing FPV control. Thoroughly know the technical component, be able to repair drones as needed. Where you need to rearrange the details yourself. Sometimes the drones that come to us require inspection, they are not always 100% technically sound. Again, all the information you need is on the Internet, everything is available. Another very important point is a normal working atmosphere in the team. The crew consists of a pilot, a gunner and an engineer who prepares the warhead and loads the drones with ammunition. Roman is a successful businessman from Odesa region. General director of one of the leading companies supplying agricultural machinery to Ukraine. His company delivered agricultural machinery and precision farming equipment from the USA, Canada, and France to Ukrainian farmers. Both for small companies and for holdings that are among the top 5 leading agricultural companies of our country. -When Russia launched a large-scale offensive against Ukraine, I realized that I had to go to the army and defend our country with weapons in my hands. But before going to the army, it was necessary to implement and successfully close all multimillion-dollar contracts with our partners and legally fulfill all obligations. I will tell you a story. Night of February 24, 2022. Belarusian-Ukrainian border in Chernihiv Oblast. Columns of Russian equipment are already there and are invading the territory of Ukraine. And we have $4 million worth of foreign equipment under contract. I still don't understand how, but we managed to deliver this equipment to Lithuania, and then, of course, to Ukraine. At first, I wanted to join a tank unit with my friend, who was the first from our company to be mobilized. But they were all over the state at that time. Then he got to know the guys from the 59th brigade. I say: -I want to see you.- They told me: -not yet, wait, we will call you. And for now, help the units of the brigade financially.- And then, after some time, it was already in 2023, I received a call: -we are creating a new battalion, we will fight on UAVs, come!- Next moved on to FPV. My motivation is simple: I must go to defend my country, my home, my family. And to destroy the Russians who came to kill Ukrainians. Russia purposefully wants to destroy the Ukrainian people. Not to capture any economic or human resources, but rather to destroy Ukrainians as a people or to make as many people as possible leave the territory of Ukraine. That's why I'm here in the Armed Forces, everything is simple!-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/19/taktyka-malyh-pihotnyh-trupiv-ta-shturmovi-tachanky-gendyrektor-kompaniyi-pilot-fpv-rozpoviv-pro-taktyku-voroga/	2024-12-18T20:44:06-08:00
-Tomahawks- came in handy again: the US army introduced a new surface-to-surface missile system	According to the message, the text of which is posted on the defense portal Army Recognition, this advanced surface-to-surface missile system boasts a maximum firing range of 1,500 km, which attracted considerable interest from industry leaders, defense officials and international delegations who wanted to learn more about its complex capabilities, ArmyInform notes. The MRC consists of launchers, missiles, and a battery operations center designed to counter ground-based threats. It is part of a major modernization priority for the U.S. military to develop and deploy new long-range precision fire capabilities. -Our collaboration with the U.S. military has given us a deeper understanding of its most critical needs,- said Joe DePietro, general manager and vice president of Lockheed Martin. -This partnership has allowed us to leverage technologies across our ships, launchers and combat systems programs to design, develop, integrate and rapidly deliver a solution that meets the Army's requirements. We have created new opportunities through the integration of existing and newly created technologies so that our fighters are ready at the front for any challenge.- The Medium Range Weapon System (MRC), or Typhon Weapon System, is aimed at enhancing the US Army's precision strike capability at a medium range of approximately 500 to 1,500 km. km As part of the US military's modernization drive, the MRC system serves to counter a range of critical threats, including enemy naval ships, air defenses, and land targets. Bridging the gap between shorter-range missile systems and long-range hypersonic assets, the MRC provides flexible and effective options for deterring enemy forces in a variety of scenarios. Its key objectives are deterrence and defense, operational flexibility and increased strike accuracy, enabling the Army to respond to new threats in complex, contested environments. The MRC system has a number of advanced features and combat capabilities. Her two main missiles, the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM), provide significant versatility. The SM-6 offers multi-role capabilities, engaging both air and surface targets, making it suitable for air defense and anti-ship roles. Anti-aircraft, cruise and ballistic missile capabilities enhance the combat capabilities of the United States' Joint Air and Missile Defense Forces. In turn, the Tomahawk missiles, optimized for long-range precision strikes, allow the MRC to target critical land-based targets, such as command centers and critical infrastructure. In addition, the system supports rapid redeployment and strike flexibility, allowing it to adapt to different scenarios on the battlefield, including access-locked environments and restricted areas (A2/AD). Designed for mobility and adaptability, the MRC battery includes multiple launchers, a battery control center (BCC), prime movers and modified trailers. The TSR acts as a command center, coordinating the engagement of targets and controlling the launch process. Each launcher is configured to carry and deploy a combination of SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles, maximizing the battery's strike capabilities. The system's modular structure facilitates integration into existing army units, increasing the interoperability of joint forces and allowing them to coordinate with other large-scale assets. As informed the experts of the IKK Defense Express portal, work on this system started in 2019 immediately after its release Russian Federation under the agreement of the CISG. In 2023, the SM-6 anti-aircraft missile was first launched from the Typhon launcher, and later the Tomahawk cruise missile. Lockheed Martin has showcased the MRC system as a promising future asset for European armed forces, highlighting its potential to support NATO's integrated deterrence strategies and enhance the capabilities of partner nations. As adversaries increasingly advance access prevention and restricted area (A2/AD) strategies, the MRC offers a critical solution that enables allied forces to deliver precise, powerful strikes while remaining adaptable to new threats. The MRC system is one element of the U.S. Army's broader effort to modernize its artillery and missile forces, meeting the needs of various capabilities to keep pace with new threats. Lockheed Martin's partnership with the US Army reflects a commitment to expanding long-range precision fire and medium-range strike capabilities, consistent with a broader vision of multi-domain military operations where joint forces are coordinated on land, sea and in the air.

Discrediting Ukraine in the West with the help of AI: how the Kremlin is fighting for the minds of t...	The researchers found that several videos were actually voiced by real people. This was determined by a noticeable Russian accent. The -Agency of Social Design- - a Russian structure under US sanctions - is behind the organization of the campaign. ArmiyaInform has already mentioned her more than once. Yes, in the summer of last year during a similar campaign of the ASP prepared a series of provocative materials which, according to the authors' intention, had transfer responsibility for undermining the Kakhovskaya HPP dam to Ukraine and create the preconditions for a political crisis. And in September, the current media received leak of internal documents of ASP with information about almost 40,000 units of fake content. The target audience of these materials is citizens of Ukraine's partner countries, but its activities are mainly focused on the information field of four countries: Germany, France, the USA, and Israel. In a video presentation of ASP, which reached journalists as part of a September leak and was apparently not public, they include among their assets: After a thorough description of the disinformation -achievements- of ASP, a voiceover says: -The battlefield is the minds of the inhabitants of planet Earth.- So Russia has long been openly waging war against the entire civilized world, or even the entire planet. This war has many fronts. One of them is informative.

According to the case file, the cleric justified the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine and incited religious hatred. As the investigation established, during sermons and communication with the faithful, the archpriest praised Putin and heroized the occupation groups of Russia. Also, the person involved tried to justify the war crimes of the Rashists, including the Russian shelling of the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine. Separately, the cleric imposed his own intolerance towards representatives of other faiths on parishioners and incited religious enmity. SBU employees documented the crimes of the person involved. The forensic-linguistic examination initiated by the Security Service confirmed the facts of information-subversive activities of the archpriest in favor of the Russian Federation. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the suspect of suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The investigation is ongoing to establish all the circumstances of the crime.

The energy crisis in occupied Abkhazia is a direct consequence of the rule of the Russian peace	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Currently, electricity is supplied to the population and state institutions only for three hours during daylight hours. Under these circumstances, the majority of educational and medical institutions do not function. The official explanation for the shortage of electricity is a significant drop in the water level in the reservoir of the Ingur HPP. However, the real reason is the destructive influence of Russia, which stopped subsidies to Abkhazia. The goal is to demonstrate to the local population and -political elites- the complete economic dependence of the quasi-formation on the Russian Federation. We will remind that on September 1, Russia partially stopped subsidies to the region (including subsidies for energy resources) due to Sukhumi's failure to fulfill its obligations under -intergovernmental- agreements. At the same time, on December 3, under pressure from the public and the opposition, the -parliament- of Abkhazia refused to ratify the investment agreement with the Russian Federation, which caused a complete halt in Moscow's financing and its coverage of the electricity deficit in the region. In this way, the Kremlin creates the conditions for the guaranteed election of the most loyal candidate to Moscow during the early -presidential elections- scheduled for February 15, 2025. The search for a compromise solution with the Russian Federation is significantly complicated by the different positions of the parties. Abkhazia believes that Russia is obliged to ensure the proper level of the socio-economic situation in the region in order to preserve the political autonomy of Sukhumi. In contrast, the Kremlin believes that Abkhazia must unconditionally agree to any terms of economic cooperation, even those that completely ignore the interests of local residents. The collapse of the economy and infrastructure, energy crises, political instability and the impoverishment of the population are the direct consequences of the rule of the -Russian peace- not only in Abkhazia, but also in all territories temporarily occupied by Russia. Abkhazia is a vivid example of what any territory in which the -Russian measure- will be established will be. We remind you that the Russian shadow fleet at sea is equal to an ecological disaster.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/energetychna-kryza-v-okupovanij-abhaziyi-pryami-naslidky-panuvannya-ruskogo-mira/	2024-12-18T10:41:10-08:00

-The way- to Poland for money: a man from Volhynia was exposed who turned dodgers into truck drivers	The Special Prosecutor's Office of the Western Region informs about this on December 18. According to the investigation, a 38-year-old man from Volyn was looking for -clients- through a multi-platform messenger and promised to help him legally leave for Poland through a checkpoint in the Lviv Region for money. It was established that at first the shipper received the necessary documents from conscripts, and later ensured that information about them was entered into the -Shlyah- system. -Based on this, they could leave the country freely during the war as truck drivers. The suspect estimated such services at 15,000 euros and 2,000 US dollars per person,- the report said.

Swept away with a bad broom: an expert on the unique successes of the Defense Forces in the Black Se...	Why did this happen? Military expert Petro Chernyk said: -Ukraine actually achieved several very important results. Here I must emphasize that we, a state that does not have a full-fledged navy, were able to achieve parity with the Russian Federation, and in some cases even prevail. The first moment: the northern part of the Black Sea water area - to be more precise, the northwestern part - was able to be closed with the help of missile superiority. First of all, I have in mind the Ukrainian R-360 Neptune complexes and the wonderful American Harpoon missile. Our complexes have a strike range of up to 300 km, Harpoon is also somewhere within the limits of 300 km. And it is one of the most massive and successful American missiles of this type. Let me remind you that it was with the help of R-360 Neptune missiles, as well as very cool American targeting, that in April 2022 we managed to sink the enemy flagship, the Moscow cruiser. This is a unique phenomenon from a historical point of view. Nothing like this had happened since World War II, when the Japanese super-heavy battleship Yamato was sunk, as well as the German super-heavy battleship Tirpitz. This is a truly historic combat success. Next moment. As of this minute, we have managed to damage and destroy up to 28 surface ships. Landing class ships are especially valuable. Why? Crimea is a peninsula, it needs endless support, the bridge itself and the railway thread are not enough, especially since the bridge will be destroyed sooner or later. And the fact that out of 15 ships of this type 10 were damaged or sunk is a colossal success. I must remind you that the Russian Federation is unable to build ships of this type any more. The next big success was that we managed to expel the fleet of the Russian Federation from Crimea. How has this goal been achieved? First and foremost is also rocket parity. There is confirmed information that Storm Shadow/SCALP EG cruise missiles have hit their targets in the bays, especially in the south. And such a unique phenomenon as the destruction of an underwater diesel-electric boat of the -Varshavyanka- class took place. Let me remind you that Crimea is 250 km from north to south, 300 km from east to west. And the Storm Shadow/SCALP EG missile in the best configuration has a range of up to 500 km. That's why we have such a really, really serious success. The next point is the application of our unmanned systems such as Magura 5 and Sea Baby. At most, even large-caliber machine guns of 12.7 caliber were able to be integrated into these systems. There is confirmed information that it was even possible to damage enemy helicopters that went hunting for these means. Why is it a great success that we expelled almost the entire naval flotilla of the Russian Federation from Crimea? Only Crimea had all the necessary equipment to load the Kalibr missile onto a carrier. It is actually a very complex technological procedure to load these rockets. These are special cranes and special equipment. Only in Crimea were they of sufficient quality. At the new base, which is in Abkhazia and Novorossiysk, this equipment is not of such high quality and good quality. At the same time, the enemy should not be underestimated. The Russians still have up to 20 Kalibr cruise missile carriers in service. Let me remind you that the range of their strikes is about two and a half thousand kilometers. There is a so-called Volgodon Basin in the Russian Federation. That is, between the Sea of ​​Azov and the Caspian Sea there is a network of channels through which these relatively small vessels can move, and they can and will strike from the Caspian Sea. So, let's summarize. the Russian Federation, which had a very powerful fleet, seven military bases, one of them in Syria, 89 ships is a lot. In less than three years, it loses a third of its potential. And this really speaks of two things: about the highly intelligent organization of a battle at sea by a country that does not have a full-fledged fleet. I mean us, Ukrainians. And it will continue. We understand that the Russians can no longer deliver really heavy frigate-type ships to the Black Sea. Why? The Montreux Doctrine of 1936, signed in Switzerland as a result of the First World War, where all the players in the world at the time agreed that if any hostilities began in the Black Sea, Turkey would close the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. So, in the future, the Russian fleet is doomed. Well, if not to complete destruction, but to its significant reduction. I have no doubt that in the next ten years the Russian Federation will completely lose its status as a dominant party in the Black Sea. Turkey is already intercepting it. We understand that sooner or later we will have to rebuild our fleet. The good news is that we have ordered at least two Ada-type corvettes from Turkey. And one of them is undergoing technical tests at sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/pognaly-poganym-vinykom-ekspert-pro-unikalni-uspihy-syl-oborony-u-chornomu-mori/	2024-12-17T21:03:39-08:00
Vacation or money: who will receive compensation for -unused- days	Do these vacation days -burn-, says ArmyInform. Unused vacation days of military personnel do not disappear anywhere. Yes, it will not work to walk them in the next year. But they can be used upon dismissal from service, or receive compensation for them. This is provided for by the Law of Ukraine -About social and legal protection of servicemen and members of their families-, as well as Order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs No. 260 -About approval of the Procedure for payment of monetary support to servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and some other persons-. In particular, servicemen who are released from military service, at their request, are granted leave with the following exclusion from the personnel lists of the military unit for a duration determined in proportion to the time served in the year of release for each full month of service. A cash allowance is paid during such leave. Or servicemen upon dismissal can receive compensation for all unused days of annual basic leave, as well as days of additional leave, including for previous years. The calculation of monetary support or compensation for all unused vacation days is carried out on the basis of official salary, salary according to military rank, seniority allowance and monthly additional types of monetary support, taking into account the change in years of service and the norms of monetary support that the serviceman received at his last full-time position. At the same time, the one-day amount of cash support is determined by dividing the monthly amount of cash support by 30 calendar days. An important point - compensation can be provided for unused days not only of annual basic leave, but also additional. These include, for example, leave of up to 14 days for combatants. It is not provided during martial law, but compensation can be obtained for it. Upon dismissal, a report must be submitted to the commander of the military unit with a request to compensate for unused vacation days. The report must state the reason and date of dismissal, the number of days of unused additional leave and the law providing for such compensation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/vidpustka-chy-groshi-hto-otrymaye-kompensacziyu-za-nevykorystani-dni/	2024-12-17T20:52:30-08:00
Survive yourself - and save a friend: at Interflex in Britain they teach takmed	Instructors bring the cadets' skills to automaticity, sparing no effort and consumables, because their lives depend on how well a fighter masters the algorithm of helping himself or a wounded comrade. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform tells about how Ukrainian military personnel are trained in tactical medicine during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Late evening of another hard long day. After long trainings, we were lined up for the final task. We are standing in front of a hangar capable of accommodating the An-225 -Mriya-. The main gate is now closed, so the instructors enter and exit through a door almost invisible against the background of the huge structure. Inside, something is happening - plumes of smoke are coming out of the ajar doors and cracks under the gates, the muffled sounds of explosions and the ringing -gunfire- can be heard. It is clear that this is an audio recording played through powerful speakers, but the feeling is still unpleasant - it seems that a real battle is going on somewhere nearby. Our task is to provide first aid to the wounded under conditions simulating combat. To do this, you need to find a fighter in the hangar who needs help, find out what kind of injury he has and work out according to a well-learned algorithm. We were intensively taught what and how to do it for several days beforehand. At first, classes were held in classrooms and on training grounds in the camp, then in field conditions in the middle of the forest. During this time, we all helped ourselves and our brothers several times - learned the algorithm and practiced applying tourniquets and bandages. Under calm conditions, each of us will confidently perform the MARСH algorithm without getting confused in the sequence of actions, because the number and duration of training were more than sufficient to bring our actions to automaticity. However, what seems simple in a bright, quiet, comfortable training hall becomes much more difficult in the midst of danger, dirt, and the roar of battle. Already during field training, we were able to feel how difficult it is to work out the usual aid algorithm in conditions when it is necessary to evacuate a wounded person from under conventional fire in the -red- zone. In real combat, it will be even more difficult to do this, so with each subsequent training, the instructors try to bring us as close as possible to real combat conditions. Training in the hangar is another stage on this path of increasing the complexity of tasks. We know that there is a mock battle going on outside the door and there are wounded people, but other than that we don't know anything. From a calm line-up, we will be thrown into the thick of hostilities and it will be necessary to orient ourselves on the spot, what and how to do. The first unit has already started training and we are watching closely as the instructors briefly instruct each fighter before literally throwing them inside the building. The instructor is particularly emotional, and she clearly determines which of the fighters catches the gaw and pulls him out of line. Receiving an assignment is even more unexpected for such a cadet than for others, so when our unit starts training, we try not to lose our vigilance, carefully follow the queue and maintain eye contact. I am the weak link - it was enough to be distracted for a hundredth of a second and the instructor pulled me out. The briefing is short and clear: a group of fighters has been covered by -arty-, there are dead and wounded. I need to get to them as soon as possible under fire in an unfamiliar area, find the 300th, give him first aid and prepare for evacuation. I listen not to the translator, but to the instructor - this always gives me a few seconds head start. -Are you ready? Are you ready? Go, go, go!- she shouts, grabs me by my shoulders and literally throws me into the hangar. It is dark, noisy and stuffy behind the door - the sounds of explosions and gunshots are much louder than outside, and it becomes noticeably harder to breathe in the smoke. The next ten minutes pass like a moment - everything has to be done so quickly that only after the fact you realize what and how it happened. I act instinctively and automatically - exactly as I was taught during previous classes and training. The most difficult part of the task turns out to be to get to the wounded man - more than a quarter of the hangar has to be crawled in a narrow tunnel, constantly encountering some obstacles. Then, through piles of construction debris and branches, I finally get to a tentative position and start looking for the -wounded-. The search takes several seconds - in the darkness, among a pile of dirty rags, I notice the outline of a human body, which is barely perceptibly moving. Artificial blood from the -torn off- hand splashes into the face, thickly filling the glasses, so you have to apply the tourniquet and work out the entire MARCH algorithm almost by touch. I note with horror that the -wounded- person really does not have an arm - an artificial bone and pieces of meat have been fitted to a real giggle. I shout to the wounded man, he answers something indecipherably in English so that I can only hear: -Hand, hand!- However, I have already noticed the detached arm and applied a tourniquet - we must move on. At some point, when it comes to the thermal blanket, the instructor stops me and talks to the -injured-. It turns out that he was not yelling about my arm, but hers - I tightened the tourniquet too much and he asked me to loosen it. The instructor checks and removes the tourniquet - this completes the training. We go out into the fresh air and I listen to comments and wishes for improvement. Two main points - I did not use disposable medical gloves and applied my own tourniquet instead of finding a -casualty- tourniquet. -He was bleeding, and I didn't see anything, so I had to do as it turned out,- I briefly explain the reasons for the mistakes. -Well done, 'in real life' he would have survived,- she says and puts me back in position to rest while the other cadets continue their training. The comrades are joking about how the instructor once again slipped out of the outfit of the next biggest gap. After training, we are approached by a man who played the role of a wounded man. It turns out that he is a professional actor who lost his limbs in a car accident. Now he joined the Interflex training mission as a volunteer to help the Ukrainian military. The man emphasizes that he is proud of us and that he can help Ukrainians prepare for the defense of their native country and repel Russian aggression. He says that we did a good job and jokes that he felt on his own body that we take training very seriously. The instructors also praise us, but note that in the following days, intensive training with takmed will continue, because only practice is the key to perfection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/sam-vyzhyvaj-i-tovarysha-vyruchaj-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi-vchat-takmedu/	2024-12-17T20:33:08-08:00
German songbirds in the sky of Ukraine: which reconnaissance drones are transferred to the Defense F...	As stated in the official release, posted on the portal of the German government, similar UAVs were previously included in the list of weapons supplied to the Defense Forces, ArmiyaInform reports. In total, Germandrones, a manufacturer of unmanned aerial systems with headquarters in Berlin, has developed three versions of the Songbird drone: Songbird 60, Songbird 100 and Songbird 150. The Songbird system (-Singing bird- - Ukrainian. - Ed.) is the result of years of testing and improvement from German engineers and designers. The combination of the advantages of traditional aircraft and multi-rotor drones creates a new class of unmanned aerial vehicles with advanced capabilities. Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) eliminates the need for a runway while retaining all the advantages of a fixed-wing aircraft (high speed, long range). Songbird's modular concept allows for versatile use of the various cameras and sensors installed on it. Specialists of the Defense Industry Portal Europe believes that the Songbird 150 model offers the best performance among versions of the entire Germandrones family of aircraft. Specifically, it can carry a maximum payload of 4.4 kg. The range of these drones is up to 110 km. The Songbird 150 can reach an altitude of 5,000 m. meters Thanks to its high aerodynamic properties and uncompromising lightweight design, Songbird achieves a flight time of up to two hours, which is approximately twice as long as similar systems. Depending on the payload, one flight can fly up to 25 km². The designers installed a highly developed autopilot in the drone with the possibility of programming for fully automatic takeoff and landing. This program allows you to use Songbird with just one operator, and no lengthy pilot training is required. Together with the significant flight time and tool-free assembly of the UAV, this ensures a high return on investment. A large payload allows the use of very powerful batteries, multiple cameras or highly specialized sensors such as LIDAR scanners or real-time mapping devices. The maximum allowable take-off weight remains less than 10 kg. Songbird has been tested in extreme climates - from the African desert to the tropical jungle - and can operate in winds of up to 19 m/s, as well as in extreme heat, cold or light rain. The UAV is equipped with a 20x zoom video camera and a 2x zoom thermal imager. Video communication with the ground station is carried out in LTE/5G standards within a radius of up to 10 kilometers. In the absence of communication, Songbird stores the collected information on the built-in media. The device is transported in a strong aluminum box. The time of assembly and preparation for work is no more than 10 minutes. Authors of the profile portal for UAV specialists DroneXL note that the supply of Songbird unmanned aerial vehicles to Ukraine by Germany shows a strong commitment to maintaining its security and sovereignty. By strengthening Ukraine's intelligence capabilities, Germany is contributing to a strategic advantage that could become key to the current challenges the country faces. -This cooperation between nations underscores the importance of technological progress in modern warfare and defense strategies. As Ukraine integrates these high-tech drones into its military operations, this marks a significant step in the direction of preserving its territorial integrity and protecting its citizens,- Hay Kestelo, editor-in-chief and founder of the DroneXL website, emphasized in his article. The Songbird family of drones from Germandrones has been certified for quality and suitability according to DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 international standards. Songbird drone capabilities presentation.

Fake pages and disposable phones: fraudsters prey on relatives of prisoners of war and missing perso...	informs about this Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. Relatives of prisoners of war and missing persons are of increased interest to fraudsters, criminals and enemy special services. Criminals take advantage of the vulnerable emotional state of these persons, manipulate their desire to get at least some information about their loved one and return them home. Fraudsters are trying to establish contact with relatives of Ukrainian servicemen who were captured or are considered missing, and to seize their funds. Often, Ukrainians unknowingly help fraudsters and turn them on themselves by posting information about their relatives and requests for help on social networks. This provides fraudsters with initial information about the missing person and the relative's contact information. The victim can be contacted both directly on the social network where the ad is posted, and by phone or via messenger. Fraudsters create fake pages in social networks and use -disposable- numbers. Offer of a -list for exchange- service. Fraudsters contact relatives of captives and offer assistance in speeding up the process of releasing the person from captivity. Relatives of a missing serviceman may be told that he is in captivity. Fraudsters can pose as representatives of official structures (SBU, GUR, counterintelligence, etc.) or as persons with connections in these structures. The victim can be shown a list from the -database- of persons who are allegedly planned to be exchanged in the near future. And offer to include their relative in this list. For this -service-, fraudsters ask to transfer funds to a private or even -official- bank account. After receiving money, fraudsters usually stop contacting the victim. However, relapses are also possible: an attempt to re-take possession of the funds of the defrauded person with the assurance that -this time everything will definitely work out-, or the -explanation- that -tariffs have increased-. Scheme -your relative is in hospital.- Fraudsters have adapted the old scheme -your relative is in need- to the realities of wartime. It applies mainly to people who have posted an ad about the disappearance of a missing relative. The fraudster makes contact and claims that this person is in some remote hospital or hospital after a serious injury and urgently needs funds for his treatment. The attacker can pretend to be a fellow soldier (especially if the unit is listed in the ad), a volunteer or just an acquaintance, a doctor, etc. During the contact, the fraudster puts pressure on the victim, claiming that a person's life literally depends on the urgent transfer of funds, without giving time for additional verification of information. Extortion of non-existent debts. Criminals call relatives of a serviceman, usually his wife or mother, and demand the return of some debt, intimidate and threaten. Other members of the criminal group, who may pose as comrades in arms, offer to help -solve the matter.- Getting access to a bank account. Another old scam used on military relatives. Under various pretexts, fraudsters try to obtain the number and CVV code of the card to which payments are received. Or gain access to the Internet banking account by issuing a virtual duplicate of the victim's SIM card. For this, they can ask to turn off the phone for some time so that the real card is not online. Having gained access to the account, fraudsters withdraw funds from it. The Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War takes care of assistance to relatives of prisoners, missing military personnel and civilians. You can contact the Coordination Headquarters in Kyiv directly (in particular, the hotline 0 800 300 529), and consultative centers in Kharkiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv, and Vinnytsia. Employees of the Coordination Headquarters provide relatives of captured and missing persons with detailed instructions on all necessary actions. The road map of actions in case your relative disappeared or was captured is published on the official website of the Coordination Headquarters. It is also worth remembering that: According to the materials of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/fejkovi-storinky-i-odnorazovi-telefony-shahrayi-polyuyut-na-rodychiv-vijskovopolonenyh-i-znyklyh-bezvisty/	2024-12-17T20:08:07-08:00

After tanks-sheds, buggies-doghouses - the Russian engineering genius continues to amaze	Sergeant Oleksiy Godzenko, the head of the media group of the 413th battalion of unmanned systems -Raid- told on the ArmyTV stream. -The enemy constantly uses buggies to transport infantry to the assault. And it is clear from these vehicles that the Russians are trying to cover them with something, they are making some strange boxes with hooks for drones. Spoiler alert, none of this helps much. We can conclude that they probably don't use it because of a good life. I hope that this is an indicator that the Russians do not have enough armor,- said Oleksiy Godzenko. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 413th battalion of unmanned systems -Raid- of the SBS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine showed footage of the destruction by missiles of the command post of the Russians on on the eastern outskirts of the village of Maryine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/pislya-tankiv-sarayiv-baggi-sobachi-budy-rosijskyj-inzhenernyj-genij-prodovzhuye-dyvuvaty/	2024-12-17T11:35:37-08:00
In 2024, the occupiers removed more than 350,000 tons of cargo from Mariupol	This is notified Mariupol City Council. According to preliminary information, it is known that more than 350 thousand tons of various types of goods have been exported from Mariupol since the beginning of the current year. Earlier, the Russian occupiers started the operation of the cargo sorting and transshipment station, as well as restored the large railway scales. This allows you to increase the pace and additionally transfer resources through the seaport. -Mariupol is strategically important for the Russian invaders. Invaders actively use the seaport to take away the loot and supply the military needs of their army. In addition, the port has already started loading sea bulkers with dual purpose cargo. All this shows that the occupiers are increasing the use of the port for transportation, including materials necessary for the needs of the front,- said Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko. We remind you, in Mariupol, the occupiers will launch a propaganda center. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/za-2024-rik-okupanty-vyvezly-ponad-350-tysyach-tonn-vantazhiv-z-mariupolya/	2024-12-17T11:32:40-08:00
Uninterrupted supply of Ukrainian soldiers with drones is one of the priorities of the Ministry of D...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced this on December 17. According to the agency, the work on contracting the supply of drones for the following months and years continues in parallel.

This was stated the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Vadym Skibitsky during the conference -European Defense Industry: Prospects of cooperation with the Ukrainian defense industry-, which was organized by the analytical center We Build Ukraine. -The first step that must be taken is the strengthening of international sanctions. And we can see how the flow of relevant components to the Russian Federation is decreasing. The so-called secondary sanctions are also hitting the Russian Federation very hard,- said Vadym Skibitsky. He explained that secondary sanctions target supplies through third countries, companies and other indirect supply schemes that Russia uses to obtain foreign parts for weapons production. Vadym Skibitsky also noted that many enterprises of the military industrial complex of the aggressor were subjected to -kinetic and non-kinetic- influence. -This is also the cyber sphere, this is the information sphere, etc. Without influence, it is impossible to stop production,- noted the representative of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Obstructing the supply of manufactured weapons directly to the Russian occupying forces also remains an important area of ​​work.

Twelve friends of Putin — a group of F-16 hunters was exposed	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on December 17. Military counterintelligence of the Security Service neutralized a large-scale agent network of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (known as the game). Criminals spied on the Defense Forces in five regions of Ukraine at once. As a result of the special operation, 12 Russian agents and their informants were exposed. Some of them are deserters who voluntarily left units of the Armed Forces, and when they were hiding from justice, they were recruited by the Russian special service. The members of the enemy cell acted separately from each other and focused on the resident (head) of the agent group, who was in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. He used fake -cover documents- such as fake -volunteer ID- and -anti-corruption activist- for the conspiracy. To cooperate with the aggressor, he involved accomplices from Zaporizhzhia, as well as Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, and Odesa regions. In these regions, the perpetrators scouted the firing positions of Ukrainian air defense, tried to identify the locations of secret military airfields where, according to the Rashists, F-16 aircraft could be based. A separate task of the enemy agents was to establish the addresses of companies involved in the production of means of radio-electronic warfare against Russian drones. In order to obtain intelligence, those involved -undercover- used their acquaintances, in particular, Ukrainian military personnel who were in the front-line regions of Ukraine. In the case of receiving preliminary information, agents went to the area to conduct reconnaissance near potential targets. At first, the members of the agent group -reported- to the resident, and then he passed the information on to his Russian curator. Military counter-intelligence of the Security Service exposed the entire enemy cell in advance, detained its organizer and four key accomplices. During the searches, mobile phones, flash drives, military documents and fake identity cards were seized from them. The SBU investigators informed the detainees of the suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: — ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law); — ch. 2 Art. 114-2 (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces).

The amount for drones this year will exceed UAH 100 billion: the Ministry of Defense has allocated a...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. It is noted that 55% of the amount is for Mavic-type drones, in particular with night vision. 18% of the amount will go towards the purchase of FPV-kamikaze. In addition, significant amounts of funding are allocated for the purchase of reconnaissance UAVs, bombers and sets of spare parts for them. Thus, in the shortest possible time, the mandate of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov was implemented, which will allow to provide military formations with an additional volume of UAVs through decentralized procurement. A clear advantage of this decision is that the brigades independently purchase what they need to perform combat tasks. Drones will immediately be directed to the front. In general, this year the amount spent on drones by the Ministry of Defense will cross the mark of UAH 100 billion, which is an important component of strengthening the technological capacity of the Armed Forces. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense codified and approved for use in the Defense Forces the new UAV SOVA 10 of Ukrainian production.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/suma-na-drony-czogo-roku-peretne-100-mlrd-grn-minoborony-vydilylo-dodatkovi-koshty/	2024-12-16T23:21:25-08:00

Strong Twardy nuts from Poland: how -Caesar-, -Foreman- and -just Vanya- destroy the enemy in Donets...	ArmiyaInform told ArmyInform about training and an armored combat vehicle from Poland, the tasks of each crew member and the power of the 125 caliber, the role of tanks in modern warfare, the greatest dangers and protection against them. Intensive training on modernized PT-91 Twardy tanks in Poland is remembered with gratitude by fellow crew members. They say that they taught conscientiously, trying to prepare Ukrainian tankers as well as possible for real combat operations. — The Poles tried very hard to explain and teach us everything. They are great guys, to be honest. They wanted to explain to us in a human way - so that it was both elementary and understandable. Not for the proforma, not to hand in the papers, but precisely so that we can then actually fight on this tank, says the commander of the -Foreman- tank. However, he immediately adds, then he had to learn a lot on his own, because in a few weeks of study in Poland, you can manage to master only the minimally necessary basic knowledge. Tankers acquired real skills already in Ukraine, including during intensive combat operations in Zaporizhzhia. Tankers also speak positively about their combat vehicle, a modification of the tank based on the T-72M1 improved by the Poles. Her engine is powerful and reliable, her defenses are improved and strengthened, and her fire control system and sights allow for extremely accurate fire. — The car itself, if in good condition, is very nice. If good equipment is well repaired, it will show itself well. If there is something wrong with it, then it is not a technique anymore. It can only stand for repairs and nothing more. The car must be ready to leave, everything must work perfectly, -Caesar- emphasizes. Tankers explain that it is especially dangerous to detect a malfunction already during a battle. They recall a case when they came up close to the enemy - at a distance of about 100 meters - and after the first shot they had to quickly retreat, because the armored car broke down. This should not happen, they emphasize. As we speak, several mechanics are inspecting, testing and repairing the Twardy. In a few minutes, they start the powerful engine of the armored car - the environment is filled with a loud growl. The task of their team is to ensure what the commander talks about - the full serviceability and reliable reliability of the tank in battle. — If something doesn't work even a little bit, that's it. When we went to battle with the overhaul, it was the best. Then, confident in the car, you leave and don't worry that something might break in your car. You're not afraid that something might get stuck somewhere in you, - the gunner -Foreman- picks up the commander's words. In difficult situations, the tankers are saved by the coordinated work of the team, first of all, the least talkative member of the crew - Mechvod Ivan, who is called -just Vanya- by his comrades without a call sign. It is he who is responsible for the speed and maneuverability of the battleship and, ultimately, for the safety of the crew. — Everything depends on the driver. Maneuverability must be at a height so that he can quickly bring you in and then take you out even faster when we roll away. Therefore, a serviceable car and a good mechanic are the foundation, more than half of the task depends on them, the tank commander emphasizes. Mehvod Ivan modestly smiles and notes that his job is simple - to follow the road and react to the situation, to follow the commander's orders. However, he immediately adds that in a combat environment, one also has to make decisions independently, without waiting for a direct order. -If the commander is busy, then you yourself decide where and how to maneuver, where to go,- he says. - Then you choose the path yourself and react to the situation, because there is no time to wait for orders - you need to make decisions yourself. The gunner continues that his task is to be able to feel the maneuvers of the combat vehicle and take it into account when firing. He emphasizes that shooting from a tank while moving requires completely different skills and abilities than when shooting from stationary closed positions. - You need to feel the car - when it is moving, you need to turn the turret and catch the sight on the move, take prejudices, take into account the movement. When I hear that he (nods at the mechvod Ivan) is turning, I immediately take it into account when aiming, explains the gunner -Foreman-. The tank commander smiles and says that with experienced comrades, his tasks are the easiest - to give instructions to whom and what to do. And if the crew is experienced, then this is not necessary either - they will do everything themselves. However, all jokes aside, the role of the commander is important in battle, because thanks to the information from the headquarters and what he sees with his own eyes, he is the one who best navigates the combat situation and makes the most well-considered decision. — You talk to your crew and keep in touch with headquarters. They correct us from the -bird's eye-, but they can't see everything that we see from above, so we have to decide for ourselves how to carry out the order. For example, they cannot see from above that there are bushes in front of the tank, but we take this into account and act at our own discretion, - explains -Caesar-. Speaking about the effectiveness of tanks in modern warfare, fighters speak highly of the combat qualities of powerful tanks and the tasks they are capable of performing. Enemy armored vehicles, accumulations of infantry and enemy shelters - everything that can be reached by the direct fire of the -long arm- of the tank gun is guaranteed to be destroyed. — 125 caliber can do serious wonders with direct aim. Imagine that the tank is 300, 200 meters away from the enemy shelter and -dismantles- it - how will the enemy feel? The tank is a terrible machine and it will do a job that no one else can do - neither mortars nor artillery, says the commander of -Tvardogo-. He explains that the kinetic energy of an armor-piercing cartridge alone is enough to completely destroy the enemy's position in any structure in which he tried to entrench himself. Enemy infantrymen are destroyed by the very fragments of the walls, which fly in all directions after being hit by a tank shell. Realizing the danger of tanks, the Russians are intensively hunting Ukrainian armored fortresses on tracks. Tankers consider FPV drones, the Lancet barrage munition and the Kornet anti-tank missile to be the most dangerous threats. Anti-tank mines are also dangerous. In addition to the PT-91 Twardy's composite armor and explosive dynamic protection, EW and protective shields help defend against these threats. They appeared, the tankers recall, at about the same time. Back in the summer of 2023, there were no REBs or protective screens on the tanks, but already about a year ago, in the fall - at the beginning of winter, they began to spread more and more. At first, screens were self-made, later also factory ones appeared. Now every tank is protected by them, because they have proven their high efficiency, saving the lives of Ukrainian tankers many times. Thanks to these innovations and improvements, the already strong Twardy nut from Poland has become even harder. And the combat crew of the tank - -Caesar-, -Foreman- and -just Vanya- - pose an even greater danger to the enemy thanks to the experience gained in previous battles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/miczni-gorishky-twardy-z-polshhi-yak-czezar-prorab-ta-prosto-vanya-nyshhat-voroga-na-donechchyni/	2024-12-16T21:02:08-08:00
At first glance - a business jet: the US Army will acquire a high-tech spy plane	As informs the defense portal Army Recognition, the US Department of Defense (DoD) has released a new image of the ATHENA army platform (ATHEN - Ukrainian), an advanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, which is closely related to the capabilities of a modern reconnaissance aircraft, ArmiyaInform notes. Experts of the publication say that it is a modified Bombardier Global 6500 jet equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, which underlines the army's transition to advanced ISR technology based on jet-powered aircraft. The U.S. Army's ATHENA A-ISR reconnaissance aircraft is designed to perform stealthy multi-domain reconnaissance missions across large operational areas, strengthening the Army's strategic and tactical advantage through real-time data collection and improved situational awareness. Aviationist website TheAviationist said that in December 2023 the Pentagon signed a contract with Bombardier for the first Global 6500, which will become the HADES prototype, with options delivery of two more boards of this model. It is planned to create an air fleet of 14 aircraft, which should replace the entire fleet of manned ISR aircraft of the previous generation in the US Army. A-ISR stands for Air Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. The term refers to military operations and technologies that use aerial vehicles such as drones, helicopters, or airplanes to gather information about enemy troop movements, terrain, and other operational data from the air. The ATHENA aircraft is to be equipped with state-of-the-art technology designed for both tactical and strategic missions, providing the Army with an important intelligence advantage. Among its extensive mission capabilities, ATHENA stands out for its high-resolution imaging capability, using advanced optical and infrared cameras to capture detailed images from high altitudes. This capability is necessary for monitoring large areas, identifying enemy formations, and tracking movement in difficult terrain. In addition to image processing, ATHENA will be able to boast powerful signals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities. Sensors installed on the aircraft will be able to intercept and analyze electronic communications and signals emitted by the devices of a potential adversary, which allows finding, identifying and characterizing these signals for threat assessment and support in electronic warfare. The ATHENA platform should also include sophisticated electronic warfare (EW) systems that can disrupt, confuse or disable enemy communications and radar systems, thereby providing tactical support to US forces on the ground and in the air. In addition, ATHENA's high-altitude capabilities will facilitate large-scale observations over large operational areas in a single mission. Thanks to the increased endurance and range, the aircraft will be able to stay in the air for a long time, which makes it very effective for missions that require constant surveillance. ATHENA's main goal is to replace aging ISR rotorcraft with faster and more efficient jet platforms capable of operational deployment around the world within 24 hours. With improved speed, range and altitude, ATHENA will be able to operate above enemy air defenses, increasing survivability while providing constant reconnaissance coverage. The program unites the future army fleet of aircraft of the program HADES (High Precision Detection and Exploitation System), a planned ISR platform expected to be operational by 2035. The data collected by ATHENA will play an important role in the HADES program, enabling the next generation of ISR aircraft to meet the operational requirements of today's multi-domain conflicts. The Pentagon has already made significant progress on the ATHENA project this year, awarding contracts to defense firms such as MAG Aerospace, L3Harris and Sierra Nevada Corporation. Each contractor is working on specialized versions of ATHENA aircraft, ranging from operational platforms to research-oriented variants designed to test sensor performance and mission adaptability. As the US Army modernizes its ISR capabilities, the ATHENA aircraft offers a sophisticated solution to meet growing intelligence requirements. With rapid deployment capabilities, advanced sensing technology, and high-altitude operational advantages, ATHENA is poised to provide information dominance for the Army in current and future theaters of operations.

How to defeat the enemy at sea: the expert talked about the new Maritime Security Strategy	What is its uniqueness, how its implementation will contribute to the strengthening of the naval capabilities of Ukraine in the Azov-Black Sea region in the confrontation with the Russian Federation, and what will the national fleet look like in the medium term, a military expert, a retired captain of the 1st rank, told in an interview with ArmiyaInform. candidate of military sciences, associate professor Stepan Yakymyak. - Is such a strategy timely, or is it worth it was to focus efforts on its finalization right now? After all, work on it began even before the full-scale military invasion of the Russian Federation, right? What is the relevance of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine, its necessity at the present time? — Do we now need -some kind of strategy on paper-, if every second it is necessary to make situational decisions, strike at the enemy and withdraw our forces from under attack? Such a pessimistic thesis, I think, could be heard from anyone today, taking into account the situation in the war. Maybe this Strategy is really out of date? There is an unequivocal answer to this or similar questions: yes, it is necessary! After all, the actual presence of strategies is the key to victory, because in any struggle there must be clearly formulated goals and tasks that must be achieved. Only then is it possible to allocate available resources in time and space rationally, judiciously and reasonably. In the conditions of the war, in particular, as a result of the enemy's capture of Crimea, parts of other coastal regions, the loss of socio-economic facilities and Ukraine's access to the Sea of ​​Azov, issues of maritime security have become critical. After all, this is a loss of economic and other resources. They significantly reduce the opportunities of the Ukrainian nation and its descendants in the future. Therefore, at sea, Ukraine is fighting for the return of maritime spaces. There have been great successes, but the matter is not over yet: Crimea, the Ukrainian part of the Azov and Black Seas, and the adjacent coastal parts of the territory of Ukraine have not been liberated. — If we are talking about the national security of Ukraine at sea, how can we characterize its state today? — Everyone knows that, despite forcing the enemy’s forces to withdraw to the eastern part of the Black Sea, significant -gray areas- remain area of ​​the national maritime space of Ukraine in the Azov-Black Sea region. These water areas, which cover the uncontrolled part of the territorial sea, internal sea waters and the exclusive economic zone of Ukraine in the Black Sea and Ukrainian internal waters of the Sea of ​​Azov, total more than 123,000 sq.km or about 96.9% of their total volume of over 127,000 sq. km And this is only a one-sided and formal quantitative assessment of the state of security of our main national interests at sea. Therefore, the emergence of this Strategy is more relevant than ever. — What is the uniqueness of the new Ukrainian Strategy? — The fact is that a similar strategy, which defines the goals and objectives of ensuring national security at sea (maritime security), is far from available in every leading maritime country in the world. First developed in 2021, it was adopted in February 2022. But the start of a full-scale military invasion delayed its implementation for more than two years. The maritime security strategy of Ukraine is the latest and unique in its construction and development approaches. It can be classified as one of the best global standards, because the latest similar strategic documents of the world's leading states were used during its creation. For example, during the development of the Strategy, the National Maritime Security Strategy of Great Britain 2022, the National Maritime Security Strategy of Spain 2013, the Strategic Concept of Maritime Security of the Republic of Poland were studied. strong> of 2017 and others. The use of the best foreign models ensured a high level of quality of the Ukrainian Strategy. The uniqueness of the Strategy is also due to the fact that it was developed and implemented for the first time in the world in the conditions when the state is at war. On the one hand, it is not easy to develop a strategic document during permanent, 24/7 attacks by the enemy. On the other hand, its appearance takes into account the military experience that Ukraine has accumulated online during the war. It should also be noted that the Strategy is a medium-term planning document, so it takes into account not only current dangers and threats, primarily the danger of Ukraine's independence from the Russian Federation, but also other threats, including terrorism, piracy, illegal arms trade and migration, environmental threats and other. It is clear that at the present time these threats do not have priority relevance. — What should be understood by the maritime security of the state and what is the purpose of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine? — A correct understanding of the subject of the Strategy is conditioned by a clear definition of the main concepts. The concept of maritime security of Ukraine refers to the protection of Ukraine's national interests at sea from existing and potential threats. In the conditions of the war, as a result of the actions of the enemy, in addition, there was a danger of the independence of Ukraine. That is, we need to use the term -danger-, including at sea, in relation to the loss of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Based on an overview of the fierce nature of the confrontation in the Russian war against Ukraine and its possible consequences, the main goals of ensuring maritime security in the Strategy include the de-occupation of temporarily occupied areas of the territorial sea, internal sea waters, the exclusive (maritime) economic zone, the continental shelf of Ukraine, as well as the provision of state sovereignty, sovereign and other rights in the maritime spaces of Ukraine. In addition, the Strategy defines other goals, the achievement of which ensures the development of Ukraine's capabilities. It is very valuable that the Strategy provides for the possibility of evaluating the effectiveness of its implementation. Although a generalized indicator for assessing the state of maritime security of the state is not given, it is noted that there are -quantitative (indicative) and qualitative indicators- provided for in the plan of measures for the implementation of the Strategy. Also, for independent experts, unfortunately, it remained unknown which indicators will be used to assess the operational capabilities of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. After all, it is these capabilities that should guarantee Ukraine's victory at sea at the present time. In order to coordinate actions and efforts in achieving the goals and fulfilling the tasks provided for in the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine, in November 2024, by order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, a consultative and advisory body was created - an interdepartmental working group, and the provisions on it and its composition were approved. - I wonder what the main figures are in the action plan for the implementation of the Maritime Security Strategy? In your opinion, to what extent will they contribute to strengthening security and winning the war? - Given that success or failure on each day of the war can be decisive, strategy in war, especially at sea, must focus on measures and actions in the short term. Of course, both medium-term and long-term measures should be planned and implemented. However, what are the main measures envisaged in the Plan to complete their implementation already in 2024 and 2025? Among the measures envisaged in the Strategy implementation plan, the following are the most important: to ensure the Defense Forces' need for Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles with the creation of appropriate military, operational and strategic stocks; adopt high-speed patrol boats with striking capabilities into the Navy; conclude agreements with leading Western manufacturers and ensure joint production of sea unmanned and sea unmanned aircraft complexes of various purposes in accordance with identified needs. As we can see, the developers of the Strategy implementation plan relied on the experience of already conducted military operations at sea. It was realized and analyzed the superiority of Ukraine over the enemy thanks to the latest models of missile weapons, which include the Neptune missile complex, and maritime robotic systems, namely unmanned surface and unmanned aerial systems. Therefore, in the Strategy implementation plan, emphasis is placed on their development. Also during this period, it is planned to: increase the capabilities of the defense-industrial complex of Ukraine in the production of products to cover the needs of the Security and Defense Forces in naval weapons; implementation of measures provided for by the State Targeted Defense Program on the creation of a state integrated information system for covering the surface and underwater situation in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas and the basins of the Dnipro and Danube rivers, in particular, to deploy and ensure the sustainable functioning of the relevant information system on the basis of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . Important measures should also include: holding consultations with the EU and NATO and making decisions regarding the earliest possible initiation of joint or coordinated security missions (sea patrols) in the Azov-Black Sea basin. During the period from 2024 to 2026, the plan envisages the implementation of the following main measures: signing a contract and starting the construction of two more corvettes for the Navy, probably referring to the ships of the Turkish Ada project and their acceptance into the Navy by 2030; implementation of 100% of the planned activities of the project -Building up the naval capabilities of Ukraine, sufficient to ensure the defense of the sea coast and the protection of national interests in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas and the Dnipro River-; implementation of the maritime situational awareness (MSA) system in the Navy and Maritime Guard of the State Border Service, as well as the exchange of relevant data with NATO. In the same period, the following is planned: the development and adoption of a draft law on the territorial sea of ​​Ukraine in the Sea of ​​Azov, the Kerch Strait and the northeastern part of the Black Sea, as well as the approval of a plan of measures for the demarcation of maritime spaces in the Black and Azov Seas and the Kerch Strait from the Russian Federation in accordance with norms of international law; concluding new agreements on cooperation in the field of security with the countries that joined the Joint Declaration on Support for Ukraine of July 12, 2023. in the city Vilnius, as well as the introduction of an initiative together with the leadership of the interested states to ensure the security of the Azov-Black Sea and Mediterranean regions, in particular the safety of navigation, the formation of the international platform -Safe Black Sea-. — And what, in your opinion, are the most important mid-term planning measures, i.e. for the period up to 2030, defined in the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine? Maritime Guard of the State Border Service within the framework of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. It is about the acquisition of capabilities by the Naval Forces in accordance with the future structure - Future Navy - 2035. Resolution of the issue of the construction in cooperation with Denmark of four multi-functional patrol ships of the MRPV type for the Navy and one for the maritime search - rescue service of the Ministry of Infrastructure. By 2028, it is planned to achieve the compatibility of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service with the naval forces and coast guard units of NATO and EU member states, ensuring readiness for joint use as part of international formations, species, interspecies and interagency groups. These measures will be carried out in accordance with the list of requirements for the interoperability of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, considered during the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council of the NATO Summit in Washington. It is also envisaged to bring anti-ship capabilities into compliance with NATO standards, as well as the ability of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service to act in conditions of high-intensity operations, the implementation of cooperation in the joint management of integrated anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. Also, during this period, it is planned to conclude international agreements on the temporary international military (naval) presence of NATO member states on the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (after its de-occupation), demining the waters of the Black and Azov seas, internal waters of Ukraine with the assistance and participation of the countries -partners, NATO and the EU, to take measures to ensure environmental security, ensure development of the defense-industrial complex, in particular the shipbuilding industry, the development of the system of waterways and the creation and functioning of the Center for Situational Awareness on Inland Waterways. Ensuring Ukraine's permanent presence in international institutions on issues of maritime security and activities at sea and on international rivers will also be an important measure. The set of tasks to create a multi-level system of professional military education in accordance with NATO standards, the best domestic and foreign practices, and our own experience of conducting combat operations will be large in scope in the medium term. Thus, cooperation will be organized with numerous NATO centers of excellence dealing with issues of maritime security and maritime operations. The training of personnel of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service will also be expanded on the territory of European countries under the auspices of the European Union Assistance Mission to Ukraine. At the same time, by 2028, it is planned to complete the creation of the Naval Academy on the basis of the Institute of Naval Forces of the National University -Odesa Maritime Academy-, and the subordination of the academy to the Naval College for the Training of Senior Officers, the Naval Lyceum named after Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovany, the Diving Center training and survival at sea. The training sailing frigate -Druzhba- will be restored and put into active use for training cadets. In the interests of national and patriotic education, a modern museum of war at sea will be created during 2024-2030 on the basis of the Military and Historical Museum of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces (Odesa). An interactive branch of the museum will be introduced for all age groups with the use of gaming technologies for controlling unmanned (unmanned) systems and coastal missile systems. It is also planned to create the museum complex -Snake Island- as a branch of the museum. After the end of the hostilities at sea, the places where the ships of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the DPS were killed will be established, measures will be taken to honor the memory of the fallen sailors and determine the historical and touristic places of resistance to the enemy on the island. Zmiiny, in the cities of Odesa, Ochakiv and others. —What are the risks and how will control over the implementation of the Strategy be carried out? — The biggest risk is the loss of the initiative at sea and the enemy’s attempt to overcome Ukraine’s technological and intellectual advantage in operations at sea. This requires already now, at the end of 2024 and at the beginning of 2025, to take all necessary measures to liberate Crimea, weaken the enemy's defenses in southern Ukraine, and thus create conditions for victory in other strategic directions. Therefore, if during the implementation of the Strategy there will not be a clear vision regarding the tasks and measures for the liberation of Crimea by military or other means, then the top leadership of the state and the military leaders of the Armed Forces and, in particular, the Navy will not have enough justifications regarding the expediency or possibility of conducting such an operation. Unlike -those ideas- offered by some independent experts. There are probably relevant data, facts, figures and calculations for this. As it is known, some experts offer options for carrying out a kind of -special military operation- to restore control over Crimea. This operation involves surprise raids from the sea to seize key logistics centers, military and government control points and critical military facilities after an intensive air operation to suppress all types of enemy defenses in Crimea. With regard to other risks and the implementation of control over the implementation of the Strategy, it is worth emphasizing that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine must inform the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine about the results of the implementation of the plan every six months. In addition, the Government will make proposals to improve the effectiveness of activities to ensure the maritime security of the state. In its turn, the NSDC will make the necessary decisions regarding the protection of national interests and the defense of Ukraine at sea. It is important that the Strategy also provides for the implementation of democratic civil control over the activities of state bodies in relation to its implementation, as stipulated by the Law of Ukraine -On National Security of Ukraine-. Within this control, the media, independent experts and public associations will always play a decisive role. Summarizing, it is worth noting that the new Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine is a clear sequence of steps leading to Ukraine's victory, particularly at sea. Yes, the Strategy does not unequivocally indicate in what way the Crimean Peninsula will be liberated - by diplomatic or military means. Because such information would be very useful to the enemy. Therefore, it should be in closed planning documents. For example, in the strategy of military operations of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea, which, I am sure, is already being developed and, most likely, is already being implemented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/yak-peremogty-voroga-na-mori-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-novu-strategiyu-morskoyi-bezpeky/	2024-12-16T20:39:06-08:00
Putin's regime stamps fakes about -‎Azov-: which -sensation- is replicated by the Russian media	-Azov- &#8211; a longtime target of Russian propaganda.

Sellers of the world's most expensive tickets to the Taizhny Union were detained in Rivne region	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on December 16. The employees of the SBI, in close cooperation with the UVB of the DPSU, reported the suspicion to a law enforcement officer from the Rivne region and his friend, who organized the scheme of illegally transporting men to Belarus. In November 2024, two acquaintances approached the law enforcement officer with the desire to leave the EU. The official offered them a transfer to Belarus, because he considered it more -safe-. The law enforcement officer wanted $8,000 per person for the transfer. He was to be assisted by a local resident who was also well acquainted with the border area. The law enforcement officer planned to use his own car to transport -clients- from Rivne past all checkpoints to one of the villages near the border. Then his accomplice had to transport the men to the border itself. The men had to cross the border directly on their own according to the given instructions. On December 12, a law enforcement officer was arrested -red handed- after receiving $8,000 from one of the -clients-.

As you can see in the footage, the DPRK soldiers went out into the open for something, but when they saw our FPV drones, they tried to shoot back and run away from them. For some reason, the North Koreans did not adopt the tactics of freezing, which are often used by the Russians. Maybe Juche doesn't allow it. Soon the field was covered with the bodies of poor people who were sent by one totalitarian regime to die for another totalitarian regime. As reported by ArmyInform, our paratroopers arranged a massacre of North Koreans in Kurshchyna .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/ostannye-znajomstvo-vzvod-pivnichnokorejcziv-zalyshyvsya-na-kurshhyni-pislya-zustrichi-z-nashymy-dronamy/	2024-12-16T07:56:33-08:00

The enemy created fake youth parliaments at the TOT of the Kherson Region	About this notifies Center of national resistance. Yes, the occupiers created the first -youth parliament- in the region, which of course has no function. Its purpose is to attract teenagers to collaborationism. -Parliament- consists of twenty children who were found by the Kremlin's youth movements among the locals. By associating teenagers with occupation administrations within the scope of this crime, the enemy seeks to gain their loyalty. The Center of National Resistance urges to ignore the initiatives of the enemy, and for parents to have conversations with their children, so that they do not destroy their future lives by cooperating with the occupiers.

About this is distributed in a statement of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which December 16 General Staff Armed Forces Through such interrogations, the enemy tries to spread propaganda narratives, creating the illusion of -distrust- in the military-political leadership of the state, the Defense Forces of Ukraine, or the -surrender- of territories. It is also used to justify aggression by the enemy. Videos may contain statements taken out of context or inaccurate facts that can be interpreted in favor of the enemy. Thus, the aggressor tries to form false ideas about the situation at the front and the general mood in Ukrainian society. It should be remembered that captured military personnel may testify under physical or psychological pressure. In the conditions of interrogations carried out by the aggressor, they can be forced to voice what is imposed on them, without reflecting their true opinion or position. This is not evidence of betrayal or lack of patriotism, but rather the result of the difficult conditions of captivity. It is important to be careful and critical of videos that are distributed by the enemy. It is necessary to realize that these materials can be partially or completely falsified. -Let's remember that the informational struggle is an integral part of repelling armed aggression, and by joining forces, we can resist enemy propaganda!- the message says.

-We have our scores with the enemy-: the story of the Savchenko family, which lost two sons in the w...	Today, lieutenant colonel Serhiy Savchenko holds the post of chief of staff - first deputy commander of the voluntary formation of the Sumy urban territorial community. - Serhii, when and how did you learn about the enemy's invasion? From the TV news? — All decent Ukrainians knew that the liberators were about to visit us. After all, everything that Putin and his henchmen said on the eve of the invasion, the anti-Ukrainian hysteria that affected almost all Russians, the accumulation of troops and weapons in the immediate vicinity of the border indicated that war would inevitably knock on our door. Personally, I and my closest friends learned about the date of the invasion a day before it - February 23. From what sources - I will not say: the time has not yet come. - Weren't you stunned by such news? - No, but my soul became somehow anxious and even creepy. My friends and I, and these were mostly yesterday's soldiers, in particular, participants of the anti-terrorist operation, who at one time served in the special forces and had combat training, decided to act. We didn't have a single machine gun or even a pistol. But practically all of us were hunters, and had quite decent hunting carbines and rifles. It is about 20 kilometers from Sumy to the border with Moscow. So on the night of February 23-24, we advanced to him. Around five o'clock in the morning, they saw a small convoy of vehicles, which consisted of cars and an armored personnel carrier. In 30-40 minutes, some of them caught fire, and a few got to us as trophies. As well as small arms. Some -liberators- also fell into our hands, whom we soon handed over to the competent authorities, starting to fill the so-called exchange fund. Apparently, the stars aligned in the sky and the Lord God Himself favored us (smiles. — Ed.). And the factor of suddenness worked. Firstly, they hoped that they would be treated to vodka and dumplings here from the very morning, and secondly, the column consisted exclusively of conscript soldiers of the first year of service, led by a lieutenant who had graduated from a military school just a few months before the invasion and about the war knew from movies. True, one of our comrades died in a short skirmish. That's how, in short, my new stage of life began, which has been going on for almost three years now. In general, I will say that then, in the first hours of the invasion, many residents of Sumy Oblast resisted. And why, on the first day of the invasion, the occupiers found themselves on the outskirts of the regional center, not to mention the border villages, then, in my opinion, the factor of suddenness, their number, the amount of weapons also worked: according to these indicators, they outnumbered us many times. — After being discharged in 2006, 10 years later you returned to the army again, spending three years in the ATO/OO area. How did it happen? — During 30 years of service in officer positions, I gained experience. So, in 2016, he volunteered for the army, taking the position of chief of staff of the howitzer division in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. Three years later, he resigned and was appointed head of the district state administration of the Putivl district. After being released from this position, he engaged in military-patriotic education of youth. On public grounds. — What tasks are assigned to your voluntary formation? Who is part of it? — We are subordinate to the Sumy Territorial Defense Brigade. The main tasks are the protection of Sumy itself and important facilities located in the city, the fight against sabotage and reconnaissance groups, anti-aircraft warfare, as well as the destruction of enemy UAVs, i.e. -Shakheds-. For this purpose, we have several mobile groups armed with heavy machine guns. They already have 5 shot down Shaheds. Company strongholds have been set up, at which our fighters are on duty 24 hours a day, at which our fighters take turns holding the defense. There are also sapper units capable of demining and demining, erecting various defensive objects, etc. The average age of the boys is 50–52 years. All of them are different in age, profession, state of health, but they are able to hold weapons in their hands. Also, they love their land, are ready to protect their children, wives, and parents. Especially valued are people with combat experience who have undergone a -run-in- during ATO/OOS. Our formation is maintained at the expense of the Sumy territorial community. Financial support varies between 8-9 thousand hryvnias, we have some social benefits. But the absolute majority of guys joined the ranks of the formation not because of any material benefits: the driver of the same -route- receives much more. Many have their accounts with Muscovites. After all, among us there are those who lost their children, wives, parents, and ultimately their homes in this war. — The length of the Ukrainian-Russian border through the territory of the Sumy region reaches about 600 kilometers, and the regional center and Russia are separated by some 22 kilometers. Hence the question: do katsaps bother the countrymen a lot? — Already in the morning of February 24, Russian troops approached the city from the north-eastern direction, after which the fighting for it began. In some places, Muscovites managed to enter the city itself. Those were days filled with horror, the deaths of many people, including children, and the destruction of many buildings. Back in the summer of 2022, experts estimated that the Russians destroyed about two thousand buildings. Sumyshchyna is under constant rocket and artillery attacks: the distance that separates us from this devil allows him to strike from his territory. - Don't sabotage-intelligence groups give you peace either? - As my guys joke, they keep us in a constant state of tension, not allowing us to relax even for an hour. Today, our Sumyshchyna comes under fire dozens of times during the day, 5-7 DRGs penetrate our territory every day, trying not only to gather intelligence, but also to commit various acts of sabotage. These groups of up to 15 people are well prepared and armed to the teeth. I will not say that it was the volunteer formations that played and continue to play a decisive role in the confrontation with the enemy. After all, in addition to us, many units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, National Security Service of Ukraine, Security Service of Ukraine, National Police, State Security Service are concentrated here. We restrain and destroy the enemy by joint efforts. - I know that in the struggle with our eternal enemies you lost your two sons&#8230; - It hurts, it hurts to talk about it (he falls silent for a few minutes. - Ed.). The younger son Maksym died in 2014 while commanding the assault group 95 DShB. And it was his death that prompted me to go to the TCC and ask to join the army. The desire to avenge the death of my son, to protect my native land became the meaning of my life since then. On March 13, 2024, these creatures took the life of Denis's eldest son, who was serving in the 27th separate rocket artillery brigade. And if I were a little younger, had better health, I would be fighting -at zero- today. But, I think, here I am also useful. - What does lieutenant colonel Serhiy Savchenko dream about the most? - I used to fall asleep and wake up with only one dream - that my boys would return home alive and unharmed. Unfortunately, this dream was not destined to come true. So what can I dream about today? So that the Ukrainians as soon as possible defeat this wild tribe of creatures that came to kill, rape and rob. And I also dream that my grandchildren Arina, Sava and Ulyana will grow up to be worthy children of their parents, who gave their lives for their future. I am a Christian. But I will express a sinful desire that you cannot call a Christian desire. I want to see a bastard called poutine with a zashmorg around his neck. As well as his closest friends who bathe in our blood. This is my greatest desire, although I take sin upon myself with these words. But the one who lost a son or daughter in this cursed war, whose grandchildren these bastards made half-orphans, will understand me, I hope.

Norway will allocate about $204 million to strengthen the Navy of Ukraine	This was reported by December 16 Norwegian government. -Ukraine needs additional support to further weaken Russian naval forces in the Black Sea. It is necessary to protect the Ukrainian population and infrastructure from the attacks of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. It is also important to protect the export of grain and other goods by sea, which provides an important income for Ukraine,- said Prime Minister Jonas Har Støre. He announced the new donation from the Norwegian Nansen program during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Norway and Great Britain lead the Coalition of Maritime Capability of Ukraine, which was launched in December a year ago. A portion of the funds will go toward innovation and autonomy efforts in the Maritime Capabilities Coalition. Several specific innovative projects and development projects are working on strengthening safety at sea. The Government of Norway also allocated about $13.5 million for the purchase of small boats that will be donated, as well as for the contribution of the Armed Forces to the training and training of Ukrainian small boat drivers for river operations at the training center.

the authorities of the Russian Federation are unable to ensure the demand for currency in the countr...	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. This amount is not enough to cover the entire demand for foreign currency in the country and indicates the inability of the Russian Federation to ensure the specified level of imports at the expense of the available foreign exchange revenues. According to the preliminary assessment of the balance of payments (as of December 12), exports of the Russian Federation in September amounted to 39.1 billion dollars. USA, in October - 36.6 billion US dollars, and in November - 32.2 billion US dollars. Imports were $26.8 billion in September, $27.5 billion in October and $25.9 billion in November. The downward trend in exports is due to the drop in demand for Russian energy carriers, as well as increased competition on international markets. China's purchases of Russian coal from January to November decreased by 21% year-on-year — from $13.3 billion. USA up to 10.5 billion dollars. USA. In addition, India reduced the import of Russian coal - from January to September it was 26% less than in the same period last year. The total figure of Russian coal exports for 11 months decreased by 23% from 30.3 billion dollars. USA up to 23.3 billion dollars. USA. the Russian coal industry was on the verge of bankruptcy due to falling coal prices and high production costs. To support businesses, the Russian government canceled export duties on coking coal and extended a moratorium on other duties until the end of 2024. At the same time, China increased coal imports by 14.8% year-on-year to 490 million tons between January and November. However, this growth came at the expense of increased supplies from Mongolia and Australia. The decrease in foreign exchange earnings and the reduction of exports, which is directly related to the war against Ukraine, has a negative impact on the Russian economy, increasing financial instability. As a result, this leads to a further weakening of the ruble and a deepening of the budget deficit of the aggressor country. We remind you that while the transitional government of Syria under led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is consolidating power in the country, Russian troops continue to evacuate from the region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/vlada-rf-nezdatna-zabezpechyty-popyt-na-valyutu-v-krayini-deficzyt-byudzhetu-poglybytsya/	2024-12-16T05:54:22-08:00

In this regard, the Kremlin began to open -volunteer- centers, particularly in Donetsk. The task of the -volunteers- who arrived from the Russian Federation is to plan propaganda events until May 9. At the same time, all measures must be structured and carry a general narrative about the exclusive victory of the Russian Federation in this war. Downplaying the role of allies, denying the alliance between Stalin and Hitler at the beginning of the war and discrediting the role of Ukraine in this war. In particular, Ukrainians will be portrayed as collaborators, Nazis, and draw parallels between the present day. Occupying administrations will ensure attendance at the events by force.

the Russian Federation is unable to exert geopolitical influence on several fronts at the same time	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Large amphibious ships are urgently transferred to the Mediterranean Sea from the Baltic and North Seas to evacuate the occupation contingent. There are also chartered vessels under the flags of -convenient- countries for loading equipment near Tartus. Cargo planes are used to move troops from the Khmeimim air base. Negotiations with HTS regarding Russian bases are coming to a logical end - they have no place on the territory of Syria. From the rest of the strongholds in Syria, in particular in the areas of Manbij, Kobani and Qamishli, which were not specified in the agreement on bases in Latakia, Russian troops are moving in the direction of Tartus or Khmeimim. Minister of Defense of Turkey Ya. Güler supported the withdrawal of Russian troops to Khmeimim and Tartus, assuming that Turkey would act against other Russian bases. In general, the situation is a logical result of the aggressive foreign policy of the Russian Federation. After the fall of the Assad regime, the Russian presence in Syria has no prospects. Also, the defeat of one of Russia's closest allies undermines the reputation of the Kremlin in Africa, where many leaders considered Russia a guarantor of their regimes against internal and external threats. This is yet another confirmation that the Kremlin's war against Ukraine weakens Russia's position in other key regions, emphasizes its limited resources and inability to exert geopolitical influence on several fronts at the same time. We remind you, December 15, 2024 columns the troops of the aggressor state continued to withdraw from the interior of the country to the bases in Khmeimim and Tartus, control over which the Kremlin seeks and hopes save.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/rf-ne-v-zmozi-geopolitychno-vplyvaty-na-dekilkoh-frontah-odnochasno/	2024-12-16T04:41:27-08:00
An enemy general was suspected of ordering the use of chemical weapons against our soldiers	reported this on December 16 Security Service of Ukraine. The official is responsible for the mass use of prohibited chemical weapons by the Russian Federation against the Defense Forces on the eastern and southern fronts of Ukraine. By order of Kirillov, since the beginning of the full-scale war, more than 4,800 cases of enemy use of chemical weapons. In particular, we are talking about combat grenades -K-1-, which are equipped with poisonous substances of an irritating effect - CS and CN. Their use is prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction dated January 13, 1993. During the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, more than 2,000 people were sent to military hospitals and other medical facilities in Ukraine. of the Defense Forces with various degrees of chemical poisoning. For the most part, the occupiers use ammunition with poisonous substances in the form of drops from FPV drones on the defense points of Ukrainian defenders. When grenades with a chemical charge are activated, their poisonous compounds affect the mucous membranes of a person, primarily the eyes and respiratory tract. In this way, the Rashists are trying to force Ukrainian soldiers to come out of the trenches under the direct fire of the occupiers. According to the investigation, the occupiers use dangerous chemicals mainly in the hottest areas of hostilities, where they try to hide the use of chemical agents under heavy artillery fire. The SBU identified Russian grenades with poisonous substances and corresponding soil samples on the battlefield and handed them over to the international Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in a procedural manner (chain-of-custody). Two laboratories of this institution, which operate separately from each other, confirmed the respective war crimes of Russia. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Kirillov in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (a war crime committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). The pre-trial investigation continues to document other violations of international humanitarian law by the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, more than two thousand Ukrainian military were poisoned by the troops of the aggressor country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/vorozhyj-general-otrymav-pidozru-za-nakaz-zastosuvaty-himichnu-zbroyu-proty-nashyh-bijcziv/	2024-12-16T04:22:39-08:00

The spokesperson of the Naval Forces told about this on the air -Suspilne Novosti- Ukrainian Armed Forces captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, two tankers, which are actually river-class vessels, went out to sea without complying with shipping conditions. And the fact that they would go to the bottom was only a matter of time. -They are 50+ years old - each of them. Therefore, here, as always, the Russians violated everything they could violate. There is also information that they were detained at the anchorage longer than planned. But the captain of the ship had to take into account all these factors and, accordingly, calculate all the risks,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. However, as the spokesman of the Navy noted, the smooth operation of rusty oil tankers is vital for the Russian Federation. Therefore, they will be sent in any weather. -Transferring Russian oil or other fuels and lubricants is more important to them than complying with the requirements for the safety of civil shipping. This is not the only incident. This is also the permanent shutdown of the identification system, this is also non-compliance with the requirements regarding coastal warnings,- said the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

-Kunytsia- on tracks: marines in the Pokrovsky direction were reinforced by German Marder BMPs	The commander of the 38th brigade's amphibious assault company, Lieutenant Rostislav with the call sign -Shelby-, told ArmyInform correspondents about the combat capabilities of the German vehicle and how these BMPs will help the marines defend Donetsk region from the onslaught of Russian invaders. BMP Marder -in translation - -Marten-- is a German tracked infantry fighting vehicle manufactured by the Rheinmetall concern, which was the main combat vehicle of the Bundeswehr from the 1970s to the 2010s. The marines note the good booking of these BMPs. The Marder can protect the crew from bullets, 30mm shells and small shrapnel. It owes its protection to welded steel. There were cases when these BMPs during the Russian-Ukrainian war withstood hits even from 30-mm automatic guns in the frontal projection. The machine is easy to operate. It has an automatic gearbox and mechanics: three gears - three forward and three reverse. -Very practical and fairly mobile machine, able to cross different areas of the terrain thanks to the tracked base. Of course, the swamp will be much more difficult to pass, because its weight is about 30-35 tons. But what is important in combat missions is speed. On the highway - up to 65 km/h, on rough terrain - up to 45 km/h. The operational range of work is up to 600 km. Shelby says the Marder has better cross-country ability and armor than the Soviet BMP-1 and BMP-2 models. They are comfortable for the movement of military personnel. The crew is 3 people, the landing compartment is designed for six fighters in full equipment. -The seats for the staff are conveniently located in the car. Even when driving off-road and maneuvering an armored personnel carrier, the guys feel quite confident inside.- Regarding weapons. The Marder's main weapon is a 20mm cannon that can effectively engage lightly armored targets and enemy manpower. Its damage range is up to 2.5 km. In addition, the BMP has 7.62 mm machine guns. Cannon ammunition is 1250 rounds, machine gun 5000 rounds. The declared rate of fire of the gun is up to 1000 rounds per minute. There is also an anti-tank complex MILAN 2T with a firing range of 2 km. The Marder is additionally equipped with a deployable anti-drone net to counter Russian FPV drones. Komroty Rostyslav tells: after receiving the BMP, the units undergo practical training. Before that, driver mechanics and gunners underwent a 2-week training course on the operation and use of combat vehicles. Currently, they are already working directly on Marder. Vehicle commanders are still undergoing training and will soon join their crews. In general, the training includes BMP management techniques, technical maintenance features, providing guidance on the combat use of weapons. The crews train to target and shoot. The guys learn to repair equipment on the spot, it is very important to be able to troubleshoot during combat operations, so to speak, -repair from the wheels.- If you compare Marder with Viking amphibious all-terrain vehicles, -Shelby- emphasizes: -At one time, we worked on APC. In my opinion, Marder is more practical in operation and has a higher degree of armor protection and more powerful firepower this combat vehicle can be used for various purposes - both for the delivery of personnel to the positions and for evacuation from them armored capsule, even if the car is blown up, the personnel will remain unharmed and can continue to perform combat missions. He came across this BMP while studying at the Military Academy in Odessa, and then worked on it at the Training Center of the Military Academy. Therefore, I think the German car is somewhat better than the Viking. Although the amphibious armored personnel carrier is able to overcome water obstacles and operate in flooded areas, thanks to the wide rubber track. -I am from Odesa region. At the age of 15, he went to study at the Naval Lyceum named after Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovayn. After that, he entered the Faculty of Airborne Assault Troops and Marines at the Military Academy (Odesa). After graduation, he joined the 38th Marine Brigade, which, in fact, he wanted to join. I really wanted to be a combat officer, to manage personnel in combat conditions, in war. To work in difficult conditions. Management noticed. I was encouraged and given the opportunity to lead an assault company. Rostislav, commanding a company in battle, was wounded. But he says everything is ok. 3 days in the hospital and then returned to his unit. -We have a pretty great atmosphere in the unit, but it all starts with a personal example. In the mouth, the vast majority are men older than me, who are more than 30-40 years old. An individual approach to each. We are the Marines, we are one team. Brotherhood and trust are the foundation. The boys pick up Marine values ​​very quickly. I am very happy when I see how my subordinates learn and strive to become better. How the level of training of fighters increases, where there is a certain breakthrough in the knowledge of combat, weapons and technical equipment. We look at the potential of each and determine where it will be better to perform a combat task, so that the coefficient of useful action only increases, and does not stand still.- By the way, recently the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky, awarded Rostislav with the -Cross of the Brave- badge. The young company commander received the award for personal courage and heroism, demonstrated during combat missions to protect the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/kunyczya-na-gusenyczyah-morpihiv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-posylyly-nimeczkymy-bmp-marder/	2024-12-15T21:01:57-08:00
Artificial intelligence is modernizing transport: NATO vehicles will be equipped with an operating s...	As experts from the Dutch Army Recognition portal emphasize, this system is designed to modernize existing vehicles by converting them into autonomous and interconnected units, while ensuring integration with current defense and commercial operations, ArmyInform notes. The platform is focused on enabling the military to increase mission flexibility and adaptability without the need to replace existing equipment. The Mithra OS includes the Legacy Autonomy Kit, an upgrade feature that equips conventional vehicles with AI-based capabilities. These upgrades include adaptive navigation, autonomous intelligence, and remote control, reducing the need for human intervention. The system supports both manned-unmanned and unmanned-unmanned command, which ensures increased safety and operational efficiency. Another feature, Interconnectivity &amp; Swarming Pilot allows vehicles to share real-time data and conduct synchronized operations, while the Situational Awareness Suite integrates sensors for real-time monitoring and data processing to improve battlefield intelligence. In the manned-unmanned group, unmanned units perform tasks such as reconnaissance, evacuation of wounded and intelligence sharing. In an unmanned joint, this facilitates the coordination of unmanned ground and aerial vehicles for tasks such as perimeter security and combined reconnaissance. In addition, Mithra OS enables autonomous missions, including reconnaissance in high-risk areas and demining operations aimed at reducing threats and increasing security for advancing forces. Mithra OS can also be used in a non-military context, offering tools to improve the productivity and flexibility of commercial operations. The platform's modular and scalable design allows it to be integrated into autonomous and connected systems in various sectors. ARX ​​​​Roboticsemphasizes that the system is compatible with legacy software and includes its capabilities update in radio mode. This ensures that existing fleets can adapt to new technologies, potentially extending their service life. The modular approach aims to enable operators to efficiently upgrade their fleets, addressing both current operational challenges and future requirements. According to Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Frank Leidenberger, BWI's CEO, upgrading legacy equipment is a practical solution to meet the evolving needs of the military within budget constraints. The development of operating systems based on artificial intelligence for military equipment reflects the global trend of modernization of the armed forces. Germany's Rheinmetall is working with American company Auterion to create standardized software for drones aimed at increasing interoperability between NATO allies. In the United States, Textron Systems and Kodiak Robotics are working on artificial intelligence-based autonomy for military ground vehicles, and Anduril Industries has developed the Lattice operating system to coordinate autonomous assets such as drones. Australian company BAE Systems introduced the ATLAS platform for integrating autonomy with existing military systems. These programs are focused on upgrading existing fleets rather than acquiring new platforms to address cost and operational efficiency issues. Several other systems have also been developed in recent years that turn military vehicles into remotely operated or autonomous units. Milrem Robotics has developed a set of intelligent features that give cars the ability to operate autonomously or with the help of remote control. The US Army has tested the Light Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV-L), a semi-autonomous system designed to improve mobility on the battlefield while reducing risks to personnel. Defense company ARX Robotics has unveiled ARX Mithra OS, which it describes as the first independent AI-based operating system for military vehicles.

Drone revolution: Ukrainians show fantastic results. The expert called the phenomenon of this war	What does this mean, ArmiyaInform asked military expert Petr Chernyk: -Drones of all classes, varieties and types are becoming a very serious strike force. True, one must understand that they will never really replace barrel artillery or aviation. These are the types of weapons that will always be appropriate and valid in any war. At the same time, the drone revolution did take place and we, Ukrainians, showed fantastic results in part of their application. Here are just a few words about the types and varieties of drones. All drones are divided into two categories: reconnaissance - those that collect information about the enemy and strike. This is if we are talking about the aerial component, because we understand that there are also ground drones and surface drones, but still aerial drones are the main mass. According to the method of technical use, there are drones -on the wing- and what we call -copters-, that is, small helicopters. Their combat load can vary from a few grams or kilograms of explosives (say, even TM-62 - an anti-tank mine is already integrated into drones) to 50 kg, or even up to 100 kg. The most popular drones currently in use on the front line are so-called FPV drones. Those controlled by a person at a distance of several hundred meters to, as a rule, 15-20 km. This is precisely the area of ​​operation of barrel artillery. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has provided our Armed Forces with up to a million drones over the past year. Is it a lot or a little? If you divide by 365 days, you get about 2,700 drones per day. That's pretty good. At the same time, understanding that we have 1,000 kilometers of demarcation line, that's roughly 2.7 drones, rounding up to three drones per kilometer. Let me remind you that 1.5 km is an oral reference point. It's not that much anymore. This is an average. That is, in order for drones to really change something in a part of the battlefield, their number must be seriously increased. Another million plus would be a colossal step forward. The Ukrainians have reached such a filigree work with drones that an FPV kamikaze drone can fly directly into the head of the occupier, or, say, into a tinted car. Plus, in this part, drones also need to be divided into two categories: this is a suicide drone that has explosives on it, and the drone dies when it explodes, and the so-called -resets-. -Drop- is an improvised explosive device, or, say, a fragmentation hand grenade of the F1 or RGT-5 type, or RGO, or RGN, which is dropped from a height of several meters and works very accurately primarily on manpower. Indeed, drones are a phenomenon in this war. One very specific example: during 90 days of fighting, 4,500 pieces of barrel artillery were destroyed in the summer part. This, if divided by 72, because that is how the artillery brigade is equipped, is more than 60 brigades. Half of it was destroyed precisely with the help of drones. Drones are our everything, so I appeal to the citizens of Ukraine: we will donate, donate and donate again for drones. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/revolyucziya-droniv-ukrayinczi-pokazuyut-fantastychni-rezultaty-ekspert-nazvav-fenomen-cziyeyi-vijny/	2024-12-15T20:26:17-08:00
From a TV presenter to a press officer for the Steelers: what Dina Wong will never forget	I joined the army because I felt that I should and could take responsibility for the future of the country, that I was ready to take decisive action to stop Russian aggression, that I would finally be able to do something valuable and meaningful in my life. Dina cooperates with ArmiyaInform, tells about the successes of the brigade at the front. It recently came out na-kurshhyni/-> author's material about the commander of the division of the rifle battalion with the call sign -Red-. During the interview, ArmyInform asked Dina Wong about the brigade in which she serves, about her brothers and sisters, memorable episodes of the war, and plans for the future after the Victory. - What kind of people do you have to serve with? What is interesting about your brigade? - I am currently serving in the 1st separate tank Siver brigade. The brigade was involved in a number of key operations during the ATO period, and continued to defend the country in the East during the Soviet Union. But for me, as a resident of Chernihiv, the participation of the steel workers in the defense of the city and Chernihiv region is especially valuable and significant. In fact, I owe my life to the servicemen of the 1st separate Siver tank brigade. People here are different. But equally steel. We have many divisions, so it is difficult to make any generalization. I just want to emphasize that our tankers are currently working at the limit of the impossible. If necessary, they go out for direct targeting and successfully destroy places of concentration of enemy personnel and their equipment. In the conditions of modern war, when the enemy can direct from 20 fpv and more to one tank, not counting other means, such work requires a steel character. Such as our tankers. Fighters of the rifle and mechanized battalions firmly hold their positions in the areas of our responsibility. For me, each of them is a Hero. I think if you have an idea of ​​how the infantry works, then you can not explain further. Our gunners do not like the phrase -Gods of War-, but I believe that this description is completely deserved for them. The way they destroy the enemy is truly divine. You can make sure of this if you look at the video of their work on our page. -Pegasus- - the fighters of the company of unmanned attack aircraft systems are particularly fond of destroying moving targets. This unit is made up of people who are constantly improving their skills. Our brigade is also a repair and restoration battalion, where specialists with truly golden hands serve. These are also fighters of the engineering and sapper company; scouts, REBivtsi. Everyone risks their lives during combat missions. That's why it's hard for me to single out one person, for me all our fighting guys are heroes. - Are there any episodes of the war that will never be forgotten? - It is difficult for me to answer this question. A lot has already happened. But the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Chernihiv Oblast is something I will definitely always remember. I was a civilian then, and because of what I experienced, I am now in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Because, first of all, I don't want the war to continue and be repeated again. Second, the enemy must answer for what he has done. - Tell us about the most difficult and happiest moments during the service. - The most difficult thing is, obviously, losing your brothers. War is war, people die in war, but it is still very difficult for me when people die from the battalion in which I started my service and from the brigade in which I am currently serving. Subjectively. The happiest is working with one of our tank units. I believe (and this is my personal opinion, not as a representative of the communications department, but simply as a person who serves in the army) that one of the tank battalions of the 1st Separate Tank Siver Brigade is the embodiment of what the Ukrainian army should really be. I have great respect for all of our divisions. I admire our infantrymen and artillerymen. It's just that if I abstract and say that what has strengthened my motivation and belief in victory the most is working with tankers. - How do friends, acquaintances who have remained civilians perceive that you serve? - They perceive. Everyone understood that this would be the case. At one time, I publicly voiced my position, so some things are absolutely obvious. - Can you tell us about the oldest and youngest fighter in the brigade, other interesting brothers and sisters? - I have already said that I cannot single out one person, because I believe that all our fighters are legends. But I don't think anyone will be offended if I tell you about our pseudo-demons. She was the commander of the BMP and the commander of the department. She is one of those who protected Chernihiv. She took part in quite difficult battles in the East of the country. The guys talk about her as a fair but strict commander. People from her battalion (mechanized battalion 1 of the separate Siver tank brigade) treat her with great respect. He is a very strong, strong-willed and competent person, I am honored that we serve in the same brigade. She has already done so much for the common victory. I understand that very often people are interested in the topic of women in the army. But our Demon is primarily about what a real effective leader, commander and warrior should be. She is a young and very beautiful girl. However, this did not prevent her from breaking all possible stereotypes about women in the army and gaining authority among her peers. I personally admire her. And I am grateful for Chernihiv. And also, from my own observations. There is a tendency in our tank battalions that both very young guys and older soldiers serve. There are quite a few tank commanders who are not yet 25. They signed contracts at the age of 18-19. There are also those who are over 50, for example. But these are very experienced tankers. And they perform their tasks at a very high level. Despite such a difference in age, the crews have a perfect understanding. Of course, tankers sometimes joke that they have boys commanding grandfathers, but this is no more than a joke. Everyone does their work with maximum dedication. Our crews are a symbol that the youth are ready to fight and are fighting for their country. And that the older generation is just as actively working to win. It's inspiring. - Do you feel on the same level as the boys? What is the attitude towards a woman in the unit? - In our brigade, you are treated first of all as a specialist, as a military serviceman. Regardless of your gender. - Is journalism at the front different from journalism before you joined the army? Tell us about your creative experience. - The work of a communications officer and the work of a journalist are fundamentally different things, so I don't think it's worth comparing them. Although there is something in common. I will only note that my experience in journalism contributes to my work as a representative of the brigade's communications department. —How do you motivate to join the team? Tell us about your recruiting experience. — In different battalions of our brigade there are people from Chernihiv region who joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine after the beginning of the large-scale invasion. They fundamentally wanted to join the 1st separate Siver tank brigade, because it was she who liberated their cities from occupation. This motivation completely coincides with my own, by the way. But. Our brigade is called a tank brigade, but we have many different units. In fact, here, a person can choose his path in the army - he can be a tank driver, an artilleryman, a medic, a scout, an infantryman; can repair equipment, can work on means of radio-electronic warfare. There are many paths to victory, and we suggest you choose your own and follow it as part of the 1st Separate Siver Tank Brigade. As for recruiting, now a person can call us directly and consult about the service. Her skills and competencies will be taken into account, of course, her wishes will be taken into account. In addition, our Recruiting Group officers will advise on returning from the SDF and on the possibility of transfer from another place of service. Let me remind you of our contact: 0688824156. - Do the brigade and you personally maintain contact with the families of the victims? - Of course, our officers from the civil-military cooperation department are constantly in contact with the families of the victims. Also, the siblings of our Heroes are constantly in touch with their loved ones. — What do you dream of doing after the Victory? Will you continue to be in the army or will you return to civilian life? - My main desire is to return to Chernihiv and live there peacefully and happily. This is a wish I am absolutely sure of. As for what I will be doing, it is still too early to talk about it. Above all, Victory. And Victory will grant the right to choose further.

45 -boys in panties- on organs: the enemy invents -atrocities- in Kurshchyna	In particular, a member of the Russian State Duma Nikolai Ivanov accuses the Ukrainian military of creating -death camps in the homes of civilians-, burning villages and destroying social infrastructure. The propagandists draw special attention to the -fate of 45 children- (-boys in panties-) who were allegedly -taken to Ukraine for organ trading-, which is why -the price of donor organs fell in the West-. It is also claimed about the alleged -stealing of livestock and grain-. the Russian MP did not provide any independent verifiable evidence of his claims. Similar statements are often spread by Russian propaganda for manipulation without a factual basis. The statement about -reducing prices for donor organs- is absurd and reinforces the already existing propaganda message about Ukraine as the -center of black transplantology.- Despite the fact that, in fact, the system of organ transplantation has high standards of verification of their origin and international monitoring. Such -throw-ins- are aimed at diverting attention from Russia's actions, in particular its aggression against Ukraine and crimes within its framework committed by the Russian military. These statements are part of an information and psychological war aimed at discrediting Ukraine and creating a distorted reality for the Russian audience. In addition, in this way, the Russians dream of demoralizing the opponent. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/45-malchikov-v-trusikah-na-organy-vorog-vygaduye-zvirstva-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-15T20:01:06-08:00

Storming Kurakhovo: the occupiers use DRG, disguising them as civilians	informs OSUV -Khortytsia- on its official Telegram channel -Khortytsky Wind-. Since the beginning of the day, there have been 10 combat clashes in the Kurakhovo region. Russian troops, having a numerical advantage in personnel and equipment, attack with the support of artillery and aviation. The enemy concentrated its efforts on the southeastern outskirts of Kurakhovo, trying to seize the road junction, the block of high-rise buildings in the southern part of the city, as well as important administrative and industrial facilities in the central part. The occupiers use sabotage and intelligence groups that act under the guise of civilians. In response, the Defense Forces of Ukraine conduct counter-sabotage measures to prevent such actions. The command takes all the necessary decisions to stabilize the situation in this direction. -We express great gratitude to our soldiers, sergeants and officers, who are heroically holding back the onslaught of the Russian occupiers,- the message reads. Separately, it is indicated that Russia continues to conduct a hybrid war, including the dissemination of distorted information about the situation in Kurakhovo for informational pressure and destabilization.

The occupiers at the TOT of Donetsk region are opening centers for the promotion of the language	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. So far, such propaganda centers have appeared in occupied Donetsk, Khartsyzk, Novoazovsk and Mangush, however, local collaborators were instructed to organize such centers in every library of the occupied region. These centers create the impression of -normalization- of life in the occupied regions, while at the same time trying to change the consciousness of local residents by imposing a -Russian- identity on them. As part of such activities, Russian language courses, propaganda lectures and -cultural- events are organized, which aim to force the local population to abandon their roots and adopt a foreign, imperial identity. Thus, the Russian authorities are trying not only to change the political landscape, but also to carry out cultural assimilation aimed at destroying the national identity of Ukrainians. This is especially true for the younger generation. We remind you, almost 2,000 multi-apartment buildings located in the Luhansk region's TOT have not been serviced by utility companies for years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/okupanty-na-tot-donechchyny-vidkryvayut-czentry-populyaryzacziyi-yazyka/	2024-12-15T09:41:53-08:00

Orderly and experienced scouts resisted the Azovians for several days. As a result, the commander of the group was eliminated, and his wards chose life and surrendered.

Gauleiter Pushylin turned off communication during a -direct line- with residents of TOT of Donetsk ...	This was reported by the Center of National Resistance. Only, unlike a bunker terrorist, they have no one to filter out uncomfortable questions. That is why, during the -direct line- of the Gauleiter Denys Pushylin, during the fractious -direct line- of the Gauleiter, the connection was suddenly cut off after a question about fraud with funds for the reconstruction of the housing of civilians in Donetsk region destroyed by Russia, a scheme to squeeze property through the -nationalization- of real estate and the settlement of occupied Ukrainian cities by representatives from the most remote regions of the Russian Federation . In general, the list of problems with which the civilian population has to live in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is endless. And this is despite the fact that the Kremlin is making huge infusions into the Ukrainian land it destroyed. After all, this is not surprising because the local puppets of Moscow shamelessly steal them. We remind you, almost 2,000 multi-apartment buildings located in the Luhansk region's TOT have not been serviced by utility companies for years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/gaulyajter-pushylin-vymknuv-zvyazok-pid-chas-pryamoyi-liniyi-iz-meshkanczyamy-tot-donechchyny/	2024-12-15T08:14:49-08:00

Residents did not pay the so-called -rental fee-, utility workers, in their turn, got rid of difficulties in servicing high-rise buildings in need of regular repairs. Urgent reregistration of an apartment under Russian legislation in the so-called -LNR- is not a panacea against the arbitrariness of the local occupation authorities. In particular, in Siverskodonetsk. In the case of a long-term absence of the owner in the city, the re-issued and registered housing is again, but unofficially, recognized as ownerless. Russian handymen, including builders, along with their families who decided to move from remote regions of the Russian Federation are settled there.

The enemy threatens to cancel the registration of the place of residence in the absence of a passpor...	About this reports Center of National Resistance. The low pace of passporting is the main problem for the occupation administrations in the temporarily occupied territories. It is this process that destroys the myth of Russian propaganda regarding the support of the -liberators- population. Trying to destroy Ukrainians, both physically and legally, the Kremlin resorts to coercion, but this does not work either. Currently, the enemy threatens to cancel the registration of the place of residence in case of refusal of the passport of the Russian Federation, which is mandatory for living in a totalitarian state. We remind you that the Kremlin left Russians without an important medical preparation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vorog-pogrozhuye-skasuvaty-reyestracziyu-misczya-prozhyvannya-u-razi-vidsutnosti-pasporta-rf/	2024-12-15T07:31:45-08:00

A hit to the ground was recorded on the territory of the sports complex in the Kyiv district of the city. A 48-year-old woman was injured and taken to the hospital. Previously, the Russian army hit Kharkiv with an Iskander-M ballistic missile.

the Kremlin left Russians without an important medical drug	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. It has not been available in pharmacies for a long time, and in hospitals you have to wait for weeks for procedures that require saline solution. Against the backdrop of rising production and logistics costs, lack of equipment due to Western sanctions, pharmaceutical companies are refusing to release this cheap product. They cannot afford to operate at a loss under these conditions. And this is just one example. At the same time, doctors in various regions of the Russian Federation complain of a critical shortage of important drugs, in particular of foreign production, and the assortment of pharmacies has decreased by at least 20% during the full-scale war against Ukraine. At the same time, propaganda assures that there should be no shortage, and the government, instead of solving the problem, is engaged in the search for extremes. Thus, the health of Russians was once again under threat due to the aggressive ambitions of the Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin. We remind you, December 14 in Ulyanovsk, Russia, an explosion destroyed a railway track - the military logistics of the occupation army of the Russian Federation suffered another complication.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/kreml-zalyshyv-rosiyan-bez-vazhlyvogo-medpreparatu/	2024-12-15T06:23:25-08:00

It will be recalled that on December 13, a fire disabled three locomotives in the city of Krasnodar, and on December 11, two main locomotives of the aggressor state burned down in Bryansk. -The process of weakening logistics facilities that Russia uses to wage a genocidal war against Ukraine continues. There will be a fair retribution for every war crime!-, the GUR reminds.

Russia seeks to save Rosneft	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In December, the Russian state oil company -Rosneft- and the Indian private oil refiner -Reliance- concluded an energy agreement for the supply of oil for ten years with the possibility of extension. Deliveries are planned to begin in January 2025. According to the agreement, Russia will supply India with almost 500,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Prices will be reviewed annually. In fact, the new contract will determine prices for almost a third of Rosneft's exports and50% of its maritime exports. Most of the supplies will be Russian -urals-, which will be sold at a discount of $3. US per barrel to Dubai quotes. At the same time, the indicated agreement, which covers about 0.5% of global oil supply, was concluded without taking into account the fact that the EU is preparing the 15th package of sanctions against the Russian Federation, which raises questions about the realism of such a project. We remind you, UAE banks are massively refusing to serve Russian businesses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/rf-pragne-vryatuvaty-rosneft/	2024-12-15T05:27:16-08:00

However, this is unofficially the coordination of collaborators' actions. Despite the fact that the Russians hide the list of participants, it is known to the Defense Forces. Each -leader- is a legitimate target and will be held accountable for their actions, and only time separates them from the moment of reckoning.

Half a hundred worms here today only on a specific section of the strip, but the day is still ahead,- wrote Robert Browdy.

Banks of the UAE are massively refusing to serve Russian businesses	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. This caused delays and refusals in Russia's cross-border payments. The change in UAE policy actually supports similar moves by the Chinese authorities. The reason for the complication of financial operations for Russian business in the UAE was the US sanctions against Russian banks. The threat of secondary sanctions forces the financial institutions of the People's Republic of China and the UAE to revise the schemes of interaction with Russia, complicating its foreign economic activities. In addition, banks in the UAE began to refuse en masse transactions related to the purchase of electronics, server equipment, IT services and industrial equipment. Additional pressure is created by Chinese financial institutions, which have also stepped up checks on payments coming from the UAE, India and the special administrative region of the PRC - Hong Kong. The purpose of such inspections is to identify possible connections with the Russian Federation. We remind you, previously, the enemy hit the Kyiv district of the city with a rocket.

As an example, he cited the Russian offensive towards the village of Kruglyakivka. -As for the wedge in the direction of Kruglyakivka, I would like to recall at what cost the enemy managed to advance: for this, about a hundred units of the enemy's equipment were used in a short time, of which the Defense Forces destroyed ninety,- - Yuriy Fedorenko recalled. But no matter how great the enemy, with proper organization and provision, the invaders can be repelled. -The enemy can be suspended and stopped and, in some cases, knocked out of the positions he has taken. This was proved by the 1st brigade of operational assignment and -Edelweiss-, which knocked the enemy out of their positions,- noted Yuriy Fedorenko.

Therefore, the occupation administrations call bank debtors and their family members in order to recruit people and at least partially implement the mobilization plan in the temporarily occupied territories. the Russians even promise to forgive loans to those whose close relative signs the contract. the kremlin always uses the poverty created by its actions to recruit people for the empire's wars. However, currently the number of people willing to enter into a contract with the Russian army on TOT is critically low.

In the Kurakhiv direction, the enemy switched to round-the-clock assaults	Acting Press Officer of the 33rd Mechanized Brigade Nazar Voytenkov told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -They attack both in the morning and during the day and night. No matter what time of day it is, they are constantly attacking.

According to him, if earlier the occupiers attacked with large columns of armored vehicles, now they have switched to constant pressure with infantry groups. -The greatest advantage of the enemy is quantity,- explained Nazar Voytenkov.

They fly less — the threat of Ukraine's use of long-range weapons forced the Russians to hide their ...	This was told on the ArmyTV stream by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion of the 92nd assault brigade Captain Yury Fedorenko named after Ivan Sirko, captain of the basket. -After Ukraine received permits to use long-range weapons, the intensity of the enemy's use of aviation dropped significantly. Because he understands that he can fly in, he is forced to hide his planes, move and maneuver. This is very important. Because the tactic of erasing our settlements to zero, as happened at one time with Vovchansk or Avdiyevka, now the enemy is not succeeding. And this is very inspiring,- said Yuriy Fedorenko. He expressed hope that similar results will be accepted by the US military and political leadership and will allow not only to receive more long-range weapons, but also to establish their production in Ukraine.

Facebook War: How to Counter a Hostile AI-Generated Fake Epidemic	Software algorithms are increasingly spreading them in recommendation feeds, and this -epidemic- is only gaining momentum. From AI-generated images, -Ukrainian soldiers- call for liking, commenting and sharing. Most of such publications, at first glance, have a rather patriotic appearance. Ukrainian flags, embroidery, posts with a call to action (react) or to the manifestation of emotions (sympathize). Among the comments, between -our little girl- and -may God protect you-, there are many comments that such publications are a tool of Russian information and psychological operations. So there are a lot of calls not to like and not to comment (!) on such posts. Especially those responsible -complain- about them to the Facebook administration, but such publications only increase. So, are we dealing with an informational influence on Ukrainians, what can such communication be aimed at - this is discussed in the research of the content of a number of Facebook pages (until December 4, 2024 - ed.). I did not have to search for the accounts of the authors of the researched publications for a long time. After viewing several similar posts, Facebook immediately offered 44 pages with similar images generated by artificial intelligence in the feed. In fact, there are many more of them. Perhaps with a slightly different information content, but all of them are designed for a certain target audience. Obviously, in this case, the algorithms focus on a middle-aged Ukrainian who is Orthodox by faith, has a family and a certain interest in military issues. After a quick analysis of the titles, images and information content of the pages, it was possible to divide them into four conventional groups: patriotic-entertaining, -real people-, Orthodox and nonsense. Page titles are another interesting phenomenon. They seem to be as simple as possible and -not for sale-. However, these communities have a significant audience. Even taking into account that the subscription is -winded up- and there are many bots and -inactive- profiles among the readers, there are quite a few very real people visible in the comments under the posts. So, the authors of these -patriotic and entertaining posts- still manage to reach the hearts and minds of Ukrainians. -Almighty Ukrain- has 223 thousand readers, -I love Ukraine- liked by 221 thousand and read 222 thousand FB profiles. -Congratulations-has a more modest audience with 49,000 likes and 66,000 readers. Music 1 Ukrainian, Ukrainian written in Russian, and actually Russian itself. A certain trend is also visible in posts with generated images such as -it's my birthday today, congratulations.- There are also publications on culture, music and cinema. As for the military, it is dominated by neutral AI images of soldiers standing, sitting, hugging, smiling or crying. Until November of this year, there were many images of soldiers with amputations, cemeteries with Ukrainian flags and women in uniform. Also, the authors are often nostalgic for the Soviet past and the old Russian variety show. For example, -Almighty Ukraine- distributes collages with Nina Matviyenko, and also distributes posts about the death of a Ukrainian composer in Belarus (to find out details, the author suggests following the link). Along with the post about Andrii Danylko (Verka Serdyuchka), there are posts about the Russian actress Alika Smekhova. There is also a patriotic post about our Ptashka (Kateryna Polishchuk). At the end of November and the beginning of December, publications on political topics began to appear on these pages, some of which were provocative in relation to the state leadership. In the names of the studied communities, the names and surnames (may also happen in the patronymic - ed.) of seemingly real people are used in some places. Hypothetically, anyone can be familiar with suchChernetska Victoria, followed by 11 thousand FB users,Oksana Kostenko, whose page has 20 thousand tags Likesand 24kreaders,orTetyana Bondar, whose audience is 9.3 thousand subscribers. True, there are actually not so many pages with people's names. In the list of 44 communities offered by Facebook, their unit. Interestingly, there were no -men- among them. Apparently, in social networks, male names inspire less trust and have few associations with emotional content. At the same time, the filling of such profiles is quite specific. These are mostly AI-generated images on the topic of the military, religion, relationships with grandparents and children. -Chernetska Victoria- has been active since October 20, 2022. Since then, 3-4 posts appear on this page every day with a noticeable bias on the topic of Orthodoxy. On December 8, 2022, the first post about the -Ukrainian soldier- appeared. Since then, many generated images of children, -soldiers of the Armed Forces- and prayers to God have been published on the page. Posts with military personnel depict the difficult conditions of service in winter — soldiers sleep in the snow or eat in the cold. There are also -artificial- photos of children with amputations, elderly people in -grandmother's house- with embroidered towels, ovens with bread, or images of a married couple at a wedding. For reasons that are not yet clear, posts with people in uniform on this page have noticeably decreased in November. Instead, there was an increase in embroidery, birthday cakes, children, prayers and generated photos of mushrooms in the forest. Oksana Kostenko is much less -religious-. Prefers content in the style of -5 brothers-, -5 babies-, -5 teenagers-, -5 girls- or -5 grannies- in his posts. There are, of course, posts where two or three people are depicted. All images are generated by AI, and the texts encourage users to say hello in the comments. The first illustration with -Ukrainian military- appeared on September 14, 2024. From time to time, -Oksana Kostenko- publishes photographs of cemeteries or generated images of people with amputations, which are intended to evoke pity. At the same time, the author asks to -congratulate- them on a certain occasion. On October 11, apocalyptic images appeared: military equipment, planes and houses - everything is engulfed in fire. Tetyana Bondar prefers simpler content. More photos of the military and military equipment, less prayers. The first publications appeared on March 25, 2023, and on September 5, 2024, the first post with a -Ukrainian warrior-. There are many more Orthodox-oriented pages than those described above, but their content is not particularly diverse. Group -God is with us- liked by 11 thousand users, another 79 thousand profiles --God Loves You-, in-Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-'s audience is 60 thousand profiles and almost as many - 59 thousand have-JESUS ​​LOVES YOU -. The content is mostly similar: 9 out of 10 posts are prayers and messages from God. The rest of the posts feature happy people (women, children, farmers, a couple 50 years ago and now), flowers and weddings. Military figures are often found among such images, most of which are smiling and happy. Although there are also sad ones - with the consequences of injuries. There is also -apocalyptic- content - AI generated explosions, tanks and planes during the battle. -God is with us- began to actively publish -Ukrainian soldiers- from September 26, 2024. The -JESUS ​​LOVES YOU- community has streamed content with -Military Armed Forces- since November 21, 2024. The situation is similar with the content of the pages -God Loves You- and -Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-. Probably the most mysterious and illogical group of pages under investigation has the general name -nonsense-. These profiles cannot be attributed to the three previous groups either by photo or by information content. Who is this Luis Canuto is unknown, but this page has 53 thousand readers. - Masano's Machine-has an audience of 17 thousand,Trisec - 22 thousand readers and 29,000 profiles on the pageRichard . Luis Canuto has been publishing -patriotic- posts with Ukrainian soldiers - boys and girls - since June 2, 2023. These are both individual portraits and group images of soldiers. There may be children, babies in your arms, or pets - cats and dogs. At first, real photos were used, but over time, AI-generated images began to dominate. Interestingly, during the -promotion- of the page, preference was given to pictures with girls in uniforms and captions in the style of -looking for a partner-. After November 9, 2024, the content changed, with fewer girls. Instead, there was more politics, and the posts concerned the commanders of the Azov unit, Petro Poroshenko, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, Vasyl Malyuk, and Dmytro Yarosh. There are also generated images of soldiers with amputations and posts with Orthodox prayers. The feature of this profile is publications with calls for peace with Russia. There is also video content with opposition political scientists, clips with various conspiracy theories, and negativity regarding mobilization events (against the TCC and the police). The main communication message: the Russians will never end, because there are more of them; the police and the TCC catch people illegally; Ukraine's economy is collapsing; the last thing is taken away from the people through unjust taxes. Trisec began its activity on June 1, 2023 with the publication of neutral landscapes of nature, and the first photo with -Ukrainian military- appeared on April 30, 2024. The content is mostly warm and family: father with children; soldier with grandfather; daughter and father in military uniform; grandmothers with a grandson in their arms; veterans with medals; wedding of a military couple; a soldier with a newborn baby; bread; embroidered shirts; harvesting; soldier's friendship. This list is supplemented by a small number of AI-generated images of soldiers with amputations, photos of cemeteries and -prayer-. Among others, this profile features a small number of Soviet-era photos of children's friendship in the USSR, images from Soviet cartoons, and cover pages of birth certificates. Recent posts include birthday wishes. Among the celebrants are a pilot, a soldier, and a 5-year-old girl. There are also posts with videos. These posts are downright negative. For example, the outrageous communication of citizens with the TCC and the police. On the Richard page, among the AI-generated images, there are also publications about real units of the Armed Forces. The content is mostly neutral - clips collected from the Internet about the activities of the Armed Forces and many videos of domestic topics with girls of Asian appearance. Which posts appeared on the investigated pages for the first time and what is their communication direction? -Congratulations on the birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)- was created on April 5, 2022, the capital letter P on a colored background was published . -I love Ukraine- was created on May 26, 2022, capital letter Я was published on a colored background. Richard was created as Gedine on 17 June 2022, renamed to Meghan Markle History on 9 December 2023. Rihcart renamed on 19 Aug 2024, first published on 17 June 2022, this is a capital letter V on a colored background. JESUS ​​LOVES YOU - 16 Aug 2022, first published as a neutral illustration. -Chernetska Victoria- became just that August 22, 2024, and before that it was called -God is with us-, page created on October 20, 2022, published capital letter G on a colored background. Luis Canuto created on January 14, 2023, published capital letter L on a colored background background. -God Loves You- was created February 3, 2023, capital letter B on a colored background was published. -Tetyana Bondar- was created on March 25, 2023, capital letter H was published on a colored background. -Almighty Ukraine- was created on April 1 2023, capital letter B on colored background published. Music1 created March 30, 2023, the first post was a neutral image. Vitannyachko was created on April 8, 2023, the first post was a neutral image. Risec created on June 1, 2023, a capital letter T was published on a colored tli. -God is with us- was created on July 13 2023, a capital letter B on a colored background was published. Oksana Kostenko was created on August 22, 2024, a capital letter O was published on a colored background. The texts of the publications of all investigated pages have one common feature. To summarize, it is an -artificial- language. Obviously, online translators were used for this, which immediately catches the eye. On almost all pages, the first posts were made in Russian, and already today Ukrainian language dominates with signs of machine translation. Russian words and sentences sometimes appear in the texts. In -Oksana Kostenko-, in addition to Ukrainian and Russian, there are posts in English. A notable feature is also the fact that photos and text of publications may be repeated on different pages in different periods. It looks like a certain circulation of content. In their posts, the authors of the publications often encourage users to join the conversation in the messenger chats. Each page may have its own chat, but these calls are very similar. As a rule, these are dramatic illustrations with battle mutilations, apocalyptic images, as well as active text injection, followed by an offer to learn more. For example: why the war will not end or how to save your life. To find out, you need to join the chat. Posts are obviously written in a foreign language, and not necessarily in Russian, and then translated into Ukrainian through online translators or AI-chat. Considering the number of followers on each page, the vast majority of posts are unpopular. An average post collects 100-200 reactions, but there are also posts without a single like per day. Therefore, it can be assumed that the active audience is extremely small. For example, Luis Canuto publishes several posts every day, most of which have between 0 and 100 likes and comments. However, the recent publication -True friendship of Ukrainian soldiers- with an artificially generated image received 6 thousand reactions. Another post with an AI picture -This Ukrainian military man finally got married- has 2.3 thousand reactions and 166 comments. Obviously, such publications are popularized artificially by paying for advertising on Facebook. Among the investigated pages, -Almighty Ukraine- stands out. Individual posts in this community have garnered more than 10,000 reactions and hundreds of appreciative comments for Ukrainian soldiers from profiles that look like the pages of real people. Facebook provides the ability to check information about the main countries/regions of residence of the people who manage the pages. What is the geography of the administrators of groups that so actively get into the recommendation tape of Ukrainians. -Almighty Ukraine-: Armenia - 2 administrators; -I love Ukraine-: Armenia - 4 administrators; -Welcome-: Austria - 10 administrators; Italy - 2; Spain - 4; Music 1: Indonesia - 10; -Chernetska Victoria-: Spain - 10; Italy - 2; Indonesia is 1; Netherlands - 1; -Tetiana Tetiana Bondar-: Spain - 5; Czech Republic - 2; -Oksana Kostenko-: France - 9; Germany - 4; Spain - 3; Greece - 1; Hungary - 1; Italy - 1; -God Loves You-: Spain— 11; Netherlands - 5; Portugal - 3; Serbia - 1; -Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-: Spain — 13; Netherlands - 1; JESUS ​​LOVES YOU: Spain - 12; Germany - 1; Greece - 1; Italy - 1; Ukraine - 1; Luis Canuto: Indonesia - 3; Trisec: Indonesia - 14; Richard: (listed address London street, London, United Kingdom, +44 7167 856765), Indonesia - 5; -Masano Machine-: Indonesia - 4. Military expert Petro Chernyk reflects on what goals are pursued by the activities of such groups, what Such content is dangerous and as evidenced by the geography of the administrators of these pages. -Unfortunately, we still have a rather large number of Ukrainian citizens who look at this war on the principle of- brother -in -law -. The overall numerical potential of such citizens is within 7-8 percent, which is a fairly fertile field for a potential -masked- Russophile political project. Social networks and the ROC religious sect are platforms for the potential promotion of the political project in the interests of Russia. The analysis of the presidents of the administrators mentioned by Facebook indicates that these are the countries where it has (small) branch and influence of Russia today. It is not necessary to mislead that, in a number of European countries, the mentioned resource is prohibited. The enemy has long entered their networks not only at the official level, but also through the giant network of various humanitarian organizations, etc. -. Petro Chernyk confirmed the conclusions made by the results of the general analysis of these pages. In fact, these communities only seem patriotic, and their true goal is to climb into the heads of Ukrainians and focus their attention on the topics required by the enemy to destroy the unity of Ukrainian society. Obviously, despite the geographical diversity of administrators, these pages are interconnected and have a common purpose. Who or what can unite administrators with Indonesia, Armenia, Spain or Denmark? It seems that the geographical center, like the decision -making center, is located in Russia. In favor of this version, certain trends are evidenced in the history of the communities under study. For example, the time of creation and activation of activity during the active phase of the Russian war against Ukraine. It is also noticeable to the synchronicity of publications for a certain communication purpose, similar to the design of profiles and the identity of content - both text and images from video. Together, all these signs indicate that Russia in the Ukrainian segment of social networks conducts a broad information operation of low intensity with a single coordination and a common plan. For example, warriors with amputations, cemeteries, poor conditions are psychologically associated with the futility of the struggle. Religious content and prayers subconsciously adjust to humility - the task of a person to pray, and God - a more visible winner in the war. Which fits into the general concept of hybrid war against Ukraine, when, in addition to measures of active influence, hostilities, information is used against Ukrainians. In the short term, the purpose of such an operation may be: poor quality of publications - both text and photo - designed for the basic level of society, as well as for sympathizers on religious, political or other characteristics. It is an effort to marginalize certain layers of society. These are -ideological sabotages-, and on social networks they were moved from real life. Such a technique was used in the USSR, and described it by the KGB agent under the cover of Yuri Bezmanov, who at one time worked in Delhi. The point is that ordinary people who are sorry for the -wounded- or want to -congratulate the warrior's birthday- are used as -useful idiots-. The ultimate goal is to influence people's views and, in the end, change them to the right ones. And if there were decades to achieve the goals earlier, then in the social networking era you can do it much faster. The activities of the communities under study are primarily aimed at deepening despair and contradiction among Ukrainians. And here on the hand of the enemy is played by both those who put liked in such groups, and those who call for it not to do it, because in this way there is already a split between them. Old good tactics -Do not feed the troll-: - skip the following recommendations to make them less in the news feed; - to put and comment on the posts of only those people who know personally, or confident in the reality of their existence; - Before reacting to the publication, event, or comment, ask yourself: to whom and in what benefit will my emotion and action be? - It is necessary to find a common language with those who have already hit the hook of the Russian IPSO and to be tolerant of communication, trying to explain that they unconsciously help the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vijna-u-facebook-yak-protydiyaty-vorozhij-fejkoepidemiyi-zgenerovanij-shtuchnym-intelektom/	2024-12-14T22:08:25-08:00
Making troops invisible: France promotes new camouflage -nanofabric-	How declared experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, developed by the enterpriseKastinger and commercialized by PGM Précision HT4® technology, often referred to as -heat with an invisibility cloak,- opens up new opportunities for the armed forces, ArmiyaInform notes. The material produced by HT4® technology was approved by the French Defense Innovation Agency and selected by the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA). This development, also known as Poncho Infrarouge pour Kits de Survie (PIKS) (Infrared Poncho for Survival Kits, in Ukrainian), provides omnidirectional and adaptive thermal protection, effectively concealing even intense heat sources up to 1000°C, such as helicopter turbine. This technology works by absorbing and reflecting NIR, SWIR, MWIR, LWIR and FIR infrared radiation. Designed to protect personnel and equipment, the HT4® counters a wide range of anti-thermal threats, from monocular thermal devices to sensors mounted on drones and fighter jets. HT4® stands out for its flexibility and adaptability. Whether used in extreme climates or diverse environments, this innovative material can regulate temperature to provide near-total thermal invisibility. Its ability to hide not only soldiers, but also to cover large equipment such as vehicles and aircraft, making them invisible to thermal cameras even after landing, is an important asset for extreme military operations. HT4®'s signature anti infrared fabric is made in camouflage (tarp/poncho, etc.). This makes it possible to use its daytime masking effect on the one hand, and its absorption of thermal radiation on the other, guaranteeing maximum efficiency. Because of this, the following camo colors are available: Brown/Green, Desert, City/Rock, Snow. Its products are resistant to extreme temperatures: thanks to its excellent temperature regime, this fabric keeps you warm in cold periods and cool in hot weather. Thus, it provides excellent thermal protection for personnel working in extreme environmental conditions. This fabric is light, breathable and durable. The properties of this material allow you to equip personnel without causing discomfort, it has excellent resistance to abrasion. Products made of HT4® fabric are compact, which facilitates their transportation. The HT4® fabric has been tested by the DGA (French Directorate General of Armaments), which concluded that it provides -a real gain in reducing the infrared signature of the elements being defended-. In coordination with the DGA-CF2S campaign, the French Air Force Command also authorized the use of camouflage in flight crew survival kits. Numerous tests of various military devices using such camouflage have been conducted using a wide range of air-to-ground and ground-to-surface sensors (JIM LR2, Pod Rafale, C3ISTAR, Sophie Ultima, FLIR, Reaper, etc. ). PGM Précision emphasized the value of working with the DGA in implementing this technology, acknowledging the agency's expertise and support throughout the HT4® development process. This official recognition highlights HT4®'s potential to transform military camouflage, allowing armed forces to conduct operations more stealthily, even in areas controlled by advanced detection systems. The success of the HT4® also reflects the growing interest in advanced thermal camouflage solutions in the defense industry. While some countries are focusing on developing new detection technologies, others, such as France with HT4®, are promoting innovations that challenge these surveillance systems. This technology is compatible with a new generation of thermal camouflage that meets the challenges posed by state-of-the-art detection sensors. The future of military camouflage appears to be moving towards active camouflage solutions, the use of adaptive materials, nanotechnology and biomimicry to make the armed forces invisible even to AI-controlled devices. HT4®'s impact is likely to extend beyond military applications; this innovation can also inspire development in fields such as wildlife conservation and urban planning, where concealment or visual integration can be crucial. HT4® marks a significant step in this continuous evolution. With its ability to provide effective thermal invisibility in extreme environments, this innovation may well redefine stealth on the modern battlefield, prompting military forces to adopt new cloaking strategies to stay ahead of the technological race. How other countries and industries will respond to this advancement remains to be seen, but it is clear that HT4® is a turning point in the history of camouflage technology. Presentation of material produced by HT4® technology.

The enemy is dispersing fakes about -Ukrainian traces- in Syria and Georgia	At first, information began to spread in pro-Russian telegram channels that the fighters of the -Georgian Legion- due to the protests that broke out in Tbilisi were -abandoning Ukraine- and returning home to join the rallies. The press service of the legion categorically denied these accusations, calling them baseless. Also, the other day, the news spread in the Russian information space that in Ukraine, according to an announcement on the Work.ua platform, they are allegedly looking for -tough guys to participate in the protests in Georgia.- At the same time, activists are promised payment of UAH 2,000 per day, accommodation and food, as well as free border crossing. The foreign passport of a Ukrainian, which was allegedly found in Tbilisi on Rustaveli Avenue, is cited as -evidence-. By reverse image search of the Gwara project fact checker found ads about this lost passport from December 29, 2020. In fact, they lost it in the city of Uzhhorod at the bus station. The -Activist- vacancy in question was, of course, never posted on the Work.ua platform. This screenshot is fake. The head of the Work.ua moderation department notes that such fakes are usually created by editing the page code in the browser. This approach is technically simple, but it misleads users by creating the illusion of publication on the site. Propagandists also continue to reproduce myths about the -Ukrainian footprint- in Syria, in particular statements about the cooperation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with groups such as -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-, adding them to their speeches in international organizations. Rospropaganda creates such fakes to discredit Ukrainians and Ukrainian authorities in the eyes of the international community. They are baseless and not supported by any evidence. Their goal is to divert attention from the actions of Russia and its war crimes. The strategy of discrediting Ukraine is also aimed at legitimizing Russian aggression, portraying it as an alleged fight against global terrorism. But this strategy exposes the contradictions in Russian propaganda, which falls into its own traps and is quite often unable to explain its many fabrications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vorog-rozganyaye-fejky-pro-ukrayinskyj-slid-u-syriyi-ta-gruziyi/	2024-12-14T20:45:59-08:00
The voice of the information war: about the enemy's Achilles heel, love through strength and the fai...	Correspondent ArmiyaInform asked Professor Pocheptsov at what stage Ukraine is now in the context of conducting an information war with the Russian Federation; what are the enemy's strengths and weaknesses in this context; whether the voice of our state sounds loud enough during a duel with the enemy in virtual space, and not only that. —In your opinion, has the methodology of conducting information warfare by the Russians changed in 10 years, since 2014? How? — The approach has become more differentiated for different audiences. In 2014, everything was more unified. Russia is actively entering the mass consciousness around the world with the help of fake sites that are perceived as its own. Because of this, she has a louder -voice- than we do. Although it is hidden in other people's performances&#8230; In general, propaganda is closer to art than to science. This is a kind of political poetry, not just a newspaper article. We are oriented more towards the Soviet variant of propaganda, when everyone is silent and listens to one voice. This will no longer be the case: instead of a monologue, propaganda becomes a dialogue. That's how the audience should feel about her. —In your book -Modern Information Wars- you introduced the concept of semantic warfare. As of December 2024, according to your observations, who is leading in the semantic war: Ukraine or the Russian Federation? Argue. - Everyone is fighting for their own audience, for those who can become their favorite. Everyone wins in their own audience. We cannot win in the minds of the Russian audience because we cannot be heard. We should work more actively with Russians who emigrated, because their voices and faces are familiar to the Russian audience. The audience always wants to hear something of their own, close to their ideas. And this is exactly the kind of channel we need. —The Russo-Ukrainian war seems to be an example of virtual reality giving rise to physical war. What do you think are the ways to end this war? What is the role of quality communication in establishing a just peace? - Unfortunately, the peace will not be very just, because everyone has different goals. Russia generally says that they included our territories in their constitution. And this is absurd, because in this way they can introduce, for example, Belgium, and then say: -It is in our constitution, what can we do.- —Which cases of strategic communication on the part of Ukraine during the large-scale invasion would you call a successful example in the conduct of information and semantic warfare? And what has our state failed in terms of communication? And what can we fix? - Ukraine has done the most important thing - the world's leading media, as well as countries, are on our side. Russia wants to bring love closer to itself by force, and this is a failed strategy. As a result, Russia simply took the old place of the USSR as an eternal enemy. - And what are the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy in this sense? - They know us well, this allows us to place the necessary emphasis everywhere. And the downside is that they are less aware of how we have changed since the beginning of the war. The downside of Russia is the large number of opposition websites abroad, as well as the huge number of politicians, writers, and cultural figures who emigrated. These are all familiar names and faces&#8230; And they are against it. Not because of our propaganda, but because of Russia's actions. Today we are very far from them, but we should -sing- together. We must talk to them based on their arguments. This is a big space that Russia simply cannot censor . And it will grow louder as the war wears on. - At one time you stated that -war is a reality check of the state.- In the third year of the large-scale — has, in your opinion, our state passed this test? — the war passed the test, but the creation of propaganda both for its own audience and for foreign ones did not pass. We have a very weak -voice-. Propagandists during this time were to become the most recognizable figures to the audience. It is difficult to believe in an abstract state voice, people believe in concrete figures. - According to you, the three pain points targeted by communications during wartime are your own population, enemy population, and neutrals. In your opinion, is Ukraine -working through- all these three pain points? As? And what can be improved? - The West does the work for us, talking to its own population and neutrals. And we have not yet learned to talk in such a way that people drop everything and go to the TV to listen to a specific person. Levitan only read other people's texts, and felt like a propagandist, because during the war there is always a lack of information. - To quote you: -Information warfare is a flute tune, propaganda is a brass band that is heard even when one does not want to.- In your opinion, how audible is the flute from Ukraine now? How good is this sound? - Our -flute- is weak. She has a vague idea of ​​what to emphasize. Relatively speaking: what is needed is not just the truth, but an accurate truth that cannot be stopped&#8230; —What advice would you give to Ukrainian civilians to strengthen their emotional resilience at this time? Any advice for every day, -how to preserve clarity of thinking and freedom of action- in the time of flooding with disinformation and hostile IPSO? - We must educate our own agitators and propagandists, whose speeches the population would expect every night. The population wants to hear honest words that at the same time carry positivity. And specific faces that are trusted. - You say that -human history is built on the history of dreams- and that -man lives in dreams-, even though it is about visual space. How would you advise Ukrainians to visualize their dreams, being in a country in a state of war, so that later there would be no disappointments, no pain? - It will definitely hurt, because a compromise is not a victory. Or is a temporary victory. But there is no other option. If we are in a war, we must win.

Returned from the USA and defends Ukraine - an American pilot destroys the enemy with drones	The video about the soldier appeared on December 14 on the battalion page. Since then, he managed to serve in several positions in various units, but found his vocation in the ranks of operators of strike drones. -For me, this is both a job, and a hobby, and a business that I really like,- says -American-. His work is not just operations. This is the systematic destruction of the enemy and his equipment on an industrial scale. For more details about the more than 10-year journey of a warrior and his motivation to continue fighting for his native land, see the video: &nbsp; As ArmiyaInform reported, more than 40 units of Russian equipment and weapons destroyed for 10 days of December, fighters of 37 separate brigade of marines and 505 separate battalion of marines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/povernuvsya-z-ssha-i-zahyshhaye-ukrayinu-pilot-amerykanecz-nyshhyt-voroga-dronamy/	2024-12-14T10:57:51-08:00
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine discussed cyber security with American diplomats	This was announced by the Minister of Defense on the evening of December 14. According to Rustem Umyerov, the director of the US Department of Military Innovation Doug Beck and the US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink also joined the discussion. -The key focus of the meeting is cyber security, where Ukraine seeks to adopt the US experience in countering digital threats as much as possible. We have a successful example of cooperation with American experts from the Hunt Forward team, thanks to which we jointly identify vulnerabilities in our digital systems and strengthen protection. At the same time, our state is already demonstrating that it is capable not only of learning, but also of sharing its own advanced developments,- assured Rustem Umyerov. The minister and his team presented the digital solutions of the Ministry of Defense to the American delegation: -We agreed with Nathaniel Fick and Doug Beck on further deepening of cooperation between Ukraine and the USA in the field of cyber security. The priorities are to increase investment in our innovations, strengthen the digital infrastructure that is invulnerable to the attacks of the aggressor, and introduce the latest technologies, including artificial intelligence. I thank the partners from the USA for the comprehensive support of Ukraine and help in the development of cyber defense,- Rustem Umyerov noted. As reported by ArmyInform, Rustem Umyerov discussed with the EU Commissioner of the threat of escalation of Russian aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/ministr-oborony-ukrayiny-obgovoryv-z-amerykanskymy-dyplomatamy-kiberbezpeku/	2024-12-14T10:54:33-08:00

Good weather to die - Russians prefer to die in the sunlight	About this on the ArmyTV stream the officer of the public relations service of the 37th marine brigade, junior lieutenant Denys, told Bobkov. -The last few days, when the weather was bad, the number of enemy runs decreased. It's raining, wheeled machinery can hardly be used, heavy machinery as well. But as soon as the swamp froze, the number of assaults immediately increased from 2-3 to 7-8,- said Denys Bobkov. According to him, Russian assault groups always go with EW devices in shoulder bags. Drones are also actively used. -Enemy assault groups don't move just like that, they are always accompanied by FPV drones and drones with resets,- said Denis Bobkov. When using armored vehicles, a Russian tank is always at the head of the column, followed by an infantry fighting vehicle, and then less armored vehicles, such as BRDM or armored personnel carriers. There can be from 3 to 7 cars in a convoy. -The infantry is well equipped, it's not mobs. They know what they are doing, they are trained. The enemy is prepared,- said Denys Bobkov. As reported by ArmyInform, over 40 units of Russian equipment and weapons were destroyed in 10 days of December by fighters of 37 separate brigade of marines and 505 separate battalion of marines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/horosha-pogoda-shhob-pomerty-rosiyany-voliyut-gynuty-na-sonyachnomu-svitli/	2024-12-14T10:41:19-08:00

A column of Russian landing craft tried to reach our positions. But the enemy's equipment was still damaged. The landing party left the -boxes- and tried to hide in the forest strip, where the drones began hunting for him. In the same way, the immobilized equipment of the occupiers was also sought with drones. -According to the results of the battle, our brigade destroyed 6 BMD and 2 motor vehicles. 8 enemies were eliminated, another 13 were wounded. Glory to the marines!-, the 36th brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the fighters of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinskyi destroyed three Russian BMD units .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/spalyly-6-bmd-i-dobyly-dronamy-desant-mykolayivski-morpihy-vidbyly-shturm-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-14T10:22:17-08:00
Good news from Kurshchyna - the people of Kimcheniv shot the people of Kadyrov	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 14. The aggressor state of Russia began to use North Korean soldiers in assault operations in the Kursk region, in particular, as part of combined units of the marines and airborne troops of the Soviet Union. The North Korean troops have already suffered the first sanitary and irreversible losses as a result of successful fire damage inflicted by soldiers of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine. In particular, at one of the positions in the Kursk region, military personnel of the North Korean army were effectively -covered- with FPV drones. Estimated losses of units staffed by Russian and North Korean personnel as of December 14, 2024 amount to about 200 servicemen. In the process of using North Korean troops on the battlefield, the language barrier remains a difficult obstacle for management and coordination of actions. Due to this problem, North Korean soldiers opened -friendly fire- on the vehicles of the so-called -Ahmat- battalion. The result was eight killed -Kadyrivs-. We will remind you that there are about 11,000 servicemen of the North Korean army on the territory of Russia.

- Major renovation - occupants: four houses in a year and dreams of water	This was reported by Artem Lysogor, head of the Luhansk OVA. For comparison, much more work was done in the rear settlements, not covered by hostilities, which underlines the negligent attitude of the occupiers to the frontline territories. The situation is even worse in neighboring Pryville. There is not even an attempt to restore basic communications. Electricity and centralized water supply have been missing for more than two and a half years. Local residents are forced to buy technical water, which is delivered from time to time. The price is one ruble per liter, which is unaffordable for many. According to Lysohor, the actions of the occupation administration confirm their complete inability to provide even the minimum conditions for life in the occupied territories. As reported by ArmyInform, in 77% of the settlements of the so-called LNR, namely in 714 out of 920, it is impossible to purchase medicine. Local residents have to travel dozens of kilometers to get essential medical supplies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/velykyj-remont-okupantiv-chotyry-budynky-za-rik-i-mriyi-pro-vodu/	2024-12-14T10:01:05-08:00
He went to the front as a schoolboy, his mother did not know - the story of the youngest soldier of ...	The post about the fighter appeared on December 14 on the brigade channel. Mother did not know that Nikita went to war, and father went missing at the front. -If I was making good money and paying a lot of taxes, maybe I wouldn't have made such a decision. But at the moment I have nothing to give to the state except myself. My mother and my younger sister went abroad at the beginning of the war. When I joined the army, I just didn't say anything to her so she wouldn't worry. She thought I was in Mykolaiv until my brother told me,- says Nikita. His father was a volunteer, fighting since 2014. -In the summer, when I passed the BZVP, he went missing in the Pokrovsky direction. I don't want to entertain myself with vain hope. Therefore, he resigned himself to the thought that he would not return. And I had a desire to kill enemies,- shared Nikita. He is now a Mavik pilot. -I like everything here. Sometimes something flies in, but so far it's more fun than scary. In such stressful situations, on the contrary, I gather, I become more cheerful and confident,- said Nikita.

So far only there. But we have information that it can be used in other areas of the front as well. Losses among this category are already noticeable,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He stated that, in fact, Moscow involved another state in this war, and involved it as much as possible. -And if this is not an escalation, then what is the escalation that many have been talking about? It is Putin who is taking steps that expand and continue this war. It is he who repels the possibility of peace. And he wants the world to have more problems in Asia as well. This is why the Russians are training North Korea in modern warfare,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. In his opinion, Moscow ignores the calls of all countries, from China and Brazil to many others, regarding the need to do everything for de-escalation. -If there is no strong reaction from the world, Russia is making the war worse. Always so. We will defend ourselves, including against these North Koreans. We will continue to act in coordination with all our partners to stop this war — to stop it reliably, with guaranteed peace,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He said that next week he will speak in Europe about joint work. -Sanctions against Russia, support for our defense, investments in Europe's common defense and strong diplomacy for the sake of peace - these are things that should be increased every week, so that next year, together with our partners, we will be able to achieve our main goal,- the President noted.

Before the battle - only after the psychostrip: how to additionally prepare for the front line in -o...	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform saw with their own eyes how the instructors of the 115th separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine set up and pass a psychological test to assess its complexity before starting training with newly arrived fighters. The psycho lane is designed to prepare servicemen for actions in units on the front line. First of all, it is intended for those who come to the brigade from training centers after basic general military training. It enables newly arrived fighters to psychologically and physically enter the conditions of combat operations. -Psychosmuga adapts fighters to entering the area of ​​hostilities so that they do not experience shock, there is no difference in adaptation, so that they are ready for what happens directly on the battlefield,- explains Chief Sergeant Serhiy Korolev with the call sign -Funtik-. . Every fighter in the brigade has to pass the psycho lane. After BZVP in training centers, they have about a week to adapt, after which they go on combat missions. Then, with individual elements of the psycho lane, fighters also work during internal rotation within the brigade. — Here there are elements of tactics, elements of power loads, basic elements of combat operations. Next is directly the simulation of combat operations with the execution of shooting exercises. All this makes it possible to adapt the fighters to combat, so that newly arrived fighters do not feel the shock of entering combat directly, the instructor says about the psycho zone. Psychological adaptation is necessary first of all for newly arrived fighters, because those who come to the rotation have already been on the front lines. Therefore, they work primarily on improving tactics, taking into account the change in the situation on the front lines. - During the rotation, those who go out not only rest and put their weapons and clothes in order. They also go to the tactical field to practice some tactical elements of movement and combat work, taking into account the current situation on the front line, emphasizes the master sergeant. In order to accept the newly installed psycho lane and now demonstrate how its passage along its entire length, which is about half a kilometer, takes place, the instructors use the entire training arsenal for newcomers - explosions, smoke, overcoming absolutely all available obstacles, practicing assault actions in the trenches and shooting at three guns borders The start of the psycho lane is a steep rocky slope that the runner must overcome with the constant danger of landslides and rocks. To maintain balance, not to lose breath, not to lose speed - all this is not easy even for companions without weapons and BC. Fighters have to do it in full gear - and this is just the beginning. In the next stage, the soldiers are met with loud explosions, thick smoke and difficult obstacles to overcome. To overcome them, one should be physically hardy and psychologically prepared, able to control one's body and emotions, always be ready for unexpected changes and to perform difficult tasks in conditions of smoke, increased noise, and breathing problems. In the first few sections of the psycho lane, the fighters pass the so-called -crossroads- - automobile ramps laid out in two adjacent lanes. You should go through them with the maximum possible speed, jumping from one tire to another. To an outside observer, the task may seem quite simple and even somewhat amusing, but in reality it is quite tiring and at the same time important. Thanks to it, the fighter learns to subconsciously and automatically control the position of his body, to feel in advance where and how the leg will land, and how to compensate for the tilt with the movement of the whole body. - This allows a person to concentrate as much as possible on the conditions of movement, in the conditions of an uneven surface - stones, pits, whirlpools from explosions. When you need to move to your positions or go on the offensive, the ground will not be flat, it constantly has some potholes, some slopes, - explains the meaning of the -Funtik- exercise. Then the complexity of obstacles and tasks only increases. Barbed wire, a wobbly bridge over a stream, a forest clearing, a maze, overcoming a wall - all this is quickly overcome in thick smoke and amid explosions that ring out from both sides of the psycho lane. We barely have time to follow the instructors and manage to get a good shot of the training amid the smoke. Climbing the steep slope, we can only imagine how difficult it is for two fighters to lift an almost 30-kilogram box with ammunition. And in combat conditions, notes the senior sergeant, a situation may arise when BC will have to be delivered alone, so working in pairs is an even easier option. - This is the main element of the load, after which the fighter will experience discomfort and shock in breathing. Therefore, you should learn to breathe properly and move properly in such a way as to avoid injury, explains the chief sergeant and adds that simply climbing the BC up the slope is still far from the most difficult of the possible options. Finally, after passing through a maze, jumping over a wall, another rubble and logs on rivchakami, the fighters go to storm the trenches and dugouts. After a difficult race and overcoming obstacles, this difficult task becomes even more difficult, this is the only way to get as close as possible to real combat conditions. - This is already an element of the combat situation - enemy positions, trenches, dugouts. It already includes working out the tactics of assault actions - how to enter positions, how fighters cut corners when passing enemy trenches, how to enter dark dugouts. In a combat situation, all turns, all elements behind which the enemy can hide, are controlled, the instructor comments. It is this element of the psycho lane that is important for practice not only for beginners, but also for those who have already managed to get used to explosions, smoke and a space cluttered with rubble and debris while in combat positions. At the end of overcoming the psycho lane, we enter the firing lines. There are three of them, and on each of them we can see how exhausting the previous exercises were and how much they affected the shooting accuracy of the fighters. The first firing line is designed to practice moving around the battlefield using cover and shooting from awkward positions. In this exercise, there is also an element of tactics of moving in pairs in difficult terrain among the ruins and rubble of buildings. The next firing range is the trenches, from which the fighters practice firing at aerial targets. These can be -maviks- or FPV drones, bomber drones with drops or kamikaze drones. - The final score is shooting from three positions: standing, kneeling and prone. This happens after great physical and psychological stress, after a shock state of the body. It shows the real accuracy of a fighter's shooting in difficult combat conditions, Serhii Korolev explains. Shooting accuracy, he emphasizes, is the key to survival on the battlefield. If a soldier is aimed at an enemy, it destroys him and secures himself. On the other hand, in the case of low accuracy, the enemy's chances of hitting a Ukrainian fighter increase significantly. — When a serviceman sees that after loads he has a deterioration in shooting accuracy compared to performing the same exercises in a calm state, he understands that he needs to work to have a high level of survival in combat conditions. That is, there is both an element of preparation and an element of motivation here, emphasizes the chief sergeant. The accuracy of the instructors, despite the previous loads, is high, and they are generally satisfied with the psycho lane - for a soldier after passing the BZVP, it will be difficult, but surmountable. Passing such a psycho lane, the fighter will be able to feel himself in conditions as close as possible to combat and not only check, but also significantly improve his level of training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/do-boyu-tilky-pislya-psyhosmugy-yak-dodatkovo-gotuyut-do-peredovoyi-v-suhoputczi-reportazh/	2024-12-13T21:19:30-08:00
Videos and deepfakes with alleged Ukrainian military appear on the network: why is this the enemy	-Military- first allegedly walked along the side of the highway for almost 500 kilometers in the direction of Lviv (which is physically almost impossible without rest, food and sleep), then for four hours he tried to stop his companion, but no one stopped him, until he -picked up - this civilian male driver. Actually, this video is a production. The dialogue between the civilian male driver and the alleged military man is filmed by a person sitting in the back seat of the car, to whom the -military man- for some reason does not pay any attention, even when the video is filmed from a very close angle. In turn, the driver reacts suspiciously calmly to the words of the -military man- about the alleged lack of money, at least for the bus; two years of captivity; about the fact that the -military- community during this time had already managed to -bury- him, erecting a monument to him, etc. In addition, the -military man- says that he has been fighting since 2013, although the Russian-Ukrainian war began only in 2014. In another video, which the enemy is spreading on social networks, a Ukrainian military man allegedly complains about arbitrariness employees of the TCC, the difficult situation at the front, the unprofessionalism of commanders, losses among personnel and calls on Ukrainian men not to go to war. However, in reality this the video was created with the help of artificial intelligence, report in the VoxCheck project. The original source of the video is an anonymous profile on Tiktok, where the author publishes videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel and prisoners of war. A check by the Hive Moderation AI tool revealed that the profile contained videos that were generated using a neural network. Accordingly, the tool showed that the appeal of a serviceman talking about the difficult situation at the front was also created with the help of AI. The purpose of such videos is to increase the gap between the military and civilians, as well as to misinform the Ukrainian society about the real situation on the front and disrupt mobilization. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/u-merezhi-zyavlyayutsya-video-ta-dipfejky-z-nibyto-ukrayinskymy-vijskovymy-nashho-cze-vorogu/	2024-12-13T20:42:28-08:00
A captured Mamley, enemy BK porters and 70 Muscovites in two hours: Sergeant - Horn - told about ene...	What are the biggest losses for the day for the Russians? But what is the scariest thing on the front now? The military man told our correspondents about this: -My best man and I were from the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the DFTG. And in 2023, they joined the ranks of the Armed Forces together. When I started serving in the brigade, I was initially appointed to the position of unit commander. And then the brigade sergeant major came, talked to our officers, and I was appointed deputy platoon leader. Since September 2023, I have already been in the combat zone in Donetsk region. Performed tasks at the KSP of the company as a chief sergeant. Our -birds- flew, watched, and I, accordingly, corrected the actions of our servicemen on the radio. My duties also included getting people in and out of positions. The enemy fired at us every day, assault groups attacked our positions every day. They could send one of their attack aircraft at us, they could send two, and they could send ten at once. We saw -birds- starting to climb. And our boys at the positions were already warned by radio station that traffic is coming at you from a certain direction, be ready. We fought back with the help of small arms, grenade launchers, mortars. It happens that at first their artillery -pours- on us, and then the infantry climbs up on us. And it just happens that they storm without artillery. Sometimes it even happened that our chances broke through. And our guys were already there then throwing grenades at them. As a rule, enemy soldiers are told that there is no one in our positions. They come, and there's -hello, we're here.- Their losses are huge. Somehow it happened that in a couple of hours we put about 70 occupants to death. It is a combination of wounded and killed. But their severely wounded do not return. And they are not evacuated, unless some officer. And if it is a lightly wounded person, then he must return himself. Sometimes they even come to us to surrender themselves as prisoners. Because there they can be shot by their own people. And these prisoners have one song: I didn't shoot, I was told to go forward, I was caught on the street, mobilized. Once we took the officer prisoner. Junior lieutenant. And then, thanks to him, we got access to their streams, with maps. This helped us a lot in planning later because we could see where their drones were flying. If we saw on their streams that an enemy -bird- was hanging over some place, then we did not go there. Well, now already in 2024, we observe this at the positions: if some experienced enemy stormtrooper is coming, then he is in body armor, a helmet, with a machine gun, and two porters are behind him, carrying BC in backpacks. And these porters are unarmed. &#8230;Our new recruits, who are just entering the position, need to be ready for everything. The most important thing is to listen, think and dig. To dig is to think about saving your life. The deeper you dig, the better. A shovel is your best friend. The scariest thing right now is FPV and drones with resets. Because you hear a mortar and understand that it will lie nearby somewhere, you understand by the sound. Therefore, the mortar, let's say, is not so scary now.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/polonenyj-mamlyej-vorozhi-nosylshhyky-bk-ta-70-moskaliv-za-dvi-godyny-serzhant-horn-rozpoviv-pro-vorozhi-shturmy/	2024-12-13T20:14:49-08:00

The Armed Forces outnumber the Russian artillery in some areas by three times	Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesman for the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, said this on the air of the telethon. -If at the beginning of the war the ratio was 5:1 in favor of Russia, now in certain areas of the front Ukrainian artillery prevails over the enemy with a coefficient of 1.5:1 or even 3:1,- Voloshyn noted. He added that Ukrainian artillery focuses on pinpoint strikes on specific targets, while the Russians often fire across large squares, which reduces their effectiveness. Due to this, Russia loses its advantage in artillery and tries to compensate for it by using aviation. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction, the intensity of combat action was the highest - 47 enemy assaults were stopped there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/13/zsu-perevazhayut-rosijsku-artyleriyu-na-deyakyh-dilyankah-u-try-razy/	2024-12-13T11:58:51-08:00

They specifically waited for frosty weather to make things worse for people — the President	The President's address was published in the evening of December 13. -Thank you to our protectors of the sky. This was one of the biggest Russian attacks against our energy sector today. 94 missiles of various types, both cruise and ballistic. 81 were shot down. There were also almost 200 attack drones. In general, we can see that the Russians tried to overload our air defense, as they always do in such massive strikes. And also they specially waited for frosty weather to make things worse for people. The blow happened just before the cold weather. This is deliberate, cynical Russian terror against people. Each missile was aimed at one or another energy object, and thanks to the accuracy of our soldiers and the reliability of air defense systems, many were saved. Currently, power engineers and repair crews are working in the regions where needed. The system is being restored,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi assured. The President also spoke about the first meeting of the Technological Headquarters — a format that should bring more innovation to our Defense Forces. -The very issue of greater strength for air defense was discussed at this Technological Headquarters. About protection against missiles, protection against -Shaheeds-. We need even greater opportunities to knock down all this terrorist garbage,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. According to him, the Stavka meeting was attended not only by representatives of the army and the Security and Intelligence Forces, but also by weapons manufacturers, scientists, and people who know exactly what technological things can be done. -At the next meeting in this format, we expect concrete decisions. We will also involve other representatives of the defense-industrial complex. It is absolutely necessary to attract people from the volunteer community who have long been helping the army to become more technological. And it is technology that should become the answer to some key questions regarding the effectiveness of our units in combat operations. The more technologically advanced, the more lives are saved,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He also talked about new aid packages from Finland and the United States.

-The Workshop of Lies-: a Ukrainian book about the influence of Russian disinformation on the world	The publication describes how Russian media, social networks and cultural diplomacy have become tools of manipulation that influence society, public opinion and world politics. The book is designed to teach readers to recognize fakes and to think critically in the conditions of information wars. -Disinformation affects public opinion, and it affects the decisions of politicians. This is of existential importance for the support of Ukraine in the West. We wanted to create a tool that would make Kremlin propaganda powerless for those who read the book,- Viktor Berezenko noted. The book has already been presented at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the world's largest literary event, and is scheduled to be translated into English, Spanish and other languages. Presentations of international versions will take place in 2025 in the main capitals of the world, in particular in Brussels, Berlin, London and Washington. Special attention is paid to the cover of the book: a red spot symbolizes the dictator's profile, reminiscent of a comic book cloud from which blood flows. This is a metaphor for how misinformation breeds bloody conflict. The first copies were received by Mykhailo Fedorov, Kyrylo Budanov and servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -This is an important contribution to the fight for information security and public education,- said Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.

The F-16 window of opportunity will open wider: about the new -software- for the Ukrainian -Battle F...	-This proposed sale will improve Ukraine's ability to counter current and future threats by further equipping it for self-defense and regional security missions with more robust air defense capabilities. It will not be difficult for Ukraine to master this equipment and services in its own armed forces,- said in the press release. The package approved by the State Department includes consumables and equipment, spare parts for aircraft and their engines, support for repair, restoration and return of equipment, personnel training for training equipment, and a program to improve aircraft engine components. In addition, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will receive a joint mission planning system for its F-16s, special devices for uploading flight mission data, as well as technical and logistical services. These last three components of the support package are no less important than the aircraft or the weapons, because they create the operational environment in which the effectiveness of the F-16 fighters can significantly increase. The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is a tool for automated task planning in the interaction of various units. The system consists of computer hardware and Joint Mission Planning Environment (JMPE) software. In the US Air Force, the Joint Mission Planning System has been fully implemented since 2008. Since then, every fighter, bomber, refueler and helicopter has switched to JMPS for training, refueling and combat missions. Currently, the US Air Force continues to use JMPS, but in the future plans to switch to JOMS Core Mission Planning, or JOMS CMP, a new joint mission planning tool that uses an open systems architecture based on cloud technologies. At the same time, the Joint Mission Planning System is constantly being modernized, responding to current challenges and user needs, progress in the field of computer hardware (-hard-, -hard-) and software improvements (-soft-). As announces the US Air Force Materiel Command, in October 2020, JMPS was successfully tested for the first time in a virtual mission planning environment with the help of CloudOne, registering a 75 percent faster reporting time and receiving instant feedback from multiple locations. The transition from the JMPS monolithic architecture to the JOMS microservices architecture is planned to be completed by 2027, while the upgraded Joint Mission Planning System remains the best joint mission planning solution available for the F-16 outside of the United States. The information component is of primary importance in modern warfare, so the ability to receive and transmit data provides a decisive tactical advantage in combat. The exchange of information improves situational awareness, ensures coordination of actions and quick decision-making. In the case of the F-16, this is achieved by integrating the fighter into networked combat environments, within which it can exchange information in real time with command centers, other aircraft and ground units. The ability to receive and transmit data from the battlefield allows F-16 pilots to work with up-to-date data, which significantly increases mission effectiveness. Therefore, obtaining the ability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to use the Joint Mission Planning System is an extremely important achievement. Reliable exchange of information with the fighter's on-board computer will be provided by another component of the package approved by the US State Department - the AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader (SKL) data loading device. It is a state-of-the-art cryptographic device that securely receives, stores, and transmits data between compatible cryptographic and communication equipment. The AN/PYQ-10 SKL distributes and stores communications security (COMSEC) keys, electronic security data, and signals operation instructions using encrypted keys or codes. It meets the US National Security Agency's information security certification requirements for optimized key management, is backward compatible with existing cryptographic systems, and is a versatile device for software administration and information exchange in the US military. Finally, it is worth mentioning the services of logistics and material and technical support for the operation of the F-16. The involvement of foreign, primarily American specialists in the maintenance of Ukrainian fighters will help Ukraine maintain and repair combat aircraft that require special technical expertise for maintenance. The contractors for Ukraine in the implementation of the support package will be the Belgian company Sabena and the American companies Lockheed Martin Aeronautics and Pratt &amp; Whitney. It is important to note that among their services is the deployment of field teams of ground technical support personnel. Presumably, this may indicate the possibility of involving American military contractors in the maintenance of F-16 fighters directly on the territory of Ukraine. The actual ban on this was lifted by the administration of US President Joseph Biden at the beginning of November.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/13/vikno-mozhlyvostej-f-16-vidkryyetsya-shyrshe-pro-novyj-soft-dlya-ukrayinskyh-bojovyh-sokoliv/	2024-12-12T21:55:08-08:00

Self-propelled gun from the Korean Kims: an expert told about the Koksan self-propelled gun from the...	Russian propagandists claimed that the movement of these self-propelled guns took place through the territory of the aggressor country. We should wait for definitive confirmation of whether those howitzers from dictator Kim's lair really got to the Kremlin army only after the defeat of those 170-mm North Korean Wunderwaffe -. However, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform decided to ask Andriy Kharuk, a researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny, about the Koksany and other artillery of the DPRK. - Before proceeding to the technical -dissection- of the North Korean self-propelled guns with a rather non-standard caliber, tell our readers what you, Andrii Ivanovich, know about self-propelled artillery from this most closed country in the world? - Development of self-propelled artillery in The Korean People's Army (KPA), which is officially called the Kimov army, has a long history history During the Korean War, the KPA used approximately three hundred SU-76 self-propelled guns (by July 1953, only 127 such self-propelled guns remained in service). After the war, the KPA received a small amount of ISU-122 from China. SU-100 also appeared - according to some estimates, about a hundred. And in the late 1960s, the Koreans began their own development. At first, as they say, they molded self-propelled guns from what was available. This is how a number of self-propelled guns appeared that used the chassis of the ATS-59 tracked tractor and various variants of 130-mm and 152-mm guns. Western observers identify at least a dozen modifications of such self-propelled guns, and we will not go into all their diversity in this material. Let's turn to another art system, more well-known and well-studied. —So you mean the 170mm howitzer? What exactly became the starting point in its creation? — The specifics of the military-strategic position of the Republic of Korea is the vulnerable location of its capital — only half a hundred kilometers separate Seoul from the demilitarized zone (the actual border with the DPRK). Therefore, sooner or later, an idea had to arise among the leadership of the DPRK: why not build us a cannon capable of hitting the enemy's capital? The practical implementation of this idea began at the beginning of the 70s. The result of the efforts of North Korean engineers was a 170 mm self-propelled gun. The origin of such an unusual caliber is unknown. There is a version in Western publications that this weapon was created on the basis of the German 17-cm Kanone 18 in Mörserlafette - allegedly, several such trophy guns with a supply of shells were handed over to the North Koreans by the Soviet Union. However, no material or documentary confirmation of this version has yet been discovered. There is an assumption that the artillery part of the North Korean gun was created on the basis of the Japanese 15 cm (149 mm) siege gun -Type 96-. This weapon with a barrel length of almost 53 caliber had a firing range of 26.3 km. The Japanese produced only 30 such guns, which distinguished themselves in 1942 during the siege of Corregidor in the Philippines, and were later used in coastal defense and fortified areas of Manchuria. Several Type 96 guns reached the DPRK from among those defending the ports of Racine and Wonsan. The result of the efforts of North Korean specialists was a 170 mm caliber gun with a 50 caliber barrel (over 8 m) with a slotted muzzle brake. The cannon is split-loading, and the practical rate of fire is rated at two shots in five minutes. The firing range of a conventional high-explosive projectile reaches 43 km, and an active-reactive projectile - 54-60 km. — But a gun by itself, even with a serious range, is far from self-propelled. How did the DPRK solve the issue with the chassis? - From the very beginning, the new long-range gun was designed as self-propelled - in the trailer version, it would be too bulky and not very mobile. For self-propelled guns, a tank-type chassis borrowed from the Soviet T-54/55 medium tank or its Chinese -clone- - -type 59- was used. The gun is mounted in the open, and the mounting method itself is quite interesting. Rails are installed on the roof of the chassis, along which the artillery unit can move. In the initial position, it is located in the center of the machine - this ensures a more or less uniform distribution of mass on the support rollers. In the firing position, the gun moves aft. Thanks to this, it is easier to charge from the ground, and most importantly, the main part of the return energy is transferred not to the body, but to the soil (with the help of two coulters that are lowered by a hydraulic drive). —There is some confusion with the very name of this self-propelled gun. Please explain where its name comes from, which actually sounds Korean. - The first variant of the 170 mm self-propelled gun is known as the M1978. Like all other designations of North Korean military equipment, it is conditional and does not mean the year of adoption, but the year when the self-propelled gun first came into the view of Western experts. The names -Koksan- (a town halfway between Pyongyang and the demilitarized zone where this self-propelled gun was first spotted) and -Juche-po- (-Juche Cannon-) are also conventional. The actual designation of the ACS is currently unknown. Production of the M1978 is believed to have begun around 1973. The self-propelled gun was first shown publicly at the 1987 parade. —What versions of this art installation have the North Korean -Kulibins- developed? And how many soldiers does its service include? - In the first version, Koksan was a typical self-propelled carriage, and not a full-fledged self-propelled gun - ammunition was transported by additional vehicles. No special ammunition transporters were created - shells were transported by ordinary trucks, mainly -Sungri-58- and -Sungri-61- (North Korean -clones- of the GAZ-51 and GAZ-63). The calculation of the ACS is eight people - a driver-mechanic, a commander, a gunner and five loaders/carriers. Only the driver-mechanic and the commander are in the starting position on the self-propelled vehicle, the others move on escort vehicles. —Well, the North Korean military industry has never gone off the rails of the over-militarized economy of the DPRK. Especially for the support that the regime of Grandfather Kim and Father Kim received from the USSR. Therefore, it was natural to modernize this ACS. What did it consist of? — In 1989, an improved version of -Koksan- was spotted, which received the quite logical designation M1989 in the West. It is distinguished by a radically redesigned hull, reminiscent of the hull of the Soviet 2C7 -Pion- self-propelled gun - with a large front overhang and a forward-swept cockpit. The increased volume of the hull made it possible to place not two, but four combatants, and also organize a compartment for transporting 12 shells with charges. In addition, MANPADS are carried on the SAU. — And did the researchers manage to count these products, at least approximately? And what is the structure of the units with which they are armed? — The number of manufactured self-propelled guns -Koksan- is unknown. Western analysts estimate it at about half a thousand copies. The structure of units armed with these self-propelled guns has not been established exactly. It is believed that the -Koksans- are divided into three-battery divisions (four guns per battery). The number of personnel of the division is estimated at 150-190 people. In addition to a dozen guns, it has about 20 cars. If these analysts' calculations are correct, then the Coxans division has limited autonomy - the existing vehicle fleet is not capable of transporting a significant amount of ammunition. For their part, divisions are divided into regiments or brigades, numbering 36 self-propelled guns each. - It is known who exactly the Kim regime is going to use these self-propelled guns against in the first place. But how exactly? — As far as we can judge from the available information, the tactics of the KPA involve the massive use of heavy artillery. In particular, during exercises held on March 25, 2016 in the presence of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, about a hundred M1978 and M1989 self-propelled guns took up positions on the sea coast near Wonsan Airport. However, a completely reasonable question arises: isn't the concentration of such a large mass of artillery on a small area a common training ground show? After all, in the conditions of real hostilities, self-propelled guns crowded into positions can be easily hit by aircraft or counter-battery fire. - Voice of America analysts said that North Korea has successfully traded weapons and ammunition for decades that are in demand in the -poor- states of the world, these weapons are cheap, but at the same time effective, accessible in application and maintenance, and do not have restrictions on use, unlike the weapons supplied by the giants of the world market. And what is known about the sale of these self-propelled guns by the Pyongyang regime? - Indeed, international popularity of -Koksan- was brought by exports. After the start of the Iran-Iraq war, North Korea became one of the main suppliers of weapons to Tehran. First of all, weapons of Soviet and Chinese development, -cloned- in the DPRK, were sent there. Several dozen original M1978 self-propelled guns, delivered to Iran before the beginning of 1987, stood out against the general background. Their combat debut took place in January 1987 during the Karbala-5 operation in the Basra area. -Koksans- were involved in massive artillery raids, in particular with the use of active-reactive projectiles at the full firing range. As is known, the operation, which was supposed to ensure Iran's victory in the war, was defeated. Iraqi troops took numerous trophies, including several Koksans (there is even information about thirty captured self-propelled guns of this type). The surviving Koksans are still in service with the Iranian army. An interesting page in the history of this self-propelled gun is the episode with the Iraqi -Coxan-. Inspired by the trophies, the Iraqis tried to create a similar artillery system. The limitations of the country's industrial base did not allow copying the artillery part, so the Iraqis took a ready-made solution - the 180-mm S-23 gun. This Soviet-made gun had a 47-caliber barrel and provided a firing range of 30 km with a conventional high-explosive projectile and 44 km with an active-reactive one. The Iraqis used the East German-made BLG-60 tank bridgelayer as a chassis. The open arrangement of the artillery unit, the hydraulically driven coulters and other details of the Iraqi -Koksan- largely repeated the North Korean original. Apparently, the self-propelled gun was produced in a single copy captured by American troops in the city of Al-Anbar in 2003. And finally, I will summarize all of the above. The Koksan self-propelled artillery system, created in the 1970s, became the first sample of North Korean -strategic- weapons, a kind of -long arm- of the military-political leadership of the DPRK. Before the advent of missile weapons, these guns were the only means capable of hitting the key centers of the Republic of Korea - the capital Seoul and the port of Incheon - from the territory of North Korea. With the development of missile technology, the importance of Koksans as a strategic tool has decreased, but these self-propelled guns remain an important component of the Korean People's Army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/13/samohidka-vid-korejcziv-kimiv-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-sau-koksan-z-kndr-yaku-nachebto-pomityly-v-rosiyi/	2024-12-12T20:32:47-08:00
An imminent strike on Kiev and 25 missiles every month: new fakes about Putin	Emotions are exactly what a Russian woman feeds on. There will be a threat - there will be anxiety. Our people have long known what to do when there is a warning and alarm. And predicting the time/date/place of an attack is a thankless task, since no one can say exactly when and where the attack will be made.. Only -they-, that is, the Rashists, know. It can happen today / tomorrow / the day after tomorrow or in a week. The same applies to mass shelling. They have everything ready, but when - no one knows. Another loud statement - supposedly -Oreshnik- will improve Russia's nuclear doctrine.- This is what the dictator Putin told the propagandists. He said that the appearance of the Oreshnik missile system in service in Russia -minimizes the need to use nuclear weapons.- And on December 10, the Belarusian dictator Lukashenko announced the placement of these missiles on the territory of Belarus. In addition, numerous agents of the influence of the Russian Federation abroad make statements aimed at inciting hysteria and fear around this missile. Another -deza- spread by Russian telegram channels is that Russia can allegedly manufacture 25 missiles - Oreshnyk- every month, that is, 300 rockets every year. Actually, this information is not true. The production of such technological missiles as, for example, -Kinzhal-, is carried out in units. And -Oreshennik- &#8211; this is an even more technological cycle, so the information about the stamping of this missile is a deliberate fake. The coordination of these statements and media activity testify to the conduct of an informational and psychological operation. Its goal is to influence Western countries in order to reduce their military support for Ukraine. Note that the Kremlin activated this operation precisely after the meeting of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi with French President Emmanuel Macron and US President-elect Donald Trump in Paris on December 7. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/13/nemynuchyj-udar-po-kyyevu-i-25-raket-shhomisyaczya-novi-fejky-pro-oryeshnik-putina/	2024-12-12T20:11:58-08:00
Ukrainian military instructors will undergo training in Lithuania: cooperation with NATO is expandin...	This is reported by Ministry of Defense of Ukraine December 12. It is noted that Ukraine, with the support of international partners, continues to improve the system of combat training and training of military personnel. This was agreed upon during a meeting between Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhii Melnyk and Stasis Paldunas, International Advisor on Professional Military Education from the Republic of Lithuania. -Improving military education and combat training is one of the key tasks for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are grateful to our partners for their support, which allows us to integrate modern NATO standards into our training system,- emphasized Serhiy Melnyk. The first group of Ukrainian instructors, which will include 30 people, will undergo training in Lithuania. During the selection of candidates, special attention will be paid to non-commissioned officers of the Armed Forces with combat experience. After returning to Ukraine, these instructors will be able not only to implement new approaches in the training of military personnel, but also to share knowledge with their colleagues in domestic training centers. In addition, the parties discussed updating training programs on combat shooting. In 2025, on the basis of two educational institutions of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, it is planned to launch a pilot project for the training of shooting course instructors with the assistance of the Alliance. Within the framework of this project, two groups of teachers will be created who will master new teaching methods adapted to modern NATO standards. -Cooperation with the Alliance opens up new opportunities for us to improve not only training programs, but also the development of specialists who will be able to train servicemen in accordance with the best international practices,- noted Serhii Melnyk. The introduction of updated combat training and shooting programs from the next academic year will allow training methodologists and increase the level of professional training of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi told how HIMARS affect the course of hostilities	The head of state informs about this on December 12 in social networks. According to him, Ukrainian defenders are extremely grateful to the United States for their assistance. HIMARS is a vivid example of sophisticated, highly accurate, effective and reliable American weapons. -Without such long-range missiles, Russia would have killed hundreds of thousands more Ukrainians. The availability of means of protection against Russian terror is a matter of life and death for the Ukrainian people,- the President said. He assured that the HIMARS were critical to the defense of the Kherson region against the Russians, and also helped thwart the Russian offensive in the Sumy region earlier this year. Now these systems are helping to defend the most difficult areas of the Donetsk front against Russian attacks. -If we did not have these and other powerful long-range weapons, the Russians would capture and destroy many more Ukrainian cities and villages. Long-range capabilities prevent loss of life. It is one thing to lose ammunition and missiles to stop the invaders, and quite another to lose people due to the lack of such defense capabilities,- the head of state emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyi thanked the United States for its help in reducing Ukrainian casualties. -Strengthening positions is the key to guaranteeing peace. the Russian aggressors can only be restrained and forced to accept peace through force. And such a peace is quite achievable thanks to strength,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi is in Zaporizhzhia -zaporizhzhyu/->acquainted with the consequences of a missile strike, which the Russian troops were inflicted on the city on December 10.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rozpoviv-yak-himars-vplyvayut-na-perebig-bojovyh-dij/	2024-12-12T11:43:53-08:00
Marines turned more than 40 units of Russian equipment into burning scrap metal in 10 days	The video of combat work appeared on the page of the Armed Forces of the Navy Forces of Ukraine. It is noted that due to the high intensity of the enemy's attempts to suppress the marines, the occupiers are forced to use a large number of manpower and equipment, including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles. -All this turns into burning scrap metal, and the enemy's personnel remains fertilizer in the fields of the Donetsk region,- the message says. Since the beginning of December 2024, soldiers of the 37th separate brigade of marines and 505th separate battalion of marines have destroyed 4 tanks, 17 armored vehicles, 11 cars and motorcycles, 9 types of various weapons, warehouses and EW means of the enemy. -Behind all these numbers is the titanic work of each unit - from carefully thought-out minefields and well-established communications to accurate artillery shots and hits by drone operators and, of course, the lion-like courage of our infantrymen!- - noted in the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

the kremlin pays billions of dollars for perceived geopolitical greatness	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Last year, Russia issued loans to other states, a record since 1999, totaling more than 30 billion dollars. Belarusian Lukashenka received the most Russian money - 7.75 billion dollars. Also among the leaders are Bangladesh, India, Egypt and Vietnam. At the same time, the Kremlin is actively writing off the debts it issued earlier. Such -generosity- of Moscow is explained solely by an effort to play the role of a -great power- and maintain influence over its neighbors and countries of the Global South, despite the harm to its own citizens. After all, Russia itself has serious economic problems, the infrastructure of many regions is neglected, and people's living standards are decreasing due to the costs of war and geopolitical projects of the Kremlin. We remind you, a decrease in the export of agricultural products is recorded in the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/kreml-platyt-milyardy-dolariv-za-uyavnu-geopolitychnu-velych/	2024-12-12T10:41:01-08:00
Fictitious disability for $10,000: a corruption scheme was exposed in Prykarpattia	This is reported by the Office of the Prosecutor General. According to the investigation, doctors provided a full package of -services- for $10,000, which made it possible to avoid mobilization.

Russia's shadow fleet: how outdated tankers provide the aggressor with billions in revenue	About informs Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to the portal, this fleet includes more than 1,000 outdated vessels, often without proper insurance and with hidden owners. In 2023 alone, Russia earned $188 billion and Iran nearly $53 billion in oil exports using these tankers to circumvent G7+ restrictions. With the help of such vessels, oil is transported across the Black and Mediterranean Seas to Asian markets, in particular to China and India. It is known that Russia has spent about $10 billion to create its own shadow fleet, which includes vessels that have already participated in more than 50 incidents with the risk of environmental disasters. The new section of the portal includes data on 238 tankers that help deliver sanctioned oil. These vessels are also used for raid transshipment and violate the established price ceiling for Russian oil. The uniqueness of the section lies in the ability to sort tankers by operators that began operating in 2022-2023 and quickly became key players in the transportation of Russian oil. War &amp; Sanctions is a global resource that also highlights the use of Western components in Russian weapons, the illegal export of grain, the abduction of Ukrainian children, and other crimes related to Russian aggression. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Black and Azov seas there are no Russian ships.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/tinovyj-flot-rosiyi-yak-zastarili-tankery-zabezpechuyut-milyardni-dohody-agresora/	2024-12-12T09:38:52-08:00

Fighters of the Karakurt Colony company from the 3rd assault brigade cleared the village of Kopanky in the Kharkiv region. A Russian flag was spotted there the day before. Our fighters captured a group of occupiers, among whom this -flag bearer- turned out to be. The GUR liquidated the Russian missile designer, Army TV sources inform. Mykhailo Shatskyi, the deputy general designer of the -Mars- Design Bureau, who was engaged in the modernization of X-59 cruise missiles to the level of X-69, was shot dead in the suburbs of Moscow.

In the Russian Federation, a decrease in the export of agricultural products is recorded	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. At the same time, the import of agricultural products increased by 4.9% to 30.6 billion US dollars. Despite Putin's goal of increasing exports to $55 billion by 2030. USA, the real volume of agricultural exports will most likely amount to 36.3 billion dollars. USA, which gives a decrease of 34%. A reduction in exports will reduce customs duties, which will negatively affect the financing of unprofitable industries such as breeding, genetics, dairy and poultry. With this in mind, Russia revised the forecast for the growth of agricultural production in 2024: 1.5% per year is expected, instead of 3%, as previously forecast. The decrease in the export of agricultural products and the decrease in the projected growth of agricultural production in the conditions of the war against Ukraine and Western sanctions indicate the difficulties of adapting the agricultural sector to new economic conditions. This will worsen the stability of domestic production and slow down the development of the agro-industrial complex in the Russian Federation.

Despite the statement of some experts that with the advent of new anti-tank weapons, the life of a tank on the battlefield is a matter of minutes, to this day the tank remains the most protected and well-armed combat vehicle. Ukraine has become one of the few countries that develop and produce tanks - it is enough to mention that the best tank of the Second World War, the T-34, and the first main battle tank, the T-64, were developed in Kharkiv. During the war with Russia, Ukrainian tankers discovered and continue to discover your skill and heroism by destroying the enemy. Thousands of tankers were awarded orders and medals, individual servicemen became Heroes of Ukraine. ArmyInform reminds which of the tankers was awarded the highest state award. His brothers nicknamed him -Adam- because he was always the first to go into battle. He was one of the first to destroy Russian tanks in the defense of Donetsk Airport in the fall of 2014 year, each time fighting to break through to the terminals, where the defense was held by Ukrainian servicemen. Risking his life more than once and more than twice, Yevhen Mezhevikin applied many tactical innovations and became the first tanker to be awarded the Hero of Ukraine Golden Star. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, he created and became the commander of a tactical group -Adam-. Then, in late February 2022, the volunteers who had been fighting under his leadership since the start of the war rallied around him. Adam repaired two training tanks, an infantry fighting vehicle and went into battle with them. Task Force Adam was created on 14 March 2022. There were battles for the Kyiv region (Irpin, Bucha), then the group worked in the Bakhmut direction, took part in the Kharkiv offensive operation. It also took part in combat operations in different directions - Balakleya, Liman, Bakhmut, Kreminna, Serebryansky Forest&#8230; Now he is the deputy head of the Main Department of Doctrine and Training of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is impossible not to mention the feat of Colonel Yevgeny Sydorenko, who drove alone against the Russian column in the battle near Ilovaisk on the T-72BV trophy tank. There are very few such cases in world history. And almost all of them were during World War II. Yevhen Sydorenko, after repelling the Russian attack on August 29, 2014, went in a convoy to break away from the encirclement. It is his tank led the breakthrough after the death of Colonel Oleksiy Hrachov. For that battle, he was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Ukrainian tankers have repeatedly demonstrated their courage and heroism. So, one of the first titles of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to a 23-year-old platoon commander Yugen Palchenko with the call sign -Song- - in the first days of the large-scale invasion, he was under Kherson covered the exit of the brigade from the environment, saving the lives of his comrades. Having broken through the ring of Russians, three tanks under the command of Palchenko took up the defense near the Antonivsky bridge and enabled the brothers to break through. About two thousand Ukrainian soldiers and equipment came out of the encirclement. On March 2, 2022, Lieutenant Yevhen Palchenko was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine by Presidential Decree for personal courage and heroism. Captain's company Ponomarenka accepted the baptism of fire within a few hours after unloading near Barvinkovo, and since then tankers of the 3rd separate tank brigade of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces almost continuously defend Kharkiv Oblast from enemy attack. In one of these battles, Serhii won Ukraine's highest state award. That day, tankers together with paratroopers made an attempt to storm the village of Topolskyi, which was captured by the enemy, near Izyum. Six Ukrainian tanks approached the village from two directions, but it turned out that the Russians had more than two dozen tanks there. But the training and experience of Ponomarenko's subordinates turned out to be better: the destruction of nine Rashist tanks was confirmed. One of the Ukrainian T-72s was damaged by several hits at once. In order to save the crew, Captain Ponomarenko decided to break into the firing line again in his own tank, so as not to endanger others. The crew supported their company, and Ponomarenko's tank successfully performed a risky maneuver, suppressing the enemy's fire points with well-aimed shots, and then the brave men under fire took the wrecked car in tow and pulled it out of the battlefield. On April 2, 2022, Captain Serhii Ivanovich Ponomarenko was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the Golden Star Order.

Why the infantry rules in this war: about 24 days at -zero-, a path in -petals- and rescuing the wou...	They walked, orienting themselves by the silhouettes of bushes, pits, rips from the arrivals. The eye was already used to the darkness, and the terrain was familiar - they had gone to these places on more than one combat sortie. Just then, in the velvet silence of the night, an explosion rang out. Ivan with the call sign -Lucky- is the chief sergeant of the company of the mechanized battalion of the 44th separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He is 30 years old, originally from Chernihiv Oblast. ArmyInform recorded the story of a serviceman - about people and equipment in the army; about our army and training in Britain; about own motivation and approach to subordinates; about the evacuation of the dead soldier, about 24 days in the positions and much more: -I well remember the dawn of February 24, 2022: I was on the route on the way to Kyiv. Worked at a gas station, went to work. Basically, I'm a builder - it's my hobby! Don't feed with bread, but let bricks be laid (laughs - ed.). Then, on February 24, I read the news: shelling of Odesa, Kyiv&#8230; And I went to the Military Commissariat. I was sent to territorial defense. Teroborona is mostly a routine, we've been testing people. They stood at checkpoints, drove closer to the border, worked in the forests. Various information was checked, including about suspicious people. It was interesting because I found a lot of new acquaintances. My previous military experience is a term of service in 2015-2016, but in the National Guard of Ukraine. Therefore, the ZSU as a structure was a little unclear to me at first, but after a few days it became like cheese in butter (smiling - ed.). Then, when the Russians were expelled from the Chernihiv region, I joined the ranks of the ZSU - in the 44th brigade. I have been in this brigade since March 2023. Came to the position of commander of the department - the commander of a combat vehicle. &#8230; Why did I then go to the Military Commissariat? I'm not going to beat myself up and say what a great patriot I am, but I understood what I had to do. And I left. And he did not regret his decision one bit. I went to study in Britain in the summer of 2023. I thought it would be hot, but it's 21 degrees maximum (laughs - ed.), it's cold! After training, he returned to the position of platoon chief sergeant, and in September he became company chief sergeant, and now, in addition, I temporarily perform the duties of a battalion sergeant. The British military has a wonderful attitude towards Ukrainian soldiers. They do their best to teach us something. The classes were very interesting, they arranged quests for us, we walked through the woods, and, like pirates, looked for treasures&#8230; It was interesting. But the British have their own vision of how the war should continue, it is radically different from what is happening in our country. We also advised and advised them. Personally, I took a lot of useful things, especially regarding work with personnel, organization of work with people (approach to everyone, manner of communication, system of incentives). How do I encourage personnel?... I'll let you in on a big secret: The best incentive for military personnel is to see family. Therefore, yes, when there is an opportunity, I always tried to make maximum efforts so that the person was allowed to go home at least for a day or two, I could take care of this in front of the commander, etc. Because neither money nor diplomas can compare with a trip to relatives. &#8230; I'm generally reserved, but I can raise my voice - there are cases when it is proved&#8230; But I don't -bark- at subordinates on a regular basis. But the best recipe for understanding people in the army is communication. People are all different: someone from the city, someone from the village, from different regions. All this should be taken into account. In principle, I have not yet had such cases when, whether at the front or when the unit was in the rear, it was not possible to solve any issue. You just need an individual approach to each person. Recently, we went on a recovery from the difficult Kupyansk-Svativsk direction. We went there at the beginning of July 2023, the task was carried out for almost a year and a half. What are the most difficult tasks during this time? Probably holding positions that were difficult to reach, to which there is no approach, and when the enemy is just around the corner. This was the most difficult. Because, even elementary: in order to provide people with water, it was necessary to connect drones that would drop water and food for people. Therefore, to enter or exit these front lines intact was another quest. Now is a drone war. I personally had a case when the guys got lost, and I was just at that moment in a position where there was communication and I had the opportunity to see the picture. I contacted the UAV and asked them to find these guys. He told the boys that now our bird will take them to follow her. So, with the help of drones, we took out two fighters who got lost at night. They came out by the sound. Somehow I spent the maximum 24 days in the leading positions. It was the first time for me and it was a difficult experience. Because until now they entered the positions only for evacuation, or for 2-3 days (to see the situation, tell the guys something, or something). And 24 days is my maximum. During that time, I realized the best thing: a shower of wet wipes is such a thing (laughing, thumbs up - ed.). What is the most delicious exercise on the enemy's personnel?... It was with the help of drones. The UAV calculated where the enemy BMP and three buggies were. It seems that they imported BC&#8230; And then, with the help of Browning, two drones with resets and one RPG, we just poured it in there! Detonated everything! There were fireworks! And it was the most effective of what I saw with my own eyes. Adrenaline surges every day when you perform combat missions. You won't feel like you're there. I remember how I had to lead two soldiers to a position, they didn't know the way back then. The night was dark. I had a specific path there that led to a position on the middle line. I have met them and I am leading them. It is not possible to shine, so I oriented myself in the space - a bush, a hole, a gap from the arrival - we are walking, so to speak, by the devices (laughs - ed.). And then I hear one of the soldiers who followed me blow up. I did not understand what happened, because the drone was not heard. I took out a red flashlight and shone it. The path was strewn with -petals-. All Stupidly stuffed. We carefully approached the military one, threw it on us, and for another 200 meters made our way along that path literally by a millimeter - so as not to be stepped on. Then the enemy drones began to direct artillery at us, it started to slurp-slurp-slurp (simulates falling shells - ed.). We have already put up tourniquets in the shelter&#8230; If we talk about my worst experience, it was last year, unfortunately, we had to evacuate one of our dead comrades, a soldier. It took a day, with stops and rests, because the movement in the forward positions takes place only in the dark or gray hours of the day. We drove in at night, it took us some time to reach the position, to him, by morning. They have already started to appear gray. The distance was up to 5 kilometers. We spent the whole night on it. But leaving it there is not an option. A group of volunteers gathered, I led it, the armor dropped us and we left. When I found out that the unit was going to rebuild?.. Oh, it was shock content (laughs - ed.), like a bolt from the blue. There was a meeting and the company commander proved it&#8230; He arrived with his eyes wide open and says, -You won't believe it, you STILL WON'T BELIEVE IT!-. We asked what the matter was. And he was frightened: -On the way, they are taking us out.- When the boys heard it, they almost ordered the orchestra! They could not decide what to take with them and what to leave. The team was prompt and we got together pretty quickly. Everyone was so happy, as if&#8230; the war is over. Everyone hoped that maybe it would be possible to go home for a day or two. What was the first thing I did when I found myself in the -civilian- world? I went to the supermarket, bought myself the most expensive sweet water and pizza. And came out, inhaled, and it was a cool feeling. Nothing buzzes or explodes overhead&#8230; Now there is an opportunity to communicate more with relatives, call friends, because there is no such opportunity. What will be the end of the war for me?.. At least information about the ceasefire that is coming from their side. And there are guarantees from the authorities that it will stop for now. It is also important for me to understand that all this was not in vain, that all my brothers died - not in vain. I want people in the frontline and frontline villages to start sleeping peacefully. Because there are villages where there are a few elderly people left and they simply do not have the opportunity to leave somewhere. They don't even have a store in the village. It's painful to watch. And when they start to sleep peacefully - yes, it would be happiness for me. The borders of 1991?.. I think it is unlikely and unrealistic now. I would, of course. But it is hard to believe. So even if the fire and bombing just stopped, that would be cool. I would really like that. Fear of war?.. Everyone is afraid. And I'm afraid. But when you're already in the team, it's all much easier to digest. And these fears simply become something commonplace. For me, the worst thing is, for example, to lose the opportunity to see even more loved ones&#8230; But all those who are afraid just need to understand that sooner or later this fear can become their joy if it comes to them (when they find themselves in the ranks of the Armed Forces - ed.). The more we unite now , the more of us there are, the easier it will be for us. Adaptation to the army is very fast. Therefore, there is no need to be afraid. Yes, everyone is afraid. But you need to understand that this fear will live with you forever and constantly. Sometimes, simply, something will go into the background, then some adrenaline appears, then there will be successes that will switch you. Why do infantry rule this war? Gosh, it's so simple. Infantry is the hardest. Infantry units are the most difficult because it is direct contact with the enemy. These can be weeks spent in positions. I'm not downplaying the achievements of other units, but infantry is the hardest. Even take into account the fact: you are going to the position and you need to take food, water, BC with you for a week. And it's easy to put it on the position. Only for this, I believe, people need to shake hands and hardly carry on their hands. Infantry are the ones without whom we would lose territory. Without infantry, it is impossible to maintain a defensive line. Yes, there are drones, there is technology. But it is people (infantry!) who enter the position, establish themselves and keep it. Without these people, we would simply crumble.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/chomu-pihota-rulyt-u-czij-vijni-pro-24-doby-na-nuli-stezhku-u-lyepestkah-ta-poryatunok-poranenogo-istoriya-laki/	2024-12-11T20:55:22-08:00
At the forefront of technology: the European manufacturer of anti-ship missiles presented a new vers...	As highlighted in the presentation release MBDA (Matra BAE Dynamics Aérospatiale), an industrial company in the aerospace and defense sectors, a European leader in the development of missiles and missile weapons, -the ability to successfully launch an anti-ship missile at any time of the day or night, in any weather, and regardless of electronic warfare conditions has always been vital to the Navy,- the ArmyInform document quotes. -In addition, the ability of surface ships to detect a submarine has increased significantly over the years due to technological improvements, which has led to the emergence of a new generation of anti-ship missiles,- state the manufacturers of the warhead. The ammunition, named SM40, was created in France and became the last representative of the Exocet family, writes the Defense News portal with a link on company representatives. The material says that the main differences of the new anti-ship missile from its predecessor, the SM39 missile, are the use of a new J-band radar, improved algorithms for working under conditions of high combat load, as well as a doubled radius of attack. According to Pierre-Marie Bellot, MBDA's Head of Strike Missile Development, the SM40 missile has a range of up to 120 km, which is made possible by a new turbojet engine. According to him, the significant increase in the damage radius is designed to increase the possibility of conducting a battle at a safe distance in the conditions of anti-submarine warfare. Bello also noted that the SM40 is designed exclusively for submarines produced by the French company Naval Group, which provides for the compatibility of the new missile with submarines used by a wide range of customers of the French shipbuilder on the international market. As Defense News writes, the predecessor of the new missile, the SM39 model, is already in service with the navies of several countries, including France and India. The new variant of the ammunition, in addition to effectively hitting well-protected warships and invisible targets, also has the ability to hit ground objects, which allows, for example, to attack ships in the port. According to the developer, the SM40 uses a launch method similar to the previous model: the missile is placed in a special underwater container with an engine that is controlled and accompanied during the underwater movement stage, and then ejects the missile to the surface, launching it. The new design's more compact airframe reduces fuel consumption compared to the MM40 Block 3/3c naval round. However, MBDA believes that the SM40 will still achieve its 120km range targets, which is double that of its predecessor. In addition, SM40 will retain the current launch area of ​​SM39, which includes the possibility of launches from the sea depths. Like the MM40 Block 3/3c, the new missile can hit coastal targets (such as moored ships inside a naval base). In addition, Naval News believes that the MBDA envisions additional sets of potential targets for the SM40. The SM40 has not yet been put into mass production, but, according to an MBDA representative, since it is built on the basis of already existing and proven technologies, the time to market will be minimal. Information: -Exocet- (fr. Exocet - flying fish) is a cruise anti-ship missile. Developed by the French company -Aérospatiale- in 1975. It is in the armed navies and air forces of more than 25 countries of the world. It is the most common PKR in the West. The missile has a traditional aerodynamic design with cross-shaped wings in the middle part of the body and the same rudders in the tail compartment. The rocket is launched from a sealed container. During launch, the distance to the enemy object and the bearing of the target are indicated. At a distance of 10 km to the target, the missile descends to a minimum height (8 m from the surface) and turns on the GOS radar. The warhead has contact and non-contact detonators. Exocet's main competitors are the American Harpoon, the Italian Otomat, the Israeli Gabriel-V, the Swedish RBS 15, and the Chinese Yingji series. Presentation of the SM40 Exocet cruise missile.

A new fraudulent scheme: Ukrainians are offered fake aid from UNICEF	To make the -dumping- look more believable, the swindlers even painted the categories of people to whom this aid is supposed to belong. But if you think about it, almost every Ukrainian falls under one of them. What is the point -people with a monthly income of less than 28 thousand hryvnias- worth? And this is in a country where the minimum wage is more than three times less than the specified amount. Obviously, this is being done to scam as many people as possible. The fraudulent scheme has already been warned on the official account of UNICEF Ukraine on Facebook: -We emphasize that we do not accept applications for such humanitarian kits. So be careful, do not go to third-party resources and do not share your personal data! According to the data of /a> of the -On the other side of the news- resource, fraudulent posts were spotted on the -Switch | Kyiv | Light- to which more than 100 thousand people subscribed. If you click on the link, you will be directed to the Unicef ​​Humanitarian Free Kit Telegram bot. Then you need to press -Start!-. As soon as you do this, you will be bombarded with dozens of messages. First, you will be asked to confirm your city. Whether you do this or not, you will then be threatened that you were -spotted on a Russian server 18 minutes 32 seconds ago.- Therefore, you will not be registered until you confirm your citizenship. And they write it in an ultimatum tone. However, even without this, you will receive an invitation to a -free humanitarian kit from our organization- (spelling correct). In short, you won't have time to blink an eye, and you will already be subscribed to a bunch of dubious Telegram channels. Specifically on -[substitute city] | Time-. This is a network of channels that covers all regional centers controlled by Ukraine. To understand the scope: only to the channel -Kyiv| 351,000 Ukrainians subscribed to Time! Actually, this is the main purpose of the scam scheme - to lure people to their channels. The more followers, the more advertising and money.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/nova-shahrajska-shema-ukrayinczyam-proponuyut-fejkovu-dopomogu-vid-unicef/	2024-12-11T20:26:47-08:00
About drones, EW and vacancies in a special battalion: combatant Kucher told how the enemy is having...	When will ground-based drones become commonplace on the frontline? What are the advantages of a separate special purpose battalion and what tasks does it perform? How to get into a special unit and what should be done to stay in the chosen position? Which branch of the special battalion of the presidential brigade is vacant? The commander of the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Major Oleksiy Kucherenko with the call sign -Kucher-, told ArmyInform about this. - What is the difference between a separate special purpose battalion and a separate presidential brigade? - First of all, one should consider the advantages of a separate battalion as a whole over line battalions. This is greater autonomy, this is the availability of services - from cars to UAVs. This is the ability to independently carry out recruiting, the ability to make purchases, receive support from higher authorities not only from the brigade itself, but also directly. It is about the very benefits of an individual organism. A special purpose component allows us to perform various specific tasks. As of today, our tasks are closer to those of infantry — primarily to hold the line, destroy the enemy. But there are also quite specific tasks - for example, jump on a -Hummer- close to the enemy's positions and directly into the entrance to the house, throw -TM-ki- (anti-tank mines - ed.) into the dugout and watch , as the enemy flies into the air. There are different stories, extreme evacuation tasks, when there is no longer a walking route, and no access at all to that position. That is, there is a whole series of tasks with an increased level of risk that the special purpose battalion performs. - Not everyone can do such tasks. Who serves in the battalion, because the Armed Forces are, first of all, servicemen, people. Who serves in the battalion subordinate to you? How do you get to it - are there any special requirements? - Since the battalion was formed in March 2022, the vast majority of personnel are primarily mobilized. Recently, thanks to the opportunity to engage in recruiting, the number of contract workers in the unit has increased. However, the vast majority are soldiers who came to us for mobilization from training centers. If taken as a whole, more than 2/3 of the personnel are mobilized, and another 30% are those who found information about the battalion on media resources, on bigboards, on Reserve+, through recruiting centers. Those who self-mobilize are able to choose the position that best suits their desires and civilian experience. In the battalion, there is an opportunity to choose a direction for yourself, and not so that everyone goes under the same comb and it does not matter whether you were an agriculturist or a small businessman or worked on the railway. Everyone will be able to get a position according to his skills. If you're a great driver and you know how to fix an engine, you'll be a driver, my friend. If you have skills in the IT field, we also have suitable tasks. For example, there are UAV workshops, where we ourselves repair and improve large and small -birds-, configure kamikaze drones. Do you want to become a pilot - no questions, we will show and tell. Even if you do not have experience and skills, there are a number of experienced warriors in this field, there are a lot of training centers where everyone will find a position according to their calling. - Is there a guarantee that a person who has passed according to the necessary criteria for a certain position will serve in that position? - Absolutely. If she confirms her qualifications and shows results, not only this serviceman, but also everyone around, primarily the command, will be interested in her continuing to perform tasks in this particular position. But there are also nuances. It will not be the case that if a person comes and does not show results in this position, then he will remain in this position forever. If you don't manage, you don't show results, you're lazy, then the trust credit ends - and then please do what they say. Then I'm sorry, my friend, if you don't cope, then in this case another military approach will already be applied and you will be transferred to a position that corresponds to your level of knowledge and skills, and which is now critically needed specifically in the battalion. — Now the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were able to independently recruit new recruits without the mediation of the TCC and SP. Is it practiced by the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade? - Of course, we practice. You can learn about us directly on our Telegram channel, on battalion Facebook pages and Instagram. Just enter the name of the battalion in the search engines and you will immediately find our page with a description of the combat path of the unit, information on how to join the battalion and vacancies. Aggregate vacancies in the Armed Forces of Ukraine from ArmiyaInform There are also vacancies in various platforms such as Work.ua or the newly created application Rezerv+, where you can mobilize directly. — In the ten years since the beginning of the open armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have gone through a very significant path of powerful modernization. Are these changes visible at the battalion level? What are they? — I have seen these changes personally — not from the outside, but in the army, because I have been serving for much longer than 5 years. I remember how the fighters still hemmed the -oak-. Therefore, the changes are very noticeable - starting with elementary issues of providing property, equipment, its quality - and ending with the conduct of hostilities. Material security is the first component that has changed very significantly for the better. The second component is how we now fight. For example, drones, real-time communication and data transmission, software that allows for operational control have given a very big boost and huge change to the tactics of warfare. We now have a variety of drones, from large UAVs such as Vampires and Bats to ground-based drones, both kamikaze and logistics drones. With the help of drones, it is now possible to provide supplies to advanced positions, as well as to deliver or drop large -bombs- directly on the enemy's head (smiles - ed.). And this is not to mention the many other high-quality Western weapons such as Javelin or NLAW, LAVR or MaxxPro armored vehicles and much more. It's one story when you drive a pickup and all your protection is an icon on a torpedo, and it's quite another when you fly in an armored Hummer with a Browning machine gun on the roof. - You mentioned ground drones. Despite the fact that their appearance on the front is no longer news, they still continue to be perceived as a certain novelty compared to UAVs. Can you say a few words specifically about ground unmanned complexes and their tasks? - As for ground drones, this is a really new branch of development for our division. However, it is extremely promising because there are specific tasks, especially in urban areas, that ground-based drones can perform best, and for which these tools are designed. For example, to deliver cargo without risking the lives of soldiers. Or drive a kamikaze drone directly into the enemy position and detonate four TMs to completely destroy it. All this allows, first of all, to save the lives of our soldiers and, secondly, to save a significant amount of ammunition that would have to be spent to fire damage to these positions. I will not reveal all the secrets about ground drones, because this component is still developing and has not gained much popularity. But, I think that in about half a year, ground drone crews will not be a novelty, but will become as commonplace as UAV crews and will appear in all units. They will perform tasks just as successfully and become as indispensable an integral part of operations as aerial drones. Nowadays, videos of FPV kamikazes or bombers with resets will not surprise anyone, instead, they are doing extremely important combat work. Thanks to this simple, already familiar element, we save a lot of lives of infantrymen who do not have to engage in direct combat with the enemy. Combat work of drone operators of the 21st special purpose battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi Drones, heavy night bombers are 5 to 10 drops per night. This is a minus of the enemy's logistics, it is a deprivation of his ability to accumulate before assault actions. There were times when the enemy tried to build up on the front edge before attempting to storm our positions. We worked on them for a day with various drones, both kamikaze and heavy bombers. In the end, the commander of the assault group of the Russians refused to obey the order, turned off the radio station - and we listened to their conversations - and, judging by everything, left the position. The assault did not take place. They refused to storm, because every 20‒25‒30 minutes something would definitely come at them from our side. —The combat work of the UAV is very vivid, it is shown in countless videos. However, there is something that remains behind the scenes - providing battle management, establishing and maintaining communication, the work of EW. We understand that it is not possible to talk about everything in detail, but at least in general terms, what can be said about this -invisible- component of combat operations? - Communication is generally a key component of fighting, fire control. There will be no connection - there will be nothing. You will not be able not to give a command, you will not be able to adjust the means of fire, you will not be able to simply manage a unit. Without communication, any unit at any level will simply be incapacitated. It will be a group of people with weapons, with some skills, but it will not be a single fist, it will not be a single military body. So is the EW - it's invisible in the video, but just as important as kamikaze drones and bombers. The enemy uses FPV drones as actively as we do. Therefore, without REB, without providing reliable protection, no task can be performed now. Currently, no vehicle will be allowed into the combat zone without a REB, as this is an unjustified risk to personnel. Covering with electronic devices is also very relevant now.

Why it is more difficult to return deported children than military children: the President's explana...	He told this in an interview for SBN. -You exchange the military for the military. Yes, unfortunately, sometimes the Russians block it, but it happens. Sometimes there is a possibility of returning civilians. And we understand the tool by which we return civilians. What about the children? It is very difficult with them, because we cannot trade children for children,- he stated. Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted that there are no stolen Russian children in Ukraine. -We didn't steal anyone, we didn't deport anyone. Our operation in the Kursk region is proof. It cannot be said that there are simply no Ukrainians on Russian territory, and therefore we did not touch anyone. No, we operated in the Kursk region. Not a single person was stolen, not a single civilian was killed by us, not a single child was harmed there. That's the difference,- he emphasized. According to him, the Russians stole 19,500 verified Ukrainian children. -These are the children who are verified by our institutions. But pay attention to the fact that officially, it seems to me, in 23 years, the Russian ombudsman reported that they are keeping 700 thousand Ukrainian children. This is their official data. I don't know how true this is, but it's terrifying. They are proud to have stolen children,- the head of state said. The President of Ukraine said that children can be returned only thanks to partners and joint pressure. -Now we are returning children through the mediation of Qatar, through the mediation of the Vatican, and certainly there are examples where this or that country can help with a small number of children. To date, we have returned 1,030 children. 1,030 out of 19,500 verified,- he said.

Former Wagnerians from Syria operate in the north of the Kharkiv region: the occupiers attack from t...	The commander of the platoon of unmanned aircraft systems of the 92nd separate assault brigade said this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- named after the kosh chieftain Ivan Sirko Mykola with the call sign -Kitty-. — If we take into account the change in weather conditions, the enemy no longer uses frontal attacks, because the shore along the reservoir has become exposed. And moving infantry groups across that shore is almost always a 100% negative for the enemy. So they shifted the vector more towards flanking [attacks],- he said. The military reported that the Russians are trying to storm the area of ​​the settlement of Strelecha of the border Lipetsk community of the Kharkiv district. — Attempts of active assault actions near the settlement of Strelecha. But also the enemy does not experience any strategic results, it is detected by our unmanned systems, artillery systems are used, and the result is always in our favor so far, and it will continue to be so, - said the commander of the drones. The officer told about the composition of the enemy's forces. — Now motorized rifle units are fighting directly in our direction. We are also currently monitoring the Africa Corps group. These are, in principle, fighters of the former -Wagner group- and the contingent from Syria, who were called to fight the -colonial policy- of the West, he said. The military assessed the level of training and skill of the enemy. — People from the -African Corps- are more prepared, they are ready for adverse weather conditions, for difficult conditions of combat operations. Therefore, we have certain surprises from such guys, he said. However, Ukrainian fighters are also ready for difficult weather conditions. — As for work, this is not the first winter. We adapt to the weather conditions. We know certain types of weapons, namely unmanned systems, which should not be used with quality now. We're low on humanity, we're also low on cloudiness. Therefore, certain types, such as the long-range reconnaissance wings, are currently ineffective. Therefore, we perform these tasks with the help of FPV drones, explained the commander of the drones. He described the tactics used by Ukrainian drone pilots. — We fly out on reconnaissance directly with ammunition, one might say, on a hunt. If the movement of some equipment or manpower is detected, or we simply find something disguised as a result of reconnaissance, then a defeat occurs.

We learn osuohai, we meet immigrants from Yakutia: the realities of the occupied Luhansk region	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. It is noted that the relevant draft law is being developed in the so-called LNR. The initiators are sure that such a step will facilitate the migration of families of Russian servicemen to Luhansk region, which will solve the problem of shortage of personnel, in particular among doctors, teachers and accountants. Meanwhile, in Novodruzhesk, which is next to Lysychansk, there has been no electricity supply for more than two years. The remaining local residents hoped in vain to solve this problem after a pseudo-referendum, fake elections or a change of local -curators-. Instead, they began dismantling equipment at transformer substations in the settlement, to which the Russian military was involved. The restoration of critical infrastructure facilities is not being carried out, which confirms the further neglect of the basic needs of local residents.

This is reported by the Command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Especially brutal murder - Article 105. Killed a pedophile who raped a 13-year-old girl from an orphanage. The sentence is 22 years and 3 months of strict regime,- says Danylo. From this term, Usov managed to serve only 1 year. Agitators for the SVO appeared in the colony. He says he didn't want to sign, but was threatened with violence. -One by one, we were brought to the chief's office, where there was a representative from the Russian Armed Forces. Those who refused were proved in the evening that -it will be necessary. They pushed me papers and told me to sign everything,- the Russian continued. Usov signed the contract without hesitation. Propaganda said that they were going to fight against foreign legions and NATO because -there are no more Ukrainians in the Armed Forces.- -For refusing to sign, prisoners were threatened with -press houses-. They assured me that I would not make it to the colony. And after the -press house-, where people were broken, everyone and everything signed,- Danylo added. On the same day after signing the contract, Usov was sent to Barnaul from the pre-trial detention center. There they were dropped off from the bus depots, where other prisoners were already waiting. -We gave out dry rations of water and put them on buses to Novosibirsk. They said that there are two days and you can meet with your relatives. Mom left, but she didn't have time to get there, they told us that we were flying out urgently. We never met. -Mom used to say, 'It would be better for you to sit and not go to SVO,'- said the former prisoner. Usov and other convicts were brought to the first training ground, where they were engaged in construction work for 2 weeks. -They dug, sawed, built, laid electricity. There was no training. I've been building cars because that's what I know. Once they were taken to the training ground, but only because television came. They gave out 15 rounds per machine gun, like we are training here,- Danylo noted. Usov broke his leg during one of these -training sessions- at the Zoryanyi training ground near Luhansk. He says that prisoners were shot and thrown with grenades. This is how the instructors instilled courage in the newly minted fighters. Three weeks later, they were sent to a training ground in the Kursk region. There, they were taken to an abandoned factory, where they passed a medical examination, worked on racks, and disassembled weapons. Over the course of a month, prisoners were transferred to different villages of the Kursk region. In one of them, Usov and other paratroopers were pelted with drops from drones. For several days, Usov, along with other wounded convicts, hid in the basements until they were captured by Ukrainian paratroopers. -Our commanders abandoned us. The boys and I assumed that in this way, when we were working, our command calculated the enemy's artillery. Each prisoner, on the eve of the military exit, was issued one grenade for suicide. They said that it is impossible to surrender to captivity. One fellow blew himself up, but I couldn't. -I probably didn't have enough courage,- said the Russian. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 80th Halych Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces repelled another unsuccessful enemy assault and took captured 11 Russians from the 11th Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/ubyv-pedofila-zmusyly-jty-na-svo-daly-granatu-dlya-samogubstva-istoriya-polonenogo-rosiyanyna/	2024-12-10T23:37:52-08:00

The BvS-10 (short for Bandvagn Skyddad, -protected tracked vehicle-) is a Swedish-British tracked amphibious armored personnel carrier. In service with the Marines since 2023. This technique was transferred by Great Britain. Amphibious all-terrain vehicles consist of two parts: the first car is for the commander, driver-mechanic and gunner, the second is for transporting the landing party. Accommodates up to 12 people. The machines have excellent maneuverability, are able to overcome water obstacles and operate in flooded areas. This is possible thanks to the wide rubber track (has a Kevlar insert), which is not heavy on the swamp, and on the sand of the APC. There is an automatic transmission, it moves quite quickly on dry land, accelerates to 70 km/h. The guys tried more - they took 75 km/h. Of course, overcoming water obstacles is much slower - 5 km/h. It dives into the water at 1.25 m and moves there with the help of caterpillars. The Viking is well armored, equipped with a 12.7mm Browning M2 machine gun and special grenade launchers to create smoke screens. The combat module rotates 180 degrees, also protected by an armor plate. The equipment is very light and convenient to use. Cummins turbocharged diesel engine produces 285 horsepower. The mechanical power of the engine is transmitted to the rear of the car, meaning it is fully four-wheel drive. The weight of the front link is 5000 kg and the rear link is 3500 kg. Unlike our MTLB and BMP, these machines are much simpler and more economical. Fuel consumption 6.7 liters per 100 km. Like a normal car. The range is 500 km. That's quite a lot. Our mechanics-drivers mastered this miracle of technology for more than a month at the training ground in Great Britain. Tactical and technical characteristics, equipment and combat capabilities were studied in detail. Theory, followed by practical training in all weather conditions. Driving lessons are the base. British instructors showed all the technical intricacies and features of armored vehicles. They taught the basics of -first aid repair-. Of course, marines consolidated their knowledge on tests. Plus, auxiliary courses on improving work on this technique are periodically organized in Ukraine. When the brigade fought in the Kherson direction, Viking was used less for its intended purpose. Here, in Donetsk region, these machines are already in full use. -The tasks are diverse: delivery of amphibious combat groups through difficult terrain and their landing, including overcoming water obstacles, evacuation of the wounded from the battlefield, delivery of provisions and water. They even carry ammunition. Our engineers also had to deliver explosives to the area of ​​combat missions. In short, everything that can be delivered to the front edge of our guys, we deliver. Due to the small dimensions of the armored personnel carrier, it is inconspicuous, the enemy often does not see it because of plantings or large bushes. Once the amphibious all-terrain vehicles were attacked by the Russians with their FPV drones: -They hit the landing compartment, but the machine continued to move and, most importantly, no one was hurt. I believe that MTLB could hardly withstand this blow. Not to mention the amount of shrapnel that comes in during shelling. Katsaps try to hit APCs with mines, but usually they do not hit on target. A meter or two from the cars.- -Of course, there have already been cases when several cars were hit, but the crews remained completely unharmed. Somehow I even remember: there was a collision with an anti-tank mine and no one was hurt. Imagine! Did anyone even have a concussion? The Viking rink was only damaged, so he could not go any further. Then the next car left and picked up the boys. They independently all plunged into the amphibious landing and evacuated. The armor is solid so far. Of course, if there is a direct hit by a large-caliber projectile, you understand.- In order for the knocked-out APC to burn completely, the Katsapas used as many as 10 FPV drones. That's 10 direct hits to completely destroy the tech. -Bird- says: there are no particular problems with spare parts. -If necessary, the British deliver them to Ukraine. They have a lot of such equipment under conservation there. They send tracks, engines, other mechanisms. We repair cars in our repair units.- What's interesting? According to the crew of the machine, due to its compactness, the Viking is less likely to be blown up by mines. The secret is that the limited weight is distributed over the wide surface of the rubber tracks, making mines less likely to detonate. This is the survivability of these APCs. -For example. Again, the track on the MTLB is not wide and there is a much greater load on the mine. That's why there was an explosion there immediately.- Vyacheslav is 36 years old, originally from Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv region. Awarded the Order -For Courage III degree-. In the army since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. -In Mykolaiv, they were just recruiting for the marines. It was necessary to form units to support our troops in the Mariupol region. I am a sergeant, I have a term of service in the internal troops. At first he got into the reserve company of the 36th Marine Brigade. They worked in the Volnovakha district. He fought in 2022 in various places of the Volnovasky district. He got into the environment with his brothers. Lost connection. Russian equipment and occupiers were already all around. It was possible to get out and join other marine units. In the 38th brigade since 2023, he received a promotion to the rank of officer and the opportunity to lead an airborne assault company. We ask: for which combat episode was awarded the Order -For Courage III degree-. -Bird- replies: -This is a collective award from all the guys in my unit. Their heroism is incredible. At that time, the intensity of hostilities in Mariintka, Pisky, and Vodyan was such that every day and everyone in the positions could be awarded orders. No one felt sorry for themselves and, in general, often, unfortunately, did not count with life.- &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/chudo-btr-morpihiv-viking-yak-na-fronti-vykorystovuyut-vsyudyhody-amfibiyi/	2024-12-10T21:03:36-08:00
Armored monster on the water: the Korean car manufacturer will create the most modern tank	Not without a certain amount of boasting declared by the development company, this next-generation main battle tank surpasses all capabilities of modern MBTs, providing more effective performance tasks with the help of the latest technologies for future warfare, ArmiyaInform reports. As considered by the experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, a collaboration between Hyundai Rotem, the Development Agency of Defense of the Republic of Korea and the Korea Research Institute for Defense Technology Planning and Improvement is a significant technological breakthrough that brings the country closer to the introduction of hydrogen vehicles for military purposes. The K3 is expected to be equipped with hydrogen fuel cells, advanced electric motors and batteries, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to diesel engines. This innovative system not only reduces emissions, but also allows the tank to operate almost silently, greatly increasing its stealth capabilities, a significant strategic advantage in modern warfare. The expected design of the K3 offers significant performance advantages, including the ability to navigate difficult terrain and steep slopes. In addition to the hydrogen fuel cells, the tank will have a 130 mm smoothbore gun, which is a significant upgrade from the K2's 120 mm gun, improving its firepower. Hyundai Rotem also revealed plans to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the tank's fire control system. This neural network-based feature aims to improve the K3's aiming and accuracy capabilities, giving it an edge in pre-emptive strikes and rapid threat assessment on the battlefield. Production of the all-hydrogen K3 tank is planned for 2040. As an interim solution, Hyundai Rotem will initially present a hybrid model combining diesel and hydrogen systems. This transition phase will allow the South Korean military to take advantage of some of the benefits of hydrogen technology in preparation for a full transition to this energy source. Hyundai Rotem officials confirmed that this hybrid version will soon be put into service, supporting South Korea's strategic goals of reducing emissions while maintaining reliable military performance. The development of the K3 tank is in line with the wider trend towards the use of hydrogen fuel in the global defense and transport sectors. Hyundai, already recognized for pioneering work in the field of fuel cells, is expanding its expertise in military technology by contributing to the development of hydrogen-based mobile solutions. For example, the company has previously worked with Chinese firm WeRide on autonomous water-powered vehicles. Similarly, in the United States, advances in hydrogen technology are making waves in commercial and military maritime transport, with projects such as -Sea Change-, the first hydrogen ferry approved by the US Coast Guard, which is soon to be launched in San Francisco. A hydrogen fuel cell works by converting hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, water and heat through an electrochemical reaction. It consists of three main components: anode, cathode and electrolyte. The hydrogen stored in the tank is injected into the anode, where it is split into protons and electrons with the help of catalysis. Protons pass through the electrolyte to reach the cathode, while electrons unable to cross the electrolyte travel through the outer circuit, generating a useful electrical current. On the other hand, oxygen, which is normally drawn from the air, ends up at the cathode, where it combines with protons and electrons to form water, a net byproduct of this reaction. This technology, which produces only water and heat, provides a sustainable energy source that does not pollute the environment, ideal for applications in vehicles that require low acoustic and heat signatures, such as stealth military operations. In modern military operations, a hydrogen tank would have significant strategic advantages, particularly in terms of stealth, autonomy and operability in a hostile environment. Due to the low temperature signature, the hydrogen tank would be more difficult to detect by infrared surveillance systems, facilitating discrete maneuvers, night patrols and infiltration into enemy rear areas. The increased autonomy of such military equipment will also allow armored units to penetrate deeper into enemy territory without frequent refueling, which is a valuable opportunity in areas with complex logistics supply chains. In addition, producing only water vapor with no polluting emissions will make the tank resistant to degraded or polluted environments typical of war-torn urban and industrial areas. By reducing dependence on fossil fuels, this type of vehicle will ease logistical requirements and protect supply lines, which are often vulnerable to targeted enemy attacks. Finally, the silent operation of hydrogen technology will provide a decisive advantage for ambushes or defense in wooded or urban areas, allowing the tank to remain undetected until combat. Thus, the hydrogen tank can meet the unique challenges of today's conflict, offering a combination of caution, autonomy and environmental resilience that will greatly enhance operational capabilities on the ground. Projects on the development of hydrogen military vehicles are gaining momentum around the world, although South Korea is at the forefront with its K3 tank. Other countries and defense companies are also exploring the potential of hydrogen for military applications, although efforts are generally less advanced than Hyundai Rotem's. In the United States, the military is evaluating the viability of hydrogen as part of its Next Generation Combat Vehicle program (NGCV). General Motors Defense, for example, has developed a prototype ZH2 , a hydrogen-powered all-terrain vehicle designed for the US Army. This model aims to test the stealth and autonomy of hydrogen technology for defense missions. In addition, BAE Systems and Oshkosh Defense, two major defense contractors, are also exploring hybrid and hydrogen technologies for future applications, although for now they are mainly focused on hybrid vehicles. In Europe, the MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) program, which is detailed told our editors in one of their publications and which jointly led by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and Nexter, is the flagship project for the development of the future European main battle tank. However, it is still at the specification stage: hybrid and hydrogen options are being considered to reduce emissions and increase stealth. Rheinmetall, another major player involved in the high-profile project, is also exploring alternative propulsion solutions, but a final decision on the Germans' implementation of hydrogen technology has yet to be made. Japan is also interested in hydrogen fuel cells for armored vehicles through Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The industrial conglomerate is exploring the possibility of using hydrogen technology for its future battle tanks, responding to the Japanese Ministry of Defense's requirements for solutions that increase autonomy while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is focusing primarily on prototypes and performance testing in difficult terrain to evaluate the applicability of hydrogen in its combat vehicles. Israel is another potential player interested in the benefits of hydrogen for missions that require low acoustic and thermal signatures. Israeli companies such as Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) are conducting research into stealth defense vehicles and are considering alternative power solutions to meet the specific needs of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), although no formal hydrogen programs are currently was launched. Summarizing the analysis of the arms market, it is believed that although several countries and defense companies are actively engaged in research into new power technologies to reduce the impact of military equipment on the environment, few of them have made hydrogen an immediate priority. The Hyundai Rotem K3 project puts South Korea at the forefront of hydrogen-powered battle tank development, offering a roadmap for other countries. This innovation could prompt European, American and Asian players such as BAE Systems, General Motors Defense, KMW, Nexter and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to accelerate their own hydrogen programs as they continue to explore the technology's potential for military realities. The company Hyundai Rotem from the Republic of Korea is engaged in the development of the newest main battle tank K3.

Was -Funny-, but became -Smiley-. The story of a tanker whose life was saved by his mother's call	How to go through the path of an artilleryman, an infantryman and eventually become a tankman in a short period of time, and what advantages the Leopard 1A5 has on the battlefield, a serviceman told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Serhii entered the Armed Forces of Ukraine two months before the start of the large-scale invasion — in December 2021. -I wanted to go to the military service. My grandfather told me since childhood that every man should serve. But I didn't have time for the fall draft. And I had a choice. Either wait for the spring of 2022 or go for a contract. I signed the contract,- recalls Smiley. Sergey became an artilleryman in the 72nd separate mechanized brigade. At the beginning of the invasion, he defended Kyiv region. In particular, he participated in the battles for Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel. -The first tangible moment was February 27, 2022. We then worked at the SAU. A rocket flew about 5 meters from her. I don't know what it is, but it's very powerful. I was lucky then. For some reason, I really wanted to call my mother. I left to pick her up, and at that very moment it flew by. A funnel formed 2 by 4 meters,- Smailik recalls. After Kyiv region, there were battles in the East. First in the Bakhmut direction, then in the Ugledar direction. -I received the first wound in the direction of Bakhmut. I was in the infantry at that time. The tank and the BMP worked on our position. A shell hit a tree above us. And the debris hit me. I stayed in the hospital for a week and then came back. Later we were transferred to Ugledar. And there, during one fire contact, a VOG flew behind me from the -undertray-, says Serhiy. After treatment, Serhiy was transferred to mortars. And later he got into the 44th separate mechanized brigade, which was being formed at that time. He was supposed to be a mortarman there, but it turned out differently. -A certain number of people were retrained as tanker drivers. Sent to study in Germany. It lasted for 2 months. After that, they returned, got the equipment and went to Kharkiv region,- says Serhiy. -Smileyk- affectionately calls his car a kitty. He says that at first it was difficult, because everything is new and unclear. However, already during the battles, the tankers quickly gained experience and consolidated their skills: -Already now, when leaving the position, we only need 2 minutes to work out 13 essential shells and then roll back. Most often we work in dugouts and trenches. They worked on tanks, armored personnel carriers, BMPs. A friendly crew once left to work on an enemy tank. They hit with the first shot. It was, I think, a T-90.- All in all, if everything is set up and calibrated correctly, the Leopard 1A5 is a very accurate gun. -We had a moment - at a distance of 3.5 kilometers, our gunner hit a machine gun DOT. The projectile flew right into the window,- recalls Serhiy. In addition, the tank is equipped with high-quality aiming devices, which are also used on the more modern Leopard 2. -Once it happened that they went to work in the Kupyansk direction. We reach the firing position, and the gunner says: -I see a tablet.- That is, he saw in the crosshairs through the night vision system that one of the Russians was sitting and clicking something on the tablet. Well, they started to -pour- right there,- recalls Serhiy. Because of its origin, the tank constantly attracts the attention of the enemy, says -Smileyk-. And as soon as he is noticed, the hunt for him begins. The most enemies are in the sky. In particular, these are FPV drones and Lancets. Although active armor, -barbecues- and EW devices have appeared on the cars, this does not always help. Therefore, tankers try to do everything as quickly as possible. -Leopard 1A5 helps a lot in this regard. They are very maneuverable. Much more -lively- than Soviet tanks. There was a moment when we shot back and the enemy started working on us. We started to roll back. Usually the tank accelerates to 60 kilometers per hour. But here the mechanic-driver gained more speed. He shouts at me: -Smiley, I'm going 67 kilometers!-. In addition to speed and maneuverability, the tank also has armor. In particular, the Leopard 1A5 -Smileyka- withstood the impact of two anti-tank missiles. -Last year, when we were working with direct fire, 2 ATGMs flew into the -mask- on the tower. But the tank survived. We were still able to leave on it. The crew was injured. But everyone survived,- Serhiy says. During Serhiy's service, not only his specialty changed, but also his call sign. At first, while in the infantry, he received the nickname -Funny-. Although the situation at that time was not at all fun, says a serviceman: -We are lying in a trench, and they are working on us with everything they have. It was so scary that it was a slipper. Also, in the morning and until the evening, the enemy constantly tried to approach in order to engage in fire contact. Well, I thought that it was necessary to at least somehow raise the spirits of my fellow citizens. And he began to make various jokes about the fact that the Russians still cannot hit us. Then they told me I was funny. And that's how it stuck. And when I was transferred to mortars, they asked for my call sign. He said that -Funny-. But there was a foreman who called him something else - -Smiley-. -Smailyk- speaks succinctly, but without hesitation, about his motivation to serve in the ZSU: -I would rather be here than the enemy would be at my home.- I would rather die than have the enemy do anything to my family. No one here fights for deputies, politicians. Everyone fights to protect their family.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/buv-smishnyj-a-stav-smajlykom-istoriya-tankista-yakomu-vryatuvav-zhyttya-dzvinok-materi/	2024-12-10T20:32:32-08:00
The situation is under control: the Russian army simply imagined that it had breached the border in ...	In fact, this information is not true, and the situation at the border remains under control. Andriy Demchenko, the spokesman of the State Security Service of Ukraine, stated this on the air of the Kyiv24 TV channel: -The positions held by the border guards are not located directly along the border line. But if we talk about that aspect, then the border units did not record any attempts to enter, nor any attempts at hostilities. The area there is characterized by wetlands, so it will be difficult for the enemy to gain a foothold there or develop their actions.- Andriy Demchenko noted that directly on the territory of Russia, in the Kursk region, the enemy is trying to advance in order to knock our forces out of their positions. The Sumy OVA also denied the information about the alleged -breach of the border- by the Russians: -Currently, there are no data from the military regarding the change in the situation at the border, the situation is under control,- said the head of the administration, Volodymyr Artyukh. It should always be remembered that the border line with Russia is actually the front line, where our Defense Forces hold their positions to counter any enemy attempts to enter our territory. The Defense Forces of Ukraine call on citizens to trust only official sources of information and not to succumb to enemy manipulations aimed at destabilizing the situation in the region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/sytuacziya-kontrolovana-prosto-armiya-rf-uyavyla-shho-prorvala-kordon-na-sumshhyni/	2024-12-10T20:12:58-08:00
Membership in the EU, frozen assets of the Russian Federation and the Air Defense Forces: the Presid...	About December 10, the Office of the President informs. The head of state thanked the European Parliament and the European Council for the financial and political support of Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. -Yesterday's allocation of 4.1 billion euros for Ukraine for this year within the limits of the Ukraine Facility program is very important for us. We are also looking forward to an €18 billion macro-financial loan for Ukraine. For us, such decisions are very important. All the political decisions that were supported by the majority of the European Parliament during these almost three years were very important for us,- the President said. During the meeting, they discussed military support, as well as the strengthening of air defenses to protect people and critical infrastructure facilities in Ukraine from Russian attacks. One of the key topics of the negotiations is the use of frozen Russian assets for the benefit of defense needs and the strengthening of air defense, because this directly helps to bring a just peace for Ukraine and the whole world closer. Particular attention was paid to the progress of Ukraine on the way to EU membership. -Our goal is to be closer to the EU as soon as possible. We are aiming at the active adoption of the necessary laws and the implementation of reforms,- ​​Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. Iraçe García Perec emphasized that it is important to continue military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine. -We know how important this is to all of us. You are defending your country and our shared values, freedom. We know how important it is to continue working in this direction,- she said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov also -proyektiv-z-yes/->met with deputies of the group -Progressive Alliance socialists and democrats-.

The horrors of the occupation in Izyum: two Russians who tortured the mother of a Ukrainian law enfo...	The Office of the Prosecutor General informs about this on December 10. The suspects are the assistant shooter of the grenade launcher of the 1st rifle division of the 3rd rifle platoon of the 1st rifle platoon of the 3rd rifle company of the 204th rifle battalion of the -DNR- regiment and the commander of the intelligence group 607 of the special purpose center of the North Caucasus District of the Federal Service of the National Guard of the Russian Federation. According to the investigation, in July 2022 in Izyum, the suspects together with other occupants broke into the house where a woman - the mother of an active Ukrainian law enforcement officer - lived. They detained her and took her to the torture chamber set up on the territory of the railway hospital. -DNR militant systematically raped a woman and committed sexual acts against her. In addition, he exerted psychological pressure on the woman: he threatened to kill her, as well as strip her completely, tie her in the square, take a photo and send the photo to his son, a law enforcement officer,- the report states. During one of the interrogations, the occupiers attached wires to the victim's legs and turned on the current. The victim was in severe physical pain, fell to the floor several times, but was forced to stand up and repeatedly shocked. -Also, the occupiers put handcuffs on the woman's hands, a gas mask on her face, hung her handcuffs from the ceiling and beat her with a belt. The suspects held the victim in a torture chamber from July 1 to July 10, 2022. During the period of illegal imprisonment due to the inflicted mental injuries, the woman attempted suicide,- the law enforcement officers said. The issue of declaring wanted suspects is being resolved. The identification of all the occupants involved in the crime is ongoing. Two occupiers were informed in absentia of the suspicion of cruel treatment of the civilian population and committing other violations of the laws and customs of war by a group of persons in a previous conspiracy (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that this year's Human Rights Day is accompanied by terrible testimonies -rezhymy-asada-i-putina/->human rights violations in Syria. Prisons and torture chambers opened after the escape of the Assad regime revealed years of inhumane abuse of thousands of men and women. People were beaten, tortured, raped and humiliated.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/zhahy-okupacziyi-v-izyumi-identyfikovano-dvoh-rosiyan-yaki-katuvaly-matir-ukrayinskogo-pravoohoronczya/	2024-12-10T11:53:29-08:00
-For money? No!-: a woman from Lviv tried to pay a bribe for illegal travel abroad	About this reports State Border Service of Ukraine. The woman was looking for clients on the Internet, offering her services for an amount from 7 to 10 thousand US dollars. One of these clients was a 43-year-old man from Lviv who was planning to leave for Spain. The organizer received $10,000 from him and promised to assist in illegal border crossing. The woman planned to hand over part of the money, namely 7 thousand dollars, to the border guard of the 7th Carpathian border detachment. However, the employee refused the bribe and reported the crime to the competent authorities. The organizer was detained while trying to transfer money. She has already been informed of the suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: ch. 1 Art. 369 (granting an undue benefit to an official) and ch. 3 Art. 332 (illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine). The court chose a preventive measure for her. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/za-groshi-ni-lvivyanka-namagalasya-daty-habarya-za-nezakonnyj-vyyizd-za-kordon/	2024-12-10T11:34:24-08:00

He wrote about this on December 10 in social networks. -This visit is a signal of unwavering support of Ukraine from our European partners,- he noted. According to him, the head of the faction Irache García Peres confirmed that supporting Ukraine in countering Russian aggression is one of the key priorities of the faction's activity in the European Parliament. Rustem Umyerov expressed his sincere gratitude for the comprehensive assistance that the European Union provides to the Ukrainian state. They also discussed ways of consolidating international support for Ukraine, promoting the development of joint projects with the EU, in particular, between the Ukrainian and European defense industries. The Minister of Defense emphasized the need to increase the production of weapons in Europe, especially air defense systems. Separately, he noted the decision to provide Ukraine with a loan at the expense of frozen Russian assets. -I called to direct these funds to the development of the Ukrainian defense industry. Russia is trying to attack the European values ​​that unite us. Therefore, it is our common duty to end Russian aggression. Only together will we win,- Rustem Umyerov summed up. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerovmetwith Prime Minister of Estonia Kristen Michal. During the meeting, issues of military support, cooperation in the field of cyber security and the development of Ukraine's defense capabilities were discussed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/rustem-umyerov-obgovoryv-iz-yevrodeputatamy-rozvytok-oboronnoyi-promyslovosti-j-spilnyh-proyektiv-z-yes/	2024-12-10T11:31:30-08:00
Propaganda hero and informant: Gauleiter from Kozachai Lopan was exposed	Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, in March 2022, the accused, who previously worked in the internal affairs bodies of Ukraine, and later in the -militia- of the so-called -LPR-, arrived in the village of Kozacha Lopan in the temporarily occupied part of the Kharkiv region. There he headed the occupation administration created by the Russians. The traitor cooperated with the military of the Russian Federation, helping them to search among the local residents for ATO/OOS participants, volunteers and patriots. He also provided special equipment for the construction of engineering structures and provided the occupiers with information about the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. In addition, the accused recruited personnel to work in a pseudo-authority, approved relevant orders, and also called on the local population to be loyal to the invaders. In order to discredit the Ukrainian authorities and the Armed Forces, he participated in the filming of propaganda videos that were broadcast on Russian federal TV channels. After the successful counteroffensive of the Armed Forces in September 2022, the suspect fled to Russia. He is currently wanted. His trial will take place in absentia at the Chervonozavod District Court of the city of Kharkiv. He faces life in prison for the crimes he committed.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said how many Patriots Ukraine needs to close the sky	This is in his evening address on December 10. -Talked with the Central Committee about what is needed to provide more security to our cities. We are talking with all partners about additional air defense systems. We are now preparing a schedule of meetings and talks for this month to do as much as possible,- he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also spoke with the Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk today. -Good conversation. Ukraine is grateful to Poland for all the support provided, and it is a significant support. We must continue to work precisely together so that both our states become stronger. During the conversation, we planned our joint work in these weeks and also next year, when Poland's presidency of the EU will begin,- he noted. Previously, Volodymyr Zelensky stated that additional ten to twelve Patriot systems for Ukraine will save lives and make the war is meaningless for Putin. -If our sky is completely protected, they have no advantage in the sky. No anti-aircraft missiles, no missiles, any ballistic missiles, etc. will be able to hit the civil infrastructure of Ukraine, the energy industry, our hospitals, schools, universities,- he emphasized. According to him, one and a half billion is worth one system. -Take this money from Russian assets. It will cost 30 billion. But completely, finally close our sky. And that's it. People will return to normal life, and from abroad too. Children will go to schools and universities. The economy will work,- the head of state assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky discussed with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte a number of topics, including a recent meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and US President-elect Donald Trump in Paris.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/volodymyr-zelenskyj-povidomyv-skilky-patriot-neobhidno-ukrayini-dlya-zakryttya-neba/	2024-12-10T11:01:29-08:00
Occupation budget: -lnr- exists at the expense of Russian handouts	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to the draft budget, the revenues of the so-called -LNR- are planned to be 144.8 billion rubles. Of these, 92.6 billion rubles, or almost two-thirds, are interbudgetary transfers from the Russian budget. The rest of the income, including subsidies and subsidies, provides only a little more than 50 billion rubles. The largest source of own revenues remains the tax on the income of individuals - it forms 83.4% of this part of the budget. However, the arrival of investors that could improve the economic situation has not yet been observed. In addition, the Russian authorities established control over the housing and communal economy of the occupied Luhansk Region. Until 2028, non-governmental organizations are prohibited from managing apartment buildings. All functions in this area have been transferred to Russian state organizations, despite the possible objections of local residents. These facts once again demonstrate that the occupied territories remain economically unsustainable and completely dependent on external funding from Russia. As reported by ArmyInform, in occupied Aydar (former Novopskov) ->Russian troops continue raids and restrict exit from the settlement. In particular, three exits from the city remain closed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/okupaczijnyj-byudzhet-lnr-isnuye-za-rahunok-rosijskyh-podachok/	2024-12-10T10:47:40-08:00

The overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria: significance for Ukraine	This is how the more than half-century rule of the Assad family ended in Syria and one of the important stages of the civil war that has been going on since 2011. About the significance of the overthrow of the Assad regime for Ukraine, we talk to Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-: -Syrian opposition forces succeeded in triumphantly realizing -Aleppo in three days- and -Damascus in eleven days-. They drove the Assad family out of the country, which had held power for 53 years. Syria was and remains a theater of war, where two states hostile to Ukraine are actively involved: Russia and Iran. They have both invested significant resources in Syria, making it a testing ground for modern warfare tactics. However, recently the focus of their attention has shifted to other directions: Russia has stalled on the fronts against Ukraine, and Iran is waging an active proxy war against Israel. In fact, in Syria, the scenario of Afghanistan in 2021 was repeated, when the hopes of the foreign contingent on the local armed forces completely failed. In the case of Syria, the government troops surrendered the territories to the opposition even faster than the Afghans to the Taliban,- says Oleksandr Chupak. Russia, the main ally of the Assad regime, did not provide him with the necessary assistance at a critical moment. Despite the fact that Putin threatened in 2017 that -if the terrorists raise their heads, we will deal them such blows that they have not seen before,- and Moscow Patriarch Kirill said in 2015 that -the Russian operation in Syria will lead the Russian Federation away from any - what evil-. Now, apparently, evil has approached the Russian Federation again. -For Russia, Syria is an important logistics center, in fact, the only unimpeded exit to the Mediterranean Sea through the port of Tartus. This path guarantees Moscow access to the Balkans and North Africa, where Muscovites traditionally have a significant presence. Depriving Russia of Syrian ports would mean weakening, if not losing, its contact with spheres of influence in the said territories. And while the Russian-Ukrainian war continues, the Kremlin will not have access to the Mediterranean either through the Bosphorus or through Gibraltar. The failure in Syria is evidence that the war against Ukraine is draining Russian resources. In previous years, it was the presence of Moscow's private military companies with air support that allowed Assad's army to control most of the major cities without any apparent risk of losing them. Now, due to the need to transfer forces to Ukraine, the government army is left alone against its enemies. There is a widespread opinion that the elimination of Yevgeny Prigozhin, formerly the main organizer of the Russian PMK, was fatal for the Syrian contingent. Of course, the failure in Syria does not mean that Russia will immediately fall on other fronts. However, it demonstrates that the Russian military machine is not all-powerful and is capable of collapsing under the blows of well-armed and organized troops. The logical continuation of the Syrian scenario should be the expulsion of Russia from other places where it has a military presence: Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Africa and, ultimately, from the territories occupied by it, which are now part of the Russian Federation (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and many others).- Oleksandr Chupak notes. Now the events in Syria are developing dynamically - the Russians are withdrawing their troops, and Israeli armored units, on the contrary, have crossed the demarcation line on the Golan Heights and are advancing towards Damascus. Oleksandr Chupak is sure that the establishment of a Western-friendly regime in Syria will contribute to the establishment of trade in energy carriers between the countries of the Persian Gulf, Turkey and Europe. And the laying of the pipeline here will allow many countries to finally abandon Russian oil.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/povalennya-rezhymu-asada-v-syriyi-znachennya-dlya-ukrayiny/	2024-12-10T09:01:17-08:00

Electric current, pipes and threats: a Ukrainian woman tricked the people of Akhmativ and escaped fr...	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. This time it is about Magomed Uzdorbiyev, a fighter of the special rapid reaction unit of the Rosguard -Akhmat-. At the beginning of the full-scale war, his unit took part in the capture of the village of Makiivka, Svativ district, Luhansk region. In order to establish an occupation regime there, the Rashists carried out so-called -clearances-, which were accompanied by the kidnapping of local residents and the looting of private property. According to the investigation, on April 12, 2022, a group of -Kadyrivets-, which included Uzdorbiev, broke into the residence of the local headman. After the occupiers found patriotic pro-Ukrainian photos on her computer, they tied the woman up and took her to a torture chamber set up in a captured gymnasium on the territory of the community. In the cells, Uzdorbiev together with his accomplices tortured the victim with electric current and beat her with a metal plastic pipe. Then the Rashists kept the woman handcuffed to the battery for several hours. During the torture, the -Kadyrov- demanded that she provide them with the residential addresses of the families of Ukrainian defenders. Also, the person involved -knocked out- from the victim information about the places where she hid the Ukrainian flags that she took from the gymnasium during the capture of the village. Late in the evening, the occupiers let the woman go home so that she could collect the -necessary- information for them under the threat of death within a two-day period. However, the victims managed to secretly get out of the village to the territory controlled by Ukraine, without providing the occupiers with any information about the Ukrainian soldiers and their families. Forensic medical examination confirmed that the victims suffered severe injuries as a result of torture. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Uzdorbiev of the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (cruel treatment of the civilian population and other violations of the laws and customs of war committed by a group of persons in a previous conspiracy). Comprehensive measures are underway to find and punish the war criminal.

The horror of Syrian torture camps: the President of Ukraine compared the regimes of Assad and Putin	He wrote about this in his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the Assad regime relied exclusively on violence for decades, and Russia uses the same methods. The President emphasized that the Russian occupiers created similar torture chambers and prisons in every occupied territory of Ukraine. Atrocities began in Crimea in 2014, when repressions affected Crimean Tatars, journalists and politicians. Later, similar practices spread to Donbas, in particular in the infamous Isolation prison, and after a large-scale invasion in 2022, they became even larger and more brutal. The president emphasized that Assad and Putin are not just vassals and overlords, but accomplices in violence. Dictators like Assad cannot survive without the support of dictators like Putin, who, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, will surely seek revenge for the fall of Assad. -There must be punishment for terrible atrocities and violations of human rights. In fact, Putin and Assad should end up in prison, not those innocent people whom they have been imprisoning for years,- the head of state emphasized. The President called on the international community to unite and support Ukraine in the fight against the Russian dictatorship, stressing that this will help protect other regions of the world from violence. As reported by ArmyInform, for the retreat from the Syrian Republic Russians attracted a caravan of military transport ships, on which the remnants of troops, weapons and military equipment are loaded techniques	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/zhahy-syrijskyh-kativen-prezydent-ukrayiny-porivnyav-rezhymy-asada-i-putina/	2024-12-10T06:49:26-08:00

About this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- told - lieutenant colonel Yevhenii Romanov. According to Yevgeny Romanov, it's all because they are trying to advance where their artillery and aviation have already worked. It is difficult for them to maintain defense in these destroyed areas. The defense forces, on the other hand, effectively destroy the attack aircraft. -It is very difficult for them to bring ammunition supplies there. Replace people. Evacuation of the wounded. The dead are not even mentioned. And getting new forces there is another task, since they move on foot, they do not use armored vehicles,- said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Armored vehicles are not used, in particular, also because this resource is limited. As is the human resource. -Professional soldiers are worn out in 10 years of war. They already use such a resource that they have caught or lured with money, collected from prisons. This is not an army, this is a meeting place,- Yevgeny Romanov said.

They say that they will be -zeroed- if they go back. Such people later get lost somewhere, turn off their walkie-talkies, they try to find them, because if one does not leave, the others also start to refuse,- said Mykola Zinko. According to him, Russians are greatly affected by the sad fate of those who went on assaults earlier. -They understand that the previous group went to the same end, we destroyed it, that's why their motivation disappears,- Mykola Zinko said. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 5th assault Kyiv brigade repelled a foot assault of the occupiers in the Pokrovsky direction. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ne-vyhodyty-na-zvyazok-i-zagubytysya-yak-rosiyany-unykayut-uchasti-u-myasnyh-shturmah/	2024-12-10T05:52:19-08:00

The complex for elite recreation will become a base for military training	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Private individuals with administrative influence, financial resources and parliamentary powers illegally took possession of it in 2017 and built a recreation center there with a helipad and hunting services for wealthy clients.

Checking the roads several times a day: how our fighters fight remote enemy mining	This was reported on the Army TV stream by the commander of the fire support company of the 5th Kyiv Assault Brigade Mykola Zinko. -Very often the Russians use FPV drones to mine our logistics. Enemy drones simply land on the road with ammunition. It can even be a TM-ka (anti-tank mine). But here our sappers work perfectly, and those areas where our logistics routes pass, they pass several times a day,- said Mykola Zinko. According to him, there are also enemy drones that drop -petal- mines on the roads. -They are anti-personnel, but their explosion is quite enough to puncture a tire and the like,- remarked Mykola Zinko. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 5th Kyiv assault brigade hit a Russian bomber RBU-6000 -Smerch-2- in the Kramatorsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/perevirka-dorig-po-kilka-raziv-na-dobu-yak-nashi-bijczi-boryutsya-z-dystanczijnym-minuvannyam-voroga/	2024-12-10T02:23:29-08:00
Hit in the head - our drones hit either a very dumb or a deaf occupier	The video of combat work was released on December 10 on the brigade's channel. Two Russian soldiers were walking along the road when our FPV drone flew up to them. For some reason, the occupiers did not try to react to him at all: they did not run away and did not evade. Then the drone was able to fly up and hit one of the Russians directly in the head. The second invader, not at all impressed (in every sense of the word), simply moved on. -Sudden death overtook the occupier,- the brigade commented on the video.

Panic escape - for evacuation from Syria, the Russians brought in a whole caravan of planes	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 10. Several An-124 and Il-76MD aircraft are scheduled to fly from the Khmeimim airbase on routes to the Ulyanovsk, Chkalovsky and Privolzhsky airfields. Also, the aggressor state attracts additional fleet objects: in particular, the city of Baltiysk was ordered to prepare the dry cargo ship Sparta II and the large landing ship -Alexander Shabalin- for the departure to Tartus. The large amphibious ships of the Northern Fleet of Russia -Alexander Otrakovsky- and -Ivan Green- headed for the Mediterranean Sea. The enemy frigates -Admiral Gorshkov- and -Admiral Golovko- are also participating in the -Syrian retreat- operation. In the port of Tartusa, the Russians are carrying out emergency dismantling of equipment and military property. Several hundred Russian special forces have already arrived there to ensure the safety of the retreat. Probably, the aggressor state is counting on agreements with anti-government forces regarding an unimpeded exit from Syria. Even the representatives of the so-called Moscow diplomacy no longer call the rebel groups against the Assad regime -terrorists-, but demonstrate a neutral, even -sweet- public rhetoric. Meanwhile, frustration and oppression continue among the remnants of the Russian contingent in Syria - Muscovites even express dissatisfaction with their leaders and commanders, in particular with their organizational incompetence.

Unfortunately, the enemy has an extremely large resource. And he does not regret it, it happens that the platoon, and sometimes the company. So that you understand, an infantry platoon is 30 people, an infantry company is 100 people,- said Mykola Volokhov. For the enemy, his infantry is expendable. The enemy command can kill its stormtroopers just to check something. -Just to see what it will be like. If, for example, you try to swim across that Oskil. Try to swim in different ways. Look. And if those infantry are lost, they believe that this is the normal state of affairs,- said the commander of the Terra unit of the 3rd separate assault brigade.

And that is why there are constant assaults in Vovchansk. -About ten every day. And the enemy attacks in small groups, and so-called meat assaults. They throw, relatively speaking, half a hundred of those who don't feel sorry for it - and maybe they will manage to capture some such locations,- said the head of the media interaction group of the State Border Service -Hart- brigade. If such one-time attack aircraft manage to capture positions, follow them more professional fighters are coming. -They are covered by artillery, mortars, and the same drones. But these attempts are unsuccessful, unsuccessful. The enemy is trying to make his way through the ruins of what is left of the city, but they are already waiting for him,- assured Oleksandr Danylenko. How ArmyInform reported that the situation in the Vovchan direction is stable and tense. The enemy continues to shell our positions with all available weapons: anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, drones, mortars.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/pivsotni-tyh-kogo-ne-shkoda-kydayut-na-prolom-u-vovchansku-vorog-ne-prypynyaye-shturmuvaty/	2024-12-10T00:16:00-08:00
70,000 people once lived here - the ruins of Toretsk from our drone cameras	The video was released on December 10 on the brigade's channel. -In 2014, about 70,000 people lived their full lives in Toretsk&#8230; But as of December 2024, about one and a half thousand locals refuse to leave the once glorious city. This is the current population in Toretsk. Of which almost nothing was left after the arrival of the -liberators,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, the 42nd mechanized brigade reported that on December 1 Russians have launched massive offensive operations in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/kolys-tut-zhylo-70-tysyach-lyudej-ruyiny-toreczka-z-kamer-nashyh-droniv/	2024-12-10T00:02:41-08:00
Fake diagnoses, bogus marriages, personal escorts - the most popular schemes of crossing the border ...	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on December 10. Statistics of criminal proceedings show that illegal schemes for transporting people across the state border are mainly created by officials, employees of the TCC, MSEK, doctors and law enforcement officers. Most often, criminals use the mechanism of removal from military registration due to fake diagnoses of unfitness for military service. Also, the employees of the DBR began to identify cases where they tried to make money from conscripts directly at the checkpoints. Personal escort services to the border, sham marriages, etc. appeared. During the investigation of such proceedings, only the amount of documented bribes amounted to UAH 11.4 million. In fact, the amounts are much higher and will be established during the investigation. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/pidrobleni-diagnozy-lypovi-odruzhennya-osobystyj-suprovid-nazvani-najpopulyarnishi-shemy-perepravlennya-cherez-kordon/	2024-12-09T23:46:58-08:00

The most famous Middle Eastern -heavyweight-: Israeli gunsmiths improve their drone	As stated in a statement on the official portal of this aerospace giant, combining UAV characteristics and missiles, the Harop has long been a formidable barrage munition equipped to hunt high-value targets such as unmanned surface ships, command points, supply depots, tanks and air defense systems, ArmyInform reports. Using an electro-optical homing head and no pre-reconnaissance plans, the Harop has a 9-hour airborne endurance to search for targets in a defined area, locate and identify them, plan an attack route, and then strike from any direction, shallow or steep diving At the same time, according to the data developers of kamikaze drones, Harop overcomes difficulties in communicating with control points thanks to its immunity to GNSS jamming. As a guided weapon system, Harop is controlled by man-in-the-loop remote control and its combat mission can be interrupted if necessary. Launched from containers mounted on trucks or naval vessels, the Harop is easily deployed in a variety of terrains and environments. One of the key features of the Harop is its homing system. It is equipped with electro-optical and infrared sensors that allow you to find targets in difficult weather conditions and at night. As soon as the target is identified, the drone heads towards it, destroying it by detonating the built-in warhead. AI Harop has impressive technical parameters that make it versatile: — Flight range: up to 1000 km. — Flight time: 6 hours. — Maximum speed: 417 km/h. — Weight of the warhead: 16 kg. - Hit accuracy: less than 5 meters error. These characteristics make the Harop effective against a wide range of targets, including radars, command posts, armored vehicles and ships. IAI Harop has already entered the armed forces of countries such as Israel, India, Azerbaijan, Singapore and Morocco. Its capabilities are valued for high accuracy and flexibility in modern warfare. In addition to the basic version, there is a smaller Mini Harop model, which is designed for tasks at shorter distances and is more compact. Barrage munitions such as the Harop are becoming increasingly popular due to their cost effectiveness. Unlike traditional missiles or drones, these UAVs are able to stay in the conflict zone for a long time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike. This greatly increases their tactical value. Barrage munitions, such as Harop, are becoming part of a global trend towards the development of autonomous weapons systems. They provide a strategic advantage on the battlefield, minimizing personnel risks and increasing the accuracy of strikes. In the coming years, it can be expected that their use will only expand and technologies will improve, making these systems an even more important part of the arsenals of the leading military states.

Danish F-16s — after Syria to Ukraine: where they fought - Fighting Falcons - Royal Air Force	Where the Danish F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-purpose fighter jets managed to fight before reaching Ukraine, ArmyInform reminds. The first serial -Fighting Falcons- entered service with the Royal Danish Air Force in the spring of 1980. Gradually, they replaced the already significantly outdated at that time second-generation fighters F-100 D/F Super Saber and F-104 Starfighter. By the mid-1980s, they were adopted by four squadrons - 727 and 730 at Skrudstrup Air Base and 723 and 726 at Aalborg Air Base. Subsequently, in 2005, all Danish Fighting Falcons were assembled into 727 and 730 squadrons at Skrudstrup air base. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the main task of the Danish F-16 was the protection of the territory of Denmark and integrated participation in the defense of the countries of Western Europe within the framework of NATO's general strategy. Since the 1990s, the set of tasks of the Royal Danish Air Force has changed significantly. In 1999, the Royal Danish Air Force was reorganized into an -expeditionary- force capable of supporting international operations around the world. Danish combat and transport aircraft began to be deployed and used in a number of international military operations. For the first time, F-16s of the Royal Danish Air Force took part in the NATO bloc's military operation -Allied Force- during the war in Kosovo on the territory of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The operation lasted from March 24 to June 10, 1999 and became the final stage of the Kosovo War. During it, F-16s became the first military aircraft of the Royal Danish Air Force to take direct part in combat operations. At that time, a total of nine F-16 fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force from the 730 squadron took part in the mission of missile-bombing of military facilities on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Before, during and after Operation Allied Force, units from all four squadrons of the Royal Danish Air Force visited the Balkans. Denmark's combat aircraft were based at the Italian Grazzanise Air Base. Soon, Danish F-16s took part in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In this operation against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in 2001-2003, six -Fighting Falcons- from the 727th squadron took part. Taking off from the territory of Kyrgyzstan, they carried out 743 missions, conducting reconnaissance and bombing terrorist targets. It was at this time that the F-16s proved their unique ability to rapidly deploy and be based almost anywhere in the world. The infrastructure of the airfields (Ganchi, Manas, Kant) of the former Soviet republic, and then also of Afghanistan, turned out to be quite suitable and sufficient for the placement of these fighters. After the accession of the Baltic states to NATO, F-16 fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force took part in patrolling the airspace of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania within the Baltic Air Policing. Based at the Šiauliai International Airport in Lithuania, from July to October 2004, five Battle Falcons flew 48 sorties defending the new members of the North Atlantic Alliance. Subsequently, Danish F-16s took part in the surveillance and protection of the airspace of the Baltic States also in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2014, and also patrolled the airspace over Iceland in 2009, 2010 and 2015. In 2009, Danish fighters flew over Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland at the same time. In 2011, six Danish F-16s from 727 and 730 squadrons took part in NATO's joint operation -Unified Protector- in Libya. Being stationed at the Sigonella Air Base in Sicily, the fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force flew 599 sorties from March 20 to October 31, 2011, dropping 923 high-precision guided aerial bombs on military targets. In just the first 12 days of the initial Odyssey Dawn operation, Danish F-16s flew 41 sorties and dropped 102 bombs. In total, during Operation Unified Protector, the Danish -Battle Falcons- flew approximately 1,300 sorties. This was about 5% of the total sorties by NATO aircraft, which flew a total of 26,435 sorties. The last combat mission of the Danish F-16 before arriving in Ukraine was the participation in the operation -Inherent Resolve- against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. From October 2014 to October 2015, seven Combat Falcons from Denmark were based at Ahmed Al-Jaber Airfield in Kuwait, flying 547 sorties over Iraq and dropping 503 aerial bombs. In the next phase of the fight against ISIS, seven Danish F-16s operated over Iraq and Syria, based at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. From June 17 to October 5, 2016, fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force flew 166 sorties, striking 231 targets. After the Royal Danish Air Force adopted the Combat Falcons, progress significantly accelerated, software and hardware made a significant leap. This led to the need for a technological upgrade of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Danish F-16s have undergone significant modernization, largely carried out in cooperation with Danish industry. The Fighting Falcons were updated under the Mid-Life Update program, designed to maintain the effectiveness of existing aircraft in the middle of their service life. Thanks to this, the aircraft that Denmark handed over to Ukraine are significantly technologically improved. Engine improvements give them more power while using less fuel, and new and updated instruments and weapon systems provide better pilotability and weapon accuracy in difficult combat conditions. Currently, even a relatively small number of F-16 Fighting Falcon available in the Air Force of Ukraine -povitryanyh-czilej-zbyly-bojovi-sokoly/->makes a significant contribution to airspace protection country. Thanks to Denmark, the increase in the number of Ukrainian -Combat Falcons- will be able to significantly increase the effectiveness of these combat aircraft in the Ukrainian sky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/danski-f-16-pislya-syriyi-do-ukrayiny-de-voyuvaly-bojovi-sokoly-korolivskyh-povitryanyh-syl/	2024-12-09T21:01:26-08:00
-I came to the TCC, although I had armor-: about repelling the attack of 15 invaders and the -repair...	How did you manage to repulse the assault near Nevsky in the winter of 2023? But who else from Valery's family has also now joined the defense of Ukraine? The sergeant told our correspondent about this: -I myself came to my TCC on March 6, 2022. Although I, as a railwayman, had armor. Two months passed and my eldest son followed me to serve. From our family, now we are both fighting. I can remember one of the combat episodes. It was in February 2023. It was necessary to repel the attack of the assault group, where there were a lot of occupiers. It was near Nevsky in Donetsk region. At that time, we had already been in those positions for a month. Constant shelling, assaults&#8230; That day again, before the assault, there was heavy shelling. We saw a group of 15 people. They opened fire from small arms on them. At the same time, we adjusted our mortars, they helped us a lot then. The enemy has never attacked us with such a number at the same time. But then we fought back. Although the enemy managed to approach us by 50 meters. In general, during that period it was such that we lost some positions, but over time we still repelled them. And when another unit replaced us, we transferred all the positions we had taken at the beginning, we did not lose a single one. During all this time, I had many injuries. The last time the air ambulance came, it damaged my inner ear, ruptured the eardrum. But already more or less, the doctors repaired it. Now I have transferred to the management of the company as a material support sergeant. Because over time the commander saw in me a manager. In general, before the large-scale invasion, I was a civilian, working on the railways since 2009. He started as a track fitter, then an engineer, and when he entered the war, he was the chief mechanic of the enterprise. Maybe that's why they transferred me to the office, because they saw that I can work with documents and people. I am currently serving as the Battalion Headquarters Logistics Group Officer.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ya-pryjshov-do-tczk-hocha-j-mav-bron-pro-vidbyttya-ataky-15-okupantiv-ta-vidremontovane-vuho-serzhanta-zaliznychnyka/	2024-12-09T20:31:44-08:00
Kremlin media attacks on the Armed Forces: why the enemy continuously demonizes Ukrainian soldiers	In the draft state budget of the Russian Federation for 2025, more than 137 billion rubles ($1.4 billion) is provided for financing state propaganda, which is 13% more than this year. For comparison: in 2023, this amount was 58 billion rubles ($500 million). Propagandists on different platforms tailor their messages to their target audience. For example, some sites use emotional and negative language, which grossly violates journalistic standards. At the same time, more restrained lexemes and constructions are applied to others. This variety of communication approaches caters to the needs of different categories of readers: for some, open language of hostility is presented, for others, more veiled rhetoric. However, identical messages and images aimed at discrediting Ukraine and Ukrainians are consistently promoted on all platforms. Russian media often -attack- soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Their messages are almost always accompanied by aggressive clarifications about -Nazism- or demonize the fighters, which contributes to the formation of a negative image. In addition to dehumanizing the image of the Ukrainian military, the Russians fuel the rhetoric of -victims- by constantly generating different stories with the same scenarios, where it seems that the Ukrainian military kills, abuses, affects mothers with children, etc. This cements in the mind of the domestic consumer a persistent association that armed forces and violence are identical. Thus, over the past few days, Russian sources have been circulating new batches of fakes about the alleged killings by the Ukrainian military of civilians in Donbas and throwing bodies into wells, about the destruction of drinking water sources, the destruction of churches, etc. Propagandists, of course, do not provide any evidence for these stories. All these publications refer either to the -testimony- of the Russian military, or to the words of residents of the occupied territories, who recount something that they seem to have heard from others. The purpose of such fakes is to discredit the Defense Forces of Ukraine and an attempt to justify their own numerous war crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ataky-kremlivskyh-media-na-zsu-dlya-chogo-vorog-bezperervno-demonizuye-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv/	2024-12-09T20:16:22-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi commented on the events in Syria and the presence of Wagnerites in Africa	The head of state wrote about this on December 9 in social networks. -Assad's regime fell not only because of the strength of the opposition. This also happened because there are not enough Russian troops there. Why? Because the entire combat-ready Russian army is on the territory of Ukraine. And this says precisely that the entire army of this pseudo-empire is fighting against the Ukrainian people today,- he assured. According to him, the same is already happening in Africa. -We know that the Wagnerites were there. And we know how many -Wagnerians- were destroyed in Ukraine. -Russia wants its regimes in Africa, which would influence the African continent, and for this they used the Wagnerites,- the President noted. In his opinion, that is why it is very important today that all countries that value a world without war and security - European countries, the United States, other countries of the world, world leaders - understand this perspective: now and right here, a lot is being decided. -The strength of Ukraine depends on whether the Russian army is strong. Because if Ukraine falls, Putin will return to Syria to take revenge, and to Africa, and to many other regions that interest him. And it seems to me that this is the most important thing that everyone should understand: in this union around Ukraine, success is the general success of the world,- he summarized.

The Prime Minister of Estonia assured that his country and people will continue to support Ukraine in all possible ways, because they consider Russia a common enemy. -We made it clear: Ukraine is part of Europe and should be part of NATO. Because if we want to have a just and lasting peace, we need both. Because if Putin wins and changes the borders by force, it will send a signal to, for example, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and everyone else to continue doing similar things. So for Europe, what Ukraine is doing is a struggle for the freedom of Europe, and also for the freedom of the entire democratic world,- said Kristen Michal.

We are very grateful for that. We believe that this aid will not stop and that Germany will support Ukraine. We are counting on stronger, decisive actions by Germany from you personally,- the head of state said. The President noted friendly relations between Ukraine and Germany. In particular, this is confirmed by recent negotiations with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Kyiv and a meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Paris. Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Friedrich Mertz discussed increasing the financing of military aid to Ukraine for the next year. This is critically necessary to protect lives in Ukraine, as the country suffers from Russian strikes every day, and every show of support saves lives. The increase in aid also directly strengthens Ukraine's position to bring a just and credible peace closer. One of the key topics of the meeting is the Victory Plan.

Friedrich Merz noted that there is an intense debate in Germany about the details of military support and what kind of weapons to transfer to Ukraine, but there is a consensus in principle about providing aid to end the war and establish a just peace. -The position of our faction is clear: we want to give your Armed Forces the ability to reach military bases - not the civilian population and infrastructure, but so that you can achieve the very objectives from which the war against your country is being waged. I spoke about this a few weeks ago in the Bundestag. By limiting the range of weapons, we force you to fight with one hand behind your back,- he emphasized.

Provision of the largest army in Europe: the DOT spoke about the results of the work	Arsen Zhumadilov, general director of the Procurement Agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -State rear operator-. According to Arsen Zhumadilov, this result is due to the fact that the agency managed to build the right procurement process. As it should be. -We have planning, we have normal interaction with the consumer, on the one hand. On the other hand, we have interaction with the market. This means that we understand exactly what the consumer needs and when, and we place appropriate orders in a timely manner through the Prozorro electronic procurement system,- he said. According to the general director of the -State rear operator-, they provide the largest army in Europe, one of the largest in the world. It is a very large system in itself, in which there are many components. Now the agency has signed contracts for the total amount of 75 billion hryvnias — they closed needs with a total cost of 92 billion hryvnias. 17 billion hryvnias were saved. And all because of the predictability of the process and competitiveness. -Already in November of this year, we are purchasing what will be delivered in the next one. That is, it was not the case when we started at the beginning of this year - we needed to ensure the supply of goods under the contracts that we entered into at the beginning of January, so that the deliveries under these contracts would be in January,- said the general director of the procurement agency. The digital algorithms used by the DOT allow both to control suppliers and to interest them. -Previously, an average of 45-60 days passed between the delivery of goods and payment. Now, due to the fact that this entire process has been digitized, including all additional invoices, documents, etc., from the delivery of the product to the payment for this product takes an average of 10-15 days,- Arsen Zhumadilov stated. DOT responds to all problematic moments as quickly as possible and solves them systematically. As for failures, here the general director of the agency is adamant. -Regarding failures. Nevertheless, I will say that in 24 we managed to avoid them. As of today, we do not have any -material- failures, that is, everyone changed clothes for the winter in a timely manner. Not for fuel and lubricants - the equipment is moving, it needs to be refueled. No in terms of nutrition,- assured Arsen Zhumadilov.

Putin does not want this war to end. Therefore, he must be forced - the President	The President wrote about this on December 9. -I emphasized to both President Macron and President Trump: first of all, you will see that Putin does not want this war to end. Therefore, he must be forced. It is possible to force only if Ukraine is strong. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy is strong on the battlefield. It's a strong army, it's weapons packages, etc., it's long-range systems, certainly -atakams-, and -taurus-, and -storm shadows-, and -scalps-. We need all this very, very much. And yes, exclusively for strikes on military targets, we emphasize this,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. According to him, security guarantees are also important. -Now we cannot be in NATO, but we can be invited to NATO. And we already need such security guarantees. And we talked about that. And this is exactly how I formulate our opinion. As for the invitation to NATO, it is difficult to talk about it with President Trump today, because he is not yet in the White House, he does not have all these legal rights,- explained Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said that he is going to call President Joe Biden in the near future and raise the very issue of the invitation to NATO. -Because Biden is currently the current President of the United States, and a lot depends on his position. And it makes no sense to discuss with President Trump what today, while he is not in the White House, does not depend on him,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He also thanked the United States and Joe Biden, bipartisan support for the recent package, which the President called very important and serious support for Ukraine. -If there is a pause while Ukraine is not in NATO, and even if we had an invitation, but we would not be in NATO, and there is a pause, then who will guarantee us some kind of security? We can think and work on Emmanuel Macron's position. He suggested that some part of the troops of one or another country should be present on the territory of Ukraine, which would guarantee our security while Ukraine is not in NATO. But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and when Ukraine will be in NATO. Understanding our future, these would be very effective guarantees,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, President told about enemy attacks for the past week.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/putin-ne-hoche-zakinchennya-cziyeyi-vijny-tomu-jogo-treba-prymusyty-prezydent/	2024-12-09T04:45:25-08:00

- My sons did not even serve a term...-. The story of the Savostyanov family, which chooses victory ...	But no calls ring in his apartment. Neither apartment nor telephone numbers. He understands that he will never again sit down with his son at the table and talk to him. In such moments, when he is enveloped by indescribable sadness and does not want to live, he drips Corvalol, trying to calm his heart. But where is there!.. Tolya Savostyanov, like most Ukrainians, learned about the large-scale invasion of Russians from television news broadcasts. And the arrivals of -Iskanders- and -Calibers- that -visited- the city once again confirmed this information. And on February 26, when thousands of residents of Dnipro continued to leave their homes, fleeing from the war, a man went to one of the city's territorial recruitment centers with a single request - to be allowed to defend both his city and the whole of Ukraine. There they asked if he has experience in army service, what military specialty he has and where he would like to serve. — I know about the army from movies and the stories of my father, a personnel officer, he sincerely admitted. — And where would you like to serve? And anywhere. The main thing is to be in action&#8230; After a short conversation, he was sent to the 234th Battalion of the 128th Territorial Defense Brigade. Sagittarius -Later, the son said that thousands of our compatriots came to the brigade assembly point in those February days and he was proud that he was among them,- continues the father. — Our units entered the battle after a month and a half and stopped the enemy's offensive in the spring of 2022 on the border of Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Over time, all of them took part in operations to liberate Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, and Donetsk region. The son, who had never even held a machine gun in his hands before, admitted to me that he had learned military craft from his brothers who had passed through the ATO/OOS. And there were quite a few of them in the unit. He has been to many hot spots in this damn war. The hottest is Kurakhovo district in Donetsk region. There he survived a lot of artillery and rocket attacks, when it seemed that his life was about to end. However, he survived by some miracle. What I heard from my son is difficult for an adequate person to understand. From his words, I know that Putin's scoundrels simply wiped off the face of the earth both the city and the people - its residents. No, bastard katsaps are not at war with us, but are destroying us and our children, as Ukrainians were destroyed by their ancestors at the beginning of the 30s of the last century. The only difference is that those were dying of hunger, and these are being beaten with Calibers and Daggers. When it came to the danger that befalls our boys at every step and I asked my son to be careful, Tolya said that the Lord God himself was helping him. But one day ended tragically for him: he received an injury that, as doctors later said, was incompatible with life. But his brothers quickly took him to a mobile hospital, where doctors stabilized his condition. Anatoly Sevastyanov was treated in many military hospitals, including the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Clinical Hospital, through which thousands of our soldiers have passed and where the best doctors are gathered. He underwent cranial trepanation, several of the most difficult surgical interventions in the head area. The duel with the skeleton lasted almost a year. Unfortunately, she prevailed and he passed away this summer. -Anatoly was a real soldier, although he did not wear a soldier's uniform until February 2022,- says one of his brothers. — If you want to hear about him as a person, then I will say one thing: he was ready to sacrifice his own life for the sake of the lives of those around him. Anatoly went to the TCC on February 26, and his brother Oleg on April 9, telling his father that he was ashamed to sleep at home, knowing that his brother was fighting. To Serhii Anatoliyovych's suggestion to think it over, he answered with a categorical -no-. He happened to serve in the 55th Zaporizhzhya Sich Artillery Brigade, armed with 155-mm French self-propelled artillery. Together with the same guys, more than once and more than twice he terrorized the occupiers, accurately destroying both manpower and equipment. At first he was a gunner, but over time he retrained as a -KRAZ- driver, providing batteries with shells. Oleg, by the way, learned the driving trade at the Society's Dnipro driving school. And mastered it properly. Fellow gunners say that only because of Sevastyanov's remarkable driving skills, his car, which was repeatedly tracked by enemy UAVs, did not become a target of the Russians. Talking with retired Major Serhii Savostyanov, I asked him what his greatest wish was, to which he replied: — First of all, I want the death of my son Anatoly to become one of the bricks in our victory over the enemy. I want to wait for Oleg to be alive and well. Then we will gather both his brothers and the fallen Anatoliy at the same table. And we will remember my son, and tens of thousands of other sons, fathers, brothers, whom fathers and mothers, children and wives did not wait for, not with an angry, silent word, as the poet wrote.

Our naval drones worked on Russian helicopters and airplanes near the Crimean Bridge	About this reported on December 9 Security Service of Ukraine. The Russian pilots considered themselves hunters and counted on easy hunting, but they became the prey, because the naval drones opened fire in return. The newest -Sea Baby- were equipped with large-caliber machine guns with ballistic programs for automatic guidance and automatic target acquisition. Intercepted Russian radio communication indicates that there are dead and wounded on board the helicopters. The helicopters themselves received significant damage and now require major repairs. SBU drones also hit a barge that was transporting military equipment and equipment for the repair of the Crimean bridge, which the occupiers are still trying in vain to restore after previous bombings by the Ukrainian special services. -Sea Baby- is our multi-purpose platform, which can accommodate various weapons: both missile systems of volley fire, and flying drones and heavy machine guns. The main thing is that it once again proved its effectiveness. The results of our work are actually much more than we can show now, but everything has its time,- the SBU said. These water drones were produced as a result of the joint fundraising of several foundations and volunteer communities in February of this year. As ArmyInform reported, the Ukrainian drone war in the Black Sea led to the failure of special operations of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/nashi-morski-drony-vidpraczyuvaly-po-rosijskyh-vertolotah-ta-litakah-nepodalik-krymskogo-mostu/	2024-12-08T23:49:27-08:00

Martens, leopards and cobras: the expert told about a German zoo that helps Ukraine	-Only if you go through the most important classes of weapons, then Germany is definitely in at least the top five (those who provide assistance - ed.). So let's figure it out. Excellent Leopard 2 tanks. In my opinion, there is nothing better in tank building. Despite this, there is also Leopard 1. Of course, there is a slightly weaker 105 -millimeter gun, but as an infantry cover weapon works just fine. Very successful Marder (Ukrainian marten) infantry vehicles. They are surpassed only, in my opinion, by combat Swedish CV90s and, of course, the M2 Bradley. There is no need to talk about the Iris-T air defense system. This is the only system with a medium range of up to 50 km, which has one hundred percent damage to the target: and all possible, both cruise missiles and unmanned systems. Not to mention such, at first glance, seemingly banal things, but very, very necessary - demining machines. We understand that our country is currently the most mined country on planet Earth. Further. Beautiful grenade launchers Panzerfaust 3 - after AT-4 and after Instalaz C90 and Carl Gustaf are probably the most massive and best grenade launcher. Plus much needed stuff like DM-31 anti-tank mines and the like, with a huge amount of small arms, a very nice Heckler automatic rifle &amp; Koch. Yes, I would very much like to see a good Taurus long-range missile appear (in Ukraine - ed.), but there are also certain nuances here. The Germans produced up to 600 of them in total, and they have about 125 in their arsenal. Even if 30 of them conditionally appear, they fundamentally do not solve anything. Some fat target will definitely be destroyed, but it is not necessary to talk about the fact that this is a war-breaking missile. Plus one more very important detail also matters. This is a huge amount of microelectronics and especially optics. The Germans have always been famous for very high-quality optics of all types and aiming systems. Not to mention the fantastic COBRA counter-battery machine. The Russians don't have anything like that. And most of all, we can safely say that this is almost the best class of weapons that exists. Even American systems of various purposes, say, AN/TPQ-36, 48, 50, are not equal to this particular machine&#8230; Therefore, it is definitely not correct to throw stones at our strategic ally on the European continent.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/kunyczi-leopardy-ta-kobry-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-nimeczkyj-zoopark-yakyj-dopomagaye-ukrayini/	2024-12-08T21:03:11-08:00
-Cowboy Duel- on MSDS: how -Drone- on -Hurricane- is seconds ahead of the invaders	The acting commander of the artillery platoon of the 48th separate artillery brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, junior sergeant Andrii with the call sign -Drone- told ArmyInform about his military career and combat work - the importance of the speed and coordination of the crew's actions, the -sharp vision- of drones and the accuracy of shots -. The call sign -Drone- has been attached to Andrii since the beginning of the service - as early as 2020. The military man says that he is not connected with the UAV, but with the abbreviation of his name. Andriy - -Andron-, -Dron- - that's how it happened between the brothers. — I entered the Armed Forces of my own free will back in 2020, signed a contract, passed the basic combined military training and studied in one of the artillery brigades. In January 2021, he received the -hundredth VOS- and was sent to the zone of joint military operations (Operations of the United Forces - ed.), where he served for 8 months and returned for training in his profession, the soldier says. In 2020, Andrii just turned 20 years old. At that time, it seemed to many Ukrainians that the war in the East of Ukraine had stopped forever, and to end it once and for all, it was enough to simply stop shooting. Instead, -Drone- was sure that if you wanted peace, you should prepare for war. — Studied in 2014. I was 14 years old then, and although of course no one drafted me into the army, even then I thought and wanted to go and serve as a volunteer - to defend my land, family and friends from the enemy. For me, the war began at the end of 2013, when the Maidan began, repressions began against students, against ordinary people, - explains the gunner. At the educational center, Andrii not only studied, but also taught himself. As the most motivated and responsible cadet, he was appointed deputy commander. And since there were not enough instructors, -Drone- often conducted classes with his brothers himself. — I have been interested in and engaged in -military- since childhood. I watched historical and documentary films, read books about war, studied weapons and battle tactics. That's why he had certain theoretical knowledge, says Andriy. The military adds that despite the limited training time and the lack of instructors, they trained and prepared for combat operations in a high-quality manner. Then, in the zone of OOS, it was possible to significantly improve the acquired knowledge and skills, because it was necessary for the daily performance of combat and special tasks. — In the OOS zone in our area of ​​responsibility for a long time, everything was generally quiet and peaceful. Several times we went on duty for three days. Of course, there was a tense situation on the front line, there were shelling. At that time, we were preparing, sharpening our skills, knowledge, and gaining practice, the fighter recalls. — Already from November to December 2021, it became finally clear that a full-scale invasion would inevitably take place. -Russian troops were approaching the border with Ukraine, and we were sent to artillery training,- Andriy says about the eve of the start of the great war. Then he began training to be an anti-tank platoon commander, mastered the MT-12 -Rapir- gun, the -Grad- MLRS and the -Uragan-. I had to continue studying already in combat conditions - practicing with rocket artillery on columns of Russian invaders in the Sumy region. In 2022, -Dron- fought in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions, took part in the expulsion of the occupiers from the North of Ukraine, the successful offensive of the Defense Forces of Ukraine north of Kharkiv at the end of April - in May, and the famous Slobozhan offensive operation in September-October. — In the Sumy region, we worked mainly on columns of Russian equipment. And in the Kharkiv region, they have already begun to work on base camps, on the accumulation of manpower and equipment, on the placement of equipment on firing positions. In September, we worked from the Kharkiv side towards the border with the Belgorod region of Russia. They hit enemy positions in the area of ​​the village of Liptsi and neighboring villages, Andrii recalls. — In jet artillery, there are several types of projectiles, which are used depending on the target on which it is necessary to inflict fire damage. There are explosive devices, there are cassettes. We can hit infantry, fortifications, columns or clusters of enemy vehicles. We can remotely mine the area with anti-tank mines to prevent the enemy from advancing, says the gunner. The most memorable for the military was the well-aimed strikes on enemy anti-aircraft guns - -Hrad- and -Smerch-. There were cases when, thanks to the timely receipt of information from intelligence, it was possible to hit the enemy right at the firing position even while he was starting to deploy and prepare for firing. — If the intelligence worked on time, provided quality data, then there is nothing complicated about it — we just have time faster than them and know exactly where to hit, -Dron- explains. To an outside observer, it reminds one of the famous cinematic cowboy duel, in which the faster and more accurate wins. However, here the enemies are not several meters apart, but tens of kilometers, and their weapons are not Colts and Winchesters, but deadly long-range salvo missile systems. High-quality and timely further intelligence allows you to stay ahead of the enemy by seconds. To practice on the target, gunners are given coordinates, after which they begin to perform a combat mission. - A full pack of 16 shells can be fired in a very short time - from 8 to 20 seconds. It is necessary to prepare for shooting in a few seconds, one and a half minutes maximum. And it is necessary to roll twice as fast - in 45 seconds maximum. If a well-coordinated crew is working, then this is all done very, very quickly, explains the -Drone-. Later, being in a safe place, the -reactive women- will learn about the results of their work. The results of the objective control are proved to the gunners by sending a photo or a short video. This can be done by real drones - -quadriks- or -wings-, which record fire damage to enemy targets. Andriy says that he and his brothers are always pleased to learn that they worked exactly on target, inflicting maximum damage on the occupiers. Thus, the -sharp vision- of the drones and the skillful, fast and coordinated actions of the crew allow you to accurately hit the invaders under the most difficult conditions. The gunner says that in the almost three years since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the war has changed several times and requires constant training and improvement from Ukrainian soldiers, because the enemy does not stand still and learns from its own mistakes. — In 2022, the Russian was very defiant, walked in columns, did not prepare enough. Now the enemy is learning no less than we are. Their FPVs are also developing more, and their -wings- are developing, and their artillery also began to work better. They have already learned to fight, says Andriy. However, the biggest problem, he is convinced, is not this, because the Ukrainian military still surpasses the enemy in terms of training and is ahead in innovation. The threat is a change in attitudes in society, which has begun to perceive war as routine and many speak of -war fatigue- and do not want to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — Many civilians for some reason believe that the war is already over for them, that the enemy will settle for some conditions and cease hostilities. However, this will not happen, the war will reach everyone anyway. The military needs to be replenished, we need to be replaced on the front lines with fresh, trained units, those who have been fighting for many months, years should be given a rest, the defender explains. He is convinced that there is no other way for Ukrainians than the nationwide support of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and the personal participation of all citizens in the defense of the country. After all, the gunner claims, he and his comrades are not fighting for politicians, as some claim, but for their own families and their home, which was invaded by the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/kovbojska-duel-na-rszv-yak-dron-na-uragani-vyperedzhaye-okupantiv-na-sekundy/	2024-12-08T20:56:53-08:00
Missiles have reached the micro level: the development of miniature missiles for drones has been com...	As declare the authors of the portal of the Spanish Defense Industry Association TEDAE, this development, carried out by the Pyrenean firm Aertec in cooperation with the General Directorate of Armaments and Materiel (DGAM), is part of the ARPA project aimed at equipping remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) of its own production with high-precision weapons, ArmyInform reports. Aertec worked with DGAM to redesign its Tarsis-W platform, an armed variant of the Tarsis 75 UAV, as part of DGAM's Coincidente program. In this collaboration, Aertec contributed 70% of the funding and DGAM provided the remaining 30%. The contract with DGAM covered design, prototype production, development and a series of successful ground firing tests, including the launch of a fully guided missile with a warhead. These tests, conducted at the San Gregorio test site in Zaragoza and the Las Bardenas test site in Navarre, demonstrated the missile's readiness for the next stage of qualification. In 2025, Aertec plans to conduct up to 100 additional firings in the -ground-to-surface- and -air-to-surface- launch options to assess the missile's viability for integration with the Tarsis-W platform. As inform the experts at the defense portal Army Recognition, the Tarsis 75, Aertec's Class I UAS system, is a light tactical unmanned aerial vehicle an aerial system (UAS) designed for reconnaissance, surveillance and integration with its light weapons. The UAV has a maximum take-off weight of 75 kg, can carry up to 12 kg of payload and has a maximum flight time of 12 hours. The drone has a wingspan of 5.2 meters, a length of 3.8 meters and can operate from different runways and locations. It has integrated catapult launch options, emergency parachute landing and a back-up satellite communication system. The UAV operates autonomously for the full flight plan, including take-off and landing, while maintaining the ability to manually operate if required. It can reach a height of up to 5,000 m. meters and has an operational range of 70 to 150 kilometers, making it suitable for the deployment of the Fox I micro-missile. The Fox I micro-missile, also known as μASM A-Fox, is designed specifically for use with small RPAS and has intermediate inertial navigation together with a semi-active laser guidance terminal. It has a length of 900 mm, a weight of 3 kg and a range of up to 4 kilometers, capable of hitting a variety of mobile targets and objects equipped with counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) sensors. Aertec's Fox I relies on an in-house developed high-performance homing kit and a laser homing gun for precision targeting. The warhead of the missile and the rocket engine were developed in cooperation with the Spanish defense equipment manufacturer Instalaza. The warhead, adapted from the C90 Instalaza munition and equipped with a specially designed fuze, is intended for use against designated targets. The rocket motor is designed to fit the compact scale of the warhead while maintaining stability in flight. INTA's Ground Systems Directorate supported the project with testing resources and engineering assistance. In addition, the modular design of the Fox I micro-rocket allows it to be integrated into various flight platforms with minimal software modifications. Optimized for Class I UAVs such as the Tarsis 75, the missile's size and flexibility make it suitable for a number of light aircraft platforms that incorporate precision attack capabilities. The potential of micromissiles such as Aertec's Fox I for drone applications is to equip small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with efficient, lightweight and adaptable precision strike capabilities. These micro-missiles allow you to hit lightly armored targets with minimal side effects. Their modularity and small size allow it to be integrated with different types of drones, maintaining flexibility between missions. In addition, their adaptability allows drones to provide close air support to their own units and conduct combat operations beyond line of sight using onboard sensors and targeting systems, facilitating operations in high-risk environments. This capability provides cost-effectiveness by reducing the need for larger drones or conventional munitions for specific tactical scenarios, from counter-UAV to direct fire support.

The Russians invented a fake about the instructions on how to meet the fallen defenders from the fro...	For example, Kremenchug schoolchildren are given instructions on how to properly kneel when meeting fallen defenders from the front. The corresponding poses are shown on the postcards. A reverse image search leads to similar pictures on several photo stocks (photo sales sites). It is signed in English, literally -a set of soccer players kneeling to protest racism and police brutality for Black Lives Matter.- The original drawing illustrates how football players and athletes protest by kneeling and raising their hands up. This gesture became global after the killing of African-American George Floyd in May 2020 in the United States, which caused a wave of protests around the world. And it was first used by American football player Colin Kaepernick, when in 2016 he knelt with his hand raised during the playing of the US national anthem before National Football League (NFL) games. The gesture signified disagreement with racial inequality and police violence. It is interesting that a fragment of the poem -On the Shield- by Oksana Lesyk-Paduchak is printed on the fake instructions. It is likely that Russian propagandists used it to create the illusion of greater resemblance to the truth. And also to show the -Nazi image of Ukrainians-, since the poem uses a trigger word for Russians - -Banderivskyi-. In addition, the -news- does not contain any specifics - where did it become known, in which school it was noticed, comments of eyewitnesses. Taken together, all this indicates that this is a Russian fake. In fact, in many cultures, people kneel: to pray, ask for forgiveness, or honor the memory of the dead. In Ukraine, fallen soldiers are commemorated by getting down on one knee. It is a gesture of respect, completely voluntary. But Russian propaganda gives it a negative connotation. After all, in their understanding, kneeling symbolizes submission to the ruler. They still often kneel down when addressing their Kremlin dictator. The fake was created in order to cause negative emotions towards the Ukrainian authorities, to undermine trust in education and to impose certain stereotypes that are not characteristic of Ukrainians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/rosiyany-vygadaly-fejk-pro-instrukcziyu-yak-zustrichaty-zagyblyh-zahysnykiv-iz-frontu/	2024-12-08T20:04:31-08:00

-I saw a shot from an RPG-7 fly in front of my eyes and hit a barrel with fuel- — the story of a fig...	His story published byState Border Service. Yuriy is from Luhansk and since childhood dreamed of becoming a soldier. After graduating from college, he joined the State Border Service. -On June 2, 2014, we were raised by another alarm. They thought it was a training course, but they saw a red rocket signal. At the same moment, bullets flew from all sides. They hid on the territory of the car park, behind the cars, then ran to the inspection pit for vehicles, in which some mobilized man was already wounded in the leg,- the man recalled. According to him, there were few bullets, but they fired intermittently from a hole in the forest strip, in which the enemy's shots flared. -I looked out - I saw how a shot from an RPG-7 flew in front of my eyes and hit a barrel with fuel. It was like a slow motion movie! The fire was very intense. We had to move to the nearest building. They began to cover us with mortars, and we could not understand where the fire was coming from in order to respond with underbarrel grenade launchers,- said -Artist-. He remembered the movie -Saving Private Ryan-, in which Tom Hanks searched for enemy positions with the help of a mirror. I found a mirror in one of the offices, crawled to the window, saw a flash behind the greenhouses along the track. -Oh, and we showered them with gifts! But I was also -burned-. He was wounded in the stomach by a direct hit from a cumulative shot. In an hour and a half, I was evacuated to the Luhansk hospital, then on a helicopter to Kyiv,- Yuriy said. He underwent rehabilitation in Israel, at the Hadassah medical center in Jerusalem. Within two weeks, he started visiting the day hospital on his own. It was necessary to drive almost through the entire city. -The most difficult thing was to accept that I would no longer be able to run like before, one hundred percent. I returned to the army, because the uniform suits me! But, seriously, since 2018, we have been fighting for the right to military service for persons with disabilities who received it during the defense of the homeland,- explained the -Artist-. In 2021, the law was passed and it was reinstated. As an officer of the special projects department, he currently draws various illustrations, situations and comics for the social networks of the State Border Service. The man has the Order -For Courage- of the III degree and the award of the President of Ukraine -For participation in the anti-terrorist operation-.

There is currently no threat surrounding Toretsk: the Defense Forces spoke about the fighting in the...	About this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the deputy chief of staff - the head of the planning group of the staff told the audience Mykhailo Stoykevich of the 49th separate assault battalion -Karpatska Sich-. Despite the tactics of fighting in urban areas, according to the officer, the enemy periodically resorts to the use of artillery damage and the use of anti-aircraft guns. Thus, he exposes his own soldiers to danger. -And they never counted their soldiers. And for those groups that seep into the city, such trips are almost always a one-way trip. Moreover, we do not even record the attempts of the Russians to evacuate their wounded,- the Ukrainian military officer emphasized. In turn, our units are actively using unmanned systems to fight enemy groups. -The invaders are trying enter the city in small groups and occupy some buildings. We track them and attack with FPV drones after dark, thereby hiding the occupiers under the ruins of buildings,- said Mykhailo Stoykevich. The officer noted that our units have an advantage in night attacks thanks to more modern bomber drones , equipped with the appropriate dark-adapted surveillance systems, and the enemy is actively developing a fleet of fiber-optic UAVs. -Such drones on wires are very difficult to suppress with electronic warfare. It is almost impossible to neutralize them until they are damaged,- Stoykevich assured. However, under the current weather conditions, the use of drones is becoming more and more problematic. According to the deputy chief of staff of -Karpatska Sich-, drones -don't like- rain and frostbite. However, the enemy also has such problems. The officer of the Armed Forces informed that the enemy made several attempts to bypass the city of Toretsk in order to surround it. However, all such forays of the Russians ended in failure: their groups were defeated in small villages located near this settlement. And at the moment there is no extraordinary threat to the surroundings of the city. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy concentrated his offensive efforts in the districts Toretska, Dilyivka, Leonidivka and Shcherbinivka, where seven clashes took place, currently three more clashes are taking place.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/zagrozy-otochennya-toreczka-narazi-nemaye-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-boyi-u-misti-na-donechchyni/	2024-12-08T08:28:33-08:00

According to him, numerous cases of illegal arrests and sentences are recorded. In particular, in Energodar, an employee of the Zaporizhzhya NPP was convicted on trumped-up charges of attempted sabotage. Torture and imprisonment have become common methods of intimidation. Residents of the occupied territories are also forcibly mobilized and sent to the front. -Many are forced to participate in a war against their own state. Despite this, some find an opportunity to surrender to the Ukrainian military,- said Ivan Fedorov. He emphasized that anyone forcibly mobilized can use the state program -I want to live- and surrender to captivity. This guarantees safety and saves lives. As reported by ArmyInform, during the day the occupiers made 269 strikes on 11 populated areas of the Zaporizhzhia region, as a result of which a 65-year-old man died in Vasylivskyi district.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/nezakonni-areshty-j-prymusova-mobilizacziya-shho-vidomo-pro-sytuacziyu-na-okupovanyh-terytoriyah-zaporizhzhya/	2024-12-08T07:47:11-08:00
They are not worth the price - the enemy still has enough reserves for attacks on Chasiv Yar	About it in TV Andrii Polukhin, press officer of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told Suspilny. -The situation remains difficult, the enemy is trying to storm the positions of our defenders, is making attempts to bypass them and is using small infantry groups as a sort of DRG, which are trying to impose a battle in the rear behind the backs of our defenders,- noted Andriy Polukhin, analyzing the events last week According to him, the enemy is actively shelling the territory of the city from various fire systems, as well as inflicting damage with aerial bombs. At the same time, according to the military, the Russians have not recorded the arrival of new units. -The reserves that they accumulated earlier are still enough for offensive activity. At this time, there are no special changes in the tactics of the Russians. Not particularly affected by their maneuvers and weather conditions, since this is an urban lane. In many places there is asphalt, there are still places where you can drive without problems on any vehicle, despite the weather,- stated Andriy Polukhin. According to Polukhin, at the moment, the biggest problem for the occupiers is not the weather, but the successful work of Ukrainian drone fighters: the -Rarog- battalion, as well as units of unmanned systems in the battalions of the brigade. Among the problems faced by the soldiers of this military unit is the presence in the city of civilian residents who, for reasons known only to them, bypassed the evacuation and remain in Chasovoy Yar. Andriy Polukhin pointed to the fact that Russian saboteurs quite often use civilian clothes to disguise their intentions, and therefore the movement of a group of citizens who are not invaders through the streets complicates the combat work of Ukrainian soldiers -At this moment, indeed, local residents still remain there . Somehow they don't have a drastic effect, but the understanding that they can be in certain places where combat operations need to be carried out somewhat constrains the movements of our troops,- Andriy Polukhin said. As reported by ArmyInform, the drones of the -Rarog- unmanned systems battalion of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo showed footage of the liquidation of the army kombat Russian Federation Yevhen Smirnov, known by the call sign -Yermak-. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/za-czinoyu-ne-stoyat-vorogu-poky-vystachaye-rezerviv-dlya-atak-na-chasiv-yar/	2024-12-08T07:23:18-08:00

The army of the Russian Federation flees from Syria by planes and ships - GUR	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 8. The rapid process of overthrowing the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria was marked by the shameful flight of the Russian contingent from the territory of the Arab republic. In the Syrian capital, Damascus, the dictator's residence, government buildings and the central office of national television are under the control of anti-Assad forces. After losing control of Damascus amid a continued offensive by opposition forces in the provinces of Latakia, Hama and Tartus, the Russian army withdrew its warships from the naval base in Tartus, which Assad had previously lent to Moscow in return for its security. On December 8, the frigate -Admiral Grigorovich- of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation and the cargo ship -Engineer Trubin- of the Northern Fleet of the Russian Federation left Tartus in the Mediterranean Sea. Also, the Russians are transferring the remnants of their weapons and military equipment from Syria by military aircraft from the airbase in Khmeimim. -After the capture of Damascus, the forces opposed to Assad are moving to the coast - Russia's probable loss of military bases in Tartus and Khmeimim will finalize the Kremlin's defeat in the Middle East,- GUR believes. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of the GUR destroyed the enemy -Hurricane- in the Zaporozhye direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/armiya-rf-tikaye-z-syriyi-litakamy-ta-korablyamy-gur/	2024-12-08T06:44:27-08:00

Marines of a sick person - in Kurshchyna, the Russians attack with a brigade of -freaks-	About on the air of the telethon -Edyni Novyni- announced the press officer of the 47th mechanized brigade Anastasia Blyshchyk. According to her information, the main force of the Russians, which conducts the assaults, is the 155th Marine Brigade of the Russian Army. -And this is a really elite unit of the Russian Federation. They are really prepared, they are well equipped, that is, they are not some mobilized people who are simply thrown for meat. It is clear that each of their assaults is planned. That is why they are motivated to fight here, and we are motivated to eliminate them. The brigade of these marines are really -repulsed-, they are finished bastards who document their crimes, how they kill Ukrainian prisoners, torture them. We eliminate them in battle,- emphasized Anastasia Blyshchyk. Using the example of a specific battle, the press officer noted that the units of the brigade were opposed by well-prepared and well-equipped enemies. -In particular, they were dressed in camouflage robes. This is special white clothing, it is spotted to blend in with the snow. They also used armored vehicles, they were also amphibious assault vehicles, and they were also MTLB. They were met by our anti-tankers, who were firing from the Stugna ATGM, and also worked as UAV operators. And a huge thank you in this situation to the engineers who very competently placed the mine barriers,- Anastasiya Blyshchyk emphasized. She noted that before the mentioned combat, in the last 2-3 weeks, the Ukrainian infantrymen had not seen enemy heavy equipment on the battlefield at all. If anything was observed, it was motorcycles, ATVs. -And more Russians used this type of transport for logistics. But just now they became more active. I don't know if they will try to advance with equipment again, or if they will return to infantry assaults, we will see,- Anastasiya Blyshchyk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the unmanned systems battalion of the 47th mechanized brigade daily causes colossal losses to the enemy, supporting our infantry in Kurshchyna. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/morpihy-hvoroyi-lyudyny-na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-atakuyut-brygadoyu-vyrodkiv/	2024-12-08T05:46:13-08:00

They sighed - in Slobozhanshchyna, the combat activity of the enemy has decreased	About it at telemarathon and -The only news- said the spokesman of the operational-tactical group of troops -Kharkiv- lieutenant colonel Yevhenii Romanov. -We are observing a decrease in Russian assaults. Twice they tried to advance in the Vovchansk region, but they failed. In general, we observe that the number of shelling and attacks has really decreased. Over the past 24 hours, the occupiers have carried out two strikes using four guided aerial bombs, Yevgeny Romanov stated. At the same time, according to the speaker, during Saturday, the enemy struck 17 kamikaze drones and carried out 199 attacks on the positions of defenders of Ukraine. -But this is twice less than the statistics for the period of a week and a half before-, Yevhenii Romanov said. He noted that the soldiers of the units of the Defense Forces respond adequately to all actions of the enemy. -Yesterday, the enemy was still without 56 soldiers. Of them, 26 occupiers suffered irreversible losses,- Yevgeny Romanov noted. At the same time, according to Yevgeny Romanov, in recent days in the Kharkiv direction there has been a decrease in the number of attacks by guided aerial bombs (UABs) from the enemy, which may be due to the fact that the enemy has concentrated its resources on other areas of the front or faced limitations in their use -This resource (KAB) is limited for them. Therefore, they are forced to save on flights, and the CABs themselves. Or they don't have the ability to carry out air attacks,'' Evgeny Romanov stated. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv- told about the fighter Serhii with the call sign -Kosii-, who not only managed to save himself, but also destroyed enemies, who brutally executed his fellow prisoners. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/vyzdyhaly-na-slobozhanshhyni-bojova-aktyvnist-voroga-zmenshylasya/	2024-12-08T04:45:22-08:00

Creating Controlled Chaos: In the south, the enemy continues to terrorize the civilian population	About this on the air of the military TV channel said Serhiy Bratchuk, the spokesman of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army -South-. -According to the speakers of the aggressor, they are going to launch an attack on Zaporizhzhia, or the Zaporizhia direction, and then, as it were, shift their forces in order to force the Dnieper and reach the right bank, create a bridgehead and, accordingly, attack the regional center of Kherson. And all this was scaled in the information space with the use of appropriate publics, appropriate introductions. And, of course, that this worries people,- said Serhiy Bratchuk. However, according to him, the situation, from the side of the Ukrainian command, is fully controlled, no matter how difficult it was. Although the enemy's movements are quite intense. -At least the task that faced the Russians for more than a month is an attempt to enter our islands located on the Dnieper. With these islands, in fact, they are trying to achieve an increase in the gray zone and an increase in fire pressure on the right bank, on those communities that are near the Dnipro,- stated Serhiy Bratchuk. He stated that we are talking about terrorism against the civilian population, because the enemy uses UAVs quite actively. -The enemy absolutely does not shy away from using these drones against the civilian population. Every day we receive reports of attacks on individual citizens and groups of civilians. The occupiers are also hunting for representatives of the National Police, rescuers of the State Emergency Service, and medical workers. That is, I would even say that the enemy is trying to vividly demonstrate its terrorism,- Serhii Bratchuk emphasized. According to him, these signals of terrorism are primarily aimed at our partners as well, they say that Russia has power, Russia is not ready and will stop at nothing, even the killing of civilians. -Well, actually, this is an attempt to create a situation of panic, a situation of controlled chaos among peaceful citizens. Moreover, this is one of the elements of the concept of waging a modern war, which is promoted by the Russian Federation, and they quite actively developed and are developing this direction of their strategy of waging war on the basis of Soviet instructions, where no one spared people. Especially when it comes to those territories that Russia wants to invade,- Serhii Bratchuk is convinced. The speaker also pointed out that now in the area of ​​responsibility of the units in the south, the invaders are actively conducting sabotage and reconnaissance activities along the banks of the Dnipro. -If we are talking about islands and assaults on them, the Russians are trying to enter the island and gain a foothold on boats or other watercraft. Very often they fail to do this, but those who fall over try to get a foothold and wait for the next group. Whether there will be a next group is already a question. Especially since the fire control from our right bank is constant,- concluded Serhii Bratchuk. According to his conviction, all this hostile activity in the Dnieper direction, as well as in the Zaporizhia direction, is aimed at distracting our forces. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy dnipro-ta-zaporizhzhya/->frightens with a big attack on the Dnipro and Zaporizhzhya. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/stvorennya-kerovanogo-haosu-na-pivdni-vorog-prodovzhuye-teroryzuvaty-myrne-naselennya/	2024-12-08T03:36:02-08:00
One to five: Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the losses of Ukraine and Russia	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced this on December 8. He said that since the beginning of the full-scale war, Ukraine has lost 43,000 soldiers who died on the battlefield. -370,000 cases of assistance to the wounded, and this is taking into account that in our army, approximately 50 percent of the wounded return to the ranks, and all injuries, including light and repeated ones, are recorded,- the head of state said. According to him, one of the key differences between the Russian army and the Defense Forces of Ukraine is the level of development of front-line medicine, which is much higher in the Ukrainian army. -We in Ukraine are grateful for this to everyone who helps develop medicine in our army and saves our wounded, carries out rehabilitation. Since September of this year, Russia has been losing people on the battlefield in a ratio of 5 and even 6 to 1 in our country. That's how they want to seize more land before the pressure of the world on them can increase to an unbearable level,- the President said. In addition, he urged not to forget about the Ukrainians who are in Russian captivity - there are thousands of people, military and civilians, and some of them have been in captivity since 2014, when the occupation began. As of February 24, 2022, Ukraine managed to return 3,935 Ukrainian people from Russia: 3,767 soldiers and 168 civilians. -We have to get everyone back and it's still a lot of work. And we must establish the truth about all our missing people. Let's not forget about the children deported by Russia from Ukrainian land: the Russians themselves say that there are hundreds of thousands of such stolen children, and Russia scatters them across its territory,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, getting them back is the hardest part. At least several million people remain in the occupied territory of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/odyn-do-pyaty-volodymyr-zelenskyj-oprylyudnyv-vtraty-ukrayiny-ta-rosiyi/	2024-12-08T03:13:21-08:00

The weather is bad, but the enemy is even worse - our pilots have learned to work well in difficult ...	Maksym Bilousov, the head of the communications department of the 60th brigade, told about this in the stream on the military TV channel ArmyTV. -Now there is a slight lull in our area of ​​responsibility precisely from the point of view of the involvement of armored vehicles. The enemy is not using it as actively now as it was a week ago. But he does not stop constant assaults with the participation of infantry,- Maksym Bilousov said. According to him, enemy infantrymen have different degrees of combat training. From time to time there are very worthy opponents. According to Maksym Bilousov, they have an idea about regrouping the unit, about conducting the battle in sectors. But a considerable number of Russian soldiers practically did not undergo any thorough training. -They don't even know where they got to. One of the prisoners said that they were, so to speak, trained at the training ground for just a couple of days, and then they were transferred to the front. And he got to us because they told him: -Take some water and take it to the front.- He took his burden, left and came out ... to us,- Maksym Bilousov said. In the certain absence of enemy armored vehicles on the battlefield in the area of ​​​​responsibility, their operators of unmanned systems organize a hunt for both Russian infantrymen and firing points. In particular, mortar calculations of the invaders. -As a recent example of a successful hunt, there is a video that we posted. Our aerial scouts found a mortar nest of the occupiers. Somehow they didn't hide it very well. And the soldiers from the unit of combat UAVs — FPV drones quickly hit the position of the invaders. Because mortars are still such a thing that can cause a lot of damage. And hitting a mortar is, I think, such a very good and good bonus for us,- Maksym Bilousov emphasized. According to him, the pilots of the kamikaze drones find a way out even in bad weather, fly between the clouds and then work in a very organized manner on the enemy's positions. As reported by ArmyInform, aerial scouts of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade noticed a Russian lying on the ground with a weapon. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/pogoda-pogana-ale-vorogu-shhe-girshe-nashi-piloty-navchylysya-dobre-praczyuvaty-u-skladnyh-meteoumovah/	2024-12-08T01:46:59-08:00
- I remember the sparks that flew from their bulletproof vests - Serhiy killed the Russians who shot...	The story was made public on December 8 by the operational-tactical group -Kharkiv-. Serhiy comes from Chernihiv Oblast. During the war, he went through all the circles of infantry hell. He was hunted by mortars and drones, poisoned with gas and tried to kill at close range during assaults. He survived where there seemed to be no hope left. Otherwise, Serhii does not call it a miracle of God. -This happened during the defense of a small, completely destroyed Donetsk village. There were very fierce battles, for three days we were -covered- with everything possible. We are tired, wounded, hiding in the basement among the ruins from shelling and drops. We were left without a portable REB. We sit and wait for the boys from neighboring positions to bring. Suddenly we hear someone approaching the basement. They asked for the password, but they are Muscovites! Experienced, careful - they do not go to us, they only throw grenades and shout: -Surrender!-. I have a wound in my leg, my Achilles tendon is torn, I'm bleeding a little. The boys are contused and injured. They decide to leave, and I stay until the last. I hide in mattresses, rags that lie on the floor. Suddenly I hear automatic rounds: the guys who came out to surrender are being shot. The Russians begin to descend to the basement. Two. One says: -There were more of them!-, the other denies: -No, we killed them all!- Two things saved me: firstly, it was dark in the basement, secondly, they didn't shoot the space before the event,- recalls Serhiy. The invaders acted quickly, in a businesslike manner: they began to barricade the entrance in case of our drones. -Weapons were put away for convenience, and one of them threw a machine gun almost into my hand - I even felt the heat from the receiver. Then he acted on reflexes: he grabbed the -Kalashnikov-, checked. The Muscovites were trained: after shooting, they changed the magazine to a full one, a charge in the chamber. He emptied the machine gun at the enemies in turns. I remembered the sparks that flew from their bulletproof vests... He automatically changed the empty magazine to his full one and somehow crawled out into the yard. It turned out that one of the boys who were shot by Muscovites was alive: the bullet hit his face, there was a lot of blood, so they decided that he was dead. The two crawled to the shelter, called for help. We had to wait more than four hours. All this time we pretended to be dead, because enemy drones were circling above us. His brothers were the first to be evacuated, it was easier with him - he could go by himself. They came after me a little later. At first they dragged me, then they carried me, finally they picked up a bicycle in the village and rolled me on it. Thank God, it was delivered. Then - the hospital, numerous operations, rehabilitation. I recently returned to my unit, but I no longer fit in the attack aircraft: you can't run without an Achilles tendon. Scandibai slowly, but I plan to continue to serve, to do something useful, to pass on experience. It's a pity - now I can't drive a car&#8230; In general, I was very lucky then. What is the moral of all this? Guys, never trust the Russians, don't surrender, they will definitely shoot you. It is necessary to fight to the last, this is the only chance to survive. Don't allow yourself to be killed, it's better to kill the enemy first,- Serhii advises. ArmyInform told the story of a fighter with the call sign -Bridge-, who bijczya-na-psevdo-most/->was completely surrounded, but destroyed the enemy group.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/pamyatayu-iskry-yaki-letily-vid-yihnih-bronezhyletiv-sergij-vbyv-rosiyan-yaki-rozstrilyaly-jogo-pobratymiv/	2024-12-08T01:27:35-08:00

-Bats- in the service of the Coast Guard: American law enforcement officials are betting on the late...	According to distributed information by the United States Coast Guard Command, V-BAT drones (one of the variants of the translation into Ukrainian - -Bat- - author) are able to take off vertically and do not need airstrips, which makes them less vulnerable to detection and enemy attacks, ArmiyaInform reports. With a flight range of up to 370 km and the ability to stay in the air for a long time - up to 11 hours - they give law enforcement an important advantage in the form of reconnaissance, long-term surveillance and reconnaissance. In particular, units of the US Coast Guard will use patrol ships already available in this structure to launch drones. In particular, on the National Security Cutter or Legend class vessels. After all, V-BAT is able to take off vertically and land on a field of only 4x4 meters. The drone weighs 56.5 kg and can carry up to 11 kg of payload. Equipped with a powerful optical-electronic system with a thermal imaging sensor and artificial intelligence, V-BAT ensures effective detection and recognition of targets. The duration of the drone's flight is up to 10 hours. The fuselage of the V-BAT measures 9 feet (2.74 meters) with a wingspan of 9.7 feet (2.95 meters). The system works with Hivemind's own Shield AI technology, which allows it to fly autonomously in the harsh conditions of the activity of enemy air defense assets without GPS or communication. This software supports control of four V-BATs and a software application is currently being developed to increase the number of drones for use in swarms. The UAV is powered by a 24-horsepower twin-cylinder engine that provides a top speed of 56 miles (90 kilometers) per hour and an altitude of up to 20,000 feet (6,100 meters). The UAV can be transported in a pickup truck and assembled by two employees in less than 20 minutes, making it a true expeditionary system designed for dynamic movement and fluid mission sets. So far, Shield AI produces about 120 machines a year, each of which costs about $1 million (although the price will be lower when buying in bulk). As for the future of the unmanned system, according to Brandon Tseng, president of the Shield AI startup, the next stage of development is the integration of missiles into the V-BAT. -We put into production a Northrop Grumman missile called Hatchet, which is a laser-guided munition that will be released at the end next year,- Tseng reported. At the same time, V-BAT is one of the contenders for participation in the Pentagon's FTUAS project, which should replace drones. 7_Shadow->Textron RQ-7 Shadow. The final decision on this program is expected in 2025, and the introduction of the drone into the troops in 2026. V-BAT Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) presentation.

-Nona- in action: how to hit with the first shot. The story of the gun commander from the legendary ...	He is currently a gun commander in the 25th Separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. How to hit a moving tank with a 2C9 gun? But is it possible to destroy an enemy assault group with the first shot? Yuriy told our correspondent: -I have been at war since the first days of the large-scale invasion. He came to the TCC, was assigned to the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. Our calculation is fighting on a 2C9 gun, it is a 120 caliber. I started as a gunner, now I am a gun commander. As an interesting fact, I can tell about one case. Somehow art reconnaissance could not work with us due to bad weather conditions. And our infantry on the front edge saw the gap we gave on the objective. They gave us the coordinates of this gap. We adjusted accordingly and hit the target. It was an enemy assault group. There was another case. We started working. We received a reply. We quickly rolled over and found our way from a new place almost without preparation and achieved the goal we started working on from the previous place with the first shot. And it was also an enemy assault group. We have 120 calibers, which, as a rule, we work with on the front edge. Rarely do we technically shoot. Recently, we have been working with mines at short distances, 4-5 kilometers. Why mines, because the 2С9 is a self-propelled mortar gun. Can work both as a mortar and as a cannon. Simply put, this is a rifled mortar. Well, 2C9 is a self-propelled, tracked. She is better known by the name -Nona-. It was still made on the basis of BMD. Can -swim-, by the way. I really like this gun. Shoots well. Although the barrel is not very long. I still remember the incident. This is August 2022, Bakhmut direction. First morning, our next objective is an enemy stronghold. Once an enemy BMP drove up to him. And we hit her with the second shot. The next morning we are again given the same objective. And another BMP arrives at the same place. And we impress her again!.. This is really memorable. We were sent a photo report later. That cheered us up. Then, during the Lyman offensive, things got interesting in October 2022. It is in the area where the reservoir cascades along the Zherebets River. The enemy was on the left bank in Terny. And we hunted a tank there. And of course he was moving. And somewhere from the tenth shot we got him. We didn't see it, we were just given the coordinates: -plus 10 meters-, -to the left 0.01-. And in a couple of minutes we were informed that it had caught fire. It was not destroyed, but it was disabled. At some point, we even wanted to drop this tank without shooting at it. But with the last shot they did hit. In order for your calculation to work well, it must be prepared. When there is free time, for example, with a gunner to -pull up- certain moments that you noted during combat work. It is also very important to analyze the results of shooting. And, of course, the consistency of the calculation is important. Everyone should be like one family. So that there are no quarrels in the team. Because sometimes for two weeks we sit together in our cannon, in a closed space. Therefore, it is important that there is psychological compatibility. It is also necessary for the gun commander to always have a leadership position. Because there are various stressful situations at the front, when your subordinates can get confused and at this moment they just need to be told what they should do. The support of the commander in such episodes is very important.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/nona-v-diyi-yak-vluchyty-z-pershogo-postrilu-istoriya-komandyra-garmaty-z-legendarnoyi-25-ky/	2024-12-07T20:48:02-08:00

The Ukrainian military man - Sei- played one of the main roles in the world-famous game S.T.A.L.K.E....	The game has become a true quintessence of Ukrainian meanings and context. At least take into account the fact that in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl used 420 (!) Ukrainian songs of the main and secondary characters of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was embodied by Ukrainian theater, film and dubbing actors, and, in particular, those who joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. One of them is Oleksandr Laptiy with the call sign -Sey-. A theater and film actor, since 2023 a serviceman of the 1st Special Forces Battalion of the 12th Azov Special Forces Brigade. The soldier of the National Guard became the prototype of one of the main characters - Scar. During an interview, ArmyInform asked a serviceman about how he joined the team of game creators, how fellow gamers reacted when they learned that a colleague had joined the creation of a cult product; about personal permission for filming from Brigadier General Denys Prokopenko, about how S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 sharpens the perception of the Ukrainian context in the world community, as well as how he joined the ranks of the Defense Forces, using his official position (although he had armor from mobilization). - Please tell us how this story started: that you became the prototype of one of the main characters of the Stalker game. - This story began in November 2021. Before the full-scale invasion, I was a professional actor, drama theater director, and Ukrainian cinematographer. And one day I got a message on messenger from a casting director working on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. And then she says that she wants to invite me to the casting, I still didn't know what character it was about. At first I thought it was a prank. Because S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - my favorite game that I played ten years ago and I was waiting for the second part! And here is the message! I actually thought it was a joke. But: why not try? I went to the central office of GSC Company group, met the casting director, the person who wrote the scripts, and they gave me a text with the words: -Let's try.- And I saw that my prototype was Scar. And it is an iconic character for all gamers who play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Everyone who played the first part of the game -Clear Sky- knows that it ends with intrigue, and it is not clear whether Scar died. The global gaming community wanted to know if Scar survived. And then they give me texts. And I find out that Scar survived - but I'm signing hundreds of non-disclosure documents at the same time, and I'm not even allowed to say that I'm somehow involved with S.T.A.L.K.E.R., not to tell some storylines(laughs - ed.). Then I realized that everything is serious, me they said that I was suitable for them and that I should expect a call to the filming site. But first, as is appropriate in computer games, a 3D model is made. This is quite an interesting process: you enter a room that is simply hung with cameras, cameras, more than three hundred of them. You sit down, you are photographed from different angles, you act out several emotions, which will then directly become the prototypes of Scar's emotions. Then, in February, the shooting process began. I had quite a few shooting days, but after several shoots that took place on the 19th of February, the next one was supposed to be in the 20th of February. But everything ended. And even later, when I joined the ranks of Azov, I received a message that the work continued and that the developers would like me to voice my character. I'm like, wow! But now everything depended on the command. - Was the command consulted before this, or was it in favor? Do you mind? Were there agreements? — There was no command against. Of course, there was a lot of agreement. I immediately came to the combatant and said: -I have such a request for you, friend combatant, it is unusual. I need KZV (short-term release of a serviceman), but not for family reasons.- I told this story and that I needed to be in Kyiv for a few days, for the first session. The combatant replied that it should probably be decided by the brigade commander. He was just going to see him on business, and he promised to ask about me. An hour later, he returned with the answer: -Radish has gone haywire. Pack your things in the evening - fly to Kyiv in the morning.- - Was it for you an image and a thrill that you became a part of this legendary game, because you said that you were already familiar with this game? - Of course I played. In the process of preparing for filming, I went through the first part again to remind myself of the plot. Scar has changed during this time, as the story has been 10 years in the past and he has survived several radioactive releases. In the second part, Scar became a rather impulsive and expressive character, although in the first part he was mostly silent. Yes, it was valuable for me to participate in the creation of this game. First of all, when you read the script, you have incredible emotions. After all, I knew the answer to the question of whether the Scar was alive or not, but I could not say about it. This is a secret that I kept until the release (laughs - ed.). - Do people in your unit play this game, acquaintances, friends? When they find out that you were involved in the creation of a new -Stalker- - how do they react? It's very emotional, because some people don't like the Internet, others like a laptop. Yes, there are fans of the game in the unit. When they found out that I was involved in the creation process, they constantly asked when the keys would be available, they said: -There is a promotional version, give me the keys- (laughs - editor). I asked them to wait a little, because then they won't be interested if I spoil something, the intrigue will disappear, and this is the whole excitement for a gamer: to keep tension while playing the game. This is very cool! - When did you first admit to your brothers? - I didn't say that I was playing Scar, but our brigade media service made a clip where they said that an Azov was involved in this game. And everyone's like, -Oops!- (laughs - ed.). There were a lot of questions. But I asked to wait for the release. —The first part of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. many associated it with the Russian Federation, thought it was Russian. Now there is a clear realization that this is a Ukrainian product. In your opinion, is Ukrainianness advancing in the world because of this game? — Yes, I heard such an opinion that, they say, the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was kind of pro-Russian, but this is not a completely correct statement, in my opinion. Because the basis of the game is the real events of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Then there was the Soviet Union, and for some reason Russia took and appropriated the history of the USSR, although it is the history of specific republics. Therefore, this was another attempt by the Russians to appropriate and steal our history. Of course, the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was Russian-speaking at that time, because the Russian market is much larger. But I think it was purely a marketing ploy to attract a larger audience of gamers. This should be taken into account. But I will not say that the game was -pro-Russian-. This is just a fictional world that is built on the history of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. And to think that the Russian Federation is a descendant of this history is not correct. And now that all-out war has broken out thanks to the Headmasters, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. became a purposeful promotion of Ukrainian content not only throughout Europe, but also throughout the world. Russia was completely forgotten, and it's great, it was simply taken and cut off. I watched the streams of foreign bloggers (Americans, Germans, French, Koreans), and they all advise not English dubbing, but rather Ukrainian, because it is more emotional and closer. When I was working on the voice over, I was of course shown the English material. And I heard the voice of the person who voices my character in the English version. And for him the word -Pripyat- is just a word, he does not know what it is. I am from Chernihiv. I remember this disaster. I know what Pripyat is, the exclusion zone, the red forest&#8230; For me, these are close words, and this is the Ukrainian context. More than once I have heard that even those people who do not understand the Ukrainian language are advised to turn on Ukrainian dubbing with subtitles. And the music is powerful, this is also a big plus. - Games are a whole culture, a separate universe. Do you have the feeling that you will Ukrainianize this direction? What are you doing with information on Ukraine at a time when a large-scale and informational confrontation is going on?... — Yes, definitely. The war is hybrid, and an important application of this, shall we say, soft influence on the Western world. This is how we advance our narratives, our war, that we are in now. We introduce the Western world to our culture so that they see that it is fundamentally different from Russian culture and art. — Tell us about yourself: when did you join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine? Why -Azov- in particular? — This, by the way, is the first question that is voiced at an interview. When you walk into a recruiting center and the person representing Azov asks: -Why Azov?- I thought I should give some kind of non-standard answer, according to my civilian profession. And I answered as follows: -Azov- is a subdivision that organically combined one of the principles of ancient philosophy: kalokagatia. This is a combination of physical qualities and moral and ethical ones. They looked at me carefully and answered: -It's not that simple, but we're not on the way to it.- But I am sure that Azov is the realization of the principle of kalokagatia. Just look at the commanders: Redis's friend, Kalina's friend, Gandalf's friend. These are people with an incredible education, with an intellectual base, they are constantly developing. This is the real Ukrainian elite that builds the idea of ​​the Ukrainian nation. They asked me how old I am. I answered that it was 49. They said that they take it up to 45. I answered that at the age of 49 I passed BZVP and did not ring the bell. It was in June 2023. Although the 20-year-olds were knocking. But I'm hardened by the 90s, I'm going strong-willed until the end (laughs - ed.). - And until June 2023, what were you doing? - When in February 2022 year, the enemy was in Chernigov district, I immediately took my family out and stayed in the city. They worked on improving the defense capability. Then, when the enemy left, I received an offer to become an adviser on issues of culture, arts, tourism, and religion to the head of OVA Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych Chaus. A bunch of tasks were cut there, they had to be done. But at the same time, when the information campaign on the creation of offensive brigades began, I began to think that I should somehow be involved in this process. I applied to several divisions, but I received feedback only from Azov. Then I went to the governor and said: -In 3 days I will be called to the basic course.- He was a little stunned, but generally supported my decision. That's how I joined Azov. — What is the most vivid memory of your service in -Azov-? When was it dangerous, when was it scary, and when was it fun? War is a point of contact where everything mixes: tragedy, comedy, life, death, dark humor, tears, disappointment, elation. It's always scary when it flies. When KABU rustles and you don't know where exactly it will fly. One of the bright moments happened to us in the area of ​​concentration, we were then standing in the direction of Serebryan Forestry near Liman. Three rockets arrived, 150 meters from us. There was a big fire, urgent evacuation of property. And we had several kittens (now in the war, they are born in packs). And here's my brother standing with two kittens in this chaos, during the re-detonation, when everything explodes&#8230; He stands holding them both under his arms, and they just hang like two -sausages- and do not understand what is happening. I then thought that if boys in such a dangerous situation are still thinking about kittens, then they are cool boys. We then evacuated the kittens too. All are alive, only the boys had severe contusions, and the property burned down. —Many people do not join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine due to a number of fears about mobilization. Did you have any fears and how did you deal with them? What would you advise civilians who have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine - as a person who also left their comfort zone at one time? , I used my official position(slyly smiles - ed.). I just had armor from mobilization. But I called the head of the TCC, introduced myself as an adviser to the head of the OVA and described the situation that I had to be in the unit in two days. I was accompanied by a person and everything worked out. This is how I once used my official position. And about fears&#8230; They arise from the fact that many people do not know how it is organized: how the army is organized directly in the conditions of war. For some reason, people think that if you get into the army, you will definitely go to the trenches. But now everything is arranged in such a way that a person is given the opportunity to choose a specialty and a position according to the skills of civilian life. If you are, for example, an electrician or an auto mechanic, you will be taken with your hands in any department, because the equipment is like consumables, it constantly needs to be repaired, and there are not enough people to fix this process 24/7. The army needs people. And the fear of the army comes from ignorance. Communication is a very important issue, and a very difficult one. Information removes any fears. Yes, war is scary, of course. But don't be afraid only of fools. - What for you will be a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war? - A difficult question. This is a very difficult question&#8230; I think the big break will be a win for me. There is a great silence inside me. And, probably, there will be men's tears&#8230; Because at first you keep this list of guys (dead brothers - ed.), and then you understand when there are more than 40 of them&#8230; Therefore there will be silence inside me. And thanks to those who gave the most. And you will remember everyone by their call sign&#8230; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/ukrayinskyj-vijskovyj-sej-zigrav-odnu-z-golovnyh-rolej-u-vidomij-na-uves-svit-gri-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-intervyu/	2024-12-07T20:03:08-08:00

Eggs for less than 17 hryvnias, women's uniforms and inclusive dry rations: the state operator of th...	The state rear operator managed to save 17 billion hryvnias for the year, said the General Director of the agency Arsen Zhumadilov. According to him, the need for the total cost of 92 billion hryvnias was proved to them. It was closed with almost 700 contracts worth 75 billion hryvnias. The saved 17 billion was redirected to cover additional needs. -We bought almost 163,000 body armor. This would be enough to fully supply the armies of Hungary, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Sweden combined,- &#8211; noted Arsen Zhumadilov. The Director General of DOT also recalled that this year clothing and protection for female military personnel were purchased, inclusive dry rations were developed (halal, kosher and plant-based rations) and the DOT chain system was implemented, which reduced the duration of movement of documents in food for the Armed Forces by 4 times. There were also certain problems. For example, scandals involving the supply of low-quality stew and a batch of meat in which a needle from a syringe was found. According to Arsen Zhumadilov, the agency reacted to these cases and implemented additional measures to control suppliers so that such problems do not occur again. At the beginning of next year, the State rear operator plans to introduce its own NPS tool &#8211; collect and analyze feedback from suppliers, brigades, individual units and military personnel. Currently, DOT supplies food, clothing, fuel and lubricants, and IT technologies for the needs of the Armed Forces.

- We are constantly working to ensure that the lands along the state border, in accordance with the ...	He stated this during the telethon -Edyny Novyni-. Along the length of the border, this shade can be from 30 to 50 meters. And if we talk about the border with Belarus and Russia, this section can be wider - up to two kilometers, but it is not necessary that all this land is transferred to the property of the military units of the DPSU. It is necessary to understand that the lands can be state property, communal, private, and there are also lands along the border belonging to the nature reserve fund. And if we talk about the last category, then they can be of state or local importance. And it is precisely in order to transfer the lands of state reserves to military units that there should be a Presidential Decree. Therefore, the relevant Decree of December 5 reduces the land of the Chernobyl reserve and the land with a width of 45 meters along the state border is transferred to the ownership of the military units of the DPSU for the arrangement and maintenance of engineering and fortification facilities. This will allow us to continue increasing the engineering arrangement of the border, maintenance of crossings, border signs, equipping technical systems of terrain control, video surveillance systems. So that we have proper arrangements on the state border in a direction that is threatening to us. We continue to strengthen the border with Belarus along its entire length, because this is a threatening direction for us as long as Belarus remains under the influence of Russia. We must have strong defensive positions there to repel any attack should the situation change. At the moment, Russia does not have a sufficient number of units, forces and means on the territory of Belarus that could pose a threat to us. We remind you, situation in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Khortytsya- military defense unit, it remains tense, but controlled by the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/my-vedemo-postijno-robotu-shhob-zemli-vzdovzh-derzhavnogo-kordonu-vidpovidno-do-zemelnogo-kodeksu-buly-peredani-do-vijskovyh-chastyn-dpsu-andrij-demchenko/	2024-12-07T08:12:57-08:00
the kremlin drags on the war with a cheap mortgage	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Despite huge budget payments to ordinary Russians for those who volunteer to sign a contract to participate in the war, the Kremlin faces a steady decline in the number of people willing to fight. Instead, high losses require a constant supply of manpower. Under such circumstances, the Russian authorities invent new and new forms of encouragement that would force the residents of the Russian Federation to go and kill Ukrainians. Subsidized mortgages are another attempt to solve the issue of reducing army recruitment. Currently, the mortgage rate without benefits reaches 35% in the Russian Federation. There is also a so-called preferential -family mortgage-, where the rate is about 6%, but this program is constantly underfunded from the budget. Because of this, the first installment on a preferential mortgage has already been raised to 50%, which makes it unaffordable for most Russians. We remind you that EU countries on the eve of Donald's inauguration Trump's initiative to create a fund for joint defense projects and arms purchases is being discussed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/kreml-zatyaguye-na-vijnu-deshevoyu-ipotekoyu/	2024-12-07T07:53:13-08:00
The situation in the area of ​​responsibility of the OSUV - Khortytsia - remains tense, but controll...	This was stated by Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the -Khortytsia- OSU. -Of course, the situation is changing dynamically, and in our area of ​​responsibility, 150 clashes with the enemy took place per day. The enemy attacked the Pokrovsky, Kurakhivskyi and Vremiivskyi directions the most. There were 48 enemy assaults in the Pokrovsky direction, 35 in the Kurakhivskyi direction, and 21 in the Vremiivskyi direction. Also, during the past day, the enemy in our area of ​​responsibility carried out 5 airstrikes, dropped 8 guided and aerial bombs, carried out more than 3,200 attacks on populated areas with various types of weapons and 250 strikes with kamikaze drones,- he emphasized. Already this day, 11 enemy assaults took place, which carried out more than 300 attacks on positions and populated areas using various types of weapons. The enemy is trying to carry out active offensive actions, but the Defense Forces restrain the offensive, inflicting considerable losses on him both in manpower and in equipment. The Kurakhiv direction is important for the enemy to align the front line. This will allow him to regroup, withdraw some units for recovery, and then, having accumulated resources, conduct further offensive actions. The Vremiiv direction in the northwest of the Donetsk region is also a priority for the enemy, because it is one of the elements of the Kurakhiv-Pokrovsky offensive. The day before yesterday, the enemy was more active there, there were 37 enemy assaults. However, the Defense Forces, having recaptured the settlement of Novy Komar, improved their tactical position. In the Pokrovsky direction, the formations of two Russian combined armies are concentrated against us. These are the 2nd and 41st armies of the -Center- troop group. In the Kramatorsk direction, near Chasovoy Yar, the 98th Airborne Division, which was twice defeated by our defenders, and which was repeatedly replenished with personnel, is standing against us. In the Pokrovsky direction, one of our brigades restrains the assaults of four motorized rifle brigades of the Russian army at once, one of which is the 74th motorized rifle brigade. The enemy is trying to move its personnel and equipment between directions in the east of Ukraine. In particular, in the Pokrovsky, Kurakhivskyi, Vremiivskyi and Toretsk directions. Where he suffers a significant defeat, he tries to compensate for the lost forces and resources from other directions. We remind you that Oleksandr Syrsky released the video, on which our drones destroy enemy equipment and infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/sytuacziya-v-zoni-vidpovidalnosti-osuv-hortyczya-zalyshayetsya-napruzhenoyu-vtim-kontrolovanoyu-sylamy-oborony/	2024-12-07T07:31:33-08:00

Prosecutors proved that during the occupation of Shevchenkive village of Kupyan district, the former policeman voluntarily went over to the side of the enemy.

Collaborators at the maintenance of Luhansk region prepare children for -their-	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. The main condition for victory was the ability to control drones. According to the -educators-, it was the control of the drones, as well as the best results in the dress and song competition, that showed that the children were continuing the age-old Cossack traditions. -After all, such talents demonstrate the readiness of young men and women to join the ranks of the Kremlin army at any moment,- the organizers said. The students of the fake Luhansk Cossack Cadet Corps won. Distorting the historical truth, brainwashing is the Kremlin's tradition, which criminally takes root in all territories where the occupiers set foot. The topic of Cossacks is particularly distorted for propagandists. And it is mostly used in schools. Cossacks in Ukrainian schools in the temporarily occupied territories have already become teachers. For example, in the Kherson region, these representatives of the occupation forces conduct lessons on so-called political information. Children are told about how Russian peace is being implemented on Ukrainian lands destroyed by them, films are shown about the beauty of the Russian Federation and how important it is to become a part of Russia. We remind you that the occupiers use the labor of people with disabilities to -own- needs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/kolaboranty-na-to-luganshhyny-gotuyut-ditej-do-svo/	2024-12-07T05:56:58-08:00

The occupiers use the labor of people with disabilities for their needs	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. Here, patients are forced to carry out plans to manufacture so-called aid for the needs of terrorists. First of all, it is about weaving camouflage nets. The occupiers of using the labor of people with disabilities cynically argue that weaving has healing properties for the sick and develops fine motor skills. The Russian occupiers' use of the labor of the unprotected population of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is a -normal practice-. Since the beginning of the year, the Luhansk character of the Kremlin program has been actively implemented in the schools of the Luhansk region. Pupils organize propaganda events, in particular, make trench candles for terrorists of the Russian army. We remind you that the enemy is terrorizing agrarians from temporarily occupied Ukraine with innovations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/okupanty-vykorystovuyut-praczyu-lyudej-z-invalidnistyu-na-potreby-svo/	2024-12-07T04:53:05-08:00
EU countries plan to create a fund to strengthen defense potential	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Funds are planned to be raised by placing bonds under national guarantees of participating countries. The model will involve both EU member states and non-EU states (Great Britain, Norway).

The estimated amount of funding could be at least 500 billion euros – the minimum required to meet Europe's defense needs over the next decade. Implementation of the project will be an important step towards strengthening the defense potential of the EU. The initiative already has the support of the Netherlands, Finland, and Denmark.

But luckily for us, they have no success, painstaking combat work is going on every day,- noted -Enei-, the spokesman emphasized that they do not ignore any Russian occupier, they understand this, that's why many of their infantry go to deserters. -The enemy is trying to land those who are left closer to our positions so that they somehow conduct combat operations against such legendary brigades as ours and neighboring ones,- the speaker noted. The specificity of the work in the Kursk region is that maneuver work is carried out - both defense and offensive. -This is used by both the enemy and us. However, many enemy infantry do not even reach the point they were assigned. And because of the great losses, they are not morally ready to fight even in the Kursk region, not ready to perform the tasks that their leadership sets them,- Eneis summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, drones and DRGs are not so effective in the rear: what winter changed at the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/rosiyany-atakuyut-kolonamy-v-loba-morpihy-rozpovily-pro-speczyfiku-boyiv-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-07T04:13:08-08:00
Agrarians from temporarily occupied Ukraine are being terrorized by the enemy with an innovation	reports this Center of national resistance. the Kremlin obliged farmers to obtain Russian-style driver's licenses for tractor drivers. The process of replacing the document will continue until the end of December 2025. If the farmers do not fulfill the new conditions of the Russian terrorists, their equipment will be confiscated. Meanwhile, in the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia, Putin's henchmen began to fight hysterically over possible farmers' riots. After all, due to total looting, terror and confiscation of property, farmers cannot withstand the conditions in which the Kremlin forced them. We remind you, in the Vasylivsky district, the Russian occupiers fired artillery attack on the village of Primorske.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/agrariyiv-iz-tymchasovo-okupovanoyi-ukrayiny-vorog-teroryzuye-novovvedennyam/	2024-12-07T03:47:31-08:00

The occupiers have blocked exits from Aidar and are simulating the restoration of factories	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. The invaders organize queues of cars and check local residents and guests according to their lists. This time, they are looking not only for ATO/OOS members, but also for their relatives, even distant ones. According to Artem Lysohor, this is how Russian law enforcement agencies try to achieve -results- for reporting at the end of the year. At the same time, the occupation authorities announce the attraction of investors to the industrial enterprises of the front-line cities. However, in reality, no activity was observed on the destroyed objects. During the two years of occupation, demining of the territories has not even begun. It is known that the launch of the -Azot- chemical plant in Severodonetsk has been postponed for the -next few years-. Currently, the occupiers are trying to restore only one of dozens of shops, which has been operating as a separate enterprise since the 1990s. Raids and imitation of industrial recovery become a cover for repression and attempts to create the appearance of economic activity in the occupied territories. As reported by ArmyInform, Kysh Babaj and Tol Babaj: occupiers brought fabulous guests from Tatarstan and Udmurtia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/okupanty-perekryly-vyyizdy-z-ajdaru-ta-imituyut-vidnovlennya-zavodiv/	2024-12-07T03:08:11-08:00

The educational session covered the following topics: Specialists of the Croatian Mine Action Center shared their 30-year experience in demining territories affected by the 1991-1995 war for independence.

Not so effective drones and DRG in the rear: what winter has changed at the front	Oleksandr Danylenko, the head of the group of interaction with the media of the State Border Service -Hart- brigade, told about this on the -Social News- broadcast. In particular, in Vovchansk, the enemy storms up to ten times a day. However, the border guards of the -Hart- brigade repulsed the enemy, intelligence revealed the movement of the enemy, attempts to set up positions. Enemy DRGs are also trying to sneak into the rear, but our guys detect them. Therefore, the situation is under control. -Regroupings associated with fairly large losses occur constantly among the enemy. The number of manpower and equipment is kept at approximately the same level, but this is enough to make breakthrough attempts in the area,- Oleksandr Danylenko noted. In addition, snow and frost leave their mark. At low temperatures, drones, of which there are many, fly less because the batteries drain faster. And when it snows, visibility becomes worse, drones become less effective. -Also, due to the low temperatures, thermal imagers can see people and equipment better, and tracks are better visible on the snow. And this must be taken into account in order to be invisible to the enemy. And the enemy, unfortunately, also takes this into account,- the spokesman noted. Oleksandr Danylenko noted that every day our servicemen with artillery, mortars, and drones destroy enemy positions, equipment, guns, vehicles, mortars, personnel, and destroy their fortifications. -The enemy is suffering significant losses both in manpower and equipment. It's not very easy for him here, that's why he sits and waits, and with the help of the DRG he tries to feel our weak points, but he has no success,- the speaker added. As reported by ArmyInform, in the direction of Kurakhiv Russians maintain their large presence and do not lose their ambitious plans to move forward. However, they are hindered by the successful combat operations of our fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/ne-taki-efektyvni-drony-ta-drg-v-tylu-shho-zminyla-zyma-na-fronti/	2024-12-07T02:09:00-08:00

According to the spokesman, our tankers are working well. Armored groups advance to the front and destroy the enemy literally a few meters away in fortified places, dugouts and other locations. -In the ranks of our enemy there are both trained military personnel and mobilized ones, with which the enemy is renewing its frantic losses.

Armored toy for Kim Jong-un: North Korea inspected a new tank	Arms market experts interviewed by reporters of the American magazine Newsweek say that North Korea has introduced a new main combat tank (OBT), the design of which is similar to modern Western counterparts. Tianma-2 -resembles modern Western and American main battle tanks very much,- the Army Recognition Group, a Belgian company, said in turn , which conducts military analysis. Experts from a group that studied images of the Tianma-2 released by the North Korean news agency compared the tank to the German Leopard 2A7/A8, known for its advanced and modern armor, firepower and digital systems. Experts in the basics of tank construction have determined that the layout of the North Korean MBT involves the placement of the driver-mechanic at the front on the left, the turret located in the center, and the power plant located at the rear. The tank is manned by a crew of three, supported by an automatic loading system for the main weapon, a 125 mm smoothbore gun. The turret design includes modular composite armor that provides improved protection against kinetic energy projectiles (APFSDS) and cumulative charges (HEAT projectiles). The modular design allows for quick replacement of damaged armor sections in the field, which is characteristic of many modern main battle tanks. In addition, dynamic armor (ERA) covers the front and sides of the hull, and special wire protection is installed in the rear to protect against rocket-propelled grenades and other cumulative charges. One of the most striking updates of this model of the North Korean battleship is the integration of an active protection system (APS), which is similar to the Trophy APS from Israel and its European counterparts. The Tianma-2's APS system includes radar sensors on each side of its turret for threat detection, as well as countermeasures designed to intercept incoming anti-tank missiles and projectiles. To further strengthen the tank's defenses, the turret roof is equipped with an anti-tank launcher to combat drones, reflecting North Korea's emphasis on countering new aerial threats. The upgraded Tianma-2 turret also includes a Remotely Operated Warfare Station (ROWS) equipped with a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun, as well as launchers capable of firing anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). The tank is equipped with a panoramic sight system for observing the battlefield and conducting the battle by the commander and gunner, which provides enhanced opportunities to capture targets with their subsequent escort. Originally unveiled as the M2020 during a military parade on October 10, 2020, the Cheonma-2 has undergone significant changes since its first public appearance. It was officially named Cheonma-2 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's visit to the Defense Development Academy on May 29, 2024. The original Cheonma-2 demonstrated North Korea's desire to modernize its armored forces, and the new Tianma-2 builds on that prototype by integrating advanced technology and improved battlefield survivability. According to Army Recognition experts, the exhibition presentation of Tianma-2 emphasizes that North Korea continues to focus on the development of local military technologies capable of competing with global standards. The inclusion of advanced features such as APS, modular armor and counter-drone capabilities signal a shift to equipping your forces with tanks designed for the high-intensity scenarios of modern warfare. Defense market experts noted that given the technological leaps demonstrated in its design, the appearance of the Tianma-2 in North Korea's arsenal is likely to attract close attention from regional and global military analysts. Although North Korea has not provided official specifications or performance data for the new MBT, visual evidence from the exhibition underscores its desire to create a powerful and modern main battle tank. The event adds a new dimension to the regional security landscape, as Tianma-2 could potentially strengthen North Korea's armored forces, influencing tactical and strategic calculations on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xM_Rm2m7bA Video: Presentation of the new main battle tank of the DPRK Tianma-2.

What awards are in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine	Awards are primarily a moral value, because they testify to the recognition by the state and society of a person's real merits. After 2014, with a review of the war in Ukraine, the entire award system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine was compositionally and ideologically modified to reflect the historical progress of the Ukrainian military. The Department for the Development of Military Symbols and Heraldry of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is responsible for the development of military awards, which, in response to ArmyInform's request, reported what awards are in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine and what are the principles and ideology of creation modern Ukrainian military awards. Awards in the system of the IOU and ZSU are divided into four main complexes. The first is the departmental incentive awards of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The current decorations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine are established by the Order of the Ministry of Defense No. 392 dated November 21, 2022. According to it, servicemen and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as other persons, can be awarded the badges -Cross of Special Merit- and -For Exemplary Service-, as well as medals: -Iron Cross-, -Knight's Cross-, -Military Cross-. , -Cross of Valor-, -For Wound-, -Cross of Honor-, -Golden Trident-, -For Strengthening defense capabilities-, -3rd point of the military brotherhood-, -Defender of Ukraine-, -For assistance to the defense-, -Cross of the Ground Forces-, -Cross of the Air Forces-, -Cross of the Naval Forces-, -Cross of Special Operations Forces-, -Cross of the Forces Territorial Defense-, -Logistics Forces Cross-, -Support Forces Cross-, -Medical Forces Cross-, -Airborne Assault Forces Cross-, -Cross Communications and Cyber ​​Security Troops, Cross of the State Special Transport Service, Peacekeeper Warrior, Service Veteran, 20 Years of Faithful Service, 15 Years of Faithful Service, 10 Years of Faithful Service. The second award complex is the incentive awards of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Cold weapon- and -Firearm-, established by the order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine No. 693 dated 10/23/2012. According to this order, the -Firearms- badge is a pistol, a revolver and a hunting firearm, and the -Meadow Weapons- badge is a saber, broadsword and a club. The third award complex is the Honorary Badges of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, established by the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine No. 187 dated 07/05/2023. This order, in particular, established the following badges of honor: -Cross of Merit-, -Cross of the Brave-, -Steel Cross-, -Silver Cross-, -Golden Cross-, -Military Honor Cross-, -3a conscientious service-, -Combatant cross- with the breastplate -Honor and memory- next to it, -For invincibility-, -For life preserved-, -3a contribution of the army-, -The best sergeant (sergeant) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, -For combat valor-, -Shield of the winner-. And, finally, the fourth complex is the Commemorative breastplates of military units, established by the order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine No. 478 of 03.08.2021, which is entitled -Regulations on the commemorative breastplates of military administration bodies, units, military units , institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. According to this provision, commemorative badges were established -with the purpose of developing the symbols of military administration bodies, units, military units, institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, increasing the prestige of military service, strengthening military-patriotic education.- Drawings of breast insignia are developed taking into account the specifics of the activity of the military unit, its affiliation to the relevant type of Armed Forces, type of troops (service), history and combat traditions, place of deployment, etc. When creating award systems, specialists were primarily guided by the provisions of Decrees of the President of Ukraine No. 694 dated May 18, 2000. -On streamlining heraldry in Ukraine- and No. 365 of May 30, 2012. -About departmental encouraging awards-. However, ideologically and artistically, awards were created based on the position of continuity of modern awards from the symbols and award traditions of the period of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917–1921, awards of the UHP government in exile, awards of Ukrainian national emigrant organizations of 1930–1990, awards of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army of 1942–1950 years Some awards are based on historical prototypes. In particular, the -Iron Cross- medal originates from the single combat award of the UNR Iron Cross -For the Winter Campaign and Battles-, established by the order of the Main Command of the Army and Fleet of the UHP dated 10.19.1920, signed by Simon Petlyura, the chief commander of the troops of the UNR Directory. The official incentive award of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Golden Trident- originates from the award project of the Western region of the Ukrainian People's Republic, established on April 30, 1919, which was not implemented more than a hundred years ago. A number of insignia of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are based on the awards of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. For the first time, the UPA Main Command introduced the awards system by its order No. 3/44 dated January 27, 1944. The design projects of these awards and the technology of their minting in underground conditions were developed by a member of the regional reference office of propaganda of the OUN Branch of the North-Western Ukrainian Lands, the famous graphic designer Nil Khasevych (1905–1952) and his student -Svyrid-. They were approved by the UGVR on June 30, 1950. An equally important element of the award ideology and award practice was the study of modern phalerist traditions of partner countries and their comparison with the national phalerist heritage. In particular, an in-depth analysis was carried out regarding the military awards of the USA, Great Britain, the Republic of Poland, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the French Republic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/yaki-nagorody-ye-v-systemi-minoborony-ukrayiny-ta-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2024-12-06T21:03:42-08:00
Mobilization of volunteers in the Transcarpathian way: about -chips- recruiting, monetary reward and...	But the main thing is that they give a 100% guarantee that you will be sent to serve in the military unit in which you want to serve or they will choose the appropriate unit for your specialty. In addition, they also give a monetary reward of 20 thousand hryvnias for the fact that you are called up for service under a contract from the Tyachiv district of Transcarpathia. Active military personnel and their families are provided free of charge with rehabilitation programs and rest in the sanatoriums of Solotvyno in Transcarpathia. How did you manage to establish an effective recruiting mechanism? Why do people believe the servicemen of Tyachiv RTCC and SP and go to Transcarpathia from all over Ukraine? What is their main -feature-? ArmyInform asked the head of the Tyachiv district TCC and SP Colonel Andrii Oleschuk about this: -Our recruiting system works simply and efficiently. About a year ago, we realized that we needed to change our approach to recruiting candidates for military service under a contract. We analyzed our work and formed several important criteria, which gave, in fact, the result of recruiting volunteers. Right now, we are exceeding our contract staffing plan by 300%. So, first, we introduced advertising in social networks, in the media, and created printed campaign products. Social advertising is aimed at different strata of the population and it is conventionally divided into three directions: — Russia has attacked and the Motherland must be defended; — advertising that shows the destroyed cities and villages of our Ukraine; — a social package and state social guarantees: financial support, rewards, vacations, career growth. Plus an additional incentive from us to recruiters in the amount of 20 thousand hryvnias. The first two ads worked well in 2022-2023. People are looking more at cash benefits and social security issues this year. The second is communication with military units. We work with many military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. First of all, these are the local unit of the TrO Forces, the 128th separate Transcarpathian mountain assault brigade, the 47th separate mechanized brigade -Magura- and many other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Third, the creation of comfortable conditions, documentary support for conscripts, humane treatment of candidates and their social support. Of course, no lies, work on mutual trust and feedback from the recruiters themselves. This, by the way, is the most important criterion of our work. If the recruiter has a letter of recommendation from a military unit in his hands and he has had experience in military service for the past 10 years, then the process of filing documents together with the VLK (if everything is in order with his health - ed.) goes as quickly as possible. Unless, of course, an additional medical examination is required. If everything is OK: before 12 o'clock and the serviceman is already leaving for his military unit. Is it fast, I think so. Very often there are situations when people come from other regions, because at the local TCC it takes more time to process documents and send them to the army. And guys don't want to wait. For example, in Kyiv, one man was processed for 5 days, as soon as he learned about the speed of work of Tyachiv RTCC and SP, he immediately went to us with the documents. In general, they come from different regions of Ukraine. From Kherson, Kyiv, Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Chernihiv, etc. We estimated that almost 60% of the people who came to us could not register for service in the TCC and SP at their place of residence. Next, if, for example, a person who has never served, but wants to join the ranks of the Marines, then together we will find him the unit in which he wants to go. This applies to all majors. Sapper, signalman, paratrooper, tanker, anti-aircraft gunner, stormtrooper, medic, cook, military sailor, etc. Again, it doesn't matter how long the search itself takes. The recruiter lives, eats and rests on weekends as much as necessary. The main criterion is that a person should be satisfied with the choice and be sure to serve where he wants. We had an incident. A man who worked in civil aviation arrived. Well, we spent a month and a half looking for a suitable specialty for him and a part in which he wanted to serve. And all this time he lived here in Tyachevo. We take people where they want to go. And we guarantee them that they will get to serve there. There are, of course, isolated cases when recruiters, who already come to the Training Centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to pass the BZVP, are not always assigned to the military units to which they wanted. We, for our part, can no longer influence these things. Financial support is provided by the Tyachiv District and Transcarpathian Regional Council. These are primarily united territorial communities, private entrepreneurs and philanthropists from our area, who renovated sleeping quarters, toilets and showers. That is, they provided normal living conditions for volunteers. Plus, they provide funds for a cash reward of 20,000 hryvnias to everyone who enlisted from us to join the army. Food itself: purchase of products, their delivery, cooking itself. This is all for the charity funds of our entrepreneurs. And what is interesting, military personnel who have already served some time on the front lines can come here to us on vacation with their families and undergo rehabilitation in sanatoriums and recovery centers in Solotvino and other places located in Tyachiv district. Plus recreation centers in Khust. Military personnel even come to us after being wounded. There are rehabilitation centers with hot salt springs in Solotvino. With the permission of recruiters: we organize watching movies in cinemas, swimming in pools, hiking in the mountains. This is all absolutely free for our defenders who voluntarily went to serve under a contract. All candidates for contract service take a course in tactical medicine at our RTCC and JV in cooperation with the national resistance center of the Transcarpathian region: they learn to provide first aid, work with tourniquets. At the end of the course, everyone is given a first-aid kit with the necessary drugs free of charge. Plus, they take classes on national resistance. These are the basics of military affairs. They are also taught the basic skills of handling weapons. For this, we have the appropriate weapon models. If we take young people, they are interested in the newly created units of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Unmanned Systems. About 40% want to serve there. Older people, who have already served in the army, are more likely to choose those specialties in which they completed their military service or those in which they fought during the ATO/OOS period. There is another category of recruiters who are ready to fight in assault brigades. In principle, it does not matter to them which VOS to obtain. Or those who only want to join the Army or the Marines. And there are quite a few of them. I remember, even a year ago, there was a huge lack of trust in the work of our RTCC and SP. After all, society, unfortunately, has developed a negative attitude, in principle, towards the work of TCC and joint ventures. There was a stereotype - they say that even volunteers are deceived, they do not get where they want to serve. In addition to the long processing of documents and VLK, quality is a problematic issue, people lose hope and lose the desire to protect the state from the enemy. This is where our -main chip- lies. We undertook to reverse this negative trend with the recruitment of volunteers and to show that RTCC and JV can work effectively. At the same time, creating the necessary household and social conditions. Everything for people - comfort and service. People who voluntarily went to this terrible war to defend Ukraine from the enemy deserve special respect. This is the key point. Yes, step by step, we fixed the system and it worked. Feedback from military units helped us a lot in this. Who recommended us to potential candidates to come to us and get registered quickly. I remembered one incident. A volunteer with a letter of recommendation to one of the mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We called the representatives of the unit, they say, they say, -make arrangements, but we don't believe that he will get to us.- We, in turn: -ok, when the military comes to you in the unit - go on a video call for confirmation.- At that time, the team was really surprised. After that, even more volunteers were called to that part through our RTCC and SP. Gradually, the principle of -word of mouth- worked for the very recruiters who signed a contract with us. These are hundreds and hundreds of real testimonials. Here, we can say, came a turning point in trust in our work. Next, our authority was already working for us. Plus a monetary reward of UAH 20,000, it also worked effectively. There are people with different social status. Many people come to us without money. There is an important nuance here. Everyone knows that in the Armed Forces, monetary support is calculated for the actually served last month. And what to do with those military personnel who undergo BZVP in Educational Centers. That is, they have no money in the first month of training. We are solving this problem with the help of these 20 thousand hryvnias. These funds are received by our volunteers in Tyachevo, before being sent either to Training Centers or directly to military units. All volunteers receive monetary incentives without exception. In addition, we provided proposals for the implementation of the mechanism for the purchase of cars for personal use by servicemen who entered into the first contract. We will remind that contract holders have the right within three months from the date of conclusion of the contract to receive a certificate for the purchase of a vehicle in the amount of 150 thousand hryvnias. The mechanism itself is still under development. We, in turn, offer to ensure communication between the owners of car dealerships and the military. That is, to undertake a commitment and help our defenders buy a car. It is necessary to dispel an absolutely harmful myth, which was successfully launched into the information space of Ukraine by Russian propaganda. It concerns the passing of the VLK of those who are conscripted into the army. For example, the TCC and SP -turn a blind eye- to obvious health problems and seek to drag everyone to the ZSU in a row. This is not true. Once a 45-year-old man from Cherkassy came to us. He was obviously from a poor family. He ate at our place more than three times a day. So, in the course of VLC, he was diagnosed with throat cancer, accordingly, he was informed about the diagnosis and was not invited. They bought a train ticket and he went home for treatment. There was a volunteer, a 28-year-old guy from the Kherson region. A letter of recommendation is in hand. He passed the tests, his blood sugar is high, up to 60. We tell him, boy, go home, get treatment, and then come to us. The part was informed that we could not call him. Many candidates have AIDS and other diseases that make them ineligible for military service. This is all clearly established. Because the most important thing for us is the health and life of people. Therefore, we invite all willing conscripts who are fit for service in terms of health to stand up for the defense of Ukraine. One of the main differences between contract service and mobilization during martial law is the ability to choose a unit and specialty.

The enemy is dispersing the attack on - NATO's plan for the introduction of troops into Ukraine -	In fact, the narrative of the Western -occupation- of Ukraine has been promoted by Moscow since the Revolution of Dignity. It is Russia that has been violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine since 2014, and in 2022 it tried to completely occupy the country. In addition, Russia is dispersing a manipulative -throw-in- as if -Western Ukraine will join NATO separately from other regions, like West Germany during the Cold War- with a reference to the American publication Politico. Actually in the article of the Politico publication entitled -Ukraine's peace plans: Many ideas for ending the fighting, but the sides, as before, are far from each other- there are several models for ending hostilities in Ukraine. One of the options is when Ukraine receives an invitation to join the alliance within its internationally recognized borders, instead security guarantees are extended to those territories under the control of the Ukrainian authorities. Thus, Russian mass media and social media users once again take quotes from foreign media out of context, this time to spread the narrative about the division of Ukraine. Such statements are aimed at causing Ukrainians to mistrust Western allies, shaking the unity of the country and its partners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/vorog-rozganyaye-vkyd-pro-plan-nato-shhodo-vvedennya-vijsk-v-ukrayinu/	2024-12-06T20:28:58-08:00
-Twice for seven-, or How the master sergeant Red twice led his comrades out of the encirclement in ...	In the ranks of the Ryzhy Armed Forces from the first day of the large-scale invasion: -At 7 a.m. on February 24, I heard explosions and went outside. A comrade drove by in a car, he says, war. I immediately went to the TCC for a military ID and passport. I had a first-line reserve after my military service. They said I was needed. We were put on a bus and we went to Goncharivske. Then I didn't think about anything in particular: they said it must be, therefore it must be.- At that moment, Ryzhy's family was waiting for the arrival of their daughter. The wife saw off with tears in her eyes. Mom was also upset. But the man says that they still couldn't refuse him. Then there was a clear realization: first of all, it is necessary to protect the closest people. In 2022, as part of a rifle battalion, he went to defend the state in Donetsk region. He says that even then the situation was tense, but the enemy had fewer drones at that time. For the most part, the enemy stormed with infantry: -By the end of 2023, they had a lot more technical means. We were constantly under enemy drones: you enter a position under drones, take turns constantly under drones, leave the same way under drones. In winter, everything is complicated by the fact that the leaves fall, so it is more difficult to disguise the position.- One of the episodes that Ryzhom remembers the most happened on December 1-2, 2023. Then a group of enemy infantry consisting of eight people came almost close to the position of the rifle battalion: -There were four of us and eight of them. Landing. From one end of the hole, from the other end of the hole - they haven't had time to dig yet. The branches were used to make a shack so that the fpv wouldn't fly in. It was foggy. A drone hovered above us. While I was contacting the senior to find out if it was our bird or not, I lowered my head and saw the enemy 10 meters away. A battle ensued. They immediately threw us at RGD-5. For a moment, I might as well call it quits. But I realized that I want to live more than they do. And immediately shot two stores in the Somali style, then began aiming fire. The guys and I put 5 of them, one gave up. Two of them were beaten up, they were still shouting: -friend-brother, pamagi-. It was not possible to take those two and to provide them with help - all the time the Russians were firing from grenade launchers and mortars. Therefore, our infantrymen did not come out of the shelter. Instead, the Russian, who surrendered first, even managed to tell a little about himself. However, as it turned out later, the versions about why he took part in the war were made up on the fly: -I remember that he said his name was Vova, he was 40 years old. He went to war so as not to be imprisoned. But when he was brought to our far position, he told a completely different story there. That he was caught, brought by force. They promised that trenches would be dug, but they threw themselves into the storm.- Currently Ryzhy, together with his brothers, performs combat missions in the territory of the Kursk region. Twice he had to remove people from the environment. And twice he was able to get everyone out alive. -The first time, a platoon leader came and said that it was necessary to go on an assault. We went as a group of 16 people on two BMPs. Three tanks moved to cover us. They drove to the place, took positions. It was difficult, many enemy fpvs, three hundred appeared among us. The wounded were evacuated. Reinforcements came to us and we continued our work. But the next day, neither evacuation nor support groups could reach us. We took up a street and a half. The enemy realized that there were not so many of us and began to knock out every house. They worked on us actively with mortars, rockets, and fpv, there was constant shelling from small arms. It was not possible to get us through the windows, because we strengthened them well with boards, beds, and bedside tables. But then the Russians started breaking through the roofs, dropping the so-called -lighters-. And when one house was occupied, it was necessary to move to the next one,- Ryzyy recalls. -When the combatant realized that the equipment could not reach us, he began to take us out in small groups. It turned out that I became the leader of the group. He took out at least seven people. They walked -on brimstone-, through the enemy's street. The commander accompanied us by radio. They walked through the swamp. It was difficult because I was thirsty. Twice the fellows managed to drop half a liter of water each from the drone. I tell the guys: don't drink a lot, wet your lips and move on. As soon as we got out of the swamp, it was easier, but we had to move across open terrain. There was a moment when an enemy drone overtook us, one fighter was injured - shrapnel hit his shoulder blade and leg. But we managed to get to our neighbors, where we were able to rest a little. I drank one and a half liters of water in a minute. Then the combatant got in touch, said to go further. And so he brought us to the evacuation point, from where we were already taken to the place of deployment. The only thing I thought about then was how to get all the people out alive. And also about the fact that I had one RGD-5, one F-1, three stores. I will shoot the stores, throw a grenade. One more remains. Let the enemies come,- says the man. The redhead led seven fighters, brought them all to the evacuation point. Even later, finding himself in relative safety, the first desire was to call his relatives. The husband had not been in touch for a long time, so he understood that the family was worried: -I talked a lot with my daughter. She called everyone home. He told his wife that he did not call because roaming abroad is very expensive. I started joking, because I realized that it was safe, that everything was over. At that moment I was already released.- During the third trip to the territory of Kurshchyna, the man again had to take out his comrades: -A combatant came out to me, around 9 o'clock, told me to leave. Offered at my discretion: either now or in the evening. The guys and I consulted, decided what to expect. Moreover, the enemy BMP had already moved in, unloading the infantry. We decided to go in the afternoon. Just gathered as three drones hovered above us. We waited until they took off, heard that it was quiet, and left after landing. He went out to the commander, asked where to go. The most frightening thing was to move through a clear field, there it was necessary to overcome about a kilometer and 200 meters. Just like the first time, 7 people were taken out, the same way the second time. My lucky number.- Ryzyy is now the chief sergeant of the rifle battalion company. Among his tasks is the training of personnel. Goes to training grounds with soldiers, shares his experience, tells in detail how to prepare for combat. He says this about his motivation: -I have two daughters. Wife. Mother. Three sisters. Brother. If we do not destroy the enemy, he will come to our homes. And if we talk about the Kursk operation, it is better for us to destroy the enemy on his own land than for them to come to us again.- Dina Wong for ArmyInform	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/dvichi-po-sim-abo-yak-golovnyj-serzhant-ryzhyj-dvichi-vyviv-pobratymiv-z-otochennya-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-06T20:12:13-08:00

Words from Russia mean nothing, but its bombs and missiles say everything very eloquently - the Pres...	The President wrote about this on December 6. -On the evening of St. Nicholas, aerial bombs hit Zaporozhye — just on the service station, on cars with people. As of now, it is known about four injured people, all of them are receiving help. The list of the dead includes nine people. A rocket attack on Kryvyi Rih — on an ordinary city building. Seventeen wounded. Two died. And these are only two Russian strikes on two Ukrainian cities in one day,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. In his opinion, the thousands of such strikes that were carried out by Russia during this war clearly state that it is Putin who does not need real peace, he only needs the opportunity to do this to any country - bombs, missiles, all other violence. -It can only be resisted by force. And only through force can real peace be established. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine with this! Eternal memory to all the victims of Russian terror!-, said the President.

The DPRK has sent 11,000 military personnel to the Kursk region,- said Rustem Umyerov. According to him, this increases the risk of the transfer of modern military technologies from Russia to the North Korean regime, which creates new threats not only for Europe, but also for Asia. -Japan remains our strategic partner. Our cooperation is strengthening in response to common security challenges. Support for Ukrainian industry and new models of cooperation were discussed.

The voice of defense: how -Armiya FM- became a radio station for all Ukrainians	To the Day of the Armed Forces, the information service of NSJU prepared a story about the main military radio of our country. The history of the radio station began in 2016 — -Army FM- was called to support military personnel in the area of ​​an anti-terrorist operation. Since then, radio has significantly expanded its audience. Today's -Army FM-, which works as part of the Central Television and Radio Studio of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine headed by Lieutenant Colonel Serhii Zhukovsky, is a radio station that speaks in 37 settlements throughout Ukraine. This is no longer exclusively a radio for military personnel, but for every Ukrainian, because practically every family has a military person. -Army FM- broadcast is structured taking into account the needs of the audience. The main prime time is in the morning and evening hours, when people go to work or return home. From 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., the morning show of the famous radio presenter Serge Gagarin, who tells listeners about important events, communicates with listeners, from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., the evening show of experienced radio host Igor Kozak, and from 8:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. — -Evening Poe-, author's program by a famous Ukrainian singer and military serviceman Oleksandr Polozhynskyi. Under the leadership of Major Andrii Davydov, -Army FM- works with the military and political leadership, receives information about the development of the defense complex, what weapons our units are equipped with, how training is conducted. -Army FM- maintains constant contact with the audience through all available communication channels. Communication is especially active during the morning and evening shows, when listeners can join in discussing current topics. The radio station is present on all social networks and messengers, so any listener can conveniently write, express their opinion or ask questions to an expert in the studio. Among the listeners' questions are many about how to get to serve in one or another unit of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. And this despite the fact that nowadays this information can be easily found on the Internet or on street billboards. But on the radio, there is a program with military servicemen who tell how they came to serve in their units, about their military experience, about the combat path of the brigades and joint achievements. The radio also distributes recruiting videos through its social networks, from which you can learn that the army is not only about combat tasks, there is also other work that many can do. The main audience of the radio station is men and women aged 30+: current and future military personnel, volunteers and their family members. It is interesting that before the start of the full-scale invasion, the radio was listened to even in the temporarily occupied territories. Listeners from Luhansk, Donetsk, Makiivka, Debaltseve called and wrote messages. The work of military radio does not go unnoticed by the enemy. The site has been repeatedly attacked by cyber attacks. The most recent case was on the Day of Remembrance of the Holodomor Victims. The site was attacked allegedly from Indonesia, although it is clear that in fact it was from a completely different country. In the front-line territories, the Russians are trying to jam Ukrainian radio broadcasts and broadcast their own. The enemy allocates huge funds for disinformation, has at least twenty years of experience in imperial propaganda. The programming content of -Army FM- is diverse and meaningful. Every day at 4:30 p.m., the program -Stratcom Speaks- is broadcast - an up-to-date summary of the most important military and socio-political events in Ukraine and the world. Captain Kateryna Bilenko's program -There is no reason to worry- is broadcast twice a week, which tells about the legal features of military service. A special place in the broadcasting network is occupied by the program -Timely about- - the author's project of Dmytro Simanskyi. The program discusses global topics: international military cooperation, recruiting and mobilization, energy, political processes. Guests are top officials, military, diplomats and politicians. Verified objective news from primary sources and refutation of Russian fakes is the most important direction of the radio station, which is overseen by Captain Maria Veres and highly experienced journalist Oleksiy Mustafin. Andriy Vyrva provides timely sports news. Every day on -Army FM- you can hear -the same historian from Tik-Tok- Oleksandr Alfyorov, a soldier of the 3rd Assault Brigade, with a unique author's column -A Minute of Ukrainian History-. The radio station always supports a variety of events for military and veterans at all levels. A prime example of this is the partnership with Invictus Games. Its manifestation on the air is the big weekly project -Games of the Invincibles- from the inside. Also, -Army FM- likes to provide media support to interesting initiatives of units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. A lot of attention on the radio is paid to the musical content. Radio presenter, now captain of the ZSU, Serzh Gagarin, who has more than 22 years of experience in radio broadcasting at leading Ukrainian radio stations, joined the Army FM team at the end of 2022 after serving in the Chernihiv National Guard. At the same time, a professional approach to the formation of the program grid and music playlist was applied to the broadcast. The format of -Army FM- is Modern Rock / Power Pop, which is based on rock compositions, recognizable world hits and a large share of modern music from Ukrainian rock artists who have an unblemished reputation. Ukrainian music occupies more than 40 percent of the airwaves. Nobody arbitrarily rearranges songs on the air. The music selection that the radio -plays- is determined in advance, taking into account categories, hours and audience preferences. With the passage of time since the large-scale invasion, the musical preferences of listeners have changed. -Bayraktarshchy- became less. At the beginning, there were a lot of jokes in the style of -what a Cossack you are-, -what a Cossack you are-, -Russian ship-, etc. Now is the time for more serious music that conveys important messages to listeners. Some songs can make you feel sad, and some songs can inspire you for important things and victories. At -Army FM- they are convinced that music can save, -pull out of a psychological pit.- Someone is inspired by Oleksandr Polozhynskyi's -Knight's Cross-, someone likes -Pianoboy- with the song -I can do everything-, someone likes -Surface Tension- with the motivational composition -Tomorrow-, someone likes the group -Pyratyn- and its humorous song -Arta-, someone else the work of the Finnish group -Moon Shot- called -Yes!-, recorded in support of Ukraine, or Yarmak's track -Babylon-. The Ukrainian military believes that today it is important to talk to people about Ukraine's victories - and not only at the front, but also in sports, art, film production, and the IT sphere. All of these parts make up our overall prospective Victory. The radio station is actively developing and planning new projects. I would like to see more programs, but the human resource of the Central Television and Radio Studio of the Ministry of Defense is limited, in addition, military personnel are assigned to combat units on a rotational basis. But from the New Year, some pleasant surprises are waiting for the listeners. At -Army FM- they intend to introduce an international project about global changes, talk about the political component of events in the world, how it affects Ukraine and democratic countries. They are also planning a full-length program on the fight against Russian fakes, they want to talk more about Western weapons and Ukrainian developments. As of now, military radio speaks in 37 settlements, including the big cities of Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Rivne, Kryvyi Rih and others. Also, the -Army FM- signal receives a considerable number of small front-line and border towns and villages, where radio is more or less the only way to receive information, so the mission of the radio station does not lose its strategic importance. Another expansion of coverage and the start of broadcasting in Mukachevo is on the way. There are plans to obtain more permits for temporary broadcasting in order to inform Ukrainians about the state of affairs in the army and the state in general. Today, Army FM is much more than just a radio station. It is an information outpost that reminds every day: together we are strong, together we are free, together we will win. It is a voice that, through music, news and communication, supports the fighting spirit of defenders and the entire Ukrainian people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/golos-oborony-yak-armiya-fm-stala-radiostancziyeyu-dlya-vsih-ukrayincziv/	2024-12-06T08:04:08-08:00

Illegals are threatened with deportation with a ban on entry, instead they are offered to sign a contract and promise not to send them to the front line. However, this is a delusion, because the empire always fights with other people's hands.

Illusory victories of the Russian Federation: what the enemy invents to divert attention from large-...	Moreover, the MORF regularly reports on the -destruction- of HIMARS launchers, the number of which has already exceeded that received by Ukraine. About writes Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. These statements are aimed at supporting the illusion of Russia's -greatness-, because Russian propaganda has always operated on the principle of quantitative exaggeration. For example, back in 2017, Sergei Shoigu reported on the -laying off- of 500,000 km² in Syria, although the area of ​​the entire country is only 185,000. km². At the same time, the real facts remain outside the official summaries. By report of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, in November, the Russian army suffered the largest irreversible and sanitary losses in force since the beginning of the large-scale invasion: during this month, our soldiers -two hundred- and -three hundred- 45,720 enemy soldiers. But this data is overlooked by propagandists who focus on creating their own illusory victories. After all, the Russians can indeed shoot down Ukrainian missiles with oil depots, airfields or military factories. Such fake -reports- not only create a false picture of reality for the domestic audience, but are also designed to divert attention from Russia's large-scale losses and failures at the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/ilyuzorni-peremogy-rf-shho-vygaduye-vorog-aby-vidvernuty-uvagu-vid-masshtabnyh-vtrat/	2024-12-05T21:02:38-08:00
A serious reason for neurosis in the Kremlin: Germany is waiting for a missile capable of -penetrati...	However, as informs the portal of the influential German publication Der Spiegel, the Bundeswehr does not yet have an appropriate budget for this is an important project, ArmyInform reports. According to the publication, the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany presented to the budget committee of the Bundestag the profile of the corresponding project in confidential documents for the state budget for 2025. Accordingly, from a military point of view, it makes sense to order 600 Taurus Neo cruise missiles for approximately €2.1 billion. The first units of long-range weapons may be delivered in 2029. The decision to develop Taurus Neo, according to German observers, marks a significant step in modernizing Germany's military potential and strengthening its strategic position in a tense geopolitical context. According to German media reports, the Taurus Neo project is aimed at expanding the capabilities of the existing Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile. In particular, according to German parliamentary sources, the modification involves increasing the flight range, increasing the accuracy of hitting targets and the power of the warhead. The Taurus Neo's technical improvements are expected to include a flight range exceeding 500 km. The guidance system will be modernized, it will integrate advanced technologies of inertial navigation and GPS correction to increase accuracy for detecting hard-to-reach targets. It is also assumed that the missile will be equipped with a more powerful warhead designed to penetrate heavily fortified structures such as bunkers or underground storage facilities. In addition, the Taurus Neo can include anti-missile defense bypass technologies, which increases the missile's ability to evade enemy radars and anti-aircraft defenses. Currently, the German armed forces have at their disposal approximately 600 Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, which are mainly used on Tornado fighters. Although the missile has also been tested on the Eurofighter EF2000, this aircraft is not yet used as a standard launch platform for the Taurus. The upcoming conclusion from the operation of Tornado fighters raises the question of the launch platform for the Taurus Neo. As such, the Eurofighter is the Bundeswehr's most likely option, while integration with the F-35As recently ordered by Germany is unlikely without a full redesign of the missile to match the internal compartment of the American stealth fighter. Experts of the IKK defense portal Defense Express (DE) reminded that the first batch of Taurus missiles in 600 units cost the Germans €570 million, deliveries continued until December 2010. As reported by ArmyInform , Taurus missiles in Germany were repeatedly requested by Ukraine. However, the chancellor of the country, Olaf Scholz, makes categorical statements from time to time that Germany will not transfer these long-range weapons to Ukraine, and the other day he noted that he will not change his position on this issue. As of today, according to data by the authors of the DE portal, Germany does not produce Taurus cruise missiles. Last year, the CEO of MBDA Deutschland, Joachim Knopf, stated that it would take a year to resume production of these weapons, taking into account delays in the delivery of electronics or explosives. As reported, in the long term, Germany could consider integrating the Taurus Neo into the FCAS (Future Combat Air System) is a next-generation fighter project developed in cooperation with France, Spain and Belgium. Despite the fact that in the coming decades, the US Air Force is expected to play a central role in the modernization of European air forces. In Germany, it is believed that the Taurus Neo technology could have significant implications for European defense. As a high-precision, long-range weapon, this missile can enhance deterrence capabilities while offering additional strategic capabilities for the continent's collective defense. However, the financing of the Taurus Neo project remains a serious problem for the German government. So, according to data reporters of the defense portal The War Zone, the budget of the Federal Republic of Germany for 2025 will require include the €350 million required to launch development, and current budget constraints may affect costs in the coming years. However, the support expressed by the government coalition in Germany indicates a favorable outcome for the implementation of the project, despite possible debates in the German parliament regarding the feasibility of prioritizing such costs in difficult economic conditions. The announcement of the Taurus Neo project came just two days after the signing of a historic defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom aimed at accelerating the development of a new, more advanced long-range missile than the Storm Shadow. This agreement was followed by the announcement of the UK joining the European Strike Program (ELSA): a French-led initiative that includes Germany, Poland and Italy. As part of ELSA, it is planned to develop a missile with a flight range of 1,000 km. up to 2 thousand km by 2030. Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile.

-The U.S. military was cool long before 2022-: about the war of the Hornet, Chip and Dale and the fi...	Experienced artilleryman Major Kostyantyn Rymarenko told ArmyInform about what the long years of war in Donbas since 2014 gave the Ukrainian army, why the armed forces were cool long before the large-scale attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine, as well as why UAVs are critical for artillery with the call sign -Khorunzhiy-. Military -Khorunzhiy- began his career in 2012 with ordinary military service. Then, as a graduate of the Alfred Nobel University in Dnipropetrovsk, he had to serve only 9 months. However, in the end, this short term was only the beginning of a long military career, during which he went from a soldier to a major. To the question about the military department during higher education, the officer answers awkwardly, noting that this is a separate sad story. Unfortunately, during the 1990s and early 2000s, and especially after 2010, the system of training military personnel through military departments at universities was largely disorganized. So the future officer began his service in the army -on a general basis- and now does not regret it. He recalls that during the conscript service, despite the chronic underfunding, outdated material base and remnants of the -Soviet regime-, military affairs were taught qualitatively. - In Divychki, conscripts were taught very well - no worse than officers are taught now. Everything was very well organized, it was very cool training - no questions. Almost everything I know about artillery, how it works, all the basics, I know because of my military service. Really taught very well. Although it was a bit -long- (smiles - author), they taught everything - from A to Z. They laid a very strong base, - says the gunner. All the best from this basis, he believes, allowed the Armed Forces of Ukraine to give a worthy rebuff to the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine in 2014 and became a reliable basis for the further development of the Ukrainian army. The following years before a large-scale attack were also not wasted, so the ASU was already cool well before 2022. Kostyantyn Rymarenko met Russia's attack on Ukraine in the ranks of the Armed Forces, because he signed a contract after the -period-. So we can say that he has been fighting since the very first days of the more than ten-year war. — In 2014, the 25th brigade was the first to leave for Donbas in a convoy, it was the first battalion tactical group (battalion tactical group — author) of the first battalion. On March 10, 2014, we went to the area of ​​the Amvrosiivka settlement. The first 150 km went well - people supported, helped, gave all kinds of -little things-, says the officer. Then the problems began - people in civilian clothes obstructed the movement of convoys of military equipment, blocking roads and chasing traffic. Voyskovyi recalls that the demonstrators were not only extremely decorated due to anti-Ukrainian propaganda, but also well coordinated - it was noticeable that someone was leading them. - Everything was coordinated to the point that they knew the point where it would be most profitable to stop the convoy. Because a convoy is a lot of armor and wheels, it is a military Ural. We often drove on dirt roads, fields - and people in civilian clothes clearly met us where we had to enter the paved road. They already stood at that place in advance, that is, they were coordinated, because they themselves could not follow our movement and understand where exactly we were going, -Khorunzhiy- recalls. The crowd blocking the road could number from a few dozen to two or three hundred people, who had to be bypassed, persuaded or even dispersed by force. It was noticeable that the hysteria among the locals was being specially fanned, and in the crowds you could see trained -activists- provocateurs who organized everything. The further combat path of the gunner lay through Amvrosiivka, Sloviansk, Debaltseve, Shakhtarsk&#8230; The attempt to liberate Donetsk in mid-August 2014 was memorable, during which units of the brigade were supposed to move from Debaltsevo through Nizhnya Kryna in the direction of Khartsyzk. It was then, the officer is convinced, that Russia's first large-scale attack on Ukraine took place. Before that, the Russian Federation operated through special services, organizing, coordinating and supplying weapons to Russian and pro-Russian militants. In the last decade of August 2014, the neighboring aggressor state directly used units of its regular army. Then one group of Ukrainian troops, says -Khorunzhy-, advanced through Nizhnya Kryna to the south, while the second was to go north to Khartsyzk from the side of Ilovaisk. They both had about 7 kilometers to go. — 14 kilometers — and Donetsk would be in a cauldron. But on August 24-25, 2014, the first full-scale invasion of Russia took place, which was hidden. The Ilovai group had an option to come to us to the north, and if we hit each other at the same time, we would meet in Khartsyzka, and everything would be fine, the gunner explains. To prevent this plan, Russia was forced to use units of the regular army, because there were clearly not enough Russian and pro-Russian fighters, and they did not have any tangible support among the local population. Khorunzhiy spent the next six years in a war that many Ukrainians chose not to notice. Meanwhile, soldiers of the Armed Forces defended Ukraine, restraining the enemy in the East of the country. The defenders gave their lives and health, for years they almost did not see their relatives and friends, while the rest of the country continued to live their usual lives. — During the year, we spent 10 months in the ATO/OO zone, then two months at home. Of these two months, we spent one at the training ground, and the other was at the PPD (permanent deployment point - author) and went to training. That is, during my service, I almost did not see my own family, my children, - explains the soldier. However, this time did not pass in vain either for Konstantin himself or for the Armed Forces. -Khorunzhiy- was trained and obtained the rank of primary officer, served in the command and artillery reconnaissance battery, was a platoon commander and a battery commander. And the Ukrainian army has gone through an important path of modernization and gaining combat experience. — In May 2015, I went to study. We mastered the AN/TPQ-48 - studied, disassembled, assembled, repaired. We were well taught in electronics, then there were also courses. After all, in November 2015, I was given the rank of junior lieutenant, - recalls Kostyantyn Rymarenko. The AN/TPQ-48 is an American man-portable counter-battery radar station designed to detect enemy mortar installations. Together with other innovations and assistance from partners, it became very helpful during the war in Eastern Ukraine. In 2020, Kostyantyn Rymarenko resigned from the Armed Forces, hoping to spend more time with his family and recall his civilian specialty as a marketer. However, a large-scale attack by the Russian Federation disrupted all plans for a peaceful life. - From the very morning of February 24, I sent my family to my relatives, and I immediately took my bag - all the military property I had - and went to the military commissariat. When I arrived, they didn't even know what to do and how to do it. And I was already completely gathered at their door. I was quickly taken through all the offices, all the officers - and on the same day I went to the brigade, -Khorunzhiy- recalls. Several days were spent on organizational work, and already on February 27, the officer left for Donbas, where to this day he defends Ukraine as part of his native 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. — When I put my family in the car and sent them to my relatives, took my bag and went to the military checkpoint, I honestly thought I was going to die. I did not believe that we would succeed. But maybe it's because everyone thought so and everyone left - that's why we survived and are still standing, the soldier explains. He is sure that it was the simultaneous rise and joint efforts of Ukrainians, primarily those who gained military experience during the war in the East in 2014-2022, that allowed Ukraine to withstand the extremely difficult conditions of the first months of the large-scale invasion. Another key to the successful defense of Ukraine is the creativity of Ukrainian defenders and innovation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukrainians brought knowledge, skills, skills and even hobbies acquired in civilian life to the Armed Forces - and this gave a colossal result. — In civilian life, I had a hobby — I flew on FPVs, on quadcopters. Thanks to this, we were the first in the brigade to fly a quadcopter. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, there was only one Mavic in the division. Three officers flew on it: I, at that time a senior lieutenant and commander of intelligence, also a senior lieutenant - the deputy commander of a battery from the MPZ - and a division commander in the rank of lieutenant colonel, - says the military man. Before that, the gunners had only wing-type UAVs, and they were even afraid to fly on the recently handed over single Mavic, so as not to lose it. However, in the end, the gunners confidently mastered the new technique and ensured an extremely high result. Three officers took turns flying one drone and directly adjusted fire, transmitting data by radio to the gun commanders. This made it possible to quickly adjust fire and achieve significant accuracy. The scaling of the same process and the significant increase in the number of UAVs made it possible to spread the acquired experience to other artillery divisions of the brigade - and drones changed everything. — If we had as many drones at the beginning of the war as we do now, the occupiers would have all died then. We fired about 300 shells without knowing where. We were told the coordinates - we shot there. If the volumes that we fired at the beginning of the war were combined with such direct streams, which thanks to UAVs we have now, it would be possible to simply destroy any position, the officer explains. The military jokingly compares the 25th Sicheslav Airborne Brigade to Chip and Dale from the famous Disney cartoon about the chipmunks. After all, he says, the brigade is often sent to the direction where the biggest problems arise and where it is urgently necessary to -put out the fire-. — The first time this happened was in the Avdiivka region, when we were planned to be taken out for recovery and replaced by another brigade. Our units began to leave, but not even a day and a half passed when those who replaced us began to fall and lose positions. Therefore, we were forced to urgently return and save the situation, the officer says. Then many more times the Czechoslovak paratroopers were transferred to the hottest and most difficult areas of the front, and everywhere they provided the desired result - both in defense and in attack. -Khorunzhiy- fondly remembers the Slobozhan offensive operation, when the Defense Forces managed to liberate a huge territory of the Kharkiv region with a swift thrust. — When we were transferred to Kharkiv Oblast, there were very big doubts, but we fulfilled the assigned tasks and everything was successful. With minimal losses and with a huge amount of trophies, Raisin was liberated. Then, with already greater losses, unfortunately, they reached the Lyman, he says. The military believes that if it was then possible to introduce additional reserves, reinforce and replace the already exhausted Ukrainian military, the offensive could be continued. Victory in the war is just as achievable, he is convinced. For this, the two most important conditions are necessary - nationwide support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and a sufficient number of motivated and well-trained soldiers.

Heroes of Ukraine: ArmyInform found out in which branches of the army there are the most of them	During the Russian-Ukrainian war, this honorary title gained special importance in the state. After all, heroism has become inseparable from sacrifice. He became something exceptional, extraordinary. As ArmiyaInform was informed by the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, from the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war on February 20, 2014 to December 2, 2024, 449 servicemen were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine (excluding the Military Intelligence Service and units under its direct control and the Military Intelligence Directorate of the Military Intelligence Service). Moreover, from 2014 to 2021, only 52 people were awarded the Golden Star, and starting from 2022, the number of awardees has more than doubled this number every year. The most Heroes of Ukraine in the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine — 234 people, in the Airborne Assault Forces — 57, in the Air Force — 52, TrO of the Armed Forces of Ukraine — 39, SSO of the Armed Forces of Ukraine — 28, Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine — 23. More about the distribution of the awarded by types and types of troops ( forces) — in the infographic We would like to remind that from May 2023, preliminary consideration of submissions and other materials on awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine for the performance of a remarkable heroic act by persons who took a direct part in the implementation of measures to ensure the defense of Ukraine, the protection of the safety of the population and the interests of the state, is carried out by an expert group. which is formed from representatives of all power structures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/geroyi-ukrayiny-armiyainform-diznalas-v-yakyh-rodah-vijsk-yih-najbilshe/	2024-12-05T20:01:57-08:00
The occupiers created classes of young Russian Guardsmen at TOT	About this informs Center of national resistance. In the temporarily occupied territories, the enemy pursues a policy of militarizing children in order to raise future janissaries from them in the future wars of the empire. In particular, the Russians invented classes of -young Russian Guardsmen-, which were supervised by the police. The children were given -cadet- uniforms and forced to swear allegiance to the occupiers. At the same time, they were given lectures by people who organize torture chambers and kidnap people from the streets. In the future, the children were promised benefits when entering specialized educational institutions. The Kremlin spent hundreds of years building a system in which service to a dictator or in the army is the only chance to build a career if you live in the provinces of the empire. In this way, Moscow ensures control over the captured lands and gains manpower for wars of aggression. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the occupied Luhansk Region they are planning to spend 43 billion rubles on the so-called development of the coal industry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/okupanty-stvoryly-klasy-yunyh-rosgvardijcziv-na-tot/	2024-12-05T11:56:49-08:00

Rustem Umyerov discussed international military aid for Ukraine with attachés of partner countries	This is stated in a post on the minister's Facebook page. The main topic of discussion is international military aid for Ukraine. -I expressed my sincere gratitude to every country that supports us in the fight against the aggressor. It is extremely important for Ukraine and our partners that the transferred weapons and equipment are used as efficiently as possible on the battlefield,- said Rustem Umyerov. Together with the representatives of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, the participants of the meeting informed the military attachés about the digitalization of military aid records. Before the start of the full-scale Russian aggression, weapons records were kept exclusively in paper format. The Great War showed that such approaches need to be fundamentally changed. This year, the Ministry of Defense made significant progress in reforming the supply of weapons and equipment to NATO standards. One of the key achievements was the implementation of the SAP system, which translates the accounting and provision of the army into a modern digital format, convenient for analysis and control. Thanks to the license transferred by Germany, SAP is scalable to all units of the Defense Forces. Today, the system covers 3,000 users at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. About 300,000 items have already been entered into the database, and in the online mode we monitor key indicators: the number of weapons, their condition and distribution among units. -Such formats of meetings with the military attachés of our allies will be regular. At the next event, we plan to summarize the results of military aid for previous years and define support plans for 2025. Transparency, clarity and accountability are the principles that the Ministry of Defense steadfastly adheres to in cooperation with our allies,- Rustem Umyerov concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/rustem-umyerov-obgovoryv-mizhnarodnu-vijskovu-dopomogu-dlya-ukrayiny-z-atashe-krayin-partneriv/	2024-12-05T10:44:21-08:00
Rustem Umyerov discussed international military aid for Ukraine with attachés of partner countries	This is stated in a post on the minister's Facebook page. The main topic of discussion is international military aid for Ukraine. -I expressed my sincere gratitude to every country that supports us in the fight against the aggressor. It is extremely important for Ukraine and our partners that the transferred weapons and equipment are used as efficiently as possible on the battlefield,- said Rustem Umyerov. Together with the representatives of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, the participants of the meeting informed the military attachés about the digitalization of military aid records. Before the beginning of the full-scale Russian aggression, the records of weapons were kept exclusively in paper format. The Great War showed that such approaches need to be fundamentally changed. This year, the Ministry of Defense made significant progress in reforming the supply of weapons and equipment to NATO standards. One of the key achievements was the implementation of the SAP system, which translates the accounting and provision of the army into a modern digital format, convenient for analysis and control. Thanks to the license transferred by Germany, SAP is scalable to all units of the Defense Forces. Today, the system covers 3,000 users at the tactical, operational and strategic levels.

Kharkiv, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions remain the most polluted freed territories. Representatives of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this at the fifth review conference (5RC) on the implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and Their Destruction, which was held in the Kingdom of Cambodia within the framework of the Siem Reap-Angkor summit. Representatives of 90 participating countries, 12 observer countries of the Ottawa Convention and almost 20 delegations of various international organizations took part in the event. The Ukrainian delegation told the international community in detail about the crimes of the Russian Federation related to the use of anti-personnel mines against the civilian population. The conference participants were also provided with information about shelling of humanitarian demining groups, which prevent the full implementation of mine action activities. In addition, it was informed about the measures to clean up the territories contaminated by Russian anti-personnel mines and the progress in this area that the units of the Ministry of Defense managed to achieve during 2024. Thus, during the non-technical survey, 35,000 km² of the territory was marked as not containing evidence of the presence of risks. This made it possible to reduce the area of ​​potentially contaminated areas from 174,000 to 139,000 km². As reported by ArmyInform, in 2024 in Ukraine 10 new demining battalions were created. In addition, the fleet of mechanized demining vehicles increased from two units to 52, of which 42 are in the Armed Forces and 10 are in the State Special Transport Service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/zlochyny-armiyi-rf-ponad-1000-czyvilnyh-pidirvalysya-na-protypihotnyh-minah-vid-pochatku-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya/	2024-12-05T09:15:38-08:00

Increasing the ruble discount rate will not help and it will continue to fall	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The regulator allows its increase to 25% at the next meeting of the board of directors on December 20. Also, according to the statement of the Central Bank, the exchange rate has become a new -pro-inflationary factor-. Price growth remains high, and the slowdown in lending, in particular corporate lending, is recorded. It is unlikely that an increase in the discount rate will help the ruble. High inflation of 8.8% and an increase in the key rate in December create significant risks for the Russian economy. We are talking about a decrease in the purchasing power of the population, an increase in the cost of lending, an increase in the debt burden, etc. The war against Ukraine is finally bringing the Russian economy into the abyss. We remind you that the Russian authorities plan to allow the use of in harmful jobs in the industry of teenagers from the age of 16.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/pidvyshhennya-oblikovoyi-stavky-rublyu-ne-dopomozhe-i-vin-prodovzhyt-padinnya/	2024-12-05T09:26:10-08:00

Oleksandr Borodin, spokesman, told about this on the air of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon Third Assault Brigade. According to Oleksandr Borodin, the enemy clearly set the task of reaching the Oskil River. Another goal is the city of Borova. This is a common goal of invaders - such logistics centers are very important for the Russians. -They chose the tactics of daily assaults for the constant fatigue of our personnel. But if there is a possibility of rotation, and there are forces and means to ensure these rotations, it is possible to be in such conditions for a long time and protect people,- Oleksandr Borodin noted. The situation is extremely difficult. The occupiers have no problems with reserves, the spokesman of the Third Assault Division points out. The quality of training has fallen, but the infantry, albeit untrained, is sufficient. -They have built logistics chains of people. When one company is destroyed there, there is conditionally another, which stands on the second line of defense. And the third company, which is in the rear area,- said Oleksandr Borodin.

In the Russian Federation, they are beginning to involve children in harmful industries	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation believes that these changes -will allow enterprises to conclude agreements on paid internships with students of professional educational organizations.- In fact, the goal of such innovations is the desire of the Russian government to solve the problem of labor shortages, primarily at military-industrial complex enterprises. Such a deficit arose in the context of the war against Ukraine, mobilization and attempts to increase the volume of production of weapons and other military products. During the first half of this year, Russian employers sent job invitations to more than 3 million people aged 14 to 18. Propaganda of the Russian Federation tries to justify the involvement of teenagers in hazardous work with examples from the Second World War and the thesis that -work even in hazardous industries is safer for children than being on the street.- The actions of the Russian authorities once again proved the readiness of the Kremlin not to reckon with its own people, in particular with the interests of children, for the sake of aggressive goals in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/v-rf-pochynayut-zaluchaty-do-praczi-na-shkidlyvyh-vyrobnycztvah-ditej/	2024-12-05T04:36:36-08:00

The forests burned, the mines stopped: the occupiers justify the failures in the Luhansk region	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysohor. However, the real consequences of the activities of Russian investors, who received mines in the region back in February, remain doubtful. Among the -results- of the work are mass layoffs, salary delays, and dismantling of equipment. Meanwhile, the occupying authorities of Luhansk region blame the destruction of 4.3 thousand hectares of forests around Stanytsia Luhanska solely on climatic conditions. The local forest farm claims that the cause of the fires was an increase in air temperature. Other factors - the lack of preventive measures, the shortage of extinguishing agents and rescuers - are not taken into account by the occupiers. As well as the failure of the disaster relief campaign. Residents of the affected settlements, whose houses burned down, were mostly forced to evacuate on their own. Rescue units of the occupiers did not arrive at the site, leaving people to fight the fire alone. The situation in the occupied Luhansk region demonstrates that real assistance to the population and solving environmental problems remain on the margins of the occupation administration's attention. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupying authorities of Luhansk region intensified forced mobilization, directing efforts to attract young people to the army of the Russian Federation. Workers of military commissariats carry out inspections in public places and at addresses, forcing conscripts to sign contracts, bypassing their military service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/lisy-zgorily-shahty-zupynylys-okupanty-vypravdovuyut-provaly-na-luganshhyni/	2024-12-05T00:11:20-08:00

Propagandists attack the computer game: what they invented this time	According to the propagandists, the game allegedly collects players' personal data, such as IP addresses, names, locations, even without their consent, passing this information to Ukrainian military commissariats. This fake was accompanied by the use of the Wired logo, which was supposed to give the information the appearance of authenticity. Propagandists also claim that the studio received funding from the Ukrainian government in exchange for such activities. About this writes Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. In fact, the GSC Game World studio raised significant funds ($800,000) for the support of the Armed Forces with the help of crowdfunding and donated them to the Ukrainian charity -Return Alive-. In response, Russia started a campaign against the game, including statements about its possible ban. This case is another example of the spread of disinformation aimed at discrediting Ukrainian achievements, particularly in the field of video games. It's also a continuation of a campaign similar to Netflix's previously documented fake trailer disinformation campaign dubbed -Matryoshka-. The main goal of such fakes is to undermine trust in Ukraine and its initiatives on the world stage.

Is there gender equality in the military: about the number of women in the army, body uniform and NA...	The ArmiyaInform correspondent asked Diana Kopanytsia, the head of the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, about all this and more. — Ms. Diana, can you provide statistics on women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine? How many in total are in the ranks of the Armed Forces as of the beginning of December 2024, of which there are military personnel? What are the statistics on women in genera and species (number of women)? — Over the past three years, the number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, compared to the data before the beginning of the large-scale invasion, has increased by more than 20%. As of October, the total number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was almost 69,000, of which more than 48,000 were military personnel. Instead, in January 2022, on the eve of a large-scale invasion, the total number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was more than 52,000. Currently, more than 5,500 women soldiers are on the front line. Among women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we now also have more than 10,000 officers, more than 13,000 sergeants, more than 23,000 soldiers and more than 1,500 cadets. The number of female servicemen in leadership positions is almost 7,000, and this figure shows a gradual trend towards growth. More than 1,000 servicewomen have been awarded state awards and more than 18,000 servicewomen have already received combatant status. As for the information in the breakdown of the number of women by military branch, the largest number of women is usually in the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as the largest branch of the military, where more than 18,000 women serve. The figures are somewhat lower in the Air Force and Medical Forces, where the number of women in each branch exceeds 6,000 servicemen. A fairly significant number of female military personnel is also observed in the Territorial Defense Forces, Support Forces and Logistics Forces, and the Naval Forces. After all, we also have hundreds of women successfully serving and performing combat missions in the Special Operations Forces and the Unmanned Systems Forces. — Ukrainian servicemen appeal attentionthat sexism in the army is a widespread phenomenon and lack of material support is one of its manifestations. In particular, it is about the form according to the size and shape of the body, anatomical body armor, underwear, etc. What coordinate system are we currently in to correct this situation? What is your administration doing for this? — Prior to the start of the large-scale invasion, security in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was predominantly male-oriented. In particular, at the level of regulatory documents of the Ministry of Defense, only a single uniform standard was approved - men's. The women's uniform was provided only for the formal one - a petticoat, a skirt and high-heeled shoes. There were also no requirements for personal protective equipment and other tactical items for female servicemen. This created problems for female military personnel, who were forced to wear men's uniforms that did not meet their physiological needs and anthropometric parameters. The situation with the material support of female servicemen in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is not ideal, but it has positive dynamics. Every day, with the joint efforts of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, we work to improve the material support of female servicemen, and at the moment we have the following results in this direction. In December 2023, for the first time, female servicemen received 50,000 sets of summer field suits, which are made taking into account female anthropometric parameters. Such uniform samples contain structural elements that allow female servicemen to feel comfortable while performing tasks in field conditions and permanent deployment points. Field trials of the women's demi-season uniform are currently underway, and the first samples of the winter uniform are ready for research testing. During 2023, women's underwear was also tested, which in 2024 was supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The supplied underwear samples cover a wide range of sizes, and also have a comfortable cut that does not restrict movement and is suitable for use in full equipment when performing combat tasks. Ultimately, in December 2023 and January 2024, the Ministry of Defense certified two bulletproof vests for female servicemen. The corresponding protective equipment has an outwardly curved armor plate, narrowed shoulders and an extended bottom, which helps to adjust the body armor to the anatomical features of a woman. — Where do you see a positive trend regarding gender policy in the Armed Forces during a large-scale war? Where is the critical situation, and where is the most needed point of effort? — A key achievement in ensuring gender equality in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is the removal of legal restrictions on the tenure of women in military positions. Since 2018, Ukraine has managed to significantly expand the range of combat positions for women: there are opportunities to be commanders of infantry units, female snipers, machine gunners, grenade launchers, scouts, and even drive armored vehicles or be a tank gunner. As of today, there are no regulatory obstacles to the occupation of positions by women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Women have the opportunity to serve in positions of their choosing, including typical combat specialties (recon, sniper, machine gunner, grenade launcher, gunner or UAV operator - ed.). And as practice shows, women in such positions are effective. At the same time, we periodically receive requests that, in fact, commanders do not admit female servicemen to combat positions, despite the high motivation of such women and the absence of objective obstacles to the performance of such tasks. We are working together with gender advisers and commanders of the types and separate branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to minimize such discrimination. — How do you cooperate with partners in the context of gender equality? What do they praise for, and what shortcomings do they point to? — Cooperation with international partners is one of the main areas of activity of the Office, as the direction of gender equality is an important direction. Most of the standards in the field of ensuring gender equality are borrowed from international documents in the field of human rights, as well as the practice of international courts. I also want to note the fruitful cooperation of the management with our Ukrainian partners and experts in the field of ensuring gender equality. Thus, during 2023-2024, more than 250 advisers on gender issues of the Ministry of Defense have already undergone educational training with the assistance of national and international public organizations. The Department also systematically and productively cooperates with the Government Commissioner for Gender Policy Kateryna Levchenko regarding the implementation of the -Women, peace, security- agenda. Thanks to the professional work of these organizations and experts, the advisers on gender issues had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with international approaches to the issues of preventing and combating manifestations of discrimination, gender-based and domestic violence, the foundations of international humanitarian law. - When we talk about -NATO's gender equality standards- - what exactly are we talking about? Explain in simple language. - Put simply, the NATO Gender Equality Standards are a set of rules, guidelines and principles that help ensure equal opportunities, in particular, for women and men in the armed forces of NATO member and partner countries. The goal of these standards is to create an environment where every service member, regardless of gender or gender identity, can fulfill their potential. At the same time, gender equality does not at all mean that we should allocate equal resources to meet the needs of women and men in the military, or fully equalize men and women in terms of rights and responsibilities during service. True gender equality involves the fair distribution of resources and the creation of equal conditions for people, taking into account their gender needs. After all, it is quite clear that the proper material support of a woman who performs combat tasks may require more resources than in the case of creating identical conditions for male servicemen. If we look at this issue from a practical perspective, then in this context we should also mention the initial requirements for the interoperability of Ukraine with NATO, which Ukraine must implement in the near future so that our Armed Forces can effectively interact with the military structures of the member countries of the Alliance and conduct joint military operations. Such requirements include, for example, the introduction of a clear system of gender advisers in the Ministry of Defense system, the removal of legal barriers that prevent the participation and representation of women in security and defense sector institutions, thematic training for gender advisers, the development of prevention policies and responding to sexual violence in the military, etc. — At the beginning of October 2024, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced that it plans to conduct a gender analysis and identify institutional obstacles to the implementation of equality programs in the ranks of the Armed Forces. As of the beginning of December - how are things going? - To begin with, it is worth finding out what gender analysis actually is. Simply put, it is the identification and assessment of barriers that exist in law or in practice that prevent equal rights and opportunities for service members because of their gender or gender identity. Gender analysis involves collecting and analyzing data (for example, the number of women and men in different units - ed.), identifying practices or rules that may create inequality (for example, women's limited access to certain military occupations), and ultimately, the preparation of recommendations or draft regulations designed to solve the identified problems. That is, effective gender analysis is a long and painstaking work that requires the processing of a large amount of diverse data. Another important area of ​​our work is the gender analysis of data on military positions held by women and the identification of barriers that prevent women from effectively performing their duties. Our strategic goal is to create all the necessary conditions for women to occupy leadership positions in the army, demonstrating their professional qualities and leadership skills. - What are you planning for 2025 in the context of gender policy in the Armed Forces? - One of the key priorities for the next year is the regulatory regulation of the status and powers of the gender advisor in the Ministry of Defense system in accordance with NATO standards and best practices. We will also continue the gender analysis of the current needs of female servicemen in the army and, based on its results, we will work on improving the physical and material support of female servicemen, in particular, in cooperation with international partners. And, as we have done this year, we will work hard to train our gender advisers so that they can get not only the legal status and powers written in the regulations, but also practical tools to carry out their daily activities, and in the future they can participate in joint operations involving NATO countries. A separate priority is for us to improve the language training of advisors on gender issues, because, as I mentioned earlier, gender issues are of a global nature and are based on international regulatory documents and NATO standards, most of which are written in English.

It was not necessary to go far: the Finnish army ordered new mobile 120-mm mortar systems from a loc...	As stated in the release, disclosed by the manufacturing company on the occasion of the conclusion of the relevant contract, the new mortar system integrates traditional heavy mortar weapons into a modular carriage, which is then mounted on a military truck, reports ArmyInform. The mortar complex, codified by the Finnish Army as the 120 KRH M3, was developed by Patria for the Finnish Land Forces. TREMOS is a modular carriage with a fire control system and recoil compensators. It can use any traditional 120mm mortar and mount on 4×4/6×6/8×8 trucks that have the appropriate container -locks- to secure the cargo. In case of machine malfunction, the weapon can be quickly transferred to another chassis. The module does not require any preparation before firing and can fire directly from the chassis of the vehicle, which greatly increases the mortar's mobility. -Patria has increased the mobility of heavy mortars in excellent cooperation with the Finnish Army and the Finnish Defense Forces Logistics Command, creating a new weapon system,- said Jussi Järvinen, executive vice president of Patria's Finnish division. He emphasized the significant tests carried out and pointed to Patria's legacy of innovative mortar systems, such as the famous AMOS (Advanced Mortar System) and NEMO (New Mortar) turrets, which are the basis of TREMOS development. The artillery system, by its characteristics, does not differ in any way from a similar trailed mortar, which would work traditionally on the ground. The main goal of the project is to increase the survivability of the mortar units of the Finnish ground forces due to better mobility in the conditions of war with an enemy that conducts counter-battery warfare and actively uses reconnaissance and strike drones. The Finnish military command is convinced that in the future heavy mortars will play an increasingly important role in the composition of ground troops as the main means of defeating from closed positions. Currently, the country's ground forces plan to gain experience in the use of such systems on ordered pre-production samples, and later make a decision on possible additional purchases of 120 KRH M3 complexes. -The goal is to start training conscripts with the new mortars during 2026,- said Colonel Ari Lehmuslehti of the Ground Forces Headquarters of the Finnish Armed Forces. However, the experts of the IKK defense website Defense Express (DE) were quite skeptical about this choice of soldiers' weapons countries of Suomi. According to their conclusions, it is a standard 120-mm mortar with manual loading, which was installed on the chassis of a truck, added a digitalized guidance system and a hydraulic recoil absorption mechanism. -The choice of this system may be surprising, because Patria has a much more advanced NEMO, which has a perfect fire control system, the possibility of a -fire raid-, when several mines that were fired from the same vehicle on different trajectories arrive at the same target, and also even the possibility of shooting on the move. It is also worth adding about the mechanization of charging and the fact that it is an armored chassis compared to TREMOS. At the same time, if the wheeled chassis can be replaced by a tracked one, for example, for the US Army, the NEMO mortar system was installed on the AMPV chassis,- noted the IKK DE. It should be recalled that our editors told in detail in one of his previous articles on the NEMO armored mortar system. By chance remind that in the order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine dated August 28, 2023 on acceptance for armament The 120-mm mortar M/41D, the developer and manufacturer of which is the Finnish company Patria, is indicated in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of regular samples of foreign weapons. In turn, the authors of the portal European Defense Review indicate that the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Finland concluded the above contract for the supply of a pre-production batch of TREMOS modular mortar systems, which are expected to be delivered to the troops in 2025. The number of ordered units is not named, but the contact amount is €4.7 million. Patria presented this new weapon system at the Future Mortar Systems conference in London on October 29, 2024	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/hodyty-daleko-ne-dovelosya-finska-armiya-zamovyla-novi-mobilni-120-mm-minometni-systemy-u-misczevogo-vyrobnyka/	2024-12-04T21:01:40-08:00
F-16 against Russian cruise missiles: how many air targets were shot down -Battle Falcons-	Since then, Russia has launched three massive combined air and missile strikes on Ukrainian territory — one in late August and two in November. F-16s participated in repelling these large-scale attacks as an air defense tool. Official information on the effectiveness of the use of F-16s against Russian cruise missiles and attack UAVs was collected and the number of enemy air targets shot down by Ukrainian -Battle Falcons- was calculated by ArmyInform. Full statistical information on Russian cruise missiles and attack drones shot down by the F-16 has not been officially made public. Therefore, approximate calculations of enemy targets destroyed by the -Battle Falcons- can be made only on the basis of separate official reports of the Air Force and the General Staff, as well as statements of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For the first time, F-16s demonstrated their high efficiency in Ukrainian skies during the repulse of a Russian air-missile strike on August 26, 2024. Then the enemy launched 127 missiles of various types and 109 Shahed-131/136 attack UAVs on the territory of Ukraine. It was shot down 201 air targets - 102 missiles and 99 attack UAVs. Unfortunately, the military pilot Oleksiy Mes with the call sign -Moonfish- died in an aerial battle. In the notification of his death, the Command of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine noted that during the repulsion of the Russian of a massive combined air and missile strike, the pilot destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV Instead, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported, that -during the aerial combat, the F-16 aircraft demonstrated their high efficiency, four enemy cruise missiles were shot down by airborne weapons.- So, on August 26, 2024, F-16 fighters shot down at least four cruise missiles and one Shahed. Russia carried out the next large-scale combined air and missile attack on the objects of the energy sector of Ukraine with various types of air, land and sea-based missiles and Shahed type UAVs at night on November 17, 2024. Then, as reported President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, F-16 pilots shot down about 10 enemy air targets. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief did not specify exactly which enemy aircraft the pilots of the Ukrainian -Fighting Falcons- destroyed, but their contribution was about 7% of all enemy air targets destroyed at that time. Finally, on the night of November 27-28, 2024, Russia struck Ukraine with 188 air strikes, including 91 missiles of various types and 97 Shahed attack UAVs. Among them the Defense Forces of Ukraine vorozhyh-bpla/->shot down 76 Kh-101/&#8221;Caliber- cruise missiles, 3 guided air missiles X-59/69 and 35 Shaheds. Seven enemy cruise missiles were destroyed by F-16 pilots. Volodymyr Zelenskyi reported this in an interview with the British broadcaster Sky News on November 29. -Seven cruise missiles were destroyed two nights ago. Seven missiles that flew over infrastructure, civilian infrastructure,- he said. Thus, for the second time, the President of Ukraine highly praised the effectiveness of F-16 fighter jets in repelling massive combined air and missile strikes from the Russian Federation. -How are the F-16s doing today? Very good. Great, for the most part,- he emphasized in an interview with Sky News. Also, Volodymyr Zelenskyi partially reported specific data on the effectiveness of the pilots of the -Fighting Falcons-, because it is not excluded that, in addition to cruise missiles, they also shot down several -Shakhed-. At the same time, the Head of State also noted the biggest problem of the F-16 as a Ukrainian air defense tool — their insufficient number. -We have very few F-16s,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview with Sky News, emphasizing the need for the Defense Forces of Ukraine both for more of these fighters and for other types of modern weapons. However, despite their small numbers, the Ukrainian -Battle Falcons- undoubtedly proved their high efficiency as an air defense vehicle, destroying about 20 enemy air attack vehicles. Increasing the number of F-16s in the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be able to significantly improve this statistic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/f-16-proty-rosijskyh-krylatyh-raket-skilky-povitryanyh-czilej-zbyly-bojovi-sokoly/	2024-12-04T20:47:16-08:00

Chief Sergeant Volodymyr of the 53rd Mechanized Brigade named after Prince Volodymyr Monomakh told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -There is an impression that the Russian leadership has a goal - to quickly wipe out their people, whom they send for meat. Then wait for some time, then type again and erase again. That is, they do not need to occupy some frontiers, but to put more of their people in,- said Volodymyr. As reported by ArmyInform, the 53rd brigade appealed to the servicemen who voluntarily left their units, with a call to return to service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/shturmuyut-tak-nache-hochut-shhob-shturmovyky-shvydshe-zakinchylysya-taktyka-rosiyan-na-toreczkomu-napryamku/	2024-12-04T11:58:55-08:00

If you watch his telegram channels, the enemy says that he will use copters on fiber optics for 15-20 kilometers. This is a not very pleasant situation, because it will complicate our logistics, because EW devices do not work on fiber-optic drones,- said Andriy Otchenash. He also noted the progress of the Russians in the development of Lancet strike drones, as well as aircraft-type reconnaissance UAVs. -They don't stand still, and that's also a minus. But thanks to the fact that our guys are also trying to find a countermeasure, for example, knocking down their wings with epfivishkas, this nullifies the successes of the Russians,- noted Andriy Otchenash. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 4th battalion -Freedom Force- of the National Guard brigade -Rubizh- -motolyg/->spectacularly repulsed the desperate attack of the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/okupanty-gotuyutsya-zapuskaty-optovolokonni-drony-na-15-20-kilometriv/	2024-12-04T11:44:38-08:00

If they find our firing positions, they launch the first -lancet-. Somewhere in 20-25 minutes, the second one flies, and then the counter-battery artillery, one or two long-range guns, or 2S19 or M-46 caliber 130 millimeters are connected,- said Ivan Dragan about the enemy's tactics.

The Ground Forces said that before the war, -Zhnets- was a tractor driver. He joined the army on mobilization. -It was clear to me that it was better to stop the enemies away from home.

-Maidan- in Georgia and an offensive operation in Syria: Putin is losing influence in the Caucasus a...	Meanwhile, on November 27, Syrian opposition forces launched a large-scale offensive against Bashar al-Assad's forces in Aleppo province in Syria. The Syrian rebels successfully took advantage of the vacuum created by the weakening of Hezbollah, pressure on Iran and Russia's focus on the war with Ukraine. It was the Russians who most helped Assad stay in power since the start of the country's civil war in 2011. Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, talks about the situation in Georgia and Syria in an exclusive comment to ArmyInform. -Anti-government protests in Georgia cannot but remind us of the events of the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine in 2013-2014. Pro-Russian oligarchic forces likely hold power through manipulation of the electoral process. The government announces the suspension of the European integration process. Thousands of protests erupt on the streets, which are accompanied by clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Like Yanukovych's regime at the beginning of the protests in Kyiv, the Georgian government exudes confidence that the rallies will lead to nothing. Despite national dissatisfaction with the announced results of the elections held on October 26, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze was not afraid to put the country's rapprochement with the EU on hold on November 28. The move was immediately hailed by Vladimir Putin as an example of -courage-. As soon as the protests broke out, the authorities began to frighten the nation with the so-called -Ukrainian scenario.- The most powerful Georgian oligarch, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who is credited with full control over the current government, has warned of the danger of a second Russian invasion in the event of an overthrow. Despite the mass of the protests, they lack a clear leader. President Salome Zurabishvili, who did not recognize the election results and publicly supported the protesters, is symbolically acting in this role. However, it is not directly coordinating the protestors' efforts. The difference here can be costly, because on the other side of the confrontation, the security forces have not yet shown any signs of disloyalty to the authorities. The lack of a general plan of action does not allow Georgians to organize resistance cells outside the borders of large cities. The government firmly controls the state media, which carries out anti-protest propaganda. Further developments will depend on the ability of various protest groups to unite around a common goal. Having a strong leader or group of leaders with uncompromising views can turn a national movement into a force that the authorities cannot handle. However, the probability of success of anti-government forces in Georgia is still much lower than a decade ago in Ukraine.- -The offensive of the Syrian opposition groups in the north-east of the country is already being compared with the attack of Hamas on Israel last October. Both operations were unexpected by their opponents and brought quick results to the attackers. However, in the case of Syria, the current government is on the verge of a real disaster. In fact, the province of Aleppo was surrendered without a fight, for which complex battles with the involvement of foreign contingents (primarily Russian and Iranian) were fought for years. As of December 4, fighting is underway for the city of Hama, an important logistics center in the center of the country that connects the north (Aleppo), the south (Damascus) and the Mediterranean coast, where the Russian naval contingent is located. Since the rapid advance of the opposition forces has stopped, the front line is relatively stabilized. They name several scenarios for the further development of events, but for Ukraine, the best option would be the intensification of hostilities for a long time, which would force Russia to transfer significant forces to Syria. Currently, we see that the Syrian government army is showing low combat effectiveness, so Assad will rely on the support of his partners. There are already two positive points for us: — the transfer of Russian aircraft to Syria. This can reduce the intensity of shelling of the Russian-Ukrainian front by air defense systems and air defense systems and the general activity of enemy aviation; — increasing costs for the war in Syria will divert Russian forces from the Ukrainian direction and may accelerate the economic collapse of Moscow. Further developments will depend on the presence of forces in the opposition. Obviously, their rapid offensive would not have been possible without the foreign support that Turkey, the United States and Europe could provide. If the supply rate is high (and not the same as for Ukraine), opposition forces will be able to gain a foothold and develop an offensive. The fate of the Russian fleet is the most interesting. Where will he go if the government loses the coast? If Spain does not allow through Gibraltar, there remains a passage through the Bosphorus, if the Turks allow it. Then an exciting trip to Novorossiysk awaits on the ship of the Russian Federation under the strikes of Ukrainian surface drones.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/majdan-u-gruziyi-ta-nastupalna-operacziya-v-syriyi-putin-vtrachaye-vplyv-na-kavkazi-ta-blyzkomu-shodi/	2024-12-04T01:57:24-08:00

According to Yevhen Alkhimov, the stormtroopers are supported by artillery and drones. Often before attacks, smoke is thrown onto the field so that under their cover the stormtroopers can advance as far as possible, but it does not always work out. -Our line is quite stable in the brigade. Sometimes it happens that one or two get to our trenches, but they are either destroyed there by the infantry, or the drones finish them off,- says Yevnen Alkhimov.

She spied on the defenders of Chernihiv under the guise of taxi rides: a minor was detained	About informs December 4 SBU. -In order to -bypass- the Ukrainian air defense, the agent had to identify and transmit to the aggressor the coordinates of the anti-aircraft missile systems and radar stations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that defend the border region. For the conspiracy of reconnaissance trips, the girl ordered a taxi in which she drove around the area and secretly recorded the objects she needed,- the SBU said. After such trips, the figure returned home, where she created an intelligence report for her Russian curator in the form of media files with -required- geolocations. The SBU military counterintelligence exposed a Russian agent, documented her crimes and arrested her -red handed- while she was photographing a defense facility. It was established that the person involved was in direct contact with a staff member of the Russian game, with whom she communicated through an anonymous chat in the messenger. During the searches, a mobile phone with evidence of intelligence and subversive activities for the benefit of the Russian Federation was seized from the detainee. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the accused about suspicion for h. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law).

Ukrainian missile program: why -Neptune- and -Palyanytsia- are becoming symbols of a new defense era	This was announced by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. According to him, April 13, 2022 was a historic day for Ukrainian defense. Just then, using the domestic missile complex -Neptun-, the Armed Forces of Ukraine sank the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation - the cruiser -Moscow-. -Today, when the war continues, missiles become not only a symbol of a technological breakthrough, but also a critically important tool for the defense of our state,- he noted. The Minister of Defense said that in modern warfare, missiles are a key element for striking the deep rear of the enemy. Despite the effectiveness of drones, their power is limited. In addition, the use of foreign missiles often requires coordination with partners. -This is where the strategic importance of own missiles is manifested. Ukrainian cruise and ballistic missiles will allow our Armed Forces to act independently, delivering pinpoint strikes on key enemy targets. This not only strengthens our defense, but also creates an effective deterrent mechanism for the aggressor,- he assured. Rustem Umyerov reminded that this year Ukraine has already produced the first 100 rockets a>. This became possible thanks to the work of the Ministry of Defense, which coordinates both public and private initiatives in missile development. -In particular, serial production of R-360 cruise missiles of the Neptune complex has been restored and scaled up. Modified missiles are now capable of hitting targets at a longer range. Private enterprises are also showing incredible results,- he said. For example, a new startup implemented the Palyanitsa missile project, which has already entered serial production thanks to the support of the Ministry of Defense. -This is a vivid example of how the state and the private sector come together to achieve a common goal,- said the head of the defense department. As Rustem Umyerov noted, Ukraine is not only developing its own potential, but also integrating into the European defense industry. This cooperation makes it possible to localize the production of foreign technologies in Ukraine. Among the key projects: According to the Minister of Defense, these initiatives provide access to advanced developments and create an opportunity for the modernization of the Ukrainian defense industry. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is actively accelerating structural changes, creating conditions for more effective management of the missile program. The new Department of Support for Missile Projects and ABM Means, as well as the Main Directorate for the Development of Missile Programs, will coordinate the efforts of the state and the private sector. -This program will allow not only to provide modern weapons for today's battles, but also to lay the foundation for the defense of the future. Ukrainian missiles will become a guarantor of the security of our state, capable of deterring any aggression,- Rustem Umyerov explained. He emphasized that the Ukrainian missile program is not only about war. It's about independence, self-sufficiency and technological breakthrough. -Our successes in rocketry prove that we are capable of creating game-changing weapons. These missiles will protect our land today. And they will ensure peace in the future. Because in the modern world, victory is not only a question of strength, but also a question of technology,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov held a meeting with Ukrainian manufacturers of missile weapons, at which plans for 2025, key areas of cooperation and development of the industry were discussed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/ukrayinska-raketna-programa-chomu-neptun-ta-palyanyczya-stayut-symvolamy-novoyi-oboronnoyi-ery/	2024-12-04T01:13:14-08:00

Changes to Russian legislation allow recruits to be sent to a combat zone immediately after being drafted, without the mandatory three-month term of military service. In Severodonetsk, meanwhile, the third winter continues without full-fledged centralized heating. The occupation authorities were unable to fulfill their promises regarding heat supply made in 2023-2024. Despite the launch of one boiler house, its capacity is not enough to heat multi-storey residential areas. In some neighborhoods, the coolant does not reach at all, and in areas with heating, the batteries remain barely warm. Frequent bursts of pipelines complicate the situation, and the number of emergency teams is insufficient for a quick response. As a result, many local residents remain in the cold without receiving adequate assistance. The freezing residents of Severodonetsk are forced to rely on their own strength in conditions where the occupation authorities continue to ignore their needs. As reported by ArmyInform, there is still no mobile phone in Lysychansk connection, which was disconnected by the Russian occupiers. Local residents are forced to travel to Novoaidar or Starobilsk to contact their relatives.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/syevyerodoneczk-zamerzaye-molod-vidpravlyayut-na-front-realiyi-okupovanoyi-luganshhyny/	2024-12-04T00:26:51-08:00

CAESAR doctors: how French self-propelled guns are repaired near the front line. ArmyInform report	Proximity to the front is not just words or geography, it is immediately felt: while we were waiting for the boys, we saw about ten flights from different directions. Only by the smoke rising, it was roughly understood whether it was an anti-tank missile or an anti-aircraft missile. White and focused is the KAB, and black and floating on the horizon is the MLRS. The guys have arrived and we are quickly going to the landing site, one of thousands in Donetsk region. Not the only place where you can try to hide in the steppe. Almost every landing is cut down, injured by enemy artillery or anti-aircraft guns, but saved for our defenders. We've arrived at the Burrow, the camouflaged hideout for the CAESAR ACS and its crew. The machine lives up to its name, the CAESAR is big and majestic. It would be a virtue on parade, but in the steppe it is not easy to hide it to protect it from enemy blows. Driver-mechanics Serhii and Ivan greet the cannon, they are old friends and brothers, and like real doctors, they take suitcases with tools and immediately start inspecting the car. Ivan disappears behind a huge wheel, everyone is anxiously waiting for a diagnosis: whether it will be possible to repair it on the spot, or whether it will have to be taken deeper to the rear, to the repair company. An anxious wait, finally Ivan says that today's problem is small: the tube on the handbrake is broken. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief. From time to time, Ivan's smiling face appears from under CAESAR, a headlamp shines, and Serhii hands out tools, gives advice and cheers everyone up with jokes. Then they conjure something together with the help of a gas burner and tweezers, Ivan disappears again. In 15-20 minutes, satisfied with their work, they say that the car is ready for battle. The calculation quickly gathers and goes on combat duty, leaving the smoke behind, and we behind them, only already in the direction of the contact line. Serhiy is a driver-mechanic. He is 50 years old, he is from the Chernihiv region, he was mobilized back in 2022, he got into the repair department of the brigade. I ask how CAESAR is in terms of repairs. Sergey smiles and shakes his head: - CAESAR seems not adapted to these weather conditions and operating conditions. It's one thing to ride the track, shoot and drive, then it's all good. And when bad weather starts, and you have to drive through fields, then everything becomes much more difficult. On the Zaporizhzhia direction, there was a difficult situation with the brake pipes, because when the mud freezes, it easily breaks the brake lines. We then went around the clock to repair. Because this is a very smart car, all on sensors, and if it shows that the brake fluid is leaking, then the car will not go anywhere. And so we moved twenty-four hours a day from car to car, repairing. Unfortunately, this is a weak point, because the car is like a military one, and the pipelines are made of plastic tubes that cannot withstand any loads. - Perhaps the French created this self-propelled gun for desert conditions? - Most likely, for European conditions. Because we faced the fact that in the summer, when there was no rain and the dust was terrible, then everything also went out of order. For example, the locks on the wedge could not be closed, because the guys try to lubricate everything, but dust gets stuck, and this does not allow the machine to work as it should. The responsibilities of the calculation include the maintenance of a combat vehicle. There are things they have to do after combat work, including cleaning the wedge. Because if it is dirty, the lock does not close, then they cannot shoot, the automation simply will not allow it. If the calculation is not yet very experienced, then it happens that they call - and we repair the car by phone, remotely. - Do you have time for departures? - We try. It happens when you work on one machine, you know that two more machines are waiting for you, then you choose something more difficult that the guys themselves will not be able to eliminate. There are still problems with the electronics. Unfortunately, the further, the more. Because even the powder boxes fall apart from so many shots. Can you imagine what happens to those wires and sensors in the car that they endure? - Do you have enough spare parts? - There are enough critical ones, they are supplied to us. We buy some small things ourselves, because there is no time to wait for elementary things, such as oil seals, gaskets. When there is already a serious breakdown, then the car goes to the factory, and there they already change the parts. —You started with the Soviet self-propelled guns. How different is CAESAR from them? - Very different, especially the -stuffing-. Because CAESAR is packed with electronics. In the Soviet self-propelled guns, everything is arranged more simply: it drives - while it drives, it shoots - while it can shoot. And there are many such nuances that some sensor has worked - and the car has stopped. Like today, when the usual brake pipe broke. It's good that the car was in the hole. And it happens that it is on the way to the fire line, much closer to the front line, and then it is an excellent target for FPV drones, which take apart the car very quickly. There was no such thing in the Zaporizhzhia direction, we did not hear about efpivishkas, except that -Lancets- flew in from time to time. Driver-mechanic Ivan from Vinnytsia region. He was mobilized a year and a half ago. Before mobilization, he worked in the State Emergency Service, was a dispatcher, then resigned, worked abroad, then in construction. — When I was mobilized, I did not have much experience in repairs. Well, except that he was fixing his car at home. Of course, I had no idea about CAESAR then. I saw him for the first time in the Zaporozhye direction and was a little scared at first. But nothing. Day by day sorted it out fine. — Did it take a lot of time? — It takes two or three weeks not to be afraid to approach her. During this time, you can more or less figure out what and why. I was lucky, because as soon as I arrived, I was assigned to work with an already experienced master. And I rode with him for two weeks. He showed me everything, told me everything. I quickly absorbed all this. Here the problem is that YouTube will not help. Almost everything is there, but about CAESAR - nothing. In general. Therefore, only my own experience and the experience of my peers. - Do you remember any such breakdown, which would be called the most difficult? - There were many such breakdowns, you can't remember everything at once. For example, when there was a CAESAR flight that was standing in a hole. It was necessary to quickly evacuate the car from there. We arrived, and everything was cut down. It was necessary to replace the damaged wheels, and try to do this if the nuts were cut by debris! Thank God that not all eight wheels had to be changed, but only on one side and only three. But they are big and heavy. Well, even though the crew helped, because my partner and I arrived, we both take turns. And there was another problem, that it was not land, but a real swamp. We try to lift the car with a jack, and the jack just sinks into the ground. You are constantly lifting, the jack is drowning, you are laying and laying, twisting further. It's as if there is such a thing as changing the wheels, and it took four hours. And it's not in the rear four hours, but where it can fly! And it is there for a very long time. - Do you like this job? - But how can you tell. Unfortunately, this is war. But yes, it's okay. Well, if you know your job, you like it. If there is an order to be transferred somewhere, I will not argue, but if I were given a choice, I would probably go to the CAESAR calculation, and I would try myself there. But that's also normal. Extreme is also enough.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/likari-caesar-yak-remontuyut-franczuzki-samohidky-nepodalik-peredovoyi-reportazh-armiyainform/	2024-12-03T21:07:05-08:00
Benefits for combatants: ArmyInform reminds you of the main ones	A significant part of them really works, although it requires a certain amount of time and nerves to design. And some of them have already lost their relevance. Most of the benefits are regulated by the Law of Ukraine -On the Status of War Veterans, Guarantees of Their Social Protection-. Participants in hostilities (hereinafter referred to as UBD) have the right to: The area of ​​housing for which a discount is granted, when calculating the heating fee, is 21 square meters. m of heating area for each person who permanently lives in a residential building and an additional 10.5 sq. m per family. And for families consisting only of disabled persons, a 75% discount is provided for the use of gas for home heating for double the size of the standard heating area (42 sq. m for each person who is entitled to a fee discount, and 21 square meters per family). By the way, you can get a benefit not only for own housing, but also for rented housing. An experimental project was also introduced, which has to make it easier for combatants and war veterans to receive benefits for paying for housing and communal services. As for travel, it is enough to show the ID card of a participant in hostilities for urban transport. For the most part, this works fine with public transport. But there are problems with FOPs. The fact is that local budgets should compensate them for the transportation of beneficiaries. But this does not always happen. So there are cases when the passage is refused. What to do in such a situation, read in our material /a>. To travel to other regions, for example, by train, you also need a ticket sheet, which is given together with the UBD certificate. The state provides combatants with targeted support for obtaining professional (vocational and technical), professional pre-higher and higher education in state and communal educational institutions: Benefits enjoyed by families of combatants: Of course, this is not a complete list of benefits regulated by the state. But we tried to talk about those that are currently relevant. We also note that having the right to a benefit is not always enough to use it. In many cases, it still needs to be properly completed. How to do this, read here. It is also important to understand that there are currently many initiatives by local authorities or private organizations regarding combatants. There are stores that provide discounts on goods and services for the presence of an ID or even a military ticket. Participants in hostilities in many regions can visit museums, exhibitions, zoos, theaters for free or at a significant discount. Therefore, if you are on vacation, you should always have your ID with you. Certain benefits are introduced by local authorities. For example, in Kyiv and some other regions, children of combatants are provided free meals in educational institutions. Or free parking . There are also material assistance programs for military personnel. Therefore, it is worth contacting the authorities at your place of residence and finding out what options are available to you.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/pilgy-dlya-uchasnykiv-bojovyh-dij-armiyainform-nagaduye-pro-osnovni/	2024-12-03T21:04:24-08:00
The hype surrounding Putin's Oreshnik: the Russian Federation invested considerable funds in the pro...	The direct threats of the bunker fuhrer are joined by Kremlin propagandists, who reproduce many different types of materials, trying to cause panic among Ukrainians. A large number of leaked materials indicate that Russia has invested heavily in a propaganda campaign aimed at promoting its -latest weapon-. However, their reliability raises serious doubts. First, according to the GUR of the IOU, on November 21, Russia struck the territory of Ukraine, using a ballistic missile from the -Kedr- missile complex. Ukrainian air defense can theoretically shoot down such missiles, as well as -Daggers-, about the impossibility of shooting down, which Putin said shortly before the large-scale invasion. Secondly, no confirmation of the -terrible- consequences of the missile strike on the Dnipro was ever provided. Those shots that spread on the network turned out to be an abandoned building in Chita, the St. Petersburg sports and concert complex and the Baikonur Cosmodrome. And the video of the alleged flight of the -Oreshnik- is a plume of exhaust gases from the Soyuz-2.1A space launch vehicle. In fact, Putin's -Oreshnik- turned out to be one big fake, and the hype surrounding it, which alarmed many Ukrainians, has the main purpose of cheering up the domestic Russian audience, frightened by the strikes of Western weapons on Russian military factories, airfields and oil depots. After all, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have repeatedly proven that Russian military facilities are not that protected.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/azhiotazh-navkolo-putinskogo-oryeshnika-rf-vklala-chymali-koshty-u-propagandystsku-kampaniyu/	2024-12-03T20:19:37-08:00
To shoot down a cruise missile or -Shahed- from MANPADS: all about the simulator on which anti-aircr...	At one time, ArmyInform already wrote about the training of anti-aircraft fighters. At that time, the simulator had various aerial targets in its library: airplanes and helicopters of various types. Now, in the conditions of the Russians' use of missiles and UAVs of various types, there is a need for its improvement. As project manager Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Mykola Salamakha said, they had to significantly change the software of the training complex: -The company now produces three types of MANPADS simulators. This is a simulator of the Igla portable anti-aircraft missile complex, the American Stinger MANPAD and the Polish-made Piorun MANPAD. When developing a new package of programs, we took into account that a cruise missile, as a rule, flies at an altitude of 50 to 150 m, unlike airplanes that fly at an altitude of 1-5 km. Therefore, these are completely different algorithms of combat work and a completely different way of training a shooter. The angular speed of the target, the boundaries of optical detection are different, in addition, the time from the detection of the missile to the possibility of launch is significantly reduced. Usually, an anti-aircraft gunner sees a missile at the last moment and needs to orientate himself very quickly and shoot, as a rule, in pursuit. With Shaheds, the situation is somewhat simpler, because its speed is about five to six times lower than the speed of a cruise missile, up to 150 km/h. Although now there are new models with a jet engine and a speed of up to 500 km/h. The simulator program provides simulation of targets at different speeds at different altitudes and in different terrain. According to Mykola Solomakha, in addition to single simulators for an anti-aircraft gunner, simulators for the separation of portable anti-aircraft missile systems have also been developed. In particular, tablets or remote controls are used to receive external information or targeting, as it happens in real life. As experience shows, a person who has undergone training in a training center on simulators and has about two or three hundred launches behind him is able to work properly in a real combat situation. The new simulators also take into account some specific moments of work, says the commander of the anti-aircraft unit, senior sergeant Andriy: -When the launch zone is displayed on the simulator, that is, from the moment when the target is visually detected and the shooter begins tracking the target, when he points the sight and when the head captures the target and begins to give a signal that it is possible to shoot, such a concept as shooting on the parameter should be taken into account. This means that it is possible to miss a hit due to the fact that the anti-aircraft missile will have to make very sharp maneuvers and the missile may simply break due to overload. On these simulators, this moment is taken into account. And there are simulators where there is no such launch zone and the instructor does not understand how correctly the shooter acted when performing the exercise.- After exercises, the simulator automatically assigns a grade. There are also separate explanations for the instructor, who must explain to the cadet how he acted, at what points he made mistakes and why, for example, the grade was lowered. To the question of how much time a person needs to prepare from scratch and to be ready to go on combat duty, Mykola Salamakha answered as follows: -In March, April, May 2022, right here in the workshop, people practiced for several hours during 3-5 classes . During each of them, the serviceman made 8-10 launches. And after a person makes more than 50 starts, sustainable skills already appear in him. According to Mykola, it is important to constantly maintain and improve the skills of anti-aircraft fighters. If there is a trainer in the team, training should take place at least once every two weeks, if more often, then it is even better. If there is no simulator, it is advisable to send the anti-aircraft gunner for retraining at training centers at least once every six months to restore the skills he acquired during training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/shhob-zbyty-krylatu-raketu-abo-shahed-z-pzrk-vse-pro-trenazher-na-yakomu-gotuyut-zenitnykiv/	2024-12-03T20:54:52-08:00
The caliber is smaller, the ammunition is smarter: Sweden is replenishing its BMP fleet	As informs the defense portal Army Recognition, the Scandinavian country plans to purchase about 50 such weapons to replace the CV9040C models. ArmyInform reports. Reporters said that this machine, which is part of the CV90 family developed by BAE Systems Hägglunds, was presented without the additional armor that will be included in the final version. Similar presentations were held in Denmark, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is worth reminding that CV90 BMPs are also well known in units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Batches of these armored vehicles were repeatedly transferred to the Ukrainian military as part of aid from the Western allies, as reported by reported by our editors. The new defense project, which received the international designation CV9035 and Stridsfordon 9035 in Sweden, combines the CV90 MkIII chassis with the turret from the Mk IV version. In May 2024, BAE Systems has signed a contract with the Swedish Defense Material Administration FMV for new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles, as well as associated integrated logistical support. -These new CV9035 MkIIICs will enhance the capabilities of the Swedish Army and provide aircrews with improved combat awareness, increased mobility, protection and lethality,- said Tommy Gustafsson-Rusk, managing director of BAE Systems Hägglunds, which develops and manufactures the CV90. One of the most significant changes in the new BMPs is the weapon system, where the 40mm Bofors gun used on previous models has been replaced by the 35mm Bushmaster gun. This gun upgrade is expected to maintain effectiveness through the use of programmable ammunition. In addition, the CV9035 Mk.IIIC is equipped with two missiles Rbs 58, a modified version of the anti-tank complex Akeron MP, which improves the ability of BMP to hit enemy armored vehicles, including tanks. When designing the CV9035 Mk.IIIC, BAE Systems gunsmiths focused on improved protection of the armored vehicle. It weighs approximately 35 tons, such a solid weight is explained precisely by the additional reservation. The BMP is equipped with sensors and countermeasures designed to detect and respond to threats such as anti-tank missiles, including a system that can launch a defensive projectile to intercept an enemy missile. The armored car also has rubber tracks to replace the steel tracks of older models, and a rear ramp instead of the traditional hatch. BMP retains the capacity of 6-7 military personnel in the landing cabin. Added a 360-degree video camera system to improve crew situational awareness. The version shown in Sweden matches the model the Netherlands is buying, but the Swedish version will have additional armor in the final configuration. Although the exact number of vehicles and the value of the contract have not been disclosed, experts estimate that about 50 units of the new BMPs, potentially valued at $360 million, have been ordered. Armament deliveries are expected between 2025 and 2027. The CV90 BMP family, which has been in service since the 1990s, includes a wide range of variants adapted to different operational needs. These vehicles were purchased in large numbers, more than 1,700 units, performing various functions such as air defense, reconnaissance and armor recovery. The CV90 platform continues to be operated by several countries, including Norway, Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Slovakia, which have adopted it for their respective defense forces. As Sweden continues to plan to modernize its fleet of infantry fighting vehicles, CV9035 Mk.IIICs are expected to play a key role in meeting the country's military needs in the coming years. New BMP CV9035 will replenish the fleet of armored vehicles of the Swedish army.

Cheap and angry - the enemy concentrated a large number of towed guns in the Pokrovsky direction	About this on the ArmyTV stream a soldier of the 14th regiment of the Forces of Unmanned Systems of the Armed Forces with the call sign -Aladdin- told about it. -We see a lot of trailed guns. There used to be fewer of them, but now there are very, very many. We can find 7-8 of them in one flight. We also see many trucks delivering BC. It's hard to tell which howitzers are because they're usually camouflaged,- Aladdin said. According to him, the enemy uses tactics of small groups on the front line. -We see a lot of motorcycles, we see buggies, they are different, the Russians put something on them and it is difficult to recognize them, we see a lot of -loaves- and we see enemy infantry. It is not always possible to work on them all day, because we have not very good weather in this direction,- Aladdin complained. As reported by ArmyInform, the 14th regiment of unmanned aviation complexes of the Forces of Unmanned Systems of the Armed Forces caused fire damage to the Buk-M2 air defense system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/deshevo-i-serdyto-vorog-zoseredyv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-velyku-kilkist-prychipnyh-garmat/	2024-12-03T12:02:27-08:00
-Natakha- destroy armor - ours repulsed the assault near Kurakhov thanks to unique drones	The video was published on December 3 on the unit's channel. The purpose of the assault was to encircle Ukrainian troops in that area. 4 tanks and 6 infantry fighting vehicles were going to Maksimivka. But they didn't make it because they were injured. A drone and a BREM tractor, which is used to evacuate damaged equipment, were found. -Part of the armor was burned by the Natakh drones, which we mentioned earlier, and the other part was destroyed by a Sternenko river cutter. So we thank the volunteers and those who donate for high-quality efpivishkas,- the unit commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Cats- unit of the reconnaissance platoon of the 130th battalion of the of territorial defense showed unique shots liquidation of the reconnaissance copter of the Russians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/nataha-nyshhyt-bronyu-shturm-pid-kurahovym-nashi-vidbyly-zavdyaky-unikalnym-dronam/	2024-12-03T11:44:55-08:00
They are waiting for new -meat- - after heavy losses, the enemy has reduced the number of attacks in...	Major Nadiya Zamryga, head of the communications department of the 14th mechanized brigade named after Prince Roman the Great, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -This indicates that in the zone of responsibility of the enemy brigade, very significant losses in manpower, equipment and weapons have been inflicted. And now the moment has come when the enemy quiets down for a while to replenish reserves. We have already observed this several times over the past six months,- said Nadiya Zamryga. According to her, there are no enemy soldiers in the brigade's zone of responsibility on the right bank of the Oskol River. As reported by ArmyInform, according to the 14th brigade, an enemy group formed in the Kupyansk direction from an extremely motley military contingent.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/chekayut-na-nove-myaso-pislya-velykyh-vtrat-vorog-v-razy-zmenshyv-kilkist-atak-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2024-12-03T11:29:10-08:00
Minus a platoon - in Kurshchyna, our marines crushed an enemy armored column	The video of combat work appeared on December 3 on the brigade's channel. A mechanized column of Russian paratroopers tried to break through to our positions, but already on the approach it was hit by Mykolaiv marines and their comrades-in-arms from friendly units. The attack on the Russians was made in the place where the concrete -dragon's teeth- barricades approached the road, so the enemy could not avoid this area and became easy prey.

Rustem Umyerov: The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health are launching a digital reform of...	This reported Defense Minister Rustem Umyerov. You no longer need to contact the TCC — you can have a medical examination in a convenient place. The reform envisages that the medical examination will be carried out by civilian doctors, who will enter conclusions directly into the Electronic Health Care System (ECHS). Information from the ESOZ will automatically be sent to the electronic system of the Ministry of Defense in a matter of minutes. At the same time, military medical commissions will receive only medical data without personal identification. This ensures objectivity and impartiality when making fitness for duty decisions. Each stage of the process will have a digital footprint - the conclusions of doctors and VLK will be recorded with the help of electronic signatures and stored in the -Oberig- register. This approach will make it possible to quickly check the work of medical institutions in case of doubts about the results of medical examinations. -We are working to ensure that public services for conscripts and our defenders are convenient, transparent and free of unnecessary bureaucracy. The reform of the VLK is another important step on this path,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine together with the Ministry of Health presented the reform project of military medical commissions (MMCs), designed to significantly change the outdated system. The reform will make it possible to divide the decisions of the military medical commission into two separate sets of data — medical and administrative. Some specialists will conduct a medical examination for VLC, and others will analyze the anonymized results of these medical examinations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/rustem-umyerov-minoborony-ta-moz-zapuskayut-czyfrovu-reformu-vlk/	2024-12-03T09:31:01-08:00

Coal only on Christmas trees: the mines of Luhansk Region are a thing of the past	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In the area of ​​the former -GTV- plant, there are still places where you can catch a signal. However, local residents spread this information cautiously, fearing a repeat of the situation in Siverskodonetsk. There, the occupiers discovered similar -islands of communication- and deprived people of the opportunity to use them. Meanwhile, in Luhansk, the Russian invaders installed Christmas trees that symbolize the administrative-territorial units of the so-called LNR. They are decorated, trying to take into account the -unique features- of each municipality. The Christmas tree from Sokologhirsk (formerly Pervomaisk) was decorated with toys in the form of coal - a symbol of the coal industry, which was once the pride of the city. However, during the years of occupation, all mines in the region were closed, as confirmed even by representatives of the occupation administration. Coal remained only in the form of decorative ornaments. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupation authorities of the so-called LNR are trying to control inflation by putting pressure on entrepreneurs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/vugillya-tilky-na-yalynkah-shahty-luganshhyny-zalyshylysya-v-mynulomu/	2024-12-03T00:22:12-08:00

40 thousand mobilized Russians, the 125th caliber and the Kursk bridgehead: an expert on the unprece...	Why is this happening now? But will the Russians increase the mobilization norms in the near future? Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions: -Recently, there have been huge losses of Russians at the front: more than 1,700 people per day. And this indicator is not decreasing. A logical question arises: why are the Russians so reluctant to count on losses right now? And they really do not count with them. And the month of November is an indicator that the losses are truly incredible. An absolute record was set - more than 45,000 people were confirmed killed and wounded. These are unprecedented losses since World War II. Not only the Russian Federation as such, but in general in the universal sense of the word. Why so? It all boils down to big geopolitics. On January 20, President Trump takes office. And very, very much will depend on his position: what will be our battle. And by this time, Putin has two tasks, as he understands them: to knock us out of the Kursk region. This is moment one. And the second point is to end the full-fledged occupation of Donetsk region. Will they be able to make it happen? In my opinion, they will not be able to. In order for them to realize this task, it is necessary to increase the monthly mobilization rates to 50 thousand people. So far, there is no reliable information that they worked that way. According to my own calculations, they mobilize 40-42 thousand per month. We have the so-called anticipatory extermination, when the enemy's losses are greater than he recruits. In a general sense, do the Russians have mobilization potential? Yes, there is. Unfortunately, it is quite large. They have 2 to 3 million trained men who know how to use a Kalashnikov assault rifle. And if we also take into account the unprepared component, then this number can be safely multiplied by two. In their opinion, learning how to use a Kalashnikov assault rifle takes about five to six days. And for the Russians, the MPL-50, what we call a minesweeper, is also a weapon. There is no mention of the equipment with which they could provide their personnel. The maximum they can do is 25 T-90 tanks per month. So far, there are between 3,000 and 6,000 different armored vehicles in warehouses, along with PT-76. What is PT-76? This is such a small irony: this is the predecessor of the BMP-1. If necessary, they will reach them. And there is an already confirmed, personally verified option, when, say, in the same Kurshchyna, tanks go into battle with almost no ammunition, they are used as a kind of armored vehicle that drops personnel. So, even with a 125 mm shell, they already had a problem. But in no way should the opponent be underestimated. They will also now count all their losses for the month of November. And my personal version is that closer to the New Year, considering that they have a holiday mentality, as they say, Putin may dare to raise the mobilization rates. Our task is to hold both the Kursk bridgehead and Donetsk region before the cycle of dry weather.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/40-tysyach-mobilizovanyh-rosiyan-125-j-kalibr-ta-kurskyj-placzdarm-ekspert-pro-bezpreczedentni-vtraty-rf-u-lystopadi/	2024-12-02T22:26:06-08:00

Why the Russians are afraid of our drones: a DSH combatant told where the enemy assault groups disap...	But with the beginning of the invasion chose the way of the paratrooper. Now the lieutenant colonel is the commander of one of the battalions of the 46th separate air mobile brigade. His combat career in the role of a combatant began in the Zaporizhzhia region. It was near Robotyny and Verbovoy. All forest strips located between these settlements were liberated by the 46th brigade. Serhiy recalls that at that time the latest developments were actively used in the battles, and this gave results: -It was then, during the battles in the Zaporizhzhia region, that we actively began to develop UAVs. FPV drones and -drops- were used. At that time, the enemy had not yet caught up with us. The guys were all prepared, intelligent. There were moments when we carried out assault actions without a single loss. No casualties or injuries.- After the battles in Zaporozhye region, the paratroopers were transferred to Donetsk region. The unit got to the outskirts of Maryanka. At that time, the settlement was almost entirely occupied. Only scraps of Ukrainian land remained, where the paratroopers were forced to hold the ruins. And they suffered losses there. -It was decided to prepare a defense line. Everyone who could was sent to equip the fortifications. This is a technical support platoon, a material support platoon, even signalmen were equipping positions at that time. They worked by hand - with shovels, peels. Logs and other materials that were needed were transported at a risk. The task was completed. They built a line, which was then held for more than six months. But, despite their heroism and all their skills, the situation on the front line was such that they were forced to retreat to a certain distance and occupy a more advantageous line,- says the serviceman. Before that, paratroopers did not take part in defensive operations. So I had to study. And learn fast. -We understood how to work in defense, what to do. Fortifications were constantly being built to move personnel to preserve life. Dugouts were dug at a certain distance so that a serviceman could move from shelter to shelter when artillery fire was being fired at him,- recalls Serhiy. In the unit, the UAV group was constantly developing. Both FPVers and Mavic pilots with resets. -There were times when we heard from interceptions that the enemy complained about them very much. And the prisoners also complained: -your drones with skids stole us.- That is, the Russians are very afraid of our drones. But, as they say, enemies do not sleep either. They also began to actively use FPV drones, drops from Mavics, and now with the enemy, you can say, we are on the same level.- However, the enemy has an advantage in the number of personnel. And they do not protect their soldiers, constantly throwing them into crazy assaults. -When we took prisoners, they often complained that their assault groups, which left on armored vehicles, simply disappeared. They reached a certain area and disappeared. Well, they didn't know the truth that we simply destroyed them after they landed,- says Serhiy. Sometimes the paratroopers had to secretly take out the prisoners so that they would not be destroyed by their comrades. In particular, after artillery and drones destroyed the main mass of enemy attack aircraft, paratroopers went out in small groups to clear the area and, if possible, take prisoners. -But the enemy does not spare his own. Even when ours were already leading prisoners, and the Russians saw it, they themselves destroyed these people so that we could not interrogate them. So, people are indifferent to Russians. Therefore, during the assaults carried out by the paratroopers, the prisoners were already taken out secretly, trying to save their lives,- recalls Serhiy. To the question of what he is proud of in his battalion, Serhiy answered without hesitation: -The DSHV is the highlight of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. But I will say that in our country each battalion works in its own way. I am proud of the fact that we still have many of those servicemen who arrived on February 24, 2022. We are all mobilized, few are full-time. We became friends, became one. Basically, we are one fighting family. We have many experienced soldiers, sergeants. If we saw that a sergeant was being followed by soldiers, we suggested that he become an officer. After all, servicemen always follow those officers who were soldiers yesterday.- And we have many such officers now.

According to the company, the US military is currently using previous versions of the Black Hornet system (-Чорный шерный- in Ukrainian), which have been supplied to the US Army since 2018. And the total amount of investment in the SBS project by 2030 is expected to exceed $250 million. By the way, it is worth reminding that miniature drones from Teledyne FLIR are well known in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. As our agency reported with reference to -_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://www-regjeringen-no.translate.goog/en/aktuelt/droner/id2924942/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=uk&amp;_x_tr_hl=uk&amp;_x_tr_pto=op-> statement Ministry of Defense The Kingdom of Norway, in August 2022, Norway and Great Britain decided to purchase a batch of Black Hornet microdrones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the amount of more than $9 million. Today's latest variant of this nanodrone builds on the previous version and retains the concept of -infantry tool for reconnaissance and surveillance beyond direct line of sight-, but at the same time has received a better payload compared to the Black Hornet 3, tell the authors of the EDR Magazine site. The drone received an updated 12-megapixel camera with day, night and thermal video and photo channels. With a weight of only 70 grams, the Black Hornet 4 can stay in the air for more than 30 minutes, and the range of the UAV is more than 2 kilometers. The Nanodrone can fly confidently in winds up to 25 knots. Flight performance has been improved with new obstacle avoidance capabilities and an improved battery. Compared to small quadcopters, the single-rotor Black Hornet 4 has extremely low visual and acoustic visibility, allowing it to detect threats day and night without being detected. According to information of the experts of the IKK Defense Express portal, in order to implement the idea of ​​improving the capabilities of the drone into a concept, the developers had to slightly increase its dimensions. Yes, the weight has almost doubled, from 33 grams to about 70 grams. Rotor diameter - from 123 mm to 190 mm, length - from 168 mm to 255 mm. That is, the drone still remains quite small, and the entire unmanned aircraft complex, which weighs 1.3 kg, can still be carried in a bag on a body armor. The drone is able to launch in less than 20 seconds, well suited for missions in the absence of GPS. The Black Hornet 4 can be used to rapidly detect targets outside of line of sight and assess fire damage results in real time. -Black Hornet 4 takes the features and capabilities that made the Black Hornet 3 world-renowned to the next level,- said Jifen Lei, executive vice president and general manager of Teledyne FLIR Defense. In total, FLIR Defense delivered more than 20,000 various modifications of Black Hornet PRS to military and security services in more than 40 countries of the world. The Black Hornet 4 is designed and manufactured by Teledyne FLIR Defense in Norway. -We have worked closely with customers and end users to make this system even more valuable to reservists who need situational awareness or are involved in covert operations where accurate and operational information is critical. Black Hornet 4 is a promising nano-drone technology,- Lei added. It is also emphasized that the basis for artificial intelligence systems has been laid in the drone - thanks to this, the drone can be improved so that it is even easier for the military to operate it on the battlefield.

-5 FPVs fell, none hit the -beha--. How does the EW-laboratory of the DSHV work near the front line	Actually, this industry is developing very quickly, and the 77th separate airmobile Naddnipryan brigade even managed to create its own EW laboratory near the front - in order to quickly produce and repair equipment for its fighters on the front line. Correspondent ArmyInform visited such a secret laboratory and asked paratroopers about what electronic devices can be made in such difficult conditions, where to get spare parts and how to keep up with know-how on the battlefield. Roman, a soldier of the 77th OAeMBr, conducts a tour of the laboratory. He emphasizes that almost all tools here are made from scratch, cases and other things are printed, and elements and spare parts are ordered from online stores. - We even bend the antennas ourselves. Here we manufacture cases on which modules and power supplies are mounted. We develop 3D models ourselves. That is, the module from scratch to the finished product is ours, he says in the room with 3D printers. Next, we get to the room where the guys solder everything. Here they mainly work with antennas. The next room is where the resource gathering takes place. This laboratory collects and repairs EW from drops and FPVs, as well as trench EW. 3D printers work 24 hours a day, says a fighter with the nickname -Fitter-. His task, in addition to bending and soldering antennas, is to monitor printing. Every day at two o'clock in the morning, he must come and replace the consumables, check whether the temperature regime in the printing house is maintained. A fighter with the call sign -Zirka- says that in the laboratory the guys not only manufacture, but also test the means: - We then carry them to the position on our shoulders. There we already receive a command when to turn on and in which direction. Sometimes you have to watch, let your drone pass. Military serviceman Serhii, who was an electrician in civilian life, adds that this laboratory has established feedback with his colleagues in the brigade - they praise the tools for their efficiency. — There was feedback, the guys called the commander, they said that the REB was awesome - there were five FPVs, they fell, all from the side, none of them hit the -beha- - that's good feedback, - recalls Roman. One of the most interesting developments of 77 OAeMBr are backpacks for assault groups. Backpacks and containers are selected by the guys themselves, spare parts are printed and ordered online. There are also anti-drop and anti-FPV backpacks. With a battery, it can weigh somewhere between 5-6 kg. - He is taken with them to the position. It has a control panel, there you can see the battery charge. There is also a seven-meter-long cable inside - that is, you can pull out, install and remotely control the backpack device, Roman explains. Serhiy talks in more detail about the technical side of the developments. He says that a year ago it was possible to close questions on one range, and now it is necessary to do four, or even five. It can be seen from the equipment that drives here near the front line, there are no longer two, but three or four -checkers- on the roof, he adds, emphasizing that before a combat mission, all equipment is tested together with pilots at different frequencies. Serhii says that the proximity to the front is connected with the need to promptly respond to the requests of fellow soldiers: - It happens that the guys at the front have a broken electronic device. Accordingly, it is delivered to us promptly, and we repair it in a day. And if it was a private manufacturer, which usually has production somewhere in the rear, then one can only guess how long it would take to repair or service the equipment. The financial aspect is also important, Serhii explains, because in the laboratory the guys can make a tool for 100 thousand hryvnias, the analogue of which on the market will cost 350-400 thousand. The fighter notes that both we and the enemy are very dependent on details from China. Although there are rumors that all these spare parts can be made here, but it will be many times more expensive. Now the guys use only Ukrainian aluminum radiators and plastic for 3D printing. The boys say that they have been fighting here for the second year. We immediately ask how to get to them. Serhii says that almost everyone here expressed their desire to serve. And everyone has the basic skills to work with EW. — In civilian life, I had an education in the field of radio engineering. They looked at the military ID and sent it here. People who understand what radio engineering is, know how to solder at least, - he explains. Serhiy also recommends going to the REB to those who know physics; understands what waves are, what they are. Motivation and a willingness to constantly learn are also important, because the approaches that were relevant a year ago may no longer work today. The -Zirka- fighter says that in civilian life he worked as a machinist at the Southern Mining and Processing Plant in Kryvyi Rih. At first I had protection against mobilization, but when it ended, I went to the TCC without hesitation. We talked about the fact that, in the eyes of civilian DSHVs, these are primarily assault units, and here we see a laboratory where the guys only do soldering, assembly and repair. First, you need to understand that different specialties are needed in the army. And secondly, the guys from the laboratory have either returned from combat missions after being wounded, or are carrying EW on their own. -Zirka- remembers how he received the task to go to the positions and help his comrades with the REB. But after he and his group went there, the Russians went on the offensive, and mines and drones began to fly at the boys. — There were four of us, we had machine guns, grenades and -flies- with us. there were five Russians, one was with the -baker-. They entered the landing stage, there was contact, we shot one of them three times, - says the fighter. Then the DSHV mortar connected, then the Russians were chased away. But towards the end, they sent a drone with a drop that landed right next to the boys' dugout. Then -Zirka- suffered a concussion. It took two days to leave, and the boys left another day later. - This is to understand that the REB platoon are the same fighters as all other paratroopers, and you should always be ready to take on a fight. Everyone who was injured there has already been treated, with the boys in contact, he adds. In parting, the 34-year-old soldier adds that his values ​​in life have changed significantly during his service: he began to appreciate the time he spends with his family, especially with his son, much more. — I appreciate every phone conversation, message. Even between the lines you can read how they care about me, are proud. They also have their own problems, so I call, reassure and say that everything is fine, everything will be fine, this is life. And no matter what, it continues. Under any circumstances, he summarizes.

-When buying one shoe, a 50% discount-: the enemy invented a fake about veterans of the war in Ukrai...	This is supposedly a promotional offer in one of the Ukrainian clothing stores. The first thing that comes to mind is that it was necessary to come up with such a thing! In the head of a healthy person, such a cynical and mocking idea - to offer a person who has lost a limb, a discount on one shoe - simply cannot be born. Only the -Russian measure- is capable of so deforming the consciousness of homo sapiens to produce such content. The primary source of the spread of this fake is the video of the Russian propagandist Armen Gasparian. The ad itself is a screenshot from it. The video shows that information about the promotion is posted in the fitting room. However, neither the sign nor the frame shows the name of this store, despite the fact that the name of the store is usually duplicated on the promotion announcement. In addition, fakers used the word -disabled- in the ad, although the correct word would be -person with disabilities.- This is a traditional problem with education and tolerance for them. Most likely, the Russians themselves printed such an ad in order to shoot this video and pass it off as a real promotion in a supposedly Ukrainian store. The purpose of this fake is to sow discord in Ukrainian society by openly mocking veterans. In fact, the level of respect for the military and war veterans on the part of society is extremely high. That is why such fakes cause hatred only for Russians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/pry-kupivli-odnogo-cherevyka-znyzhka-50-vorog-vygadav-fejk-pro-veteraniv-vijny-v-ukrayini/	2024-12-02T20:12:19-08:00

Strengthening air defense and joint production of weapons: the results of the meeting of the leaders...	The statement was made public on the evening of December 2. -We discussed our joint opportunities for the coming weeks and months — bilateral work and with other partners, possible meetings and agreements. We must realize all the possibilities of strengthening Ukraine both at the front and in diplomacy. This also applies to the level of support for Ukraine,- the President said. He emphasized that it is fundamental for Ukraine that Germany, as the leader of support, does not reduce it next year, and in particular financial support. -This will be the right signal for all partners. We must also continue the pressure of sanctions on Russia for the war — we cannot let Putin adapt to the pressure. And, of course, we must remember that the key to our common security on the continent is geopolitical certainty — something that most European nations already have, but Ukraine has not yet secured. Geopolitical determination involves the solution of two issues for each country in Europe — about the EU and NATO,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. According to him, the Patriot, IRIS-T, and Gepard anti-aircraft guns provided by Germany have already saved tens of thousands of people and hundreds of infrastructure facilities. Separately, the President thanked for the new military package worth 650 million euros and a clear deadline for delivery - this month.

Honored with 3 drones - in Kurshchyna they hit a very nimble occupier	The video of the defeat was released on December 2 on the unit's channel. The enemy soldier first tried to hit our drone by throwing his machine gun. But he didn't hit. After that, the Russian resorted to the tactics of sharp maneuvers, constantly changing the direction of movement and getting out of the way of our drone. The pursuit continued, when a bomber came to the aid of our FPV pilot, who hit the enemy with a skid and immobilized him. Next, kamikaze drones took up the task, two of which were used, because the pilots wanted to make sure that this time the Russian would definitely not escape. -Unbelievable chase in the field: the Russian occupier ran away from the FPV drone for a long time, but in vain...

Almost 4,000 servicemen are already worried about returning to service from the SZCH	This was announced on December 2 by the Special Prosecutor's Office in the Defense Sector of the Central Region. Military servicemen who for the first time voluntarily left military units or places of service or committed desertion, and who will voluntarily arrive at military units no later than January 1, 2025 and express their readiness to continue military service, will have their military service extended, the validity of the contract, and the payment of financial support will be renewed accordingly and implementation of food and other types of provision, other benefits and social guarantees established by the legislation of Ukraine were also renewed. Servicemen or their commanders must inform the relevant specialized prosecutors' offices in the field of defense, the territorial offices of the State Bureau of Investigation, the National Police or the territorial offices of the Military Law and Order Service of their intention to return to military units for further military service. The presence of criminal proceedings for the act of voluntarily leaving a military unit or place of service or desertion is not a reason for refusing to continue military service and the validity of the contract. In the future, the procedure of release from criminal responsibility will be applied to such servicemen who have embarked on the path of correction, which became possible after the adoption of Law of Ukraine No. 3902-IX -On Amendments to the Criminal Code of Ukraine, the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine and other laws of Ukraine regarding the improvement of criminal liability for crimes against the established order of military service during martial law-, which entered into force on September 7 2024 year. It should be noted that for the commission of crimes provided for in Art. 407 (-Unwillingly leaving a military unit or place of service-) and 408 (-Desertion-), committed under martial law, the law provides for a punishment of at least 5 years of imprisonment. Thus, with regard to military personnel who will not return to the military units by January 1, 2025, the pre-trial investigation will be carried out in the general manner.

The GUR reported how many North Korean missiles Russia used to strike Ukraine	About this in an interview with -Radio Svoboda- Andriy Chernyak, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, said. -Their accuracy, in principle, is not very high. We understand that the technologies by which they were manufactured are outdated,- said Andriy Chernyak. At the same time, he noted that these missiles still pose a danger, because there is no difference between being killed by a 24-year-old missile and a missile that was manufactured using old technologies. -These missiles, these supplies also pose a very serious danger to the industry of Ukraine, to the population of Ukraine, to absolutely everyone,- added the representative of the GUR. Andriy Chernyak also reported that the Russian army constantly receives artillery ammunition from the DPRK. -If we talk about artillery ammunition, it's millions. We constantly see the movement of goods and containers. We do not rule out that there may be artillery munitions that North Korea manufactures, which are already in its warehouses. Yes, this is also a huge danger for Ukraine, because in addition to the fact that Russia has its military-industrial complex, it has its own capacities, it also uses the ammunition that comes from North Korea,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, more than 100 artillery systems and 100 short-range ballistic missiles of the KN-23/24 type moved for now from North Korea to the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/u-gur-povidomyly-skilky-pivnichnokorejskyh-raket-zastosuvala-rosiya-dlya-udariv-po-ukrayini/	2024-12-02T01:44:58-08:00
Soft diplomacy: the National Presidential Orchestra presented the project -Symphony Rock Resonance-	—⁠The National Presidential Orchestra is a world-renowned professional ensemble that is loved and respected in the music community. How are you greeted abroad today, during the great war? — Our creative, professional activity consists in the preservation and development of national cultural traditions, the promotion of the heritage of world musical culture, and the disclosure of Ukraine's cultural identity on the international arena. We are an integral part of the presentation, image, cultural and diplomatic symbols of the state and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Therefore, during performances both in Ukraine and abroad, we are, first of all, carriers of our cultural and intellectual identity, we are cultural ambassadors who speak in the language of art. Any audience can sense sincerity very well, and when you are sincere in your work, you will receive a warm welcome. And we are sincere in our creativity. —In response to Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, in 2022 your team initiated the -Fight for Ukraine- art project, which had great success and a powerful symbolic meaning. How is the repertoire selected today? - We have an unlimited genre and stylistic spectrum of different music. We have the potential to perform diametrically opposed concert programs. So, performing academic music today, tomorrow, or even in parallel and at the same time, we are preparing for the performance of modern popular compositions with a different composition. Of course, this is a great physical and psychological burden on orchestra artists, but our team can handle it. Selection of the repertoire is a complex, intellectual, creative process. It is difficult for people who are not immersed in our artistic world to understand all the complexity of creating a concert program, all that is connected with the performance, combination, dramatic arrangement of this or that piece of music in a concert. It's funny when some people think that we just take some music, put a sequence number next to each piece - and that's it! But in fact it is psychology, history, and emotion. Sometimes, while performing music, we only hint, without speaking directly, and the listener already discovers the path for himself, and sometimes we take the listener by the hand and lead him along the path of music, showing this path. That's why we always analyze what we've done, where and for which audience. And it's actually always very responsible, a kind of daily test, because music is the universe, it's a powerful tool that has an incredible ability to revive, heal, and sometimes vice versa. The war brought suffering and grief to our country and to every family. Does it affect the repertoire? Undeniably. But what is more important is not whether the war affected the repertoire itself, it is important how we all perceive, rethink, reevaluate, relive the sound of certain musical works. —​​Military servicemen who attended -Symphony Rock Resonance- were sincerely delighted with what they saw and heard. How do you help the Armed Forces of Ukraine? - The National Presidential Orchestra functions within the structure of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. So, in the very essence, our activity takes place in the interests of the IOU and the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces. And, as is well known, in any field, and in the field of intellectual work and leisure, the balance between the direct and indirect form of beneficial effect of certain activities and the achievement of results is critically important. It's like an asterisk challenge&#8230; Our creativity is soft diplomacy, effectively used by our partners. It is taking into account modern trends and the experience of foreign partners that we build our philosophy of activity. In fact, I see so many people everywhere who loudly and loudly measure who helps the Armed Forces, and who is more, and who is better&#8230; We are working. The best help is to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and everything else is work, tacit homework, which everyone should do as professionally, qualitatively and efficiently as possible, well, and without too much PR.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/dyplomatiya-m%ca%bcyakoyi-diyi-naczionalnyj-prezydentskyj-orkestr-prezentuvav-proyekt-symphony-rock-resonance/	2024-12-02T01:35:45-08:00

Inflated prices and fraudulent schemes: what the enemy invents to demotivate the Ukrainian military	However, Russian propaganda would like everything to be exactly the opposite. That is why in the pro-Russian segment of the networks from time to time they spread information about inflated prices for the military, or about additional taxes, or generally about fraudulent schemes. Yes, the other day, enemy scoundrels spread information that one of the Ukrainian cafes allegedly has a menu with different prices for civilians and military. These menus are allegedly labeled -standard- and -military- respectively, with similar dishes and inflated prices for the latter category. Propagandists add a corresponding photo as -proof- of this. Usually, similar cases of discrimination by the Ukrainian military gain publicity in the media and social networks. However, no Ukrainian publications reported on this incident, the -news- is spread only by Russian propaganda resources. Neither the name of the establishment, which allegedly has a similar menu, nor its address is also known. Most likely, this is just an edited photo or a production. Previously, Russian propagandists distributed a fake photo - an announcement that a 20% tax for TCC employees was in effect in one of the Ukrainian grocery stores. And they also tried to cheat the military for money, offering them an alleged 30% discount for a driver's license without passing exams. With such fakes, Russian propagandists are trying to demotivate the Ukrainian military, disrupt mobilization in Ukraine and sow discord in Ukrainian society.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/zavyshheni-cziny-ta-shahrajski-shemy-shho-vygaduye-vorog-aby-demotyvuvaty-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh/	2024-12-01T23:57:58-08:00

There will be no total immersion in darkness: an expert on mass air strikes of the Russian Federatio...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told why there have been more mass attacks and what to expect in our country in winter: -Such a number of Shaheds: is it a lot or a little (November 28 of this year - ed.)? In fact, it is very, very much. That is, the Russians managed to raise the level of their composition. But not production. The only thing they produce is the body itself. Two-stroke petrol engine is either Iranian or Chinese. Microelectronics - from other countries. But there is a nuance. Despite the fact that these are really very high figures (the number of launched enemy UAVs - ed.), the rate of shooting down or location deviation is in the range of 90 to 98%, and sometimes 100%. This is a very serious indicator of the performance of our air defenses. Regarding indicators of locational deviation. This means that we already have such a level of radio-electronic warfare that allows -shaheda- not just to plant, but even to deploy back to Russia and Belarus. Will the Russians continue this work? One hundred percent, will not stop. But there is also an important point here: because there are again huge fears that, say, 200 Kh-101 missiles Russia has made. And it is supposedly something incredibly huge. Let me remind you that the largest volley they launched in August was 127 rockets simultaneously. And they still haven't repeated it. And they produce no more than 150-170 rockets per month. Do they have the task of destroying our energy infrastructure? THERE ARE. But again, we are a big country in terms of electricity generation, specifically in the nuclear aspect. And our network has been closed to the European network for at least two years. Despite the fact that there will be difficulties with turning off the light, I am 100% sure that there will be no total immersion in darkness. And our air defense forces will continue to demonstrate such high performance.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/absolyutnogo-zanurennya-u-pitmu-ne-bude-ekspert-pro-masovani-povitryani-udary-rf/	2024-12-01T21:04:48-08:00

The enemy conducted four unsuccessful assaults in the Dnieper direction. In Kurshchyna, Ukrainian defenders have repelled 15 attacks by the occupiers today, one battle is ongoing. There were no significant changes in the situation in other directions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/syly-oborony-vidbyly-15-atak-na-kurshhyni-vorog-aktyvizuvavsya-na-vremivskomu-napryamku/	2024-12-01T20:58:04-08:00
A new batch of aerial scouts for the Armed Forces: Germany included UAVs, which Luke Skywalker raise...	As the official portal of the German government informs, these UAVs were included in the November tranche of military support of our country, reported ArmyInform. It should be noted that the RQ-35 Heidrun aerial reconnaissance aircraft have been well known in the Defense Forces of Ukraine for many years. In particular, as told ArmyInform, back in December 2022, the legendary American actor, known for the role of the Jedi Luke Skywalker from the epic film -Star Wars- and United24 ambassador Mark Hamill, was going to donate exactly 10 powerful RQ-35 Heidrun reconnaissance drones for the Armed Forces. Manufactured by the Danish company Sky-Watch, these UAVs offer advanced capabilities for reconnaissance, surveillance and reconnaissance ( ISR). In addition, Sky-Watch engineers subsequently incorporated technical improvements into the UAV based on operational experience in Ukraine, increasing their resistance to radio-electronic warfare and the ability to navigate in airspace where there is no GNSS. The RQ-35 Heidrun is a fixed-wing mini-unmanned aerial system (UAS) designed primarily for video surveillance and low-altitude reconnaissance. The drone is equipped with a three-lens camera system, including visible and thermal imaging capabilities. Heidrun can transmit real-time video over 30km away, providing live situational awareness. This allows intelligence to be obtained without endangering the operator. This UAV has a flight time of up to 100 minutes, maximum wind resistance of 12 meters per second, and a maximum altitude of 5,200 meters above sea level. The camera payload platform features stabilized gimbals that offer 20x to 40x optical zoom and additional digital zoom options. In addition, radio frequency transmission operating in the 2.2 to 2.5 GHz range ensures secure data transmission. The fixed-wing RQ-35 Heidrun is hand-launched and rapidly collects data on enemy positions. This is extremely important when operating a UAV in the field. The compact ground station has an IP68 enclosure rating and universal mounting for a short- or long-range antenna. The short-range patch antenna allows you to communicate with the UAV at a distance of up to 25 km. For communication at a distance of more than 30 km (beyond direct line of sight), a long-range patch antenna is used, which constantly tracks the UAV. The RQ-35 Heidrun UAV platform has a multi-purpose design that allows for different payload options. RQ-35 Heidrun is supplied by the manufacturer in a set with a tablet for manual control and special software. Sky Watch claims that it is able to function properly in conditions of suppression of satellite navigation with the help of EW tools. This unmanned system was also delivered to Poland. In the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, this drone was designed to fill the gap between small (micro) quadcopters and conventional fixed-wing mini-class UAVs. Specifications: Heidrun Drones.

How the F-16 -learned- to shoot down the Shaheds: the cost of the question and what remains the most...	ArmiyaInform tells about the limitations and difficulties that the military managed to overcome and has to overcome, as well as about one of the test episodes, during which the task of the F-16 was to destroy a UAV imitating a cruise missile. F-16C fighter launches an APKWS missile at a small maneuverable air target flying at low altitude (December 19, 2019) / source: U.S. The Air Force's cruise missiles have been in service since the 1970s, but for a long time the only country that used them on the battlefield was the United States of America. This created a false impression of the absolute dominance of the US and other NATO countries in this area of ​​armaments. The situation changed in 2017, when the Russian Federation launched cruise missile strikes on targets in Syria. Soon, in 2019, Iran struck Saudi Arabia with kamikaze drones and cruise missiles. This made the military countries of NATO to worry about the possibility of using such weapons also against Western countries and to be more actively engaged in the development and testing of air defense equipment capable of countering enemy cruise missiles and UAVs. Among other things, attention was also paid to the possibility of shooting down small air targets with the help of fighters, including the F-16 Fighting Falcon. An important advantage of using aircraft as air defense means is high mobility, so they were considered as an important addition to other means of air defense. The obvious solution to the task is the use of air-to-air guided missiles by fighters. However, the expected problem was the ratio of the cost of the missile used to shoot down the enemy's ammunition with the price of the cruise missile itself or the enemy's unmanned aerial vehicle. For example, the AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) all-weather guided missile of the air-to-air class costs more than one million dollars. On the other hand, a kamikaze drone to shoot down can cost only a few tens of thousands of dollars. In view of this, one of the main problems that gunsmiths had to deal with was the creation of an effective and at the same time cheap means of defeat. It was possible to solve it thanks to the use against air targets of the modernized Hydra-70 missile - a 70-mm unguided air missile adopted for armament in the distant 1948. At the beginning of 2010, BAE Systems created the APKWS (Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System) guided missile based on the unguided Hydra, a high-precision air munition with a laser targeting system. The modernization was carried out by installing between the warhead and the rocket engine the WGU-59/B module with laser sensors and rotary vanes, which allow precise guidance on the target. The creation of a high-precision APKWS missile based on the Hydra-70 allowed the US Army to close the need for an inexpensive compact munition that would occupy an intermediate position between unguided aircraft missiles and high-precision missiles of a larger caliber, which would be irrational to use against small, cheap targets. The US Marine Corps is modernizing the Hydra-70, creating APKWS II based on it, and installing missiles on the launcher of the Bell AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter In 2012, APKWS was adopted by the US Navy, upgrading the existing Hydra missiles -70. Since 2014, serial production of the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System has begun and they have reached other structures of the armed forces of the United States of America. First of all, APKWS entered the armament of the MH-60R Seahawk and MH-60S Knighthawk helicopters. Later, they were also installed on the AV-8B Harrier II vertical takeoff and landing attack aircraft of the US Air Force. In 2016, the U.S. Air Force purchased APKWS missiles for use in ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, where they were used in combat operations from A-10 Thunderbolt II and F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. This was the first example of the use of APKWS in combat operations from fixed-wing aerial platforms, as previously they had been used exclusively from Apache attack helicopters. Opponents of the US army in Iraq and Afghanistan did not have combat manned aircraft, unmanned aerial systems and cruise missiles. So, dominating the air space, the US Air Force used APKWS missiles exclusively to strike ground targets. The use of cruise missiles and kamikaze drones by Russia and Iran has prompted the US military to consider using APKWS to also shoot down these small, maneuverable low-altitude air targets. There are several arguments in favor of such a solution - APKWS are not only effective, but also cheap, compact, versatile and easy to use. They do not need to capture the target before launch - the ammunition is guided by a laser guidance system that is activated during launch. Thanks to the new contactless detonator, a direct hit on the target was unnecessary - it was destroyed by an explosive wave and fragments. The cost of one missile is about 25 thousand dollars, which is not only significantly cheaper than the cost of a cruise missile, but also quite commensurate with the cost of most long-range UAVs. For example, it is about half the price of Iran's Shahed kamikaze drone. The versatility of the APKWS lies in its ability to be used as an air-to-surface, air-to-air, surface-to-air and even surface-to-surface missile thanks to the installation of launchers on various types of air, ground and surface platforms. The Hydra-70 missile launcher for air platforms contains 19 munitions and weighs 225 kg. In view of this, most helicopters and airplanes can carry 2-4 such launchers. Specifically, the F-16 can simultaneously carry 4 LAU-61/LAU-68 missile pods, each containing 19 Hydra missiles or 7 APKWS missiles, respectively. Ground platforms like a missile system VAMPIRE by L3Harris in general practically not limited to the number of missiles, as it depends only on the size of the body of the vehicle where they will be loaded. The only limitation is the availability of roads, the ability to move freely along them, and the maximum possible speed of the car in real conditions. Overcoming these land transport limitations allows the installation of APKWS missile launchers on high-speed air platforms such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon multirole fighters. About the successful shooting down of a small-sized aircraft at low altitude by an APKWS missile launched from the F-16 during tests on December 19, 2019 reports Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. Then, a test pilot of the 85th Flight Test Squadron of the US Air Force, Major Jeffrey Entine, shot down a small drone that imitated a cruise missile over the Gulf of Mexico during a training exercise at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. APKWS was guided to the target by the aircraft's on-board targeting platform. The exercises proved that the F-16 can relatively easily shoot down small air targets, such as enemy UAVs or cruise missiles flying at low altitudes, with low-cost weapons — APKWS guided air missiles based on upgraded Hydra-70 unguided air missiles. As the US Air Force reported at the time, the use of APKWS to protect against cruise missiles and UAVs is a promising step, as the cheap high-precision munition allows to achieve the same successful result as the much more expensive AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. However, there is also a difficult part of the task - it consists in detecting an enemy small-sized air target flying along a complex trajectory. It is possible to cope with it thanks to the complex cooperation of all forces and means of air defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/yak-f-16-navchyvsya-zbyvaty-shahedy-czina-pytannya-ta-shho-lyshayetsya-najskladnishym/	2024-12-01T20:34:07-08:00
Harry Potter and the -Rabbit's Ear-: How to Spot Landmines and Avoid Moles at Interflex UK	The correspondent of ArmiyaInform tells about how the Ukrainian military is trained to detect mines and other explosive objects during the BZVP within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. We practice the disposal of explosive objects dozens of times. The first and most important thing to learn is to detect mines of different purpose, method of activation, detonation mechanism and type of damage, as well as improvised explosive devices, stretchers using grenades and unexploded ammunition. The lion's share of classes are devoted to the detection of explosive objects and their subsequent actions. We are infantry, so demining or demining by detonation in place is not our first priority - that should be done by specially trained detonators. The algorithm of our actions is reduced to a few simple steps that can be reliably remembered by the rule of five -Ps-: Marking a mine and informing about its presence can be done in different ways at the same time or in different sequences depending on specific circumstances. However, both actions must be performed in one way or another, because this is the only way to protect those who can potentially activate an explosive object to action or find themselves in the affected area. The most difficult, of course, is the first point - to detect a mine that is specially made, installed and camouflaged in such a way that it is as difficult as possible to notice. Therefore, this is what we work on the most, for the longest time, under different conditions and in different ways. We need to be able to detect mines under any conditions - in the twilight or even complete darkness, in the rain and in the fog, in the forest thicket, among the grass and leaves, or in the dirt and among the debris of construction debris on a city street or in a building. This can be learned through knowledge of a number of basic principles and long-term practice, which trains the eye to notice the slightest signs of the presence of an explosive object. So it is not surprising that this is what we have been doing for the longest time and in different ways. Physically, the most difficult thing is to detect underground and well-disguised mines with the help of a minesweeper kit. This should be done crawling in full protective gear, with legs crossed and constantly feeling the ground in front of you. It is necessary to wield a sapper's probe like a conductor's wand of a wizard from the Harry Potter books - strongly and confidently, but at the same time gently and gracefully, holding the probe with a bunch of fingers and pressing only with the wrist. It is extremely difficult to cover even a small distance in this way, some 3‒4 meters on grass completely wet from several days of rain. Already after the first few dozen dives, the probe starts to hurt my wrist mercilessly, the helmet becomes heavy as a bell, and the bulletproof vest sticks into the Georgian soil. The only thing in my head is the Avada Kedavra spell. It is directed not so much against the mine, which the instructors disguised under the turf, as against numerous fragments of flint. There are a lot of these stones here, so every 3-4 dives the probe gets stuck in them, confusing and giving false hope that it is a mine. It is possible to detect a mine as far as the beginning of the third meter of the site. From under the probe, instead of the usual ticking or a light grinding against the flint, a dull blow to the hollow plastic can be heard. -Mina, finally definitely Mina!-, I think and crawl back. Now it should be marked and reported to the instructor about the completion of the task. Before doing this, I cheat a little and rest for a few minutes, kneading my wrists. Only then do I raise my voice and raise my hand. After listening to the comments, I move to one of the neighboring areas - and so three times in a row during one class. However, the result seems good to me only until I find out that during the time I detected three mines, some managed to detect 5-6. -I need to work faster,- I think, and I remember the spell from Harry Potter again. -And instead of -Avada Kedavra- you should use -Accio- - I know that I'm looking for a mine.- Such jokes with yourself allow you to relax a little and rest before the next class. Fortunately, it is much less physically demanding and requires observation rather than action and effort. We examine a large square, 20 by 20 meters, in order to detect at a great distance a place where a careless enemy may have planted a mine. Traces of human movement and presence are immediately visible. It is produced by crumpled grass and broken plants, shifted soil, abandoned garbage, elements transferred from another area, symmetries that do not belong to the natural area, changes in color, and many other things. There was definitely a person here relatively recently, which means there may be a dangerous surprise. Then we practice these same skills many times in pairs, moving along forest routes, on each of which the instructors have set several mines. However, in the forest, we are quite often misled by moles who managed to work in the middle of the trails after the instructors. Freshly excavated earth is not a sign of a recently laid mine, but traces of the life of forest animals. -Look for a combination of at least two signs of a possible mine, because one is not enough,- the instructors explain. And in most cases, we all complete the task successfully. The most difficult thing is to detect stretch marks - a barely noticeable fishing line crosses the path at different heights, and we can't always notice it in time. Often, of course, the play of light and water droplets helps, and sometimes a light web, which the spider has already managed to attach to the stretch, but it is not always so lucky. In the end, at one of the classes, the instructors reveal to us another interesting way to detect a stretched fishing line - with the help of a -rabbit ear-. This is a simple tool that can be made from things at hand, such as wire and light cloth. To do this, an oblong wire similar in shape to a real rabbit's ear or a similar base should be wrapped with white fabric, film or tape. The technology of using this product is as simple as the product itself. Having put the -rabbit ear- in front of you, it should be slowly raised from the ground level to the highest point above your head, describing a semicircle in the air. On its white background, it will be easy to see the thinnest stretch line. The main thing is not to rush, not to miss any section, not to step forward and to raise the tool from the lowest level above the ground as high as possible, because the fishing line can be pulled at any height.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/garri-potter-ta-krolyache-vuho-yak-vyyavyty-miny-j-unyknuty-krotiv-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-12-01T20:23:42-08:00
Neither people nor equipment are spared - no losses stop the Russians in Kurshchyna	About this on the ArmyTV stream the chief sergeant of the 36th platoon of the marine infantry brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky with the call sign - Solomon-. -When Russian attack aircraft go, they are always accompanied by equipment. It can be armored: APC, BRDM plus a tank for cover. But they also use a lot of light vehicles such as ATVs and motorcycles to quickly reach our positions and land infantry. They can go further, or they can simply leave the equipment, they don't count on it,- said Solomon. According to him, our marines are trying to respond to the attack aircraft as soon as possible. -When we spot this column, our artillery and FPV drones start working on it. When they approach, then the Maviks with resets are turned on, which fly no more than 4 kilometers. We work, then conduct preliminary reconnaissance and strike the survivors, if there are any,- said Solomon. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky, together with the soldiers of the 73rd Battalion of the Territorial Defense Forces repelled the assault of superior numbers Russian elite units in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/ne-berezhut-ani-lyudej-ani-tehniku-na-kurshhyni-rosiyan-ne-zupynyayut-zhodni-vtraty/	2024-12-01T10:57:51-08:00

The number of enemy drones on optical fiber has increased in Kurshchyna	About this on the Army TV stream the chief sergeant of the platoon of the 36th marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky with the call sign Solomon . -Often, they send a drone along the route to be on duty, and if they don't find our target, they direct the drone straight towards our positions. The Russians don't count on losses at all,- Solomon noted. According to him, although fiber-optic drones have a shorter range than conventional drones, they are insensitive to the effects of ERB, and therefore can operate where conventional drones lose contact with the operator. Solomon also talked about what drones are used for different tasks. -In my opinion, FPV drones are more useful for destroying equipment, as well as manpower, -maviks- are used for more static purposes, because it is not easy to hit infantry with a grenade. Accordingly, equipment can also be hit by drops, there is cumulative ammunition, but it should be more static equipment: damaged, abandoned,- said Solomon. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky, together with the soldiers of the 73rd Battalion of the Territorial Defense Forces repelled the assault of superior numbers Russian elite units in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/na-kurshhyni-zbilshylasya-kilkist-vorozhyh-droniv-na-optovolokni/	2024-12-01T07:32:38-08:00

Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the volunteer Ukrainian army -South-, said this on the ArmyTV stream. -Velika Novosilka, although a settlement of the Donetsk region, is located on the border of the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia regions, and there is a lot of information support from our enemy here. The enemy is spreading the idea that the offensive on Velika Novosilka is not about Kurakhov and Donetsk region in general, but about the Dnipropetrovsk region. Even more about the city of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. The information efforts made by the enemy are very powerful,- said Serhii Bratchuk. According to him, the situation in the area of ​​Velika Novosilka has worsened, our command is taking certain measures in order to stabilize the situation as much as possible, because the enemy has tactical advances. -We understand that Velika Novosilka is a continuation of the events taking place in the Kurakhivsko-Pokrov region.

Our aerial reconnaissance spotted a convoy of 3 enemy BMPs, which, together with the landing party, went to our positions.

According to OSINT maps, the enemy is trying to attack from the east from Rozdilny and from the south, from Staromayorsky. The presenter asked on which of these vectors the enemy pressure is stronger. -What is happening from the east, the advance is greater and the enemy there is making much more effort today. The enemy is trying to develop an offensive in the direction. Now both the artillerymen of the brigade and the adjacent units are working to stop the enemy and prevent his further advance. What you see now on the battle maps, what is in the open maps, what is marked in red, is in fact the Russians advancing on their blood. Because in fact there is a battle for every landing, for every street, and in fact in every battle the enemy loses his strength,- Bohdan Petrenko explained. As ArmyInform wrote, in zone of responsibility 5 of a separate assault brigade in the area of ​​combat missions the enemy arranges frequent assaults , but taking into account the time of day. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/okupanty-namagayutsya-otochyty-velyku-novosilku-v-zsu-rozpovily-pro-diyi-voroga/	2024-12-01T06:06:58-08:00

The Defense Forces explained how the intensity of enemy assaults depends on the weather	Such observations were shared on the telethon on December 1 by the commander of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault brigade, Mykola Zinko. -We have frequent assaults, as well as along the entire contact line, the enemy is probing our defenses, trying to find a weak point to then storm with greater forces. Mostly, it is a light time of day, or morning or evening grayness, when visibility is weaker, fog. Then small infantry groups try to find a gap in our defense somewhere. Much depends on the weather and visibility, and the enemy takes advantage of this. Well, we also enjoy such advantages,- Mykola Zinko told about the intensity of hostilities. When asked by the presenter whether we have parity in artillery, the military man answered in the affirmative. -There is a certain parity, the enemy has a little more artillery, but I can say that our artillery works better. On the other hand, in aviation, the enemy has an advantage and gives us a little trouble, in particular, with KABs, which they have enough of.- - summed up the interlocutor. As ArmiyaInform wrote, in the Pokrovsky direction the enemy continues to press in the area of ​​Zhovte and Lysivka settlements.

Graceful red foxes, timid pheasants and powerful wild boars got into the lens - the real masters of the forest. -Despite the natural beauty, encounters with some animals can be a serious test for a person. Aggressive behavior of wild boars or the risk of contracting dangerous diseases from foxes are not the only threats. In view of this, we urge you to avoid walking in the border areas to reduce the risk of dangerous encounters with wild animals,- the DPSU urged. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or not to risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/tvaryny-zamist-tvaryuk-na-kordoni-u-videopastky-dlya-uhylyantiv-potrapyly-predstavnyky-pryrody/	2024-12-01T05:13:03-08:00
Ministry of Defense: in November, the Russian army suffered the largest losses since the beginning o...	About this notified the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This number of casualties corresponds to the number of conditionally more than three motorized rifle divisions of the ground troops of the Russian Army. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in November, during one day, our soldiers -two hundred- and -three hundred- killed 2,030 enemy soldiers. This is also the highest daily enemy loss rate since February 24, 2022. Also, during November, our soldiers hit 307 enemy tanks. This is the highest figure this fall (291 enemy tanks were destroyed or knocked out in September, 279 in October). There are 31 vehicles in the tank battalion of the Russian Federation, so in the last month of autumn 2024, the Kremlin army lost almost 10 tank battalions destroyed and knocked out. The estimated cost of this amount of equipment is equivalent to 450 million US dollars. As a result of the active combat work of the soldiers of the Defense Forces in November 2024, 899 enemy armored combat vehicles were damaged. Conventionally, this is the number of BBMs of almost four motorized rifle divisions. Such a number of armored combat vehicles cost the budget of the aggressor country approximately at least half a billion US dollars. Last month, Ukrainian soldiers also hit 884 units of enemy artillery. One artillery division of the occupying army has 18 self-propelled artillery installations. In this way, our soldiers deprived 49 artillery divisions of the opportunity to conduct combat operations the previous month. The cost of such a number of artillery installations is about 700 million dollars. If we talk about the total losses of the enemy in weapons and equipment in November 2024, then their estimated cost reaches more than 3 billion US dollars. In September and October, this number was lower. Therefore, the Kremlin continues to spend wildly on the continuation of the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/minoborony-u-lystopadi-rosijska-armiya-zaznala-najbilshyh-vtrat-vid-pochatku-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya/	2024-12-01T04:52:08-08:00
Assaults only under EW — in Kurshchyna, the enemy is making life difficult for our drones	About on the ArmyTV stream platoon sergeant of the 36th marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky with the call sign -Solomon-. -The adversary uses powerful EW means where hostilities are taking place. Unfortunately, they are head and shoulders above us in this regard. Assaults include these devices that suppress the frequencies of both FPV drones and Mavics. That's why it's very hard to work, you have to invent your own know-how in order to bypass the REB,- said Solomon. According to him, to avoid REB, you can use optics, which, unfortunately, are not yet represented in the Armed Forces. -Or install two antennas on Maviks, work from different points to bypass the suppression zone and conduct reconnaissance and impression of the enemy,- Solomon noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky, together with the soldiers of the 73rd Battalion of the Territorial Defense Forces repelled the assault of superior numbers Russian elite units in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/shturmy-lyshe-pid-rebom-na-kurshhyni-vorog-uskladnyuye-zhyttya-nashym-dronaryam/	2024-12-01T04:42:11-08:00

According to her, among the personnel of the enemy there are also mobilized and recruited under a contract, but all are destroyed. An important role in this is played by drones from the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft systems, which find and destroy groups of Russian attack aircraft with drops. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 38th Marine Brigade recorded the strange behavior of a Russian who froze in the middle of the field like a scarecrow, or only to deceive our aerial scouts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-odna-nasha-brygada-mozhe-protystoyaty-odrazu-chotyrom-rosijskym/	2024-12-01T03:59:18-08:00
The Defense Forces spoke about the difference between Russian marines and paratroopers in Kurshchyna	About this on the air of the telethon on December 1 told marines We can say that they live richly. They quite a lot use meat assaults, columns of armored vehicles, now the 155th has pulled back, is resting, then we are working with the Russian Airborne Forces. These guys are 100% poorer, because the assaults began on &#8220;rivers,&#8221;, ATVs, and motorcycles. Is this a tactic? It's hard for me to say. It seems more that this is the poverty and weakness of these units,- said -Enei-. When asked by the presenter about the level of training of the Russian marines, the soldier replied: -Standard. I will not say that these are elite troops.

And after 30-40 minutes, a group of 20-30 Russian servicemen arrived again, who simply stepped over the bodies and went on to storm the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine. But then they were also destroyed,- Vitaly Lytvyn said. According to him, sometimes the Russians use small tactical groups, and sometimes assaults take place with the participation of, for example, 30 Russian soldiers. -And we are not counting the equipment, artillery and aviation - and they use them all the time. That is, aviation in this direction strikes not only on the front edge, but also drops guided aerial bombs on logistical routes, on the Pokrovske settlement itself, using anti-aircraft missiles... Defense is very difficult,- the serviceman emphasized. He also emphasized that the difficult weather conditions also do not contribute to the conduct of defensive operations by our Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine, in particular, to the work of aerial reconnaissance. -Cloud cover is often low, making the use of UAVs difficult.- As ArmyInform wrote, the occupying Russian army increases the number of assaults by small groups near Toretsk on Daughters	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/znyshhyly-20-rosiyan-za-piv-godyny-pryjshla-nova-grupa-okupantiv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-vorog-atakuye-bez-upynu/	2024-12-01T01:58:38-08:00

Special operation T-80: our soldiers took an enemy tank from under the nose of the Russians	Video shown December 1 in the 60th separate mechanized Ingulets brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -This story was waiting for its time to be told.

The Ministry of Defense presented the concept of reform of military medical commissions	This was reported in MoU. The presentation took place during the thematic meeting of the Council of Donors of Institutional Reforms of the MoU, which was attended by Deputy Minister of Defense Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk, Deputy Minister of Defense Kateryna Chernogorenko and Deputy Minister of Health Edem Adamanov. -The principles of the VLK have not changed for decades. The system that exists now is a vestige of the old administrative approach. It is full of shortcomings, unnecessary bureaucratic complications, and corruption risks. We must significantly reduce these risks. Therefore, I am grateful for the support of the reform to all partners and public organizations that were involved in the launch of this project,- emphasized Serhii Melnyk. The participants of the meeting noted that the modern system of military medical commissions has two-sided shortcomings. On the one hand, it allows individuals to avoid military service without legal grounds, and on the other hand, it does not prevent people with serious illnesses from entering the service, which creates additional difficulties for the Armed Forces. The reform will make it possible to divide the decision of the military medical commission into two separate sets of data — medical and administrative. Some specialists will conduct a medical examination for VLC, and others will analyze the anonymized results of these medical examinations. To pass the military medical commission, it will no longer be necessary to go to the TCC. Conscripts will be able to independently choose the hospital where they will undergo a medical examination. Data from there will enter the Electronic Health Care System (ECHS). Over time, data from the ESOZ will enter the medical information system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which will be modernized under this reform: in particular, the technical possibility to receive data from the ESOZ and the electronic office of the VLK will be created. The military medical commission will receive data about the person, get acquainted with them, and make its administrative decision. Anonymized data will be sent to a random commission whose members will not know whose documents they are reviewing. This will prevent manipulation and abuse. -As of today, in the context of the VLK, we have old bureaucratic norms that work slowly and do not inspire confidence among citizens. This reform is needed so that conscripts can trust the system. To undergo a medical examination in civilian institutions. To feel that their rights are protected and that after a medical examination they are not immediately declared fit if they actually have some diseases. Our proposal is to create a transparent and clear path that will create the basis for trusting relations and ensure that fair conclusions are drawn,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko. After each decision, a digital trail will be visible - electronic signatures of both the doctor and the VLK employee. The conclusions of the commissions will be kept. All this will simplify the verification and monitoring of the activities of the VLK by law enforcement agencies. The reform will be implemented in three stages and should be completed in November 2025. The Council of Institutional Reform Donors of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is a platform for coordination and communication between the Ministry of Defense and donors regarding the development and implementation of defense sector reforms. Thematic meetings of the Council of Donors of the Ministry of Education and Culture are held with the aim of attracting donors to the implementation of projects in the directions of the strategic priorities of the Ministry of Education and Culture. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/minoborony-prezentuvalo-konczepcziyu-reformy-vijskovo-likarskyh-komisij/	2024-11-30T22:41:51-08:00

Blood from the ears after shelling, a broken mortar and trophies of the Kharkiv operation. -Why here...	How a knee-deep trench can save lives and why 2-3 minutes at the front sometimes make a big difference? Vladislav told our correspondents about this: -On February 26, 2022, I came to Obukhiv TCC. He told his wife that I was called, but in fact, of course, he rushed there himself. Eventually got to the 30th separate mechanized brigade. I was immediately appointed mortar commander. There were 10 days of training. There is nothing super complicated like that. The 82-millimeter mortar was fully mastered. By the way, it so coincided that in the calculation, everyone, like me, was born in 1975. The only thing is that I had ATO experience - I served in the -Donbas- battalion, and the boys did not. And then they went to Donetsk to perform combat missions. Our position was called -Depot-, it was immediately behind Toretsk. We were there for more than 4 months. They usually worked as a counter-battery. It's funny, of course, but everything fell on our 82nd mortar: the enemy was working on us with both 120- and 152-caliber mortars. But, I remember, we once hit the enemy's 120th mortar quite well. We detected it and worked on it: we damaged the mortar itself, and the BC warehouse that was near it was also blown up. And, of course, they always worked on the infantry, they didn't let it take hold. Then they left again for recovery. And then there was Kharkiv Region, where we were standing near Izyum. Then their 20th army started towards us. Their paratroopers were attacking us. Well, they were loaded&#8230; Also, the Russians were working there even then with T-90 tanks, and they are really strong - they could withstand even 7 hits from RPG, LNG&#8230; Yes, he had a turret wedged after that, but at least he could move away. By the way, there our colleagues on the 120th T-90 mortar hit and knocked down his goose. It was like this. But on August 14, the Russians already stepped on us in a serious way. Everything flew at us: both -tornadoes- and -hail-. In the morning, the command -To the battle- arrived, because the enemy had gone to break through. We then covered one of our mouths. And at one point&#8230; The exits of enemy artillery can be heard, and when the cassette is opened, there is such a click. I just managed to shout -Lie down- to the boys! We had a small trench even then, knee-deep: this is what saved us. In general, everything went well, but contusions were received, of course. My ears were bleeding, but I didn't pay attention to it at the time. Not before that. We were lucky that then two tanks of our reserves had time to remove from the echelon. And they gave the enemy T-90 a serious fight&#8230; We had one tank driver there, call sign -Kipish-. So he burned the T-90 on his T-64, which started working for us. And when an enemy tank is working on you, you just lie in the trench and read the Our Father. The -Kipisha- tank never hit the enemy, although it spent a lot of shells on him. -Kipish- is a young man. Pity him, he died later near Soledar&#8230; By the way, it is true that the Russians left a lot of equipment in Kharkiv region. It got to the point that our brigades there even started sorting through the trophies: -I don't want the 72, phew, I only want the T-80.- First, the brand new ones that still smelled of paint won trophies. Then it was restored again and we already had the Bakhmut direction: Klishchiivka, Andriivka, Kurdyumivka, Zaliznyanske. I remember how we left Zaliznyanskyi&#8230; One of our drivers arrives and says: -Run, we're leaving here quickly-! And we were no longer even on the road, but on the field from there. And you look back, at the place where we stood, and everything that is begins to fly there. Literally about 2-3 minutes everything was solved then&#8230; Eventually, injuries and other ailments left me with limited fitness. Now I work in the TCC. Yes, it happens that civilians make some kind of claims: why are you here and not there. But, honestly, there is no desire to explain to people what I went through and what I experienced at the front. Why do I have to prove anything to anyone? I also have a wife, children. But the guys who are still at the front should be replaced. They are really exhausted.

Will burn a tank with a meter of armor: the Brazilian defense company is developing an anti-tank mis...	Authors of the online military publication Army Recognition inform that as this platform develops, it will change the perception of anti-tank and high-precision strike capabilities of the Brazilian ground forces, becoming the most important element of the future combat operations of the Brazilian army, ArmyInform notes. In addition to the development of the latest MSS (Míssil Superficie-Superfície) anti-tank missile complex (ATGM), the Sistemas Integrados de Alto Teor Tecnológico (SIATT) company is also working on a new anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) with the -shoot-forget- technology. Such technology allows operators to immediately change position after launching a missile, which drastically minimizes damage to the military by enemy counterfire. The new complex is expected to penetrate more than 1000 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA ). At the same time, effectively neutralizing a wide range of modern main battle tanks (MBTs) and armored vehicles, including those with dynamic protection. Thanks to this level of armor penetration, the MSS ATGM is in the same class as some of the most powerful anti-tank missile systems in the world. In addition to high penetration capacity, the future MSS ATGM model will have a range of more than four kilometers. This is very important for fighting in open or rugged terrain, where the ability to engage in long-range combat is essential for tactical advantage. The portable version of the product consists of a launcher with a tripod and sights weighing about 30 kg, a container with ammunition weighing less than 25 kg. The missile design includes a laser guidance system. In addition to the development of a new ATGM, the company is working on the creation of an anti-tank missile with laser guidance and an increased range. This variant of the ATGM is designed to increase the accuracy and range of the Brazilian army's anti-tank weapons, providing effective combat against targets at significant distances. The laser guidance system allows the missile to be precisely aimed at both static and moving targets, giving operators more control over the missile's flight path and reducing the chance that it will deviate from the target or be intercepted. -The MSS anti-tank missile complex platform marks an important milestone in Brazil's efforts to develop its own highly effective defense solutions, reducing dependence on foreign technologies,- the Army Recognition publication emphasized. In addition, the MSS complex is being developed in such a way that it can be used as an individual means of defeating armored vehicles, and can be installed on various platforms and vehicles. The MSS system is also planned to include a firing simulator with a very accurate representation of the real environment, so it will be possible to train anti-tank troops without the need to use real missiles, as well as test equipment to measure and align the direction of fire. -These capabilities increase the export potential of the system, as countries seeking to strengthen their anti-tank defense are likely to pay attention to the improved characteristics of the MSS anti-tank missile complex and its flexibility in integration with various platforms,- ​​the authors of the publication note.

Mirroring the facts in action: the Russian Federation accuses Ukraine of its own war crimes	Specialists of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security emphasize that, in fact, Ukraine strictly adheres to International Humanitarian Law, while Russia systematically attacks civilian infrastructure. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Russia has destroyed 227 medical facilities and damaged 1,714. Also, 3,798 educational facilities have been seriously damaged, of which 365 have been completely destroyed. Particularly egregious examples are the airstrike on the maternity hospital and children's hospital in Mariupol on March 9, 2022, the rocket attack on the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, when 627 children were in the hospital. Russia uses attacks on civilian infrastructure as a tool to intimidate the population, which is a violation of the laws of war. Russia is trying to create the impression that its actions in Ukraine are -defense- or -response- to Ukraine's actions, despite real evidence to the contrary. Statements about attacks on civilian objects are designed to show Ukraine as a violator of international law in order to undermine its support from the world community. Disinformation is used to bolster domestic propaganda, motivate Russian citizens, and justify the continuation of the war. The distortion of facts is aimed at causing doubts among Ukraine's allies about the provision of further military and humanitarian aid.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/viddzerkalennya-faktiv-u-diyi-rf-zvynuvachuye-ukrayinu-u-vlasnyh-voyennyh-zlochynah/	2024-11-30T20:08:39-08:00

The world is capable of ensuring this,- the President said. He also said that he listened to the report of the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, on the situation at the front and in the areas of the Kursk operation. -I want to thank our brigades that defend the positions that destroy the occupier.

However, now, according to him, the effectiveness of these decisions is obvious.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/prezydent-rozpoviv-skilky-krylatyh-raket-znyshhyly-litaky-f-16-pid-chas-ostannoyi-ataky/	2024-11-30T05:27:46-08:00

Without NATO, Ukraine will not have real independence - the President	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi told about this in an interview with Skynews. According to him, for this Ukraine needs to join NATO. In particular, first of all, the part of the territory controlled by Ukraine should be covered with the NATO umbrella as soon as possible. And then deal with the return of the occupied territories by diplomatic means. Without NATO, Ukraine will face serious dangers. -Putin does not want peace. For him, our independence is equal to losing this war. Without NATO, there will be no real independence in Ukraine. He will be back. In the next 10 years,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi believes. The President also added that Ukraine should receive an invitation to NATO within internationally recognized borders. After all, the acceptance of only part of the territory will indicate the recognition of the occupied territories as Russian. Ukraine cannot do this. Volodymyr Zelensky also does not see an alternative to joining NATO. -We don't have nuclear weapons. We gave it to the fact that the most influential leaders of the countries guaranteed the security of Ukraine. But it didn't work and we lost a lot. Maybe there is some alternative besides NATO. But I can't see her. I've heard about security guarantees. And I talked about it with many leaders of countries. Such agreements should include humanitarian, economic aid, weapons, etc. But this is not NATO. And that doesn't equate to security guarantees. We had the Budapest Memorandum. But this did not stop Putin,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. The President also calls the principle that no decision should be made without Ukraine as an important point in any agreements. As reported by ArmyInform, the Presidents of Ukraine and France discussed acceleration of Mirage aircraft transfer process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/bez-nato-v-ukrayiny-ne-bude-realnoyi-nezalezhnosti-prezydent/	2024-11-30T04:47:28-08:00

November's top targets: Defense forces named their -fattest- targets for the month	About this reported on November 30 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. So, at the beginning of the month, Ukrainian drone operators hit the launcher of the Buk-M2 air defense system on a tracked chassis. During combat operation, this air defense system can hit targets both as part of an anti-aircraft missile system when aiming from a command post, and autonomously, in a predetermined sector. A little later, on November 16, 19 and 29, our soldiers hit three more Russian Buk air defense systems of various modifications. The Ukrainian defenders also hunted down the Tor -. It is a land-based -twin- of the Russian sea-based -Kinzhal- air defense system. It is designed to solve the tasks of anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense at the level of a divisional link. In November, one of our ground units added to the list of hit enemy targets at once with two heavy flame-throwing systems of TOS salvo fire -1A -Sunflower-. Also last month, our soldiers struck Russian electronic warfare complex -Borisoglebsk-2-. The main task of the complex is to detect and suppress various communication channels and other systems that use radio signals. First of all, these are tactical link communication and control systems, in particular satellite. The last decade of November was particularly productive in terms of destroying enemy weapons and equipment. In particular, during the repulse of an enemy assault in the Donetsk direction, units of the Defense Forces hit 7 Russian BMD-4s with a crew and a landing party within one day. BMD-4 is the latest version of the Russian Army's amphibious assault vehicles. Units of the Armed Forces also launched a missile attack on the deployment site of the expensive Russian S-400 -Triumph- anti-aircraft missile system. As a result, the radar station was damaged. Let us emphasize that the functionality of the radar station depends on the combat work of other components of the air defense system. At the end of November, in the temporarily occupied Crimea, our scouts destroyed two (!) Russian radar Podlyot complexes. This is a mobile radar, which is used by the enemy to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes in a complex obstacle environment. In particular, this radar is involved in the targeting system for S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems. in November there is a Russian radar -Zoopark- - a mobile means of counter-battery combat. The main purpose of the complex is the reconnaissance of the enemy's firepower and the adjustment of fire. And another expensive target of our soldiers was the Russian mobile low-altitude radar station -Kasta 2E2-. Its purpose is airspace control, determination of coordinates and recognition of air targets, including at extremely low altitudes. It transmits coordinates and movement parameters of air targets to air defense systems. However, it can also be used as an air traffic control radar. As reported by ArmyInform, on November 28, as a result of a successful operation of the GUR of the MoU in the territory of temporarily occupied Crimea Russian radar complex -podlyot- destroyed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/top-czili-lystopada-syly-oborony-nazvaly-svoyi-najzhyrnishi-urazhennya-za-misyacz/	2024-11-30T03:51:47-08:00
Panic in the jungle -lnr-: inflation, repression against business and -meat assaults- mobilized	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, more than a year ago, the invaders forced the business to reduce the prices of food and goods, limiting the markup to 5%. This was explained by the holding of the so-called -first elections- and preparations for the re-election of Putin. Now the situation has worsened: due to the rise in prices, entrepreneurs have been accused of cartel conspiracy and issued warnings. The pressure on businesses continues, creating additional challenges for local residents. In addition, the invaders treat the forcibly mobilized residents of Luhansk region with disdain. Those mobilized are often the first to be sent on dangerous -meat assaults-. In the 13th tank regiment of the Russian army, the command forced soldiers from the -LNR- to give 50% of their pay. Those who refused were punished by being sent to the basement in Zaytsevo, known for its brutal conditions of detention. These facts testify to the deterioration of the situation in the occupied territory, both for the local population and for those who were mobilized to the ranks of the Russian army. As reported by ArmyInform, at the TOT of Luhansk Oblast, the occupiers are terrorizing the population: even a Russian passport does not help.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/panika-v-dzhunglyah-lnr-inflyacziya-represiyi-proty-biznesu-ta-myasni-shturmy-mobilizovanyh/	2024-11-30T03:28:26-08:00

In particular, within the framework of the strategy of internationalization in military educational institutions, the idea of ​​creating a system of patronage is laid: when a certain educational institution of partner countries or members of NATO takes a kind of patronage over a certain military educational institution,- Nataliya Vasyukova said. She also added that the implementation of this would help to create a partnership network between various educational institutions that would work not only in the direction of studying general English (General English), but also - what is extremely important today - specialized narrow-profile terminology (English for Specific Purposes). As reported by ArmyInform, one of the capital's military universities has become a leader in the study of foreign languages among defenders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/patronazh-u-vijskovij-osviti-nuou-zapuskaye-novu-inicziatyvu-mizhnarodnogo-spivrobitnycztva/	2024-11-30T02:53:05-08:00

As a result of the enemy attack, seven local residents died, including a six-year-old child. More than 200 people were injured in varying degrees of severity. The large number of dead and injured is due to the fact that the Rashist rocket attack took place in the central part of the city.

One of the capital's military institutes has become a leader in the study of foreign languages ​​amo...	About it in interview with ArmyInform was told by the head of the educational and scientific center of foreign languages ​​of the National Defense University of Ukraine, candidate of philological sciences, colonel Nataliya Vasyukova. -We will not talk about statistics. However, a large-scale invasion became an obvious challenge, because we had to train soldiers who spoke English because of the importance of working with partners, learning western technology, etc. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, language training was somewhat suspended, as it was necessary to figure out how to deal with the current situation, where to go next. But studies at the NUOU were not stopped: the educational process continued, graduations took place, and, of course, the emphasis was placed on disciplines that involved the direct repulsion of aggression. But in the same year, two foreign language courses were held. One was completed at the beginning of February 2022, the second started in October 2022,- Nataliya Vasyukova said. She emphasized that it is not just about NUOU, as foreign language courses are available in all higher military educational institutions and military educational units of higher education institutions. -And this shows that since the beginning of large-scale aggression, these processes have not just stopped, they have even become more emphasized, thus emphasizing the importance of learning foreign languages. The only question was which institution, depending on the number of scientific and pedagogical workers and teachers, could afford a certain number of groups. Let's add that NUOU is the leader in terms of the number of students,- the interlocutor emphasizes. If we compare the year 2024 with 2022 in the context of learning foreign languages, Nataliya Vasyukova draws attention to not just listener interest, but -motivated interest.- -Because people, in accordance with their positions, which require knowledge of the language or in accordance with the range of tasks performed, understand the complete dependence in certain official situations on the level of English proficiency. And there is also the realization that taking the next step in one's professional development and career growth without knowing the language will be difficult, and sometimes completely impossible,- Nataliya Vasyukova summed up. As ArmyInform wrote, from 2024 in military universities three new specialization. Previously ArmyInform informed that at military universities this year the most popular specialties among women were and specializations that train commanders of mechanized units, units of Airborne Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/odyn-zi-stolychnyh-vijskovyh-instytutiv-stav-liderom-z-vyvchennya-inozemnyh-mov-sered-zahysnykiv/	2024-11-29T21:33:44-08:00
The General Staff of the Armed Forces named three areas where the enemy concentrated its main effort...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, the occupiers are actively attacking in the Lyman and Kupyan directions. The terrorist state launched a missile strike with one missile, 31 airstrikes, dropping 53 anti-aircraft missiles. In addition, the invaders used 581 kamikaze drones for strikes and fired more than 3,000 shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. On the Kharkiv direction, Russian terrorists stormed the positions of our units five times in the Kudiivka, Vovchansk, and Tikhoi districts. Two skirmishes are ongoing. Seven times the enemy attacked our positions in the Kupyan direction. In the vicinity of Kolisnikivka, Lozova, Pershotravnevoy and Zeleny Gayu, units of the Defense Forces repelled all enemy attacks. In the Lyman direction, Russian troops attacked Ukrainian defenders 20 times in the districts of Grekivka, Novoyehorivka, Terniv, Yampolivka, Dibrova, Torsky, Zarichny, Hryhorivka and in the Serebryansky forest. Our soldiers repelled 18 enemy attacks, two battles are ongoing. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled three attempts by the invaders to capture our positions in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar and in the direction of Bila Hora. In the Toretsk direction, the occupiers twice tried to advance in the Druzhba and Toretsk districts, but were repulsed. In the Pokrovsky direction, the aggressor attacked our positions 34 times in the areas of Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Dachenske, Chumatske, Novy Trud and Zhovte settlements. Ten clashes are still going on. In the Kurakhiv direction, the invaders made 43 attempts to advance. 11 attacks continue. The main battles are taking place near Sontsivka, Berestki, Novodmytrivka, Zori, Kurakhovo, Dachny, Dalny, Elizavetivka, Hannivka, and Uspenivka.

Army English: about motivated new -blood-, conversation clubs with an attache... and not only	About all this and not only the correspondent of ArmiyaInform asked in an interview the head of the educational and scientific center of foreign languages ​​of the National Defense University of Ukraine (hereinafter - NUOU), candidate of philological sciences, Colonel Nataliya Vasyukova. —How many military personnel did the specialists of your university manage to train since the beginning of the large-scale invasion? And during 2024? - We will not talk about statistics. However, a large-scale invasion became an obvious challenge, because we had to train soldiers who spoke English because of the importance of working with partners, learning western technology, etc. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, language training was somewhat suspended, as it was necessary to figure out how to deal with the current situation, where to go next. But studies at the NUOU were not stopped: the educational process continued, graduations took place, and, of course, the emphasis was placed on disciplines that involved the direct repulsion of aggression. But in the same year, two foreign language courses were held. One was completed in early February 2022, the second started in October 2022. But it is not only about NUOU, because foreign language courses are available in all higher military educational institutions and military educational units of higher education institutions. And this testifies to the fact that since the beginning of large-scale aggression, these processes have not simply stopped, they have even become more emphasized, thus emphasizing the importance of learning foreign languages. The only question was which institution, depending on the number of scientific and pedagogical workers and teachers, could afford a certain number of groups. Let's add that NUOU is the leader in terms of the number of students. If we compare the year 2024 with 2022, it is worth paying attention to not just the interest of listeners, but motivated interest, because people, in accordance with their positions, which require knowledge of the language or in accordance with the range of tasks performed, understand complete dependence in certain official situations from the level of English proficiency. There is also the realization that taking the next step in your professional development and career growth without knowing the language will be difficult, and sometimes impossible. - Is the training of the military to learn a foreign language now about quantity or quality? - This is a provocative question, because the process of studying, mastering, gaining a new level in a certain direction, including a foreign language, is always a transition to a qualitatively new level. Therefore, it cannot be said that it is only about quantity. Let's talk about quality quantity in this context(smiles - ed.). - How do partners get involved in this training? - We knock on everyone. I can comment on the period of my two years in office. The initiative should always come from the interested party. And in this context, it is about creating a partnership network, first of all, within the Defense Forces. Yes, we try to communicate with all departments involved in foreign language education. We exchange materials, share experience, look for ways to improve educational and methodological support, etc. That is, it is an internal affiliate network. But we also knock on all the doors of our partners. In particular, within the framework of the strategy of internationalization in military educational institutions, the idea of ​​creating a patronage system is laid: when a certain educational institution of partner countries or NATO members takes a kind of patronage over a certain military educational institution. The implementation of this would help to create a partnership network between various educational institutions, which would work not only in the direction of studying general English (General English), but also - what is extremely important today - specialized narrow-profile terminology (English for Specific Purposes). In addition, last year we started the practice of conversation clubs for students of foreign language courses with the participation of defense attachés of the Kyiv Association of Military Attachés. Classes were held 2-3 times a month in the form of interviews, discussions with students according to their level of training. The goal was to consolidate the learned vocabulary and grammatical constructions in speech practice, as well as simply the opportunity to practice speaking, practicing typical communicative situations as close as possible to real ones with the participation of a native speaker (even if it is not his native language). During such classes, students learn to overcome the psychological barrier to start speaking a foreign language, because just as it is sometimes difficult to dare to take the first step, it is also difficult to say the first word, the first phrase in English (-will they understand me-, -will I not errors-). This year, this practice of conversation clubs has spread to other higher military educational institutions that conduct foreign language courses. - Are some subjects taught in a foreign language at the NUOU? - In the center of foreign languages, we definitely teach only in English. In addition, there is also English in research for future Ph.D. But both at the university and at other higher military educational institutions, in accordance with the governing documents and today's conditions, there is a requirement to teach 20% of subjects in a foreign language. Therefore, it is necessary to improve foreign language knowledge not only of listeners, but also of scientific and pedagogical staff. To do this, we cooperate both within the internal network and with foreign partners to create a course in the direction of English as a medium for teaching other disciplines (English-Medium Instruction or English as a Medium for Instruction). In this way, we maintain, acquire or expand the capacity to study and teach in English within the university. —What do you think is the current -room average temperature- for foreign language proficiency among the Armed Forces servicemen? —Thanks to the language testing sessions, I can see the statistics and can make a cut: in fact, so far the overall temperature is— disappointing, as it is cool outside the window now. But this new -blood- that appeared in the army with the beginning of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression against Ukraine indicates a certain tendency to increase the temperature, I will use the same metaphor - as if the heating was turned on and it's getting warmer. Those who understood that it is very difficult to achieve anything in civilian life without a foreign language, it is difficult to find a well-paid job, it is more difficult to develop professionally - they made their choice in the civilian dimension. And now they are -inspiring- their fellow soldiers with their experience. Well, it is worth emphasizing that there are many servicemen who do not wait for an order or command to learn a language, do not look for people to blame for their ignorance, but look for opportunities and time, take the initiative and start learning on their own, strive to develop, listen to recommendations - because it is the main driving force and key to success in mastering languages ​​are internal motivations and desires. I can say with great pleasure that there are more and more of them. - Do you have enough time to learn foreign languages ​​in the third year of a large-scale war? - No! Unfortunately, we confirm the effectiveness of the proverb -until the thunder strikes...-. Yes, we have started to -baptize-, but the result will take time. If you try to meet all the current needs, I jokingly say that both I and my colleagues need to be cloned! (laughs - ed.) Language is not something you can do in one or two evenings, gain some understanding and more or less master it. Language is something that is trained over time: you train your brain, you train yourself, and it is through self-discipline that you learn. But it takes time. According to our guidelines, there are 500 hours of teacher-led study from level zero to level one, which is pretty intense, and that's the pace at which four-month foreign language courses are taught. And no less important in language learning is the fact that after reaching a certain level, it is necessary to constantly maintain it, so as not to lose it, to keep what has been acquired. After all, if you do not do this, the skills will disappear, not immediately and not completely, but will become passive. Currently, there are many ways to maintain language skills - smartphone apps, news adapted to language levels, even short 15-minute lessons - but systematic - would be very appropriate. For example, we recommend Elena Chekryzhova's -Army English- project to everyone, and we broadcast her lessons to the public on the territory of our center: even passing by, you can hear something new, learn a new term. - Do you cooperate with public organizations, non-governmental institutions to improve and deepen the study of foreign languages ​​by military personnel? - Yes, and the contribution of NGOs and volunteers should not be underestimated, because the civil sector is those who, on a voluntary basis, realizing the need for the military to be included in these processes; provide translation support where necessary; continue to work and help us both abroad and in Ukraine. From November 2024, on the basis of the Memorandum of Cooperation between the Mariupol State University and the National Defense University of Ukraine, permanent and temporary staff of the university will be granted free access to educational courses on the study of the English language on the English4Ukraine electronic platform. This is another example of effective civil-military interaction. - What are your plans for improving the English course(s) for 2025? - When I am asked about the state of affairs, I usually answer -at least not worse- (smiles - ed.). As for plans, it is even more difficult, but you can use the same phrase: indeed, in 2025, we do not want to reduce our current indicators, but to increase them, of course, only under the conditions of an increase in interrelated human capital (research and teaching staff, educational facilities), so that a year later during the interview, without taking your eyes off, talk about quality quantity. We want to open more opportunities for people who want to learn a foreign language. — What interesting, funny, curious incident can you remember related to the stay of our military in an English-speaking environment? During studies abroad, during communication with partners, etc. - All these curious cases are almost always related to not quite perfect command of the language. I don't want to call these cases funny, because it demotivates those who study, strengthens the psychological barrier to language use that I mentioned earlier. And I always insisted: speak, don't be shy. After all, the foreigner with whom you speak English speaks Ukrainian worse than you speak English. One should be demanding of oneself, but the level of self-criticism should not hinder practice. And don't be afraid to laugh, and maybe laugh at yourself sometimes. Sometimes the lack of vocabulary is compensated by the ability to draw well what you cannot say, or curious cases arise not only due to imperfect knowledge of a foreign language, but also due to ignorance of cultural features, so it is always worth conducting small linguistic and cultural reviews of the countries whose language is studied. From the latest that I remember: guys are calling me and telling me: -I tell her: ``Give me keys'' - English). I meant -keys-. And the foreign interlocutor did not hear -keys- but -give me kiss- (English). Then everyone laughed&#8230; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/armijska-anglijska-pro-motyvovanu-novu-krov-rozmovni-kluby-z-atashe-i-ne-lyshe/	2024-11-29T21:03:30-08:00
-Scorpion- is ready to attack again: Turkish defenders are bringing a new version of the armored rec...	In the official release of the manufacturing company emphasized that this versatile vehicle is distinguished by advanced weapons systems and extreme mobility, which makes it necessary for a variety of military missions, ArmiyaInform reports. The new version of BBM Akrep (-Scorpion- in Ukrainian) has added to the line of armored vehicles of Otokar Otomotiv ve Savunma Sanayi A.Ş., a subsidiary of the Turkish financial and industrial group Koç Holding, which specializes in the production of buses and military equipment and whose defense vehicles ArmiyaInform repeatedlyrelate Akrep II to the BBM of the universal segment. The armored two-axle vehicle stands out for its advanced weapons systems and extreme mobility, making it useful for a variety of military missions. Unrivaled maneuverability is achieved thanks to the all-wheel drive system and the additional rear steered axle. These capabilities allow the vehicle to effortlessly navigate difficult terrains, including deep mud, snowpack or water obstacles, as well as successfully overcome natural barriers in combat conditions. If necessary, the driver of the armored car can activate the crab mode, which provides the ability to move in a diagonal direction. In this mode, the rear wheels (see video below) turn in the same direction as the front wheels. If you turn the front and rear wheels in opposite directions, the turning radius is almost halved: the rear wheels steer the car in one direction, while the front wheels steer in the other. The ability to adapt to difficult circumstances makes the Akrep II an excellent option for armies that need a reconnaissance vehicle capable of operating in extreme conditions. The John Cockerilla tower has already received high praise and is recognized as a formidable combat platform. It is designed to integrate a variety of weapon systems, including a medium-caliber automatic gun up to 90 mm. This gun has high firepower and accuracy. The turret stabilization system proved to be an effective ally for conducting accurate fire. It provides the ability to perform aimed shots even while moving, and also allows you to hit targets in different directions at short and long distances. The Cockerill LCTS 90MP turret is distinguished by its high stability and safety due to minimal recoil, which makes it the optimal choice for light shooting systems. This gun works with high-explosive shells and has effective anti-armor capabilities, which allows it to successfully perform a variety of combat missions, including reconnaissance operations. The turret system has become widespread in different countries, in particular, there are more than 300 units in the arsenal. Akrep II is designed to operate with three crew members (driver, commander and gunner) and has a total mass of 15,500 kg. With a length of 5.9m, a width of 2.5m and a body height of 1.97m, as well as a ground clearance of 400mm, this car has a compact profile that contributes to its excellent performance on the ground. The Akrep II 4X4 light armored vehicle is offered in a variety of powertrain options, including diesel, hybrid and electric. These configurations are designed to meet specific operational requirements by reducing thermal and acoustic emissions, which are particularly important for operations requiring cloaking and reconnaissance. The diesel version of the car is equipped with a 360-horsepower engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission, which guarantees reliable operation even in the most difficult conditions. Regardless of configuration, this vehicle offers a number of standard features, including central tire inflation, radial tires with Run-Flat, anti-lock braking system (ABS), as well as air conditioning systems and heating. In addition, it is equipped with five-point seat belts and an advanced driver's vision system. Additional features include Drive-by-Wire technology, a filtering system NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical), a self-extracting winch and a 360° situational awareness system that provides full visibility on the battlefield.

The Army that reads: about the project -Book on the front-, US experience and modern innovations -Cu...	The project leader, Sergeant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Andriy Ovcharuk, told ArmiyaInform about the significance of the book at the front, the connection with the experience of Great Britain and the USA during the First and Second World Wars, and modern Ukrainian innovations. - When did the -Book on the Front- project start and what prompted its appearance? - The -Book on the Front- project started in April 2023, and I joined it from March 2024. Since in civilian life I was the head of the Kyiv office of -Stary Lev Publishing House- - opened bookstores, was a bookseller and sold books myself, I readily agreed when I was offered to lead this project and develop it. I think this idea floated in the air, because such things have already happened before. During World War I, the British and Americans gave books to their troops. Then, during the Second World War, a huge campaign was organized in the USA, during which almost 123 million copies of the books were given to the servicemen of the US Armed Forces. These books simply went to all fronts, 155 thousand boxes were sent every month, each of which contained 40 different books. In total, they had a very large list of over 1,300 items. These included classics, contemporary American literature, entertaining books - westerns, detective stories, and more. — That is, there was a significant demand for books then. Is it the same now? — When many people who were civilians yesterday and are now mobilized join the army, they bring their everyday habits and needs to the army. Our Defense Forces now number hundreds of thousands, more than a million people, a significant number of whom have read in civilian life. Getting into the conditions of war, into the conditions of military service, they retain this need to read. There are also those who are trained as readers already in the army. Military personnel or those who have interacted with military personnel know very well that in the military there are quite often situations where you have to wait a long time. For example, sitting on your belongings until the transport arrives, or being on the guard of some objects, waiting for some task or resting after its completion. Typical are situations where a significant number of people have some free time that they have nothing to do. For many, the main entertainment is the phone, but we want to offer an alternative. The phone isn't always safe, it's not always smart, it's too easy a dopamine hit. In most cases, the phone is not useful, people lose concentration, and things like attention, imagination and concentration are very important in war. - Does the book help to preserve and develop them? - Yes, the book helps to concentrate and think, especially in conditions of uncertainty. When you don't know what to do, the book can help you find a non-standard solution to the situation. Therefore, we want the military to read books and do everything possible for this. -Cultural Landing- is a big project in which musicians, singers, poets, writers, puppeteers take part. People of many creative professions who worked in the field of culture in civilian life. Currently, groups of -Cultural Airborne- travel around military units in the combat zone, visit hospitals and rehabilitation centers, where they perform in front of the military. These can be different events: poet Artem Polezhaka reads poems, puppeteer Valery Dzhek performs plays, Myroslav Jonovich Kuvaldin from the band -The VYO- plays the guitar, Vitaly Kyrychenko sings songs, the most famous of which is -Good Morning, Ukraine-. And when our -Cultural Landing- groups come to the military, they take books with them. After the performance, after communicating with the fighters, they open a box of books and offer to choose something to read. Accordingly, the military choose something to their taste that they like. —Where does the Book to the Front project get the books it distributes to the military?—In the United States, since World War II, the program to supply books to the military has been supported at the state level. The government decided that this was important for the military, who had no other entertainment than reading - when boxes of books arrived, they would instantly take them apart, read them, and exchange them among themselves. It got to the point that after frequent reading, the books simply fell apart. This, by the way, caused a real book boom after the end of the war, because after returning to civilian life, former soldiers continued to read. Book publishing, the book industry experienced a boom - the book market doubled in the first half of the year, and then doubled again in the following year. In the end, it had a tremendous impact on the development of the entire country. For us, this is now happening on a voluntary basis, so the scale is disproportionate. If in the USA during the Second World War there were tens of millions of books, then we are talking about tens of thousands. We offer ordinary civilians, visitors to bookstores, book festivals to buy a book and donate it to the -Book on the Front- project. On this book, you can write a wish, leave a note for the military who will read the book. Having collected books in the rear cities of Ukraine, we hand them over to the -Cultural Landing- groups who go to the front, to educational centers, to military units, to hospitals, rehabilitation centers - wherever there are military personnel. - A paper book has a certain weight, takes up a certain volume - it is not always convenient for a soldier to take it with him. Instead, almost everyone has a smartphone in their pocket. Does the Book to the Front project practice e-book distribution? - Yes, there are several other initiatives within which the military can access e-books. There is an initiative from online bookstore Yakaboo called The Library for Heroes. We are also engaged in the dissemination of this initiative. The reading application has a separate library that contains more than 700 e-books, several dozen audiobooks. According to the promotional code, which can be obtained from us on the -Book on the Front- project, the soldier will have access to this library and can choose anything there. You really won't carry a lot of paper books with you. For example, after reading one book that was obtained during a meeting with the Cultural Landing, I realized that I wanted to read more. So here's your promo code, pick whatever you want, there's a lot to choose from. But paper books are also important, because it is not always possible to charge a phone - electricity is needed. And many people find it more convenient to read a regular paper book - you get used to it, it's nice to flip through the pages, feel them to the touch. - What is read most often, which genres of books are most often chosen and ordered? - Most often, military personnel read fiction books. They provide an opportunity to distract yourself from the military routine, from anxiety, worries about your life. They allow you to immerse yourself in another world, experience vivid emotions. How do imagination and emotions work? They help to relax, rest, switch off from complex thoughts a little. The book helps a lot in this. Of course, there are also people who like to read non-fiction - something serious, non-fiction, self-improvement books. Many people are interested in the experience of previous wars - historical books on military topics are also quite in demand and popular. It doesn't have to be books about our war—it could be books about the Vietnam War, World War II. It happens that comics are ordered, especially in hospitals and rehabilitation centers there was a request for comics. There was even a request from the military from the combat unit to give them the manga. - And poetry, collections of poems - are they ordered, read? - Of course, poetry is very attractive, because it is a short emotional text that helps you get to your own emotions very quickly. Reading an emotional poem, you yourself begin to feel everything more deeply. You can cry, you can laugh, you can experience many different emotions when you read poetry. Many of those who order books ask for poetry. Some resort to the spoken word in training centers, reading poems to motivate fighters during training. Now there are many bright, talented poets in the army. Artur Trony, for example, writes very strong poems. Unfortunately, a very strong poet Maksym Kryvtsov died, his poems became very famous. I have already mentioned Artem Polezhaku - this list can be continued for a very long time. Military service, reliving the personal experience of war prompts both to write and to read poetry. Therefore, poetry collections are chosen for reading quite often. I had an order from one hospital specifically for poetry, I organized the collection and transfer of more than fifty collections of poetry to them. - Where can a soldier put a book after reading it? - These books are gifts, they do not need to be returned. If it is a school, hospital or rehabilitation center, the book can stay in a local, often informal, library where it can be borrowed and read by others. Most often, books are given to siblings by exchanging books. You can also mail someone, family or friends, to read this book too. This allows you to share your emotions, find a common topic for conversation. Books allow military personnel to think more deeply about and relive their own experiences, and become an additional means of communication both among themselves and with those who remained in the rear. After all, a book is an extension of life. We don't know when the war will end, but life still goes on. And books help us to continue living even in the midst of the horrors of the present war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/armiya-shho-chytaye-pro-proyekt-knyga-na-front-dosvid-ssha-ta-suchasni-novacziyi-kulturnogo-desantu/	2024-11-29T20:28:59-08:00
Breaking the truth: the Russians are circulating fakes about drugs in the army	By keyword search experts from -Vox Ukraine- found the original source of the photo that was distributed by propagandists. The original photo appeared on the Facebook page of the patrol police of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Law enforcement officers seized drugs from a woman in the Samara district of Dnipro. However, there is no information in the police report that the detainee was a soldier. The propagandists cropped the original photo and passed it off as a package with drugs, which are allegedly distributed among the fighters of the 95th ODSHBr. The topic of drugs is extremely popular among Russian propagandists. Propagandists have repeatedly stated that drugs are used by Ukrainian military personnel, and that the narcotic substances themselves are grown in Ukraine by Americans in biolaboratories. In particular, we can recall fakes, as if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are creating a -universal soldier- with the help of drugs, and the Third OSH Brigade is forcing recruits to use narcotic substances. All these and similar -throwbacks- by the Russians are lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/lomka-za-pravdoyu-rosiyany-tyrazhuyut-fejky-pro-narkotyky-u-vijsku/	2024-11-29T20:10:10-08:00

The Defense Forces told about the unsuccessful attempts of the Russians to cross the canal in Chasov...	A representative of the 24th OMbr named after King Danyla Andriy Polukhin. -The enemy has been trying to attack our positions in the city of Chasiv Yar in recent days. Their main tactic is to bypass our positions and impose a battle in the rear. But this week they also openly tried to storm, to carry out a mechanized assault. But they did not succeed, they lost a lot of equipment,- said Andriy Polukhin. According to him, the enemy is trying to complicate its offensive actions, and for this purpose it bypasses Chasiv Yar from different sides. He added that in the areas on our side of the canal, the enemy has not established a foothold, but is trying to penetrate in small groups. -Our boys identify them very quickly and work on them. The enemy is trying to accumulate forces in this way, but because of our drones, they are unable to do so,- Andriy Polukhin said. According to him, the canal itself is under fire control of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and even if an enemy group crosses the canal, it is blocked and cut off from its forces. As reported by ArmyInform, on November 29 in the Kramatorsk direction, the invaders > carried out two assault actions near Chasovoy Yar and in the direction of White Mountain. There are currently two ongoing attacks by the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-bezuspishni-sproby-rosiyan-perejty-kanal-u-chasovomu-yari/	2024-11-29T10:37:24-08:00
Why MRAP armored vehicles are the safest against mines	Armored vehicles MRAP (from the English MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected - protection against mines and ambushes) - a class of military vehicles specially designed to protect the crew from undermining on min . The first armored vehicles under the MRAP system were produced back in the mid-70s. For the production of such cars, a special design and technological features were invented, which allow to protect the crew when hitting a mine. These machines have reduced the number of losses many times over. Due to the wedge-shaped bottom, the kinetic energy from the mine explosion is directed to the outside of the armored capsule. When making a V-bottom, it is important to maintain a certain angle. The sharper it is, the more energy is directed outwards and the better the crew is protected. At the same time, the sharp angle of the bottom increases the center of gravity and the height of the car, which reduces the car's rollover resistance and increases the height, vulnerability to anti-tank grenade launchers. When making an obtuse angle, the situation is reversed. The more obtuse the angle of the bottom, the worse the protection against a mine explosion, but the lower the center of gravity and the overall height of the armored car, which increases the protection against grenade launchers and other means of destruction. MRAP armored vehicles are designed according to the modular principle - a monolithic protected armored capsule and remote poorly protected external units: wheels, chassis elements, engine. The latter have an inertial fastening principle, that is, they absorb all the kinetic energy of the explosion. This design allows you to withstand detonation of powerful mines with minimal impact on the crew module. By the way, Formula 1 cars are designed according to a similar principle. Amortization seats and units. The design of landing seats in MRAP armored vehicles absorbs the kinetic energy of the explosion, saving the life of a serviceman. The seats are installed in the places of the least impact of the blast wave. During the explosion, the armor module moves, and the chair remains in place. According to a similar damping principle, other components are installed on armored vehicles so that during an explosion they do not harm personnel. For example, fragments of affected units fly out. Special design wheels. MRAP armored vehicles use wide, low-pressure tires with a high profile. Such tires create low pressure on the surface, so they do not activate the effect of anti-tank mines. The high profile of the tire serves as an additional explosion-absorbing factor. Strengthened ballistic protection. The armored capsule of MRAP vehicles is made taking into account the impact not only of small arms, but also of fragments from explosive devices of various strengths. An example of the application of safe technological solutions is the MRAP Buffalo. At the beginning of 2007, the US Army had 90 such vehicles in its arsenal. During the hostilities, they suffered more than 800 mine explosions without a single loss of crew. This fact provoked the Pentagon to start a program of complex procurement of such machines. The most popular foreign-made MRAP armored vehicles are Maxxpro, Casspir, Oshkosh, Mastiff, Bushmaster, Kirpi, etc. Ukrainian enterprises produce MRAP technology, in particular, armored vehicles of the Kozak, Varta, Novator, etc. families. And what about the MRAP technology in the Rosarmy? Objectively, the Russians also worked on this project. In the context of the large-scale rearmament and reform of the Rosarmy, which actively began after the Russian-Georgian war in 2008, and revived after the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine in 2014, this technology was implemented. For example, we will give the most famous examples of armored cars that were developed by the Russians: It is worth noting one interesting detail. In the West and in Ukraine, armored vehicles, in particular with MRAP technology, are a class of armored vehicles for widespread use in the military. The Russians follow the policy of the Soviet empire: the best weapons and equipment are for the security forces, which are designed to protect the regime, and special forces. For ordinary infantry, a -three-line- is enough. Analyzing open data on orders in the Russian Federation for armored vehicles, in particular MRAPs, their main operators within the country are units of the Russian Guard, force units of the police (riot, sobr), FSB, etc. Paratroopers, scouts and sappers received BBM in the Rosarmy. But for the rest of the ground forces, the command of the occupying army is in no hurry to implement new technological and engineering security solutions, because the life and health of personnel is not a priority for them.

The hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol told how his 95 beat the enemy: interview	The Hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol was the commander of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Army until today. In the spring, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform recorded a long interview with him, we suggest that he be recalled on the occasion of his new appointment. The great war that Russia started against Ukraine 10 years ago, during this period many young but extremely experienced military personnel grew up. who have already entered the history of modern Ukraine as talented military leaders. One of these is the commander of the 95th Separate Polish Airborne Assault Brigade, Hero of Ukraine, Knight of the Cross of Combat Merit, Full Knight of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Colonel Oleg Apostol. During the ten-year war, the paratrooper fought for Slovyansk and Luhansk airport, liberated the Mykolaiv thermal power station in Donetsk region, and from the beginning of the large-scale invasion, also populated areas in Mykolaiv region. With the appointment to the post of commander of the 95th brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, Colonel Apostol led the battles in the Serebrian and Kupyan forests, and now continues to organize defensive and offensive actions in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Exclusively for ArmiyaInform, Hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol talked about his combat journey from platoon commander to brigade commander. — What are the most significant combat episodes of the paratroopers since 2014, in your opinion, will go down in the history of Ukraine? — Undoubtedly, the well-known raid (the raid of the Ukrainian paratroopers, which began in July 2014 during the anti-terrorist operation - ed.), defense of Luhansk and Donetsk airports, battles for Debaltseve. During the breakthrough to Luhansk airport, I led a combat reconnaissance platoon, then I was in the position of deputy battalion commander. The occupiers then tried twice to set up ambushes on the advance route. Having calculated the dangerous areas in time, they decided to play it safe. Ordered two tanks and an armored personnel carrier to occupy the designated line. It saved us and prevented us from being destroyed. Everyone knows that 80-90% of ambushes do not survive&#8230; But the commander should always be able to calculate everything in advance, because then it saves many lives and enables the completion of the task. — Tell us about your first battle with the enemy. — June 2, 2014, when everyone went to storm Sloviansk and Lyman. I was tasked with bringing three artillery batteries into a designated area to support operations. Two batteries were equipped with 122 mm howitzers, and one with 152 mm. I was driving behind the 79th DSHV brigade, and then they were ambushed on the climb to Sloviansk. At that moment, I stopped the convoy, because I realized that the 79th was operating with one of the Jaguar special units. All of them are charged, and I have three armored personnel carriers, one -zushka- and three batteries that are covered with tents and not ready for combat. Then the 79th broke through and went forward to Liman, we stood in a column, and the enemy was on our right and left. I understood that the enemy might start to outflank us, so I gave the command to turn off the headlights, turn right and left, and we took up a circular defense. 15 minutes have passed I got on the armored personnel carrier and decided to move forward. I thought then that if I leave and nothing happens, then we will jump by 2-3 cars. When we realized that the enemy had withdrawn, we first thought how lucky we were, because if the enemy had not made such a mistake, it is difficult to imagine what could have happened if three batteries, each with 6 howitzers and ammunition, had been ambushed. ; This is actually the first moment of the battle, but then there was the first contact battle, when I liberated the Mykolaiv TPP. The first time we went there, it was difficult to detect the enemy, and we conducted reconnaissance by combat. The second time, we already knew where all their firing points were, and we simply stopped them with direct fire from tanks. In fact, after we regularly held them at gunpoint, they began to run away. For the third time, we broke through, unblocked Mykolaiv TPP, occupied the commanding heights - and after that Slovyansk was liberated. - What are the most memorable combat episodes since you became the commander of the 95th brigade? - The first is the assault in the direction of the settlement of Kreminna. We had great success there, but the only thing we lacked was effort. Of the four battalions, only two advanced, because the other two were in other directions. We broke ahead, we literally lacked two kilometers. After that, the enemy brought in significant reserve forces, we switched to defense with the task of defending the Kreminny direction. Secondly, this is the defense of the Kupyan forest, at times it seemed that everything was about to fall, but the enemy could not withstand the dynamics of the fighting. This was clearly visible from their assaults. At first, they attacked 15-20 people several times a day. Then 6–8 Russian soldiers, then two people, and then once a day, a couple tried to go on an assault. As soon as such a turning point comes, we immediately tried to regain the lost positions, which we did. - What units of the Russian army did you have to fight against? - We were in the Flint Forest opposite the 76th Airborne Assault Division, which included the 104th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment, the 234th infantry regiment and the 237th Guards parachute regiment On the eastern side, they concentrated the 228th motorized rifle regiment, the 80th tank regiment, and the 4th separate motorized rifle brigade. I am sure that this enemy remembered us well, because we crushed them so much that some units went out to recover. In the Kupyansky Forest, -Sturm Z- and -Sturm V- stood against us, and when the -Zeks- were finished, the personnel left - the 25th Separate Motorized Rifle Guards Brigade, the 138th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade - this was real -meat -. Analyzing the actions of the enemy, you ask yourself the question, how can you just send people to slaughter like this? But I cannot understand this, because my commanders did not act like this with their personnel. And he himself would never do that to his people. At Terny, units of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army and some assault units of the Tank Army tried to storm us. They have the same tactics here as in the Kupyan forest. They also go in packs, they just put people down. By the way, they call themselves -Kyiv Russia-, but in fact they are simply distorting our history. The most stupid thing is that their people are led by such narratives and believe that it is normal to send people to their death. All this is welcomed by the people, because then they can buy a car. Of course, it is worth noting that the -stacking- tactics of the occupiers is paying off. We have seen this in Bahmut, Soledar and other destinations, but our advantage lies in pure intelligence and technological development. — Your brigade took many prisoners. Will they admit their guilt for all the evil they have committed on our land? - When the occupiers are captured, they immediately become different people. It is clear that at first the characteristic phrases are heard: -We have been abandoned, we are offended by everything and everyone, barefoot, poor, unhappy and hungry.- They behave as prisoners should, they don't show their character, they give us information about where their command posts are, what paths they took, who is senior. If compared with the captives who were at the beginning of the large-scale invasion and now, then I call this -party- mercenaries, because they stupidly go to kill for money. No one catches them and forces them to go fight against Ukraine and kill our civilians and military. This is a purely conscious choice of each of them. When I talk to them before handing them over to replenish the exchange fund, they all say that they were aware of the possibility of their death, but they came to make money. But we understand that they have come to destroy our people. And there is nothing sacred about them. - Which settlements did your brigade liberate? - Our brigade de-occupied Dovgenka, Krasnopill, Makarivka, Pasika, Dolyna, Kamianka, Sukha Kamianka, Studenok, Koroviya Yar, Yatskivka, Krymka, Synycheno. Then they moved to the settlements of Krymka, Shandrigolovo, Zelena Dolyna, Kolodyazi and reached Ploschanka. The Kharkiv operation was well planned by the senior commander, it was correctly selected units, the direction of our shock fist, support and a clear assessment of the enemy. The enemy really relaxed then, they were confident - and that also worked against them. While still a member of the 80th DSHV brigade, he met the war in the position of battalion commander. Such a first moment, which will be remembered forever and will go down in history, is the defense of the settlement of Voznesensk. After successfully repelling the enemy's offensive, we moved to offensive actions. And then they liberated the following settlements in the Mykolaiv region: Arkhargelske, Katerynivka, Kashpero-Mykolaivka, Novopetrivske, Novofontanka, Dobrokamyanka, Ingulets, Vynogradivka, and in this way we reached Yavkina, and already near Snigurivka we supported the enemy. The outlying villages that we held there were: Shiroke, Chervona Dolyna and Kobzartsi. Oh, and we won trophies then! - Which trophies were the -fattest-? - Well, the most I can point out is REB -Resident-. In addition to it, there were gas tankers, water tankers, bathhouses, armored personnel carriers, tanks of various models of the T-72BZ type and modifications, D-30 howitzers, engineering vehicles, MT-LB, pickup trucks, many shells and even to the Grad anti-aircraft missile system. In general, we received such a normal lend-lease from the Rashists, it was -gifted- to us by the 126th separate brigade of the coast guard and the command post of the army. - How has the training of Ukrainian paratroopers changed over these 10 years? - Definitely for the better. Everything we invest in the training of young recruits is invaluable experience forged in battles on our own experience. We in the brigade have developed our own material base and assembled a group of experienced instructors who skillfully manage personnel for each type of combat and explain all the nuances. For me personally, the combat training of personnel is extremely important. — A few months ago, I saw with my own eyes how you set an example and taught the paratroopers of your brigade. To be honest, I was impressed not only by your professional approach, but also by how much your actions motivate the personnel. — Yes, then I gathered my instructors and another certain category of officers and showed all those points that need to be improved in preparation for further training of soldiers on the battlefield. Of course, these are not all dogmas and things are different in battle, but absolutely all situations are analyzed from real battles. We constantly monitor the enemy's channels, watch how our defenders act, analyze where there was success and what caused it, and where we could have done differently. That is, constant analysis of oneself and the enemy gives an understanding of how to plan the course of hostilities. If a person is trained and clearly knows what he should do, then this is already a great destiny of success, because it is the soldiers who forge our Victory in the trenches. And then an extremely important point is the moral and psychological state of my paratroopers. All of us are waiting for our relatives at home. A person should always understand what he is fighting for and what will happen if we do not fight, if we do not overcome this evil now, then Russia will not let us go so easily and will destroy us. — At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, many Ukrainian media underestimated our enemy and dispelled myths that the occupiers were weak and weak. What can you say about this and how often the enemy changes? - If they were weak and weak, we would have knocked them out long ago to the borders of 1991. You can never underestimate your opponent. Russia is a really big machine with a huge human resource, which they do not spare. They are abandoning their people by the thousands and will continue to do so, because history repeats itself. In addition, the occupiers learn quite quickly. Many examples can be given. Russia learns a lot from us and uses it against us in the future. - Did you dream of becoming a paratrooper as a child? - Definitely yes. I never considered infantry or other types of troops. When I was little, in the 7th grade, I had about 300 toy soldiers, up to 100 pieces of equipment, aviation, special forces. All the money that I saved and that my relatives gave me, I spent on my plastic army. I put them against each other according to the scenario, simulated the landing of the landing force and developed various battle sequences. It happened that I was so engrossed in the placement of soldiers that I did not come to the actual battle. After all, I was a child, and I switched to another game, for example, I went to play football, because the placement itself took more than an hour. I have also loved historical films and the history of Ukraine since childhood, constantly read memoirs and historical novels. It was then that my desire to become a soldier was born, I could not see any other way for myself. - What personally gives you strength and how do you motivate your personnel? - Gives strength when the day or battle has passed without loss. War dictates its terms, so you can never get too lazy. I understand that it can be difficult for me mentally at times, because you are constantly worrying about your people, that they are all alive and well, but we understand that it is the hardest for the soldier there. Yes, we plan everything with the brigade leadership, combatants, conduct reconnaissance, provide artillery support, but nothing will happen without soldiers. Therefore, I sincerely want all people to respect our real heroes, because many of them have already given the most valuable thing - their lives. Russia is an enemy and an evil that we must stop. I have lived in this world for a reason, at least we have already avenged both the Cossacks and the Kruts. Now our job is to reclaim the rest of ours. Here you are either the hunter or the prey. — What do you wish for the youth who dream of joining your ranks? What traits do they need to nurture? — DSHV is an elite. I even tell my boys, when they're a little off balance, to remember that they're paratroopers! It will always be difficult, because war is merciless and unfair. We all realize what a tremendous amount of work has been done here to earn the proud title of paratrooper. I wish the youth to cultivate courage, to be physically hardy, to study the entire history of Ukraine, because this is not the first time we are fighting this enemy. Putin's appetite is growing, and it will not stop. He is becoming, and may have already become a copy of Hitler himself, without realizing it. Everyone will have to fight, it is necessary to accept it as it is and with a cold mind. The main thing is to remember and honor all our fallen Heroes!

The results of the Security Cooperation Forum: who ignored the hysteria of the Russian Federation	The FBS is the OSCE's main platform for arms control, as well as disarmament, confidence-building and security measures, on the basis of which it cooperates for stability in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions. Russia tried to disrupt this meeting even before it began. In particular, during the adoption of the agenda, the Russian delegation stated that there was no consensus regarding the proposed project. In their statement, the Russians demanded from Denmark: The Russian delegation also demanded to immediately start consultations between the Russian Federation and Denmark with the involvement of -third parties-, in particular Malta and the OSCE Secretariat. In response to Russia's actions, the presiding country resolutely confirmed its position on the impossibility of blocking the agenda, which contains only minimal items (-General statements- and -Other-). The Danish side also rejected accusations of abuse of power. Only Belarus supported the Russian demands, and the delegations of the EU, Ireland, Sweden, the USA, Switzerland, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia, France, Great Britain and Georgia expressed their full support for the Danish approach and called for the continuation of the meeting. All this theater was organized to disrupt the performance of Ukraine at the FBS. But our delegation, headed by T.V.O. the permanent representative of Ukraine to international organizations in Vienna, Victoria Kuvshinnikova, who initiated consideration of the issue of the ongoing Russian aggressive war against Ukraine, nevertheless gave her speech on this occasion. -Ukraine, Europe and the whole world need a comprehensive, just and durable peace. Ukraine, as the main victim of Russian aggression, wants an end to this war more than any other country. But this must be real peace, not appeasement of the aggressor. Ukraine is open to diplomacy, but from an honest, strong position. That is why we have the Peace Formula - it is a guarantee of negotiations without forcing Ukraine to commit injustice. Ukrainians deserve a just peace and we must do everything to end the war next year. Unfortunately, the Russian Federation continues to reject all peace initiatives aimed at restoring justice in accordance with the norms and principles of international law. The criminal regime in the Kremlin still believes that it can achieve victory and change the international order according to its own vision. However, despite repeated claims that Russia has one of the most powerful armies in the world, it is still far from military success even after 1,000 days of intense fighting against a country 28 times smaller in size and almost four times smaller in population.- — said the representative of Ukraine. She also emphasized that the successes of the Russian army are based only on a complete disregard for the rules of warfare and a huge amount of -cannon fodder-. Therefore, the Russian army can be defeated, and the international order can be restored. This goal can be achieved only under the condition that all peace-loving states join forces to force the Russian Federation to end the war and recognize its responsibility for the crimes committed. Statements were also made by Great Britain and the EU, and statements by the United States and Canada were distributed in writing. Thus, for the second time, the Danish chairmanship of the FBS decided to ignore Russia's demands and limited the Russian delegation's ability to speak at the Forum. Such a position, in the opinion of the Embassy of Ukraine, corresponds to the interests of our state, since the actions of the chairmanship emphasize Russia's isolation and the weakness of the aggressor's position in the OSCE arena. In addition, the Danish reaction to Russia's actions caused significant damage to the image of the Russian Federation, emphasizing the destructive nature of its actions and the illegality of its demands.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/pidsumky-forumu-bezpekovogo-spivrobitnycztva-hto-proignoruvav-isteryku-rf/	2024-11-29T06:04:40-08:00

It is noted that the intruder, having access to the orders of the Ministry of Economy, according to which decisions were made regarding the reservation of conscripts, made fake extracts from the relevant orders. -He provided them with unreliable information that these citizens allegedly work for various critical infrastructure enterprises and are subject to a 6-month deferment from being called up for military service during mobilization,- the report said. In addition, he produced forged documents regarding the belonging of this or that enterprise to the category of critical importance for the functioning of the economy and ensuring the livelihood of the population in a special period, as well as regarding the reservation of their employees. It was established that documents related to employees of 12 enterprises, in total, related to 454 citizens, were forged. Depending on the complexity, the -service- cost between $200 and $2,000. The documents produced by the attacker were used during the verification of military registration documents of citizens, were entered into the Unified State Register of conscripts, conscripts and reservists, and were also used when crossing the state border of Ukraine. Such machinations harmed the legitimate activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations during martial law. Law enforcement officers conducted 20 searches, during which computers, media, forged documents and lists of persons who used the illegal scheme were seized.

Consequences of a drone strike at a children's clinic in Kyiv: there is destruction and a victim	notifies of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. In particular, there was damage to the exterior cladding of the facade, the entrance group of the building and the windows. At the scene, an injured polyclinic guard was found with a closed fracture of the left femur and a contusion. In addition, in the Dnipro district, near the damaged polyclinic, the destruction of facades and glazing of windows in three multi-story residential buildings was recorded. Rescuers and medics continue to work at the site, assessing the consequences and providing assistance to the victims. As reported by ArmyInform, specialists of the pyrotechnic division of the Mobile Rescue Center of Rapid Response of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine remains of the Kh-55 aviation cruise missile were discovered in one of the districts of the capital.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/naslidky-vluchannya-drona-v-dytyachu-polikliniku-v-kyyevi-ye-rujnuvannya-ta-postrazhdalyj/	2024-11-28T21:12:19-08:00
There is no translation for the -Cossack- family: how to improve the armored car -Cossack-	Andriy Kharuk, a well-known researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petr Sagaidachny, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent about the history of the creation of this vehicle. Today is the continuation of the conversation, and the first part of the interview can be read at link. — Andriy Ivanovych, at the beginning of our conversation, you mentioned that the premiere sample of this armored car has already attracted the interest of potential foreign buyers. As far as I know, the manufacturer of this type of special equipment had further plans to enter the international market. What did they consist of? — In addition to the basic version, the Praktika company created a modification of the Kozak-2M2, which was offered for export. In particular, with the optional replacement of the Iveco engine with Deutz or Caterpillar, as well as the manual gearbox with an automatic one. This variant could be equipped with a three-door or five-door body. It was planned to establish the licensed production of Kozak-2M2 in Indonesia. In December 2021, the first Indonesian prototype was demonstrated, but there is currently no information on the further development of this project. —And then the third and subsequent generations of -Cossacks- appeared. What can you tell us about them? — BBM -Kozak-3- is a Land Rover Defender all-terrain vehicle booked by -Practice-. The work was carried out on the order of the State Border Service of Ukraine, and the batch of manufactured machines probably does not exceed several dozen copies. Very little is known about the Kozak-4 - it is described as a 15-passenger transport vehicle that was tested in the National Guard. An alternative to Iveco units was the use of the chassis of the American Ford F-550 car. The Kozak-5 prototype, built on this basis, was presented at the -Weapons and Security-2016- exhibition. Unlike Kozak-2, this car was positioned not as an army armored vehicle, but as a police vehicle, including for special-purpose units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The chassis of the Ford F-550 specially modified for the construction of an armored car by the company - an official converter (reinforced front axle, brakes and suspension elements replaced with stronger ones, installed large 335/80 R20 wheels, replaced gear pairs in the bridges - ed.). The eight-cylinder Power Stroke turbodiesel with a working volume of 6.7 liters develops a power of 390 hp. The transmission is a Ford TorqShift six-speed automatic. -Kozak-5- is lighter than -Kozak-2- - it weighs 10 tons. In the basic version, the armored car accommodates eight people. The design of the body is generally similar to -Kosaku-2-, but in the rear wall, instead of double-leaf doors, single-leaf doors are installed. — But the -fifth- -Cossack-, figuratively speaking, somehow did not go well with the service in the Armed Forces. What, in your opinion, is the reason? — The basic version of the Kozak-5 does not have weapons, but it can be equipped with a machine gun on a turret. And in October 2017, at another -Weapons and Security- exhibition, a variant with a BPU-1 tower from BRDM-2 was demonstrated, in which KPVT (caliber 14.5 mm) and PKT (7.62 mm) machine guns were installed. Unlike Kozak-2 and Kozak-2M armored vehicles, Kozak-5 did not arouse much interest in the Ukrainian military. Only one vehicle is believed to have been transferred to the National Guard in the spring of 2017. She was received by the special forces unit -Vega-. The Armed Forces of Ukraine did not purchase a single armored vehicle of this type before the beginning of the Russian large-scale invasion. Instead, Praktika managed to get an order from Saudi Arabia for 60 armored vehicles. The first batch was ready to be shipped to the customer in April 2021. However, apparently not all Kozak-5 armored vehicles were delivered to Saudi Arabia by February 2022 - photos of such vehicles at the front appeared in the spring and summer. They differ from the armored car given to the National Guard in some details, in particular, the design of the headlights. — However, one of the variants of the Kozak-5 BBM turned out to be a valuable acquisition for Ukrainian sappers, for whom, unfortunately, jobs are constantly being added&#8230; — A special variant of the Kozak-5MPL is intended for demining groups State service for emergency situations. It serves to transport unexploded mines and improvised explosive devices. The difference is a longer wheelbase and a special body design designed to detonate mines/improvised explosive devices that are transported. In addition, the car is equipped with a compartment for a special tool of the pyrotechnic team. In June 2018, the State Emergency Service received eight Kozak-5MPL armored vehicles. — There was an attempt by the manufacturer to create a Kozak-6 special vehicle — In the summer of 2021, the Kozak-6 was produced and tested, a car with a four-door body without a roof. She was appointed to participate in military parades and even took part in the rehearsal of solemn events in August 2021. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine planned to purchase three -armored convertibles-, but this idea was quickly abandoned, so the Kozak-6 prototype was returned to the manufacturer. — However, the -Cossack- manufacturers did not abandon the idea of ​​providing the Ukrainian army with their armored vehicles. What did the -seventh- Kozak turn out to be? — Yes, the last representative of the BBM data line is the Kozak-7 armored car. Unlike the -policeman- -Cossack-5-, it is positioned as a purely military vehicle. The base chassis of the Ford F-550 has been significantly strengthened - wheel hubs from the US Army JLTV vehicle, reinforced axles and new springs have been installed. The body became three-door. The mass increased to almost 12 tons. Compared to Kozak-2M1, the armored car has better ergonomics, improved dynamic characteristics, as well as lower cost and simpler production technology. On the other hand, it has a frame structure, which was considered the main drawback of the Kozak-2 and became the reason for the appearance of the Kozak-2M1 machine with a supporting body. - This model of armored car has its own -export- history of creation. - Kozak-7 armored car was created for an unnamed foreign customer according to an individual technical task. On January 25, 2022, this machine was demonstrated to the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Under the conditions of a large-scale Russian invasion, exports were out of the question. However, a certain number of Kozak-7 armored cars were still produced. Since January 2023, their appearance at the front has been recorded, and in May 2023, information appeared about the use of such armored vehicles by the Airborne Assault Troops. Taking into account all of the above, it can be concluded that the Praktika company has created a fairly extensive line of armored vehicles with a 4×4 wheel formula, which are based on the use of imported civilian units. These machines, primarily Kozak-2 and Kozak-2M1, are widely used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine to ensure the mobility of light infantry units (primarily Airborne Assault Forces, Marines and National Guard - ed.), as well as to support the actions of Special Operations Forces . —Mr. Professor, with this conclusion you have effectively summed up the creation and development of the -Cossack- line of BBM in the period before the large-scale invasion of the aggressors. But the manufacturers of Kozak machines continued their improvement after the start of the great war. — In August 2023, a video appeared of the Kozak-2M1 with a new weapon option — a remote-controlled module with a 14.5-mm KPVT machine gun. In June, this module was already spotted on another carrier - MT-LBu, converted into an ersatz BMP (the designation BMP-1LB is found - ed.). The origin of the remote-controlled installation is unknown, but some conclusions can be drawn from its image. Several lenses of the optical station suggest the presence of a night channel (infrared or thermal imaging - ed.). The module is also equipped with a protective shield in the front projection, which hints at the lack of adequate bulletproofing of the installation itself. The gunner controls the module using a joystick. The level of execution of the combat module suggests that it was produced in Ukraine by one of the defense enterprises already during the large-scale invasion. Its weapons are powerful enough to destroy light armored vehicles - Soviet BMP models or armored personnel carriers. However, in my opinion, it would be desirable to supplement the KPVT with a 7.62 mm machine gun for effective damage to manpower. At this time, it is not clear to me personally whether this armored car is a new production, or perhaps repaired after damage. However, the improvements were not limited to a new weapons module - the car also received a digital TV camera for the driver. The production of -Cossacks- continues. Yes, at the end of April with the participation of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov the transfer of 40 vehicles of this type to the 225th separate assault battalion took place at once (15 Kozak-2M1 and 25 Kozak-5). In my opinion, this is a very revealing event against the background of the failure of the German company to supply 400 ordered armored vehicles of the same class. Ukrainian manufacturers manage to increase production even under the conditions of war. This fact cannot help but infuriate our enemies, because photos from this event have already been posted on anti-Russian websites. - Over the years of service, -Cossacks- have become in demand in various units of the Defense Forces. - Indeed, the family of -Cossacks- continues to grow. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in July notified about the codification of the medical evacuation armored car -Kozak-5MED-. Like the standard Kozak-5, it has a frame construction and uses the chassis of the Ford F550 pickup truck. The car is equipped with a 330 hp diesel engine. and automatic transmission. -Kozak-5MED- accommodates four wounded on stretchers, or six seated, as well as the driver and the personnel of the medical evacuation group. —The category of these machines for direct combat use continues to develop. What innovations are you aware of in this direction? — I would like to note that the Ukrainian Kozak-5 armored vehicles received a combat module from the company Escribano Mechanical &amp; Engineering for a 12.7-mm machine gun. The module has day and infrared cameras with autofocus, as well as a laser rangefinder. The combat module can automatically follow the target taking into account corrections and fire in several modes. — Protecting armored vehicles from combat drones today poses relevant challenges to the manufacturers and operators of BBM. What has been done to protect the crews of the armored vehicles we are discussing? - Recently, a message was published on the page of one of the domestic manufacturers about a new development - a set of protective anti-drone screens for the Kozak armored vehicles. As you can see from the photo, the design of the screens is well thought out and protects the car from all angles. It is reported that different versions of the kit developed are adapted to specific modifications of the Cossacks. The first 18 kits will be transferred to the 46th Separate Assault Brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/kozaczkomu-rodu-nema-perevodu-yak-vdoskonalyuyut-bronovyk-kozak/	2024-11-28T21:04:35-08:00
50 thousand -British-, -The Sun- and death for Ukraine: what Valery Zaluzhnyi actually said at Inter...	The British government made this firm and factual statement on the occasion of the 1,000th day of the Russian Federation's large-scale attack on Ukraine. She quite worried the Russian propaganda, which tried to interrupt the information agenda. ArmiyaInform tells about how Russian propagandists tried to use the authority of the -Iron General- and now the Ambassador of Ukraine to Great Britain Valery Zaluzhny and the Western media with the aim of spreading anti-Ukrainian narratives. More than 50,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been trained within the framework of Operation Interflex, a training program for recruits with no or little military experience according to NATO standards on the territory of Great Britain. About reported in the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom. -The UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with our Ukrainian allies since day one of Putin's illegal full-scale invasion - providing international support, training 50,000 new recruits and supplying weapons, drones and other critical military equipment,- UK Defense Secretary John Gealey said. The press release of the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain was published on the occasion of 1000 days of large-scale war. It contains an assurance of the United Kingdom's unwavering support for Ukraine and a firm promise to help the Ukrainian people in their just struggle as much and as long as it is necessary. On the same day, British Deputy Defense Minister Luke Pollard together with Ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Valery Zaluzhny met with the Ukrainian military who are training on the territory of STANTA - Stanford Training Area in the county of Norfolk in the north east of england -The training of over 50,000 Ukrainian recruits on UK soil since the start of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is an achievement that cannot be overstated,- said Luke Pollard. During the meeting, Valery Zaluzhnyi addressed the Ukrainian military personnel undergoing training with a short motivational speech. He emphasized the importance of the training mission in Great Britain for the high-quality training of the Ukrainian military and urged them to learn the main things every soldier needs here. Valery Zaluzhny's speech was generally correctly reported by the well-known British media -The Sun-, although the publication about the address to the Ukrainian military came out with a somewhat provocative headline characteristic of a tabloid: -KILL OR BE KILLED. Watch how Ukrainian troops training in Great Britain are told to -kill without hesitation- in a moving speech by the former -Iron General-. Recruits of the heroic army of Ukraine must learn to kill Russians -without hesitation-, The Sun clarified the words of the former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The publication cited a direct quote from Valery Zaluzhny's speech: -When you see the enemy, kill him before he tries to kill you or your comrade.- The Sun also published video report about the visit of high-ranking officials to the training base on the territory of STANTA. It also contains a video recording of Valery Zaluzhny's speech to Ukrainian soldiers, which allows you to hear exactly what he said in his address to the Ukrainian military. The -Iron General- began his speech by stating that modern warfare is becoming more brutal every day and leaves very little chance of survival on the battlefield. Valery Zaluzhny emphasized that fighters should learn not to be afraid of death and bravely look the enemy in the eye. It was these words that Russian propaganda tried to falsely present as a statement that Ukrainian fighters on the battlefield seem to face only inevitable death and the only thing they should learn is the absence of fear of imminent death. This is how the Russians tried to devalue Great Britain's undeniable colossal contribution to Ukraine's support, including the training and full equipping of more than 50,000 soldiers. To promote a false thesis, the Russians traditionally resorted to the usual propaganda techniques - pulling out of context, focusing on a part of the information and silencing everything else, manipulative statements and appeals to the authority of the Western media - this time they massively referred to -The Sun-. Instead, by looking at the video recording and the full text of Valery Zaluzhny's speech, it is not difficult to make sure that he was talking about completely different things that are completely unfavorable to Russian propaganda. He called the main tasks during training in Great Britain the need to learn how to survive on the battlefield, to take care of one's own safety and to save one's comrades, and to carry out a combat mission by killing the enemy without any extra thought. The -Iron General- urged not to die, but to kill for Ukraine and to survive himself and to help a comrade in arms survive. After all, to be ready to die for the Ukrainian people does not at all mean to be doomed to death, and death should be accepted first of all by the Russian occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/50-tysyach-brytancziv-the-sun-i-smert-za-ukrayinu-pro-shho-naspravdi-skazav-valerij-zaluzhnyj-na-interflex/	2024-11-28T20:37:40-08:00
The Ministry of Defense reported what new specializations appeared in military universities	The Department of Military Education and Science of the Ministry of Defense informed ArmiyaInform about this. -According to the decisions of the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and on the basis of detailed applications for the training of military specialists with higher education, sent by customers for the training of military specialists, new specializations have been introduced since 2024: -International cooperation in the field of defense and the military sphere-, -Management of the actions of units marine unmanned systems (complexes)-, -Operation and repair of marine unmanned systems (complexes),- the agency said. The greatest competition for admission to training in 2024 was observed in specialties that train commanders of mechanized units, units of Airborne Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces, computer technology specialists, military lawyers, military psychologists, and specialists in international relations. The listed specialties were popular among both boys and girls. At the same time, girls were enrolled in all specialties on equal terms with boys. The agency noted that during this year's induction campaign, the percentage of combatants from the total number of enlisted servicemen in 2023 was 30.5%, in 2024 it was 36.2%. Previously ArmyInform reported that at military universities this year the most popular among women were majors and specializations, according to which prepare commanders of mechanized units, units of Airborne Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/u-minoborony-povidomyly-yaki-novi-speczializacziyi-zyavylys-u-vijskovyh-vyshah/	2024-11-28T20:22:47-08:00
the Russians mirror their crimes: they invented a fake about looting in Kurshchyna	Yes, now they are reproducing a photo of a box with allegedly Russian products that fighters in the Kharkiv region received. Such a gift was apparently given to them by the military 154 OMBr from the Kursk region. However, this is not true. Ukrainian names of products are visible in the photo, they are not sold in the Kursk region. These photos were probably taken by Ukrainian volunteers to report on the aid given to the Defense Forces. Such fakes are aimed both at the domestic Russian consumer, to whom they are trying to prove that it is the norm for any military to rob stores, that it is not only the soldiers of Putin's army who do it, and at the Ukrainian, to whom the enemy is trying to show that the Armed Forces have problems with provision	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/rosiyany-viddzerkalyuyut-svoyi-zlochyny-vygadaly-fejk-pro-maroderstvo-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-28T20:07:32-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, on the night of November 28, the enemy -i-35-vorozhyh-bpla/->struck Ukraine with various types of missiles and attack drones. In general, several areas were hit by Kalibr rockets using cluster munitions, which significantly complicate the elimination of consequences for rescuers and energy workers. As a result of the anti-aircraft battle, almost 90% of Kalibr and X-101 cruise missiles. Also, three guided air missiles and 35 enemy UAVs were shot down, more than 60 were lost in location. A total of 12 hits were recorded, mainly at the facilities of the fuel and energy sector.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/u-povitryanyh-sylah-zsu-pokazaly-zbytu-v-czentri-ukrayiny-raketu/	2024-11-28T11:51:33-08:00

After a short rest, the battle continued, with a firefight lasting about three hours. As a result, the enemy group that crossed the border was destroyed. -Valery has been serving in the Armed Forces since February 2023. He joined the army voluntarily. There are episodes in his fighting days that will one day be told as heroic deeds, but Valery himself believes that he is no braver than an ordinary person. Four children are waiting for him at home,- said the Ground Forces. As reported by ArmyInform, the combat training instructor of the 79th separate amphibious assault brigade of the Taurian brigade with the call sign -Luna- told about contact battles with the occupiers in Mariintka and the first meeting with enemy FPV drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/perebuvav-u-povnomu-otochenni-ale-znyshhyv-vorozhu-grupu-istoriya-bijczya-na-psevdo-most/	2024-11-28T11:13:33-08:00

The priority of the 2025 state budget will be security and defense: Rustem Umyerov cited key figures	reported this by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. In particular, in 2025, 26.3% of the country's GDP or UAH 2.23 trillion will be allocated to defense, which is UAH 47.6 billion more than in 2024. Among them: 1.16 trillion hryvnias are provided for the financial support of our soldiers, which is 10 billion hryvnias more than in 2024. UAH 739 billion will be allocated for the purchase and renewal of weapons — this will allow the army to be modernized, providing it with modern weapons systems for conducting effective combat operations. UAH 55.1 billion will be used to modernize production capacities of the defense industry and develop the latest technologies. Funding for the purchase of unmanned systems, in particular DeepStrike, has also been significantly increased. -This budget is our response to the challenges of war. It is aimed at strengthening the country's defense capabilities, supporting our defenders, and developing the defense-industrial complex. Every hryvnia is an investment in the victory and peaceful future of Ukraine,- Rustem Umyerov concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/priorytetom-derzhbyudzhetu-2025-bude-bezpeka-ta-oborona-rustem-umyerov-naviv-klyuchovi-czyfry/	2024-11-28T10:34:14-08:00
In Donetsk region, the occupiers shot four more Ukrainian prisoners of war	This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office. On November 22, representatives of the Soviet Union launched an attack on the position of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, located near the village of Petrivka, Pokrovsky district. During the enemy assault, four servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were forced to surrender. Immediately after that, the occupiers opened fire on them with automatic weapons. Deliberate killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a grave international crime. Currently, investigative actions are underway to establish all the circumstances of the crime and the persons involved in its commission. Under the procedural guidance of the Donetsk regional prosecutor's office, a pre-trial investigation was started on the fact of violation of laws and customs, combined with intentional murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). As reported by ArmiyaInform, the Zaporizhia Regional Prosecutor's Office opened criminal proceedings on the fact of the shooting of Ukrainian prisoners of war near Novodarivka, Zaporizhia Region. According to preliminary data, on November 24, 2024, in the area of ​​active hostilities near Novodarivka, servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces shot five of the six Ukrainian defenders taken prisoner.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/na-donechchyni-okupanty-rozstrilyaly-shhe-chotyroh-ukrayinskyh-vijskovopolonenyh/	2024-11-28T10:19:23-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Putin is brandishing his -oreshnik- to frustrate Donald Trump's efforts	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi said this in his evening address. -He can wave his -nutcracker- now only in order to frustrate President Trump's efforts, which will definitely take place after the inauguration. Putin wants to escalate the situation now so that President Trump will not be able to end the war,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. The president added that today in Kazakhstan, Putin again advertised his missiles — his readiness to kill and destroy. -Putin obviously wants to add thousands more to the thousands of missiles that have already hit Ukraine. He does not need the end of this war. Moreover, Putin wants to prevent others from ending this war,- the head of state said. He emphasized that Putin is the only culprit of this war and the only one who believes in the war. And that is why Putin's escalation now is a pressure to later force the US president to agree to Russia's terms. As ArmiyaInform reported, on November 21, the Russians hit the Dnipro with a new medium-range ballistic missile based on the older Rubezh ICBM, which is a potential carrier of a nuclear warhead. GUR IOU reported that Russia struck by using a ballistic missile, probably from the -Kedr- missile complex.

Fighter -Luna- took part in contact battles in Maryinka and met with 9 enemy FPV drones	An interview with himappearedon the unit page. -After training in training centers, our recruits undergo additional training already in the combat zone. Combat training, says the sergeant, is constant and systematic work on oneself. And it is impossible to achieve perfection in it. Because war changes every day. That's why training never stops,- the paratroopers said. How to act in the most difficult situations and under fire, how to move during the operation of enemy attack and reconnaissance drones - all this -Luna- knows not from books, but from its own, real, experience. And shares it with those who go into battle. -When we entered Maryinka, it was already difficult there. The hardest thing was not to hold the position, but to get in and out of it. Everyone mostly moved along the roads. Wherever possible, they went around houses and foundations, but mostly it was roads, and they were shot at, birds are constantly flying, constant resets,- said -Luna-. He remembered how once he and the boys left the position with two three hundredths, and the Russians, who were 154 meters away, opened fire on them. -We helped ours, ours helped ours, and it turned out as it should. Sitting with three hundred all day is not an option. And they started running. So they ran from funnel to funnel, to the first foundation, to the first building. It's hard,- he shared his memories. The paratrooper also described his first encounter with enemy FPV drones. -9 FPVs flew to us in 15 minutes. There was a structure, and a hole was punched at the bottom and, as in a dugout, a descent into the basement. And we started jumping in there, miraculously without loss. This was my first experience with these FPVs. We were used to resets then, and here half the house is gone. -Mainly the loss is due to the fact that people are not trained,- he emphasized. According to him, in order to save life, one must constantly learn. -Luna- works every day with those who join the ranks of the Tavrian paratroopers. Earlier, ArmiyaInform told about the story of a fighter with the call sign -Prytsyl-. He fights in the drone battalion air complexes of the Perun Group of the 79th Tavrian Assault Brigade.

Combined strike of the Russian Federation: the Air Force of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of ...	This was reported by the Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. -The enemy attacked critical infrastructure — electrical substations in various regions of Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is a hit,- the message reads. In addition to cruise missiles three guided air missiles and 35 enemy UAVs were shot down, more than 60 were lost in location. A total of 12 hits were recorded, mainly at the facilities of the fuel and energy sector. The PS of the Armed Forces reported that recently, during air attacks, the enemy has been using a large number of missiles and drones. Their massive use in certain directions often exceeds the number of means of cover. In addition, the enemy uses modern means of air attack, constantly improving them. It is about the firing of thermal and radar traps, and also uses EW means of personal protection installed directly on the missiles. -All this significantly complicates the operation of Soviet-made anti-aircraft missile systems that are in service with the Air Force. Western systems work much more effectively in such conditions, which in Ukraine are not sufficient to reliably cover hundreds of critical infrastructure facilities. That is why, during massive enemy attacks, maximum forces and means are used, including aviation, electronic warfare, anti-aircraft defense and mobile fire groups,- the Air Force said. It is also noted that on the eve of attacks, the enemy takes into account meteorological conditions, which significantly affect the work of mobile fire groups and fighter aircraft. Dense fog and cloud cover, which were observed in many regions at the time of the attack, did not allow the pilots and calculations of the MVG to effectively perform their tasks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/kombinovanyj-udar-rf-povitryani-syly-zsu-rozpovily-detali-ta-naslidky-vorozhoyi-ataky/	2024-11-28T04:14:00-08:00

Reports were made by representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the Ministry of Veterans Affairs of Ukraine and the National Health Service of Ukraine. -Earlier there were specialists in Ukraine, but there were only a few of them. The 2014 war gave impetus to rehabilitation in Ukraine. In 2020, the rehabilitation law came into force, multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams appeared, and finally full-fledged development began. We entered 2022 with a completely different rehabilitation than it was in 2014, and today we continue to grow. Such measures, in particular, give rise to a professional discussion about what the rehabilitation of the future should be,- said Oksana Sukhorukova, head of the Department of Health Protection at the Ministry of Defense.

The representatives of the network shared their experience of working with multiple injuries, which are often accompanied by significant bone defects, deep burns, vision and hearing impairments. The program of the event included master classes, in particular, on the methods of electroneuromyography for nerve injuries, and mirror therapy for the treatment of pain. Special attention was paid to the training of personnel and the level of postgraduate education in the field of rehabilitation medicine, which is a key element of quality care. The international experience of training doctors was analyzed together with experts from the USA, Israel and Singapore.

Emphasizing the partnership between the state and the private sector, Nataliya Husak, head of the National Health Service of Ukraine, noted: -Building the rehabilitation system in Ukraine, we clearly understand that we are not alone. The state is not alone, medical professionals, defenders are certainly not alone. We have a large number of international partners, public figures and benefactors. We and the RECOVERY network share common values ​​- people-centeredness and dignity, so I am sure that together we can improve the quality and accessibility of the medical field in Ukraine.- The RECOVERY national network envisages the development of a professional community, which is why it regularly organizes professional programs to acquire new knowledge and practical skills. Thus, doctors have the opportunity to exchange practical experience with colleagues, to master modern and innovative methods of rehabilitation.

The reservoir adds its uniqueness — it is small, located in a lowland, and makes very [significant] corrections, the drone commander said. The high water level makes it difficult for the Ukrainian military to stay at their positions and carry out logistics. - Now everything is complicated by the fact that we are facing not only the enemy, but also weather and natural phenomena. It is because of this reservoir that the water is rising now, and in our positions it makes it very difficult for our maximally coordinated movement actions, and in general, the presence of personnel directly in these lowlands. The situation is very difficult and the water level is very high, - said the defender.

Voyyskovyi also explained the significance of Liptsi for the defense of Kharkiv. — As for Liptsi, their geographical position is a very strategic settlement, on its outskirts there are operational heights that, if God forbid, will be lost, then this will give a direct view of the city of Kharkiv itself and the approaches to it. This will make our logistics very difficult. If the enemy starts to use direct strikes with artillery systems, it will be very difficult for us to move, to store our ammunition, - explained the fighter with the call sign -Cat-.

Trump, Putin and more than 220 clashes per day: an expert explains why the front is getting even hot...	Why the number of enemy assaults has increased so significantly, military expert Petro Chernyk explained to ArmiyaInform. -This is connected with major geopolitics. Putin set two clear and understandable tasks. The first task: before Trump's inauguration, seize Donetsk region at any cost, and similarly, before Trump's inauguration, knock us out of Kursk region at any cost. Does the enemy have the human potential for this? Unfortunately, there is. The total mobilization resource is within 3 million people. This is very, very much. The average figures of their conscription are somewhere in the range of up to 40,000 personnel per month. And I think that in this proportion they will continue to train themselves. Do they still have a certain margin of strength, say, in terms of armored vehicles? Let's look at the example of tanks. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, they had 3,400 full-time vehicles, but there were still up to 10,000 in warehouses at that time, which is quite a lot. And part of the equipment we destroyed, the enemy managed to restore. Approximately the same applies to artillery. We have already destroyed more than 20,000 units. But they may still have 3,000-5,000 barrels of all calibers. However, we must understand that they cannot and will not be able to build a full-fledged artillery. The comprehensive margin of strength, which is currently calculated for the Russian Federation, is somewhere within the limits until the summer of next year. And then the real problems of both military and economic nature will begin. That is why the Russians set themselves the goal of seizing as much of our territory as possible and knocking them out of Kurshchyna. This is all we need to understand why the number of armed clashes has increased. It is extremely important for us to stay in the Kursk region until the summer, until the next cycle of dry weather. And it is extremely important that we retain Donetsk region also for the summer of next year.

Currently, he is performing combat tasks as part of the calculation of anti-tank missile systems. His comrades say that he quickly navigates in extreme situations and has already destroyed more than 10 units of enemy military equipment and weapons. ArmyImform succinctly asked soldier Mykhailiuk about his path to the Defense Forces, his participation in the war, and, therefore, the approaching victory over the enemy. — I ended up in the army at a time when the long queues at the TCC stopped, and you could come calmly to the reception. On April 18, he arrived at the TCC, passed the medical examination, and already on the 19th, he left for Desna, the soldier recalls. Next is basic military training. — I already served in the army in 2008-2009 as a conscript. Therefore, I remembered, so to speak, what was once. Passed everything I knew. Nothing new. But they taught about radio communication, special devices. Everything happened in an abbreviated form. It was not difficult for me. All in all, there was plenty. The most vivid memory during the BZVP is scary, but interesting, says the soldier. — There was rocket fire, evacuation of a military unit. I was the driver - I was there -to and from- our outermost soldier from our battery. We assumed that there could be another shelling of the military unit, but, despite all the threats, we got fuel, made several walkers, took out all the people and all the things. The military destroyed more than 10 units of enemy equipment and weapons. We ask the soldier to recall the most vivid case when he managed to work on enemy equipment. Each destroyed enemy vehicle, the military officer states, is both -greasy- and -delicious.- But in October 2023, it was -as fat and tasty as possible.- — Then it was both dangerous and most interesting to beat them. Because there were so many of them, and because of that it was easy to beat them. But we had a connection, although the Russians thought that they had jammed it for us. We were completely controlled by the company. The commander was in constant contact with us. We knew how many enemy vehicles were coming. Yes, they already came in 3 pairs of deuces, 2 pairs of deuces&#8230; And we could already work for them, since we had the calculation of -Stugna- and their trophy -Cornet-, then we had a chance to do everything right. Therefore, their -Cornet- repulsed the attack. So we knew how to destroy them more easily and quickly, and that we would not get anything for it. There was excitement, it made sense to choose (enemy equipment.— Ed.). For example, 2 tanks, 2 BMPs and a trawl drove in. We immediately had the urge to destroy the trawl so that it did not pave the way for our infantry. We didn't let them get up,'' the army man recalls. But after that, he says, the enemy launched a powerful shelling with artillery and aviation: - There was a fire, it was burning, everything was in smoke, we had to change positions. But they failed to destroy us. Each combat exit and each launch is the brightest that can be, the soldier does not hide his emotions: - Nice exit, nice hit. The most interesting thing was when we destroyed their observation post. Then we had to go through a forest strip in the Swativ district, about 5 kilometers. It was approximately three kilometers through the gray zone and 2 kilometers through the red zone. They approached them, 2 km from the enemy observation post, and destroyed it. Later, he says, there was training on enemy tanks: - They came from closed positions and constantly gave nightmares to the infantry at different times. We found an enemy tank, but we couldn't get to it, it wasn't coming any closer. So we came as close as we could to get it anyway. It was a distance of 5200 - almost unreal. He was standing far from the line of scrimmage. And we destroyed him with a javelin. It was a good shot, and the detonated tank burned to the ground. Only the sides remain, and I think it is still there. We ask whether a soldier is afraid during such combat sorties, and if so, how does he cope with this fear: - Fear is in every person. But we have harmony, the commander constantly helps us. We know where we are going, what we are doing, what awaits us. That is, there is no fear as such. But when you perform a combat mission, fear disappears altogether. Yes, when they give you a short briefing and show you what you have to do, yes, there can be some fear. And when you already get into that zone, have already entered, there is no such fear at all. The mood is always fighting - in all boys, not only in me. And what would an army officer advise civilians who, for various reasons, have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces? — There is nothing to be afraid of the army: there are shelling all over the country. And the sooner recruits join the army, the better it will be for our country, and the sooner we will defeat the onslaught of the horde, says Oleksandr. The military dreams of the borders of 1991: — But initially victory is when we stop the Russians and the shelling of our cities stops. And in the future, I am sure that we will reach our borders in 1991.

Blasters are already on the agenda: in the Republic of Korea, they are thinking about arming the tro...	How informs the Army Recognition portal, during the work of the international defense exhibition KADEX 2024, which took place in the Republic of Korea and united the leading players of the global arms and security industry, the development of the local firm LIG Nex1, the newest laser rifle, attracted the attention of visitors, ArmyInform reports. The manufacturing company is positioning its latest creation, which has not yet been named, as a rifle designed specifically for modern combat conditions. This compact and lightweight weapon, equipped with advanced technology, offers not only high power but also stealth, making it ideal for military operations where efficiency and stealth are important. -The rifle produces an extremely low noise level, which allows soldiers to remain invisible during operations. In addition, the low-noise cooling system maintains the optimal temperature of the weapon, preventing overheating during prolonged use,- Army Recognition experts said. Designed for easy operation by individual soldiers, the LIG Nex1 laser rifle features advanced technologies such as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) laser generation. This ability allows the fighter armed with it to hit targets that are not directly visible on the battlefield, providing a tactical advantage in the confrontation with the enemy, especially in difficult conditions where visibility is limited. Featuring high-power laser technology (one kilowatt level), this rifle combines lightness and power, offering soldiers increased efficiency without sacrificing maneuverability. Its discretion and effectiveness make this weapon an essential tool for operations that require precision and stealth. At the same time, official data on the capabilities of the laser rifle are not disclosed. The product at the exhibition was equipped with an adjustable stock, bipods and an optical sight. Shin Ik Hyun, CEO of LIG Nex1, expressed optimism about the impact of KADEX 2024 solutions. -We hope that the solutions presented at this exhibition will not only strengthen the military potential of the Republic of Korea, but also contribute to the expansion of the global presence of K-defense (South Korean arms industry),- said the Korean businessman. Founded in 1976, LIG ​​Nex1 is a South Korean company specializing in the development and production of advanced weapons systems. It offers a wide range of defense products, from precision munitions to electronic warfare systems, drones and tactical communications systems. LIG Nex1, based in Yeonin, Republic of Korea, is a major supplier to the South Korean military and also exports its technology around the world.

The Kremlin spreads the thesis that Ukraine has already lost the war: for what purpose	This was noted by the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. His specialists found out that The National Interest is owned by Dmitry Simes, who actively supports Russian propaganda. After 2022, he is in the Russian Federation and is accused by the US Department of Justice of violating sanctions, which carries a sentence of up to 60 years in prison. The publication has long been associated with pro-Russian views, and Symes himself moderated events organized by the Kremlin and received funding from Russian state structures. This message aims to undermine faith in the Victory of Ukraine and encourages citizens to doubt their country's ability to continue the struggle. Such rhetoric also helps to create the illusion that aid to Ukraine is futile in order to discourage Western powers from providing arms and financial support. In this way, Symes justifies further crimes by the Russians, while at the same time creating the appearance of strength and invincibility of the Russian regime for a domestic audience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/kreml-poshyryuye-tezu-shho-ukrayina-vzhe-prograla-vijnu-z-yakoyu-metoyu/	2024-11-27T20:03:57-08:00

But when the next drones flew up and saw that it was scattered into molecules,- the man recalled. In addition, -Ajax- stopped an attempt by a Russian tank to fire on Ukrainian defenders. -I myself was under fire from a tank and I understand how an infantryman feels when such equipment works on him. They contacted the eyes of someone flying there, took off, saw that it was working. They struck him. Luckily we stopped him. They wanted to go, but they couldn't because we damaged their engine. And with the next few copters, they finished off that tank,- he said.

The largest center for wounded soldiers of the RECOVERY national network has opened in Chernivtsi	Today, the center is the largest in the RECOVERY network, which Viktor and Olena Pinchuka founded to help the Security and Defense Forces. The RECOVERY project is an example of a successful partnership between the private sector and the state, when philanthropists create innovative rehabilitation centers on the basis of public medical institutions. The new center is designed for 61 beds, which makes it the largest in the RECOVERY national network today. The state-of-the-art center is built on three floors of one of the key medical facilities in Bukovyna. During a meeting with the military at the newly opened center, the founder of the RECOVERY project, Viktor Pinchuk, remarked: — Do you know what I felt at this, the 15th, RECOVERY center? How much it is necessary to do everything now so that our defenders realize: the state, society and the private sector value them, now they are literally our VIPs, because the most important for the state are those who are just now at the front, and those who goes to the front - and also added: - We do everything according to the highest global standards, and there is hope that we set them for everyone: the state, other philanthropists, foreign partners. That is, the standard will be all over the country. The center was equipped according to world standards of inclusivity and technology, providing the highest level of rehabilitation for our soldiers. The complex of simulators and devices covers the entire range of possible functional disorders, in particular injuries resulting from mine and explosive injuries. Physical rehabilitation rooms are equipped with virtual reality (VR) equipment that provides feedback to the patient. Such equipment contributes to the gamification of rehabilitation processes, which, in turn, increases the intensity of training and accelerates the recovery of patients. Task-oriented exercises add motivation, and built-in analysis programs allow you to effectively monitor the patient's condition and evaluate the results of rehabilitation. In addition to VR technologies, the list of equipment equipped with the center includes bobat and massage systems, rehabilitation complexes for limbs, simulators for balance correction, joint mobilization and sling therapy. Like other centers of the chain, RECOVERY in Chernivtsi is equipped with the requirements of inclusivity of premises: wide doorways, no thresholds, medical anti-slip flooring, handrails in the corridors, sanitary rooms for people in wheelchairs and showers with seats and handrails. On the first floor of the rehabilitation center there are rooms for physical rehabilitation (large and small), an occupational therapy room, as well as rooms for physiotherapy, laser therapy, assistive technologies, psychotherapy (group and individual) and a speech therapist. In addition, there are two massage rooms, staff rooms, inventory and pharmacy rooms. The second and third floors are reserved for 22 rooms: 4 single rooms, 6 double rooms, 3 three-room rooms and 9 four-room rooms. Each ward is equipped with functional beds, inclusive bathrooms and comfortable furniture. In addition, the floors are equipped with medical stations, dining rooms and treatment rooms, which ensure comfort and quality medical care for patients. Chernivtsi OVA also joined the creation of the center in Chernivtsi, allocating funds from the regional budget, as well as territorial communities of the region. This made it possible to arrange the roof, the entrance group according to accessibility norms and to insulate the premises. — Thanks to the work of a powerful multidisciplinary team and modern equipment, we expect not only a doubling of the possibilities of providing rehabilitation assistance, but also a high level of its provision. Today, it is extremely important that the military personnel who defend our country receive timely rehabilitation assistance, - noted Vitaliy Polataychuk, head of the medical institution on the basis of which the RECOVERY center operates in Chernivtsi. RECOVERY's multidisciplinary teams consist of physical rehabilitation medicine specialists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, massage therapists, assistants, speech and language therapists, and psychologists. An individual rehabilitation plan is developed here for each injured person, and thanks to innovative equipment, patients receive high-quality and evidence-based rehabilitation care at the highest level. RECOVERY is a national network of rehabilitation centers for wounded soldiers. Today, in addition to Chernivtsi, RECOVERY rehabilitation centers provide free services in Kyiv (two facilities), Lviv, Chernivtsi, Rivne, Lutsk, Vinnytsia, Cherkassy, ​​Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Odesa (two facilities) and in the Dnipro region (three facilities). In total, 18,000 patients have already received rehabilitation assistance in the centers of the national network.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/u-chernivczyah-zapraczyuvav-najbilshyj-czentr-dlya-poranenyh-vijskovyh-naczionalnoyi-merezhi-recovery/	2024-11-27T10:38:48-08:00

Medical collapse and cold batteries: the realities of Luhansk region after the occupation	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, residents of the region, from Kreminnaya to Sorokino, are forced to turn to medical facilities in Luhansk. The situation is complicated by the lack of doctors, especially narrow-profile specialists, which leads to the formation of long queues. In Seversko-Donetsk, problems with centralized heat supply continue. The occupation administration promises to provide heating only in the houses located near the STKE boiler house, but even in these areas, not all apartments have heat. Due to the mass absence of residents in many houses, technical difficulties arise with the supply of heat, which confirms the absence of the promised return of people to the city. As of the end of November, most of the high-rise buildings in Seversko-Donetsk remain without heating. As reported by ArmyInform, opening of a -patriotic education center- in occupied Siverskodonetsk , which the Russian occupiers planned for September 1, is postponed again. The reason for this was the delay in repair work due to the embezzlement of funds.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/medychnyj-kolaps-i-holodni-batareyi-realiyi-luganshhyny-pislya-okupacziyi/	2024-11-27T05:31:44-08:00

Many of them have recently undergone training on training grounds, and some are involved in assault operations and conducting reconnaissance of Ukrainian positions. Previously, a significant part of the prisoners were former prisoners who, in exchange for amnesty, joined the ranks of the Russian army, but now their number has decreased - many of them will no longer be able to return to the battlefield. In some cases, there are special forces soldiers among the prisoners. However, in general, the Russian army compensates for losses by recruiting people with financial difficulties - many new recruits and mobilized are motivated by promises of money to pay off debts or mortgages. In the Kupyan direction, as Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn noted, Russian units are replenished mainly with prisoners and mobilized. At the same time, cases of suicide among the occupiers due to fear of being captured were recorded. This is the result of Russian propaganda, which spreads lies about brutal torture by Ukrainians. Despite this, the zone of responsibility of the -Khortytsia- OSU is marked by numerous cases of surrender. One of the latest is the story of a Russian soldier who surrendered, saying that -it is better to live in captivity than to die at the hands of his commanders.- He reported that the Russian command threatened him with reprisals for refusing to follow orders. According to Nazar Voloshin, such cases demonstrate the demoralization of the Russian military and the complexity of the situation in their ranks. As reported by ArmyInform, -occupiers turned Bakhmut to a logistics hub-: warehouses and hospitals were placed in the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/polon-chy-samogubstvo-u-zsu-opysaly-portret-typovogo-rosiyanyna-z-bilym-praporom/	2024-11-27T03:15:37-08:00

Attack -Kedrom-: the expert explained why Putin hit the Dnipro	Oleksandr Musienko, manager, told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyny- marathon. of the Center for Military Legal Studies. According to Oleksandr Musienko, the Russian dictator's threats are truly unprecedented - this type of weaponry was not used even during the Cold War. However, the Russian dictator still fears a conflict with NATO. -The strike was on the city of Dnipro, that is, away from the borders directly with the North Atlantic Alliance. He did not hit the west of our country, and the missile did not fly there. That is, he was still wary and afraid of provoking a certain reaction from the West,- Oleksandr Musienko is confident. This proves that the launch of a new ballistic missile, states Musienko, is nothing but another element of the Russian dictator's nuclear blackmail. Earlier ArmyInform told that as of October of this year, Russia was supposed to produce two experimental rocket samples from the Kedr missile complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/ataka-kyedrom-ekspert-poyasnyv-chomu-putin-udaryv-same-po-dnipru/	2024-11-27T01:17:34-08:00

Propagandists launched an anti-Ukrainian article in the media: why are they in Greece?	On November 26, the site -Banking news- with a reach of 6.5 million users in Greece published article with just a wild set of Russian narratives. It is dedicated to the so-called -Ukrainian nationalist battalions -Azov-, -Aidar-, -Kraken- and others-, the destruction of which, in the opinion of Greek propagandists this time, is -one of the main goals of the Russian invasion of Ukraine-. In the material, the Greek pseudo-journalists quote the sanctioned ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Spyridon Kilinkarov, Russian military analysts Oleksandr Sharkovsky and Oleksandr Perendzhiev. They accuse units of the Armed Forces of various war crimes typical of daily Russian propaganda. The material was obviously made at the behest of Russia and is spreading through the Greek-speaking segment of the Internet with the clear aim of discrediting Ukraine, the Defense Forces of our country and specific units. Such publications are made to undermine the confidence of foreigners in Ukraine and to reduce their support. In October, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, and the Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, signed the Security Cooperation Agreement in Brussels, which confirms Greece's readiness to continue providing the most urgent defense needs of Ukraine. Therefore, such information -leaks- specifically in Greece can be directed against a specific security agreement.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/propagandysty-zapustyly-v-media-antyukrayinsku-stattyu-nashho-cze-yim-u-grecziyi/	2024-11-26T21:57:01-08:00

Will South Korea enter the war on the side of Ukraine: expert's opinion	-At the beginning of November, everyone admitted that the North Korean military was on the territory of the Russian Federation and may even have taken part in hostilities. We had first very cautious assessments, then we had positive assessments. Now we will receive them in doses, because this information still has a great political and diplomatic weight. Therefore, it will not appear quickly. Some will try to hide it, but we will try to get it as soon as possible, use it as soon as possible. The question now will be whether international institutions are ready to do something about it. As we can see from the latest reaction of most international organizations, unfortunately, they are not ready to act according to even their own statutes. That is, how they should react to Russian aggression, how they should react to Iran's actions, how they should react to North Korea's actions, no one is reacting. Therefore, now the North Korea factor, most likely, will be the catalyst that the world order that exists, those interstate organizations that exist, will be forced to change their approaches to events and to their activities. As for the reaction of other countries, in particular, South Korea, here it is necessary to know their military doctrine, how it should react to North Korea's indirect aggression against another state. But we are already seeing the -first swallows- appearing in the international space. We know that North Korea will also demand the participation of a Russian contingent in a possible war against South Korea. I don't think South Korea is very excited about that prospect. After all, the Russian army is absolutely different. There are units that we despise, but there are also units that give us a huge amount of trouble. And South Korea, the United States of America, and NATO also understand this very well. So the activity of other countries will depend on how well their doctrinal documents correspond to the existing situation, on the one hand, and on the other hand, how ready the military-political leadership of other countries is to react to the situation that is emerging.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/chy-vstupyt-pivdenna-koreya-u-vijnu-na-boczi-ukrayiny-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-26T21:07:20-08:00
More than 150 shots per day: CAESAR crushes Russians in Donetsk region. Reportage	We arrive at the specified point, where the gunners are already waiting for us. Just like us, in body armor and helmets. Because it can already fly here. - Follow us. We pull into the position, unload, our car drives away. Then you stop by. Here the safety rules are written in blood, so it is better not to break them. Let's go. We will drive past the mines. Some were destroyed by the arrivals, others continue to work, despite the approach of the front. From time to time, towering tericonas are visible from the road. Fields between them. The harvest from them has been collected, but the winter crops have not been planted. Apparently, local farmers are waiting for what will be here in the spring. The road is getting worse, there are more and more potholes, as well as tracks of heavy equipment. We turn around at one of the landings, drive through the field. The front car stops, passengers get out of it, the car starts. Next, we will land. We enter the landing, among the trees we see the CAESAR self-propelled gun, hidden under a canopy made of a metal mesh, on which a camouflage net is draped. We are met by the gun crew. Her commander, sergeant Andrii, is of medium height and wiry. He has a phone and a tablet, necessary for combat work, sticking out behind the automatic stores on his body armor. We welcome you. Andrei says that he is waiting for the goal. If we're lucky and the target is there, we'll go to the fireground and see CAESAR in action. Meanwhile, Andriy talks about his gun. — Before that, I fought on the Soviets: -Hyacinti-B-, D-20, -Vsti-B- and I can say that CAESAR, if compared with them, is like -Mercedes- and -Zhiguli-. - What is its greatest advantage? - It is maneuverable. On CAESAR, you arrive at the firing line, lay down in a minute, quickly work and drive away, and you don’t wait to see if it will fly in response or not, as is the case with trailed guns. And it's coming fast now. Both -Lancets- and FPV drones began to fly far, and enemy artillery, and now also KABs were added. So speed becomes an important advantage. - And what, do you actually have time to spread out in a minute? - You will see for yourself if there is a goal. In this regard, CAESAR works clearly. We arrived at the place, the gunner entered the coordinates, so we are ready to shoot. - And what was the highest rate of fire you had in practice? - The same as in TTX, 6 shots per minute. You can't do it faster than the manufacturer's set, because there are a lot of sensors that you can't fool. But there is no need, because here everything is done for the safety of shooting. And conveniences. The same automatic loader helps a lot, because you don't need to stuff the shells with your hands, and they weigh a lot. Once our CAESAR was under repair and we were working on a domestic gun. I manually loaded 18 rounds and tore a muscle in my stomach. So, if offered, would never change CAESAR to anything else. CAESAR has a crew of four. According to French standards, there should be 5 of them, but then it is too cramped in the cabin, which for the crew is their native home, especially now that it has become cold. They joke that they take off their shoes when they enter the cabin. — When I worked at the towed artillery, we had to constantly dig dugouts nearby so that there was a place to live and hide during shelling. CAESAR with its armored cabin is much more comfortable in this sense. - Have there been such approaches when the armor protected? Ironically, it is at this very moment that a rather loud -babah- is heard. Whether it's a departure or an arrival, I involuntarily bend over, the gunners just look around. — Once a -Lancet- flew at us, hit the roller. We had minor injuries, one of the hoses broke, but the car was not damaged, the damage was quickly repaired and we continued to work. Andriy and his crew work on the older version of CAESAR (produced in 2007), they say that they would not like to switch to the new one. — Because the new one is much larger: there are four axles instead of three, it is longer and higher, it is difficult to hide it in the landing, you have to dig a much larger caponir, and it is not so maneuverable. And there are much more electronics there, which increases the probability of some kind of breakdown. Of course, something can break in us too, because we work actively, and this is iron, it is not eternal. But we repair something on the spot, our repairmen trained in France work with something, and the enterprise that provides maintenance is already engaged in serious repairs. - There is a stereotype that Western equipment is too poor for the conditions of our war. - It all depends on service. If it's serviced well, it works well. CAESAR is a gentle machine. But if you take care of it correctly, follow all the rules for maintenance, then it works well. Andriy finally gets the coordinates of the target. — Two shells, we are working to ban actions. This is when enemy activity is detected, fire is placed on that area to force them to abandon their plans. — We are leaving for the firing position! The crew gets into the cockpit, the CAESAR quickly moves out of hiding and heads to the pre-equipped firing position. There are several such positions, they are constantly changed to confuse the enemy and prevent him from hitting. According to Andrii, his CAESAR often takes part in counter-battery combat, that is, strikes at enemy artillery. — We work on absolutely everything: from jet artillery to barrel artillery. We worked against both -Hyacinta- and -Msty-, we reach everything. We also hit mortars, anti-aircraft guns, even anti-aircraft systems. In the Vugledara area, they once worked on the Strela air defense system. It is clear that we are hitting and being hit, so we need to act quickly. CAESAR unexpectedly pulls into a forest strip. At first it seems that it is going straight to the trees, but then you notice a carefully cut gap in the wall of the trunks. CAESAR fits perfectly into it and falls under the arch of trees that cover from above. The crew leaves the cabin. The gunner turns on the computer and lowers the hydraulic plate, which provides a stop during firing. The driver prepares the gunpowder needed to hit the targets, and the loader programs the detonators, which are wound onto the projectile. The gun commander dictates the coordinates of the target, the gunner enters them into the computer. The barrel of the gun is raised and aimed. The branches in front of him are cut so as not to interfere with the projectile. CAESAR is ready to fire in exactly one minute. Second to second. - Fire! — Shot! If it wasn't for the headphones, it would have been very loud. The next projectile is already on the loading machine, which delivers it into the barrel of the gun. Followed by gunpowder, shutter closes. - Fire! — Shot! Another -babah-. Already dry leaves begin to fall picturesquely from the trees. However, the crew is not into romance. The plate rises, the barrel lowers, the computer near the gun turns off. And now CAESAR is rapidly leaving the firing position. The enemy has almost no chance to hit him in response. They just don't have time. —Mr. Andriy, what is the record for shots per day? — The maximum shot per day was 153 shots. But it is very difficult. Health minus 1. Now we are steadily firing 60 shells a day, sometimes up to 90. — But CAESAR ammunition is only 18 shells. — Yes. So we shot them, drove off and reloaded, we continue to work. — But 153 shells, that’s 9 rounds per day! — I mean, it’s difficult. — And how often do you have to change the barrel with such intensity of shooting? — It all depends on its condition. This barrel has already fired 4,000 rounds. But its condition is normal, we just take into account the correction for wear. We have such barrels that fired 6,000 shells each. Our specialists will check for wear, if it is significant, then the barrel is replaced with a new one provided by the French manufacturer. - This is the first barrel on your car? - What about you, the barrels of all the guns have already been changed three or even four times. Because we work every day, without days off. - And what is the maximum firing range? - We had 41 kilometers, it is an active-reactive projectile. Usually, we work on targets at a distance of 14 to 36 kilometers. - Have you been working with cluster ammunition for a long time? - Yes, a few days ago. We shoot them regularly. - What about the famous American -Excaliburs-? - Many used to work. And worked very well. In 2023, when the enemy was advancing on Vugledar in the winter, we fired 52 Excaliburs in one day. This is a very good projectile. Because if you work with ordinary projectiles, you need 2-3 shots for close range. And -excalibur- shot one - and it hit the target exactly. CAESAR returns to its hideout in the landing area, where it will await new targets. During the day, the guys can rest a bit, because most of their shooting is at night. I ask for permission to hold the projectile in my hands. It weighs over 40 kilograms. I take it in my hands and understand that, even with the presence of a charging mechanism, the work of the charger is not easy. We photograph the crew against the background of his car: Andriy is the commander, Yevgeny is the gunner, Kyrylo is the driver, Bohdan is the loader. For those who don't know, CAESAR is an acronym for the French CAmion Equipé d'un Système d'ARtillerie, meaning -truck equipped with an artillery system.- This truck causes a lot of trouble for the enemy and helps our infantry a lot. We wish the boys success and good luck in their difficult but necessary combat work. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/ponad-150-postriliv-za-dobu-caesar-troshhyt-rosiyan-na-donechchyni-reportazh/	2024-11-26T20:57:56-08:00
Autocivilka for UBD: what will change in 2025	According to article 13 of the Law, participants in hostilities, persons with disabilities as a result of the war, who personally drive their own vehicles, are exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance on the territory of Ukraine. That is, it is not necessary to issue anything. There must be documents for a car and a UBD certificate or a person with a disability due to war. But already from January 1, 2025, you will have to issue a driver's license. Article 13 of the Law suffered certain changes. And now there are no categories of citizens who are exempt from compulsory insurance. In return, combatants will receive a discount. In particular, for them, -the amount of the insurance premium under the domestic insurance contract is reduced by 50 percent.- But there are also certain nuances. The discount is provided for a vehicle that has an engine displacement of up to 2500 cubic centimeters or an electric motor power of up to and including 100 kilowatts and is owned by a combatant /strong>, provided that such vehicle is driven exclusively by the insured or by a person who also owns to preferential categories, and using a vehicle without the purpose of providing paid services for the transportation of passengers and/or cargo. Another important point is that the amendments to the Law indicate that the reduction of the insurance premium can be applied at the same time only regarding one vehicle of the insured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/avtoczyvilka-dlya-ubd-shho-zminytsya-u-2025-roczi/	2024-11-26T20:46:59-08:00
Seven years to the goal: in Turkey, the development of a mortar system with the possibility of 360° ...	As indicates the official portal of the manufacturer, this advanced system combines high accuracy, mobility and versatility, which makes it an effective weapon for various types of combat missions, ArmiyaInform reports. The SM-81 Keskin mortar is equipped with an 81 mm barrel with a length of 1.453 meters and a manual vertical slide. The system provides full circular horizontal firing (360 degrees) and an elevation range of −5 to +82 degrees, which is manually controlled by pointers. A hydropneumatic recoil system is installed above the barrel to soften recoil. Depending on the type of ammunition, the firing range is from 100 to 6,000 meters. Shots are fired through the trigger mechanism, which allows precise control of fire. The SM-81 Keskin mortar supports both direct and indirect guidance. For direct fire, the system is equipped with a six-fold day sight, a thermal imaging camera and a laser rangefinder, which ensures accuracy of aiming at distances up to 6 thousand. meters Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition note that when firing with an indirect with guidance, the system is loaded from the muzzle and supports two options for firing: the normal mode, when the projectile falls on the fixed trigger pin, and the trigger fire, in which the striker is activated by the trigger. If the angle of the barrel is less than 30 degrees when firing with a direct aim, the system allows loading from the breech, which expands its tactical capabilities. The SM-81 Keskin is compatible with various types of standard 81mm ammunition, including high-explosive, smoke, and illumination rounds. To improve shooting accuracy and simplify control, the system has a 10.1-inch screen that displays a digital map and ballistic calculations for elevation correction and horizontal guidance. In addition, GPS/INS technologies are implemented in the system, which ensure more accurate hitting of targets even in difficult conditions. The total weight of the mortar system is 450 kg, which allows it to be installed on light trucks for high mobility on the battlefield. The diameter of the system's pedestal is 770 mm, and its height varies from 1005 mm to 1980 mm depending on the position of the barrel. In addition to being mounted on vehicles, the SM-81 Keskin mortar can be used for stationary defense of bases or other key facilities. One of the main advantages of the SM-81 Keskin is the ability to fire 360 ​​degrees without reorientation between shots. This significantly reduces the time to prepare for firing and reduces vulnerability to counter-battery fire. The system is optimized for mobile deployment and high rate of fire, making it an essential element for modern warfare that requires flexibility and precision. Specialists of the iNEWS portal underline the fact that at the level of SM-81 localization Keskin is a cost-effective solution. More than 90% of the parts and components of the mortar system were designed and manufactured by Turkish contractors. The SM-81 Keskin system is an important addition to the arsenal of today's armed forces, providing high firepower, flexibility and reliability. Its mobility, accuracy and ability to be used in various scenarios make it an effective tool for both defensive and offensive operations. SM-81 Keskin 81mm Mortar System.

The Ukraine-NATO Council discussed the Russian strike on the Dnieper with a new ballistic missile	This was reported by the press service of the Alliance. The meeting was held at the level of ambassadors. Senior Ukrainian military officials held a video briefing for the members of the Council. -During the meeting, the Alliance members confirmed their support for Ukraine. The attack, which was directed at the Dnipro, is seen as another attempt by Russia to terrorize the civilian population in Ukraine and intimidate those who support Ukraine, which is defending itself from Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression,- the message reads. As NATO spokeswoman Fara Dahlalla previously noted, -the deployment of this potential will not change the course of the conflict and will not distract NATO allies from supporting Ukraine.- The Ukraine-NATO Council is a platform for consultations between Alliance members and Ukraine on security issues of mutual interest, including Russia's aggressive war. The meeting was chaired by Acting Deputy Secretary General of NATO Boris Ruge. The next meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council should take place during the meeting of foreign ministers of the Alliance member countries, which will be held on December 3-4.

MARCH is on the march: the cadets underwent an intensive 16-hour training in takmed	All conditions are created here for high-quality and fast training of combat medics, paramedics and soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -The cadets take the basic ASM (All service members) course with us, which is coordinated with the current Ukrainian standard of providing first aid. Here, they have the opportunity to hone their knowledge and skills directly during simulations of injuries and combat injuries, taking into account all the stress factors that accompany them,- says Diana, head of the tactical medicine center. Training takes place in full compliance with the MARCH first aid protocol (Massive bleeding, Airway Management, Respiration, Circulation, Head injury / Hypothermia / Hypovolemia) in all possible phases: -red-, -shelter-, -evacuation-. The training itself lasts 16 hours over two days. Each cadet practices this protocol independently. For this, models are used, or another cadet plays the role of the wounded. Certain marks simulate wounds (injuries) of varying complexity, according to the nature of which certain methods and means of assistance are used. Simulation of combat conditions helps cadets feel real responsibility and practice the skills of using various auxiliary medical devices (tourniquets, decompression needles, occlusive stickers, hemostatic bandages, etc.). It is also extremely important to take coordinated actions in the shortest possible time during the organization and evacuation of the wounded. In general, during the training, future officers must master the CLS (Combat Life Savior) level, which corresponds to the functionality of a medical marksman. Training takes place under the supervision of experienced combat medics. The principle -train as you will fight- applies - it educates the cadets' endurance and prepares them for actions in extreme combat situations, where the ability to save one's life and the life of a comrade is one of the most important tasks. -We work according to the MARCH protocol. First, we examine for the presence of massive bleeding, then we work with consciousness and breathing problems, tamponate, glue and carry out evacuation,- says cadet Mykola about the basic course of tactical medicine. Testing and awarding of certificates are ahead. And one more step towards receiving the rank of -lieutenant- will be taken.

Ministry of Defense: An interdepartmental commission is investigating the causes of the abnormal act...	About this Ministry of Defense reported November 26. -The absence of comments in the public space does not mean that the Ministry of Defense is inactive or does not respond to information that comes from the military or appears, in particular, in the mass media.

What are the advantages of the corps-brigade system: an expert on the new concept of reorganization ...	This may also mean how much the military management system will improve, said military expert Petro Chernyk: -We have a major combat unit, a brigade. However, we understand that the brigade does not fight by itself, considering the fact that we have a huge section of the front with a total length of about a thousand kilometers. Some number of brigades are fighting. The next control body that appears is the so-called tactical group, which can include 7-8 combat brigades. This is where the first problem appears. The command of the tactical group is a collective mess. This is not a permanent unit, it is temporary. There is a constant rotation of officers, which can actually reduce the quality of combat management of such large units. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that a full-time corps should be organized.- A corps can be anywhere from 4 to 7 brigades with the entire command network deployed. Why did they bypass the division link? A divisional unit is 3-4 brigades and is a duplicating body. There, again, a bunch of commanders, a bunch of operatives are needed there, they will be engaged in nothing but dubbing of the corps link. Could it have gone the divisional route? No. In my opinion, this is counterproductive. The conditional corps is 6-7 brigades. These are two divisions. So, instead of one corps level, there would be two divisional levels, which in the end creates a shortage of officers for such a large number of troops. What is the world practice? And so and so. Let's say the United States has the 101st Scalloping Eagles. But it is more of a historical character, because the divisional system justified itself well in the Second World War. But there are nuances. Both the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and the Allies had such a gigantic number of troops, so they could afford it. We cannot afford it. Plus, we understand that this is also funding for a potential division link.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/u-chomu-plyusy-systemy-korpus-brygada-ekspert-pro-novu-konczepcziyu-reorganizacziyi-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2024-11-25T21:03:16-08:00
From the police to the Armed Forces: the instructor - Oak - told why every policeman should pass the...	ArmyInform, a military officer spoke about the choice of each police officer, the danger of a logical trap due to euphoria or despair when consuming information about the war from the media, as well as why every adult citizen of Ukraine is obliged to pass the BZVP. Dub met the large-scale invasion in the ranks of the National Police. Took part in military operations on the territory of Zhytomyr and Kyiv regions. After the enemy was pushed beyond the borders of Zhytomyr and Kyiv regions, he resigned from the National Police and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Subsequently, -Dub- took part in military operations in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Donetsk regions. In particular, he fought in the Bakhmut direction in the areas of Avdiivka, Klishchiivka, and Kurdyumivka. — I was injured there, after which I learned to walk again. And after rehabilitation, I was offered a position at a training center so that I could share my practical experience and teach as many new recruits as possible to perform their duties well, says the instructor. He adds that at that time he was not sure that he would be able to perform combat tasks due to his health, so he decided to transfer. Now, after recovery, he again submitted a report for transfer to a combat unit. — Some of my former police colleagues also joined the ranks of the Armed Forces, others continue to serve in the National Police. This is a worthy choice, because if all police officers resign and go to the Armed Forces, then there will be chaos in the rear. -Policemen in the rear are necessary,- says the soldier, answering a question about whether all police officers should go to war. He adds that training as a police officer is not enough to immediately become a soldier. -Oak- points out that the specifics of the work of the National Police in the rear, and even of the special police officers, are the detention of small groups of criminals armed with small arms and the release of hostages, and not at all combat operations inherent in modern warfare. — The level of training of National Police employees is not comparable to the level required in the Armed Forces. The skills and abilities of a police officer are not enough to participate in combat operations using FPV drones, artillery, tanks and other numerous means of fire damage that they want to kill you with, the military emphasizes. He is convinced that police officers need just as much intensive training during BZVP as anyone else. After all, modern war requires fundamentally different knowledge, abilities and skills than even special police officers from specialized units have. So police officers have to retrain and relearn a lot. — Being -at zero-, I would not want to worry that something bad might happen to my family. Therefore, I rely on my police colleagues who continue to serve in the rear. Their work and labor is also needed, -Dub- emphasizes. However, at the same time, he notes that rear-line policemen must be trained for combat operations even if they continue to serve in the rear. — In my personal opinion, it may well happen when they will also have to become servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, will have to take up weapons, not just automatic weapons. Therefore, all Ukrainians should receive at least minimal military training, the instructor is convinced. Similarly, he believes, basic general military training of all civilians should be provided. This does not mean that everyone who has it will go to the front or even serve in the Armed Forces. However, everyone should have a minimum set of knowledge and skills in order to be able to defend Ukraine in case of need. -Oak- explains its position with personal experience. He is convinced that the availability of basic knowledge helped him a lot in the first months of the great war, becoming the basis for the further acquisition and improvement of the abilities and skills of a serviceman. — I expected that I would have to defend Ukraine with weapons in my hands, and I was preparing for it, because I understood that a big war would definitely happen. He tried to learn, learn information about weapons, about the tactics of action in small groups, studied topography, orientation on the terrain. He prepared little by little, he says. That is why everyone should be at least minimally prepared for hostilities, because with such a neighbor as the Russian Federation, there will always be a danger of new aggression and renewed hostilities. - Now our population has relaxed, started to lose the sense of danger that was in the first months of the large-scale invasion. It seems to many that the war is somewhere far away, and therefore will not affect them personally. It is very dangerous to think like that, - the former policeman is convinced, because the war is actually very close, and has already affected, and continues to determine the life of every Ukrainian. -Dub- puts a significant share of responsibility for this attitude of Ukrainians towards the war on the media and the state information policy aimed at reassuring people and the promise of a quick end to the war and easy victories. — -Two or three weeks, two or three months - and we will win. We have liberated Kherson and will soon enter the Crimea!-. After hearing this, people began to believe that they are no longer needed in the army, because what is the point of changing your life, joining the army, if victory will soon come without you? he asks rhetorically. Due to excessive optimism in the presentation of information about the war, Ukrainians began to distance themselves from the topic of the war and stopped following what was happening at the front. Because they believed that the Armed Forces of Ukraine would handle everything perfectly without their personal involvement. And then there was a -distortion- in the opposite direction - they began to tell that everything was bad and that Russia was still winning. Therefore, people began to get the impression that their participation would not change anything. In fact, the military man is convinced, only the joint efforts of the entire society, the entire country — all Ukrainians and women need to make efforts to win. - Many people are afraid to join the army because they believe that they will be thrown into the trenches, and they will, let's say, always sit in the trenches - in the mud, in the mud, in the cold. It's not like the army is functioning at all, a lot of specialists are needed, including logistics, clerks, cooks, drivers, and repairmen, the instructor explains. Therefore, in the Armed Forces there will be a place for everyone within the limits of his specialty and abilities. The decision to join the army, he believes, does not mean the end of life, but rather becomes a new stage in it. The extent to which a recruit will be able to realize himself in the Armed Forces will depend on him. - This is what I tell the servicemen who come to our unit for training - that they need to learn, to be able to do everything. But I draw their attention to the fact that not all of them will necessarily become stormtroopers or fight on the front lines, the instructor explains. At the same time, everyone who joins the army must pass the BZVP, because there can always be an urgent need to join the battle for everyone - as it was in February 2022, when everyone stood in lines for weapons, regardless of civilian profession and having military experience. - In 2022, no one paid attention to the civilian profession - it was necessary to take up arms and defend one's land. Because of this, basic general military training is now conducted to ensure that everyone has general combat skills. Then the fighters are sent to professional training depending on where they will be assigned, -Dub- explains. He emphasizes that, already during the BZVP at the training center, the instructors find out what education, skills and skills the recruits have from their previous civilian experience. This allows them to be recommended for exactly those positions where they can be most effective in the ranks of the Armed Forces, and therefore useful for the defense of Ukraine. — We can make recommendations to which position to assign a particular serviceman in order to make the most effective use of their skills that they have acquired throughout their lives working in civilian professions, so that they can be as effective as possible in the ranks of the Armed Forces, the instructor says. — We communicate directly with the brigades of the airborne assault troops that are on the front line, we exchange training recommendations. They make certain corrections, recommendations on training, on the necessary practical or theoretical knowledge that is actually needed on the front line, - says -Dub-. Thanks to this, the training is structured in such a way as to give the maximum necessary knowledge and not to overload the cadet with secondary information, not to take his time and energy for unnecessary things that will not be needed during the service. - From the statutes, we study only the most necessary, and we almost completely reject military training, since there is no practical need for it. We have instructors and officers with combat experience, they understand very well what is needed, what knowledge needs to be invested, - explains the instructor. He notes that the BZVP is the foundation on which each soldier will then be able to build his knowledge depending on the needs of his future position in the ranks of the Armed Forces. - My conscience does not allow me to teach them badly, because their lives depend on how I teach them. If one of them gets injured or dies in the future, I take it on my own account in the sense that I did not teach them well, that I did not give them a certain amount of information, a certain amount of theoretical or practical skills, did not motivate, did not brought something necessary, - says -Oak-. Currently, the soldier is already completing rehabilitation and has submitted a report for transfer to a combat position, because he believes that soon he will be able to be more effective on the front line. — My rehabilitation is already coming to an end, I understand for myself that I am ready to perform combat tasks, that I can lead people with me. Therefore, I am preparing to be transferred or seconded to a combat brigade in the near future, and there to perform my duties directly on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/z-policziyi-do-zsu-instruktor-dub-rozpoviv-chomu-kozhen-policziyant-maye-projty-bzvp/	2024-11-25T20:50:12-08:00
All-weather beam-protector: a high-energy laser weapon system was presented to the US Army	As stated in the annotation to this project, the text of which posted on the official portal of the developer firm, FIREFLY is designed to combat the growing asymmetric threats associated with with unmanned systems, and is a significant technological breakthrough in the field of air defense, ArmyInform reports. The system has a mobile and pallet (for stationary deployment) design with a modular architecture and scalable power (from 5 kW to 40 kW), specially designed to protect forward positions and critical infrastructure. The FIREFLY combat mechanism (-Svitlyak-, -Svitlyachok- in Ukrainian) is designed on the basis of a universal open architecture, optimized to balance performance, reliability, serviceability and portability. Thanks to modular replaceable units (LRUs), the system adapts to a wide range of operational applications and provides the flexibility to configure, customize and upgrade its capabilities as needs arise. This design allows FIREFLY to interact with C3S computer systems, such as FAAD (Forward Area Air Defense, -Forward Area Air Defense- - Ukrainian) and MEDUSA (Advanced Technology System for Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and other autonomous detection systems (such as radars and optical sensors). The modular structure also facilitates maintenance at the intermediate and field levels, reducing operating costs by using low-cost, commercially available components. To provide target tracking, FIREFLY is equipped with an ISR (surveillance systems) payload, which includes independent visible and infrared surveillance systems, as well as advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for remote threat detection and classification. One of the key advantages of this system, according to the experts of the Army Recognition defense portal, is its ability to work continuously for a long time. This allows the FIREFLY to neutralize multiple targets without the need for frequent reloads or reloads. Such indicators are critical when fending off massive attacks from multiple drones or other similar aerial threats. FIREFLY's functionality has undergone 34 months of rigorous testing, demonstrating its adaptability in challenging environments, including testing in temperatures from −15°C to 35°C, as well as challenging weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, and sandstorms. The weapon was deployed on both fixed and unprepared sites, which confirmed its adaptability and ease of transport and deployment. This high-energy laser system is designed to be cost-effective with minimal logistical support thanks to simplified maintenance processes. KORD specialists focused on reducing production costs and delivery times by using commercially available components, ensuring increased reliability and rapid availability of fully ready-to-deploy units. FIREFLY is offered on competitive commercial terms, making it the perfect solution for armed forces that require modern, ready-to-deploy defense technology. The increasing use of drones in modern warfare is radically changing the battlefield, creating new threats that require innovative countermeasures. These include directed energy (DE) weapons, particularly lasers, which stand out for their accuracy and effectiveness. These technologies are becoming important tools to counter unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which play an increasingly important role in today's conflicts. UAVs pose a significant threat to military personnel and equipment. Their low production cost, ability to transport various payloads, and reduced risk of injury to operators make them particularly attractive to both state and non-state actors. Recent conflicts, such as those in Ukraine, Yemen and Gaza, have highlighted the growing importance of drones in military operations. In response to this growing threat, the military is investing heavily in counter-UAS systems (CUAS), where laser technologies, with their rapid target neutralization capabilities and long-term cost-effectiveness, will play a central role in defense strategies.

The fifth wave — higher than two meters: - Book flood - will sweep through Ukraine and distribute mo...	This is the fifth wave of the initiative launched in 2015, shortly after the beginning of the open armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. As before, it is aimed at popularizing reading and supporting libraries from different regions of Ukraine - both front-line and those that sheltered many forced migrants. This time, as part of the -Book Rush-, more than 31,000 books will be transferred to Ukrainian libraries, including books for children and teenagers, Ukrainian classics and modern literature of various genres, translations of foreign authors, popular science literature and books about the war experience, works of veterans and volunteers. The co-organizers of the -Book Rush- told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about the action. — The National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine is a museum of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system, a military museum. When we learned that the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- action would take place, we offered to join it, says Yuriy Bilous, deputy director of the National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine. In particular, a small exhibition was placed at the entrance to the museum, which presents all the books that will be transferred to libraries within the initiative. - This is necessary so that anyone can see the total volume of collected books. After all, there will be 300 sets of 100 books each, which will be distributed to the libraries of Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Volyn regions, he explains. It is important for people to see this volume visually, because the information about 100 books that will be transferred to each library is a certain abstraction. When you collect the books together on one shelf or put them in a stack, it is already a small library of modern Ukrainian literature. - One hundred books is a lot. If it is conventionally assumed that each book is at least two centimeters thick, then the height of a column of stacked books will be more than two meters, says the deputy director of the National Military Historical Museum. Several books from the collected list relate in one way or another to military topics, talk about the modern Russian-Ukrainian war - an aggressive war on the part of the Russian Federation and a just defensive war on the part of Ukraine. - Since we are a military museum, together with the organizers of -Book Rush- we paid special attention to this, - explains Yuriy Bilous. However, since the selection is intended primarily for the average mass Ukrainian reader, the share of books on military topics is not decisive in it. In view of this, in addition to the basic standard set of books for libraries, the organizers plan to create a special selection of books specifically for the military. — There are many children's books, books for teenagers, which are less needed by the military. Therefore, there will be a separate list specifically for adults, for the military, he says. The museum owner invites everyone to visit the National Military History Museum of Ukraine, because in it you can not only see with your own eyes books from the fifth wave of the -Book Flood-, but also get acquainted with unique exhibits from the history of the Ukrainian military. — This is the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- launched by the -Information Resistance- group. The first took place back in 2015. Then, in addition to our usual activities - monitoring the situation, identifying and investigating security risks, countering aggression against Ukraine in the information sphere, we also decided to pay more attention to communication with people -on the ground-, - says the coordinator of the -Information Resistance- group. historian and museum expert Oleksiy Kopytko. One of the effective options was cooperation with libraries and the dissemination of modern Ukrainian literature, organization of scientific and educational events. — At first, emphasis was placed on literature of a historical profile. Our first waves of actions were connected with books about the Holodomor, with the distribution of the ten-volume popular science book -History without censorship- from the public educational project to popularize the history of Ukraine -likbez. Historical front-. Instead, we have now put together a universal kit aimed at popularizing Ukrainian books and reading in general, he explains. The demand from libraries for new literature, which is catastrophically lacking, is very high. Books are needed by all readers of all ages, so in the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- they tried to please every taste and preference. - This is children's literature, which includes both new classics and works on the school curriculum. It is also scientific popular literature, including several encyclopedias of a natural nature. This is literature for teenagers, this is what is called -non-fiction- - modern and classic Ukrainian and translated literature, says Oleksiy Kopytko. — A separate block consists of books related to understanding the experience of modern war. This is an experience of different regions - there are books about Okhtyrka, several books about Kharkiv, about Kherson. We want to collect such a palette of books that make up a certain -military- kit for any reader, - explains the coordinator of -Information Resistance-. Having received such a universal set, the library will be able to offer different groups of readers the latest Ukrainian publications that will be of interest to them. — Since the resources are quite limited and, so to speak, not comparable to the need, we decided to focus primarily on several regions from the East and South of Ukraine. First of all, these are Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava and Mykolaiv regions. We also included two regions of Western Ukraine — Volynsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, because many people moved from the East and found shelter that way, as well as in the central regions, he says. Also, the -Information Resistance- group establishes contacts with the training centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There you need literature for conducting classes - about weapons, about battle tactics, publication of motivational and psychological content, etc. — We are now preparing to form a certain set of books that will go to educational centers with an orientation primarily to instructors. We started a certain dialogue in order to understand what they specifically need and what is needed as a priority, because the needs are huge and it is necessary to understand the best way to ensure them, Oleksiy Kopytko said. public libraries, is already rolling across Ukraine. Organizers have completed accepting and selecting applications and are starting to ship books to selected libraries. The libraries of the Sumy region will be the first. — We had the following approach: formally, there are more than 10,000 public libraries in Ukraine. Unfortunately, some of them are, to put it mildly, -inanimate-. We wanted to find those libraries of various levels that are important to their communities. They can be small, but if there is life in the village around the library, some events are taking place, children come or people of all ages come - then we wanted to strengthen such libraries within the boundaries of -Book Crowd-, - explains Oleksiy Kopytko. For this review, the organizers, in addition to reviewing applications, also looked at library websites, pages and groups in social networks, which show how active and important the library is to the local community. So far, the -Information Resistance- group has collected more than 31,000 books from 26 publishing houses, more than 40 books from the set were published in the book capital of Ukraine — near the frontline, Kharkiv. Three sets of 101 books each have already gone to the first three libraries.

In the swamps, counterfeiters attack computer games: why is this the enemy	Plots from video games see them everywhere. For example, propagandists are spreading information on social networks that the German TV channel allegedly used footage from the American video game -Call of Duty- in the video of the assault on Russian positions by soldiers of the Azov brigade in the Pokrovsky direction. But in fact, this is not Pokrovsky direction, but Serebryansk forestry in Luhansk region. The video was shot in first person and is divided into three sections: advancing through positions, mopping up, and securing after the assault. There are no computer graphics on it. Apparently, the Russians still cannot believe that the Ukrainians are capable of defending their native land so selflessly. For them, the heroism of the military is beyond reality, so they believe in the fictions of their fakers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/na-bolotah-fejkoroby-atakuyut-kompyuterni-igry-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2024-11-25T20:06:10-08:00

Pavlo strikes at enemy concentrations and equipment, despite continuous fire from enemy artillery and tanks. -During one of the battles, -Beton- deliberately destroyed a stationary BMP of the enemy, under which enemy infantry was hiding. Two 120-mm mines were enough for this - the technicians tore off the tower, and the infantrymen were burned,- said the Ground Forces. Pavel admits that he wants even more such results. His main motivation is to protect his fellow vanguards. For his courage and skill, Pavlo was awarded the Golden Cross. -Beton- was born in the city of Kryvyi Rih. Before the full-scale invasion, he worked as a locksmith.

Rustem Umyerov: We expect that partners will take the initiative in equipping our brigades	This is stated in the minister's message on the Facebook page. -Allies' support will become faster and more effective. The defenders of Ukraine must be provided with everything necessary to put an end to Russian aggression,- said Rustem Umyerov. The ministers discussed the urgent needs of the Defense Forces, as well as the priority areas of assistance to Ukraine. -We count on the fact that partners will take the initiative in equipping our brigades and battalions. We have a successful experience of cooperation with France, which provided training for one of the Ukrainian brigades and also provided it with armored vehicles,- said Rustem Umyerov. Another area of ​​support is strengthening our anti-aircraft defenses ahead of winter. The enemy does not stop trying to destroy our critical infrastructure, so we need more air defense systems and ammunition for them. The next important issue is artillery ammunition. Rustem Umyerov thanked our European partners for providing Ukraine with 1 million artillery shells, but noted that Ukraine needs more to achieve parity with the enemy. -Together with its allies, Ukraine is already building the potential of the domestic defense industry. We invite the countries of the free world to transfer technology to us and start strategic partnerships with our industry,- he said. The minister informed the partners about the areas in which we see significant opportunities for cooperation: At the same time, it is planned to conduct an audit with the allied states of the aid provided during 2022, 2023 and 2024 in order to determine which models of support to Ukraine worked best and scale them up. Ukraine is also open to new initiatives that will help quickly meet the needs of our soldiers in 2025. -We must act boldly and coherently. Only in this way will we be able to achieve a just and lasting peace in Europe,- Rustem Umyerov stressed. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine reached specific agreements with Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Lithuania on investing directly in Ukrainian production.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/rustem-umyerov-rozrahovuyemo-shho-partnery-vizmut-na-sebe-inicziatyvu-v-osnashhenni-nashyh-brygad/	2024-11-25T11:09:24-08:00

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . The depressed mood among Russian soldiers is due to the extremely high level of casualties and the lack of success in the Siversk region. -Already now we can say about unsuccessful operations, unsuccessful assaults in the previous period of time - for about a month they tried to storm with equipment using a large amount of equipment that was completely broken and destroyed,- the spokeswoman said. In an attempt to rectify the situation, the Russians replaced the command staff here, and deployed military police on the ranks. — As a result of this, there were big changes in the enemy group standing in the Seversky direction: the brigade commander was changed, the combatants were changed. The military police came, as far as we know, in order to -motivate- the personnel to go into battle, the officer said. However, even this does not give the desired result to the Russian invaders - the soldiers of the Russian army refuse to perform combat tasks.

The escape attempt ended with a call to the rescuers: three men barely survived in Tisza	About this notifies November 25 State Border Service of Ukraine. -The men used the services of traders who promised to help them cross the border by land, but after paying for the -service- they were told that they would still have to go into the water,- the report said. It is noted that the shippers, traditionally disregarding the lives of their customers, directed them to the Tisza after dark, lying that the water there was knee-deep, the river itself was not wide, and therefore they would cross it with ease and would not even have time to freeze. No flotation devices or life jackets were offered to the men. -Taking off their shoes and slightly rolling up their pants, the divers went into an unknown body of water,- said the DPSU. In just a few minutes, all three were washed away by a powerful current and carried away in an unknown direction. According to the border guards, the only thing that saved the men was the fact that there was a washed-up tree in the water, which they were able to grab onto and get to the shallows in the middle of the river. Then they called the rescuers and reported that they needed help. Military personnel of the -Vylok- and -Dyakovo- border service departments of the Mukachevo border detachment were involved in the search for offenders. As a result of using a drone, the -islanders- were discovered. All three were taken to a border unit, where servicemen gave them hot tea and allowed them to warm up and dry their clothes and shoes. For an attempt to violate the state border, administrative offenses were filed against the men. -The water level in the Tisza River, which runs along the border with Hungary and Romania, has risen significantly at the moment. The water temperature is very low, which causes muscle cramps in those who try to dive into the river.

There are no occupiers in the northern part of Toretsk: the OTU - Luhansk - refuted the statements o...	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — In the Toretsk direction, the number of assaults did not decrease, accordingly, the losses of Russians in manpower in this direction did not decrease either. They remain consistently high, she said. The spokeswoman did not confirm the information of Russian propagandists about the advance of Russians in the northern part of the city. — In the northern part of the city, they have not yet appeared. Although I must also repeat that urban battles are one of the most difficult battles in military practice, military science. They are characterized by dynamism and require constant attention from servicemen and constant tension, she said. At the same time, the military woman noted that during battles in the city it is difficult to talk about the details of the situation, because the enemy may unexpectedly appear on a neighboring street for a while and will be forced to leave it or be destroyed just as suddenly. — It is difficult to say what the situation is in the city itself, specifically on this or that street. The enemy may run into the neighboring street, but this does not mean that he is entrenched there. They immediately destroy him, immediately make it impossible for him to move or take him prisoner, - explained Anastasia Bobovnikova. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Toretsk, the enemy loses 100 soldiers per day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/u-pivnichnij-chastyni-toreczka-okupantiv-nemaye-v-otu-lugansk-sprostuvaly-zayavy-rosijskyh-propagandystiv/	2024-11-25T09:39:11-08:00

He said this in his evening address. -We will definitely respond to Russia for everything it does. And it is important that such blows, each of them, do not remain without a proper response, not only ours. There should not be even a hint of normalization of Russian terror — of getting used to it,- the President said. The head of state noted the new decision of Britain regarding sanctions against the shadow tanker fleet of the Russian Federation, according to which 30 tankers came under restrictions. -This is an important step. And it would be right for European partners — at the level of the entire EU — as well as other partners to support such sanctions. The less Russian excess profits from oil, the less Russia will be able to wage war. This is an obvious connection. A relationship that must work for real peace,- he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also announced that today at the meeting Bets were relevant reports and analysis of experience in repelling Russian strikes on energy. -The best results of specific units should be spread to all objects, to everyone who carries out protective work,- he emphasized.

Britain introduced large-scale sanctions against the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation	This is stated in the message at sites of the British government. -With half of the vessels sanctioned today carrying more than $4.3 billion worth of oil and petroleum products such as gasoline in the last year alone, this is the UK's largest sanctions package of its kind,- the statement said. It said the move would further limit the Kremlin's ability to finance its illegal war in Ukraine and its malicious activities around the world, and would also bring the total number of oil tankers under UK sanctions to 73, more than any other another country 46 countries and the EU signed the call to action against the shadow fleet, announced by the Prime Minister of Great Britain at the summit of the European Political Community in July. Revenues from oil sales are a key source of funding for the Kremlin's illegal war in Ukraine. The -shadow fleet- also poses significant risks to global trade. Many of these vessels use deceptive transportation methods and pose an environmental hazard—many tankers blatantly ignore basic safety standards, increasing the likelihood of catastrophic oil spills.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/brytaniya-zaprovadyla-masshtabni-sankcziyi-shhodo-tinovogo-flotu-rf/	2024-11-25T05:57:46-08:00
RAROG breathes fire: how to get to the 24th OMBr named after King Danylo	The windows of high-rise buildings are sometimes covered with fiberboard boards, film or other material, reminding that some people left their native homes and were forced to become internally displaced persons or refugees in other countries. Evacuation offers from the Donetsk regional military administration constantly come to the phone of everyone who enters the territory of the region. A typical picture of a front-line city. It is young, energetic, focused on results. This result is the destruction of the occupiers, day and night, under all circumstances and weather conditions. The fact that unmanned systems are becoming the main means of fire damage to the enemy significantly increases the role of such units in combat military units. Everyone flies: reconnaissance units, artillery fire adjusters, UAV units of mechanized and rifle battalions, and even EW units and RKBZ. But the main striking force of the brigade in the conditions of the enemy's superiority in ammunition over artillery is the battalions of unmanned systems created in the brigades. Why -RAROG- in particular? The mythical falcon of the ancient Slavs, which flies out of a fiery whirlwind and spews fire, a whirlwind, a storm on its own - isn't this a literal description of a deadly attack on the enemy from an unmanned aerial vehicle? 24th -royal- separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, since the beginning of the war in 2014, has already entered into its history the glorious pages of the battles for Liman, Popasna, Lysychansk, the liberation of the right bank of southern Ukraine. Today, it holds the defense of Chasovoy Yar. The brigade's arm badge depicts a Galician lion with the motto -milites regum- — royal infantry. The eidetics of the new Ukrainian army organically connects the generations of our ancestors with modern heroes who defend their country from the next invaders. -Rarog- is also from those times. Only a person rooted in the history of his kind, who is aware of his responsibility both to the past and to the future, is able to consciously and effectively destroy the enemy. - We do it effectively,- the combatant claims. Some episodes of battles are particularly ostentatious. Thus, the road Verkhne Toretske - Avdiyivka was jokingly called -RAROG road- in the brigade. The enemy tried to advance along it with combat equipment at night. The operators of the battalion carried out 12 sorties with mining of advance routes. As a result, we received 11 detonations of the enemy's equipment. -After all, this is not just mining. It's practically a piece of jewelry when a mine is dropped after detonating the previous car on the likely bypass path. Sometimes almost under the tracks of an enemy tank,- explains the combatant. Service in the battalion is no less difficult than in mechanized or rifle units. Permanent shifts of UAV operators at positions with a continuous change of drones in the air; logistics and delivery of goods for infantry in positions; repair, modernization and improvement of unmanned aerial vehicles; own logistics and production of discharges and other ammunition. After all, up to 1 thousand can be dropped on the enemy during the night. kg of -surprises-. On the Facebook page of the battalion, there are photos with the latest results of defeating the enemy. From military equipment to individual invaders who met their death on Ukrainian soil. Destroyed dugouts, bridges, shelters, firing positions. Such results are comparable to the achievements of the most successful battalions of unmanned systems: Magyar Birds (deployed to a regiment), Achilles, K-2, Wild Hornets, Magura brigade battalion and others. This is the result not only of state support for capacity building The forces of unmanned systems, but also significant volunteer funds and the battalion's own funds.

GUR showed the drones used to attack the aggressor's military facilities	The report on the work of a group of long-range drone operators of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, prepared by journalists of the -Donbas Realiy- program on Radio Liberty, was published on November 25. -Preparation is carried out in several stages. First of all, we analyze the targets, the possibility of reaching them, analyze the anti-aircraft defense, the means of electronic warfare of the enemy in order to find corridors, how to pass. It has been extremely difficult to do this for the past year, but it still works,- said the commander of the group of long-range UAV operators of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. He added that during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the use of attack drones has undergone serious changes. -We are the group that was the first to launch almost all long-range drones and those that came before them. We can see the dynamics - now we can hit targets at a distance of 2,000 km,- said the scout. For more about the Ukrainian long-range drones -Lyutyy-, -Beaver- and others, with which the operators of GUR continue to strike military targets in Russia, see the report: As ArmyInform reported, the GUR discovered in the North Korean KN-23/KN-24 missile foreign components 2023 year of graduation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/gur-pokazalo-drony-yakymy-atakuye-vijskovi-obyekty-agresora/	2024-11-25T00:52:57-08:00
He bowed, prayed and confessed to the FSB: a spy in a cassock was detained in Kharkiv	notifies the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the case materials, the arrested suspect leaked information about the Defense Forces in the region. In particular, he tried to establish the approximate number of personnel and available weapons at Ukrainian checkpoints near Kharkiv. -The archpriest monitored the routes of the movement of military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the direction of the front line. The cleric sent the received information to the aggressor via messenger in the form of marks on Google maps and their detailed description,- the SBU said in a statement. According to the investigation, the 43-year-old archpriest began performing hostile tasks in October 2024. He was born in Melitopol and during 2009-2018 was on the territory of the Russian Federation. Later, he came to Kharkiv, where he worked as an IT specialist of the diocesan administration of the UOC (MP) and was appointed abbot of the local church. During the searches, a mobile phone with evidence of cooperation with the occupiers was seized from the detainee. Russian rubles and Kremlin awards were also found in his possession. Investigators of the Security Service informed the accused about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces for the possibility of their identification on the spot). He faces 8 years in prison.

A recruiting unit will be created in each brigade - the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces	This was reported by 25 November General Staff of the Armed Forces. The corresponding organizational directive defines the task of forming full-time recruiting units in combat military units. This innovation will allow commanders to improve the organization and support of volunteer recruitment events. For reference: On October 1, 2024, at the initiative of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, amendments were made to Government Resolution No. 560 of May 16, 2024, the regulations of which allow commanders to call up volunteers directly to military units without contacting territorial recruitment and social support centers. Prior to that, the Armed Forces of Ukraine operated recruiting centers in the Ground Forces, Naval Forces, Airborne Assault Forces, Special Operations and Territorial Defense Forces. Today, they continue to actively develop and improve their capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, a recruiting center was opened in Sumy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/v-kozhnij-brygadi-bude-stvoreno-pidrozdil-rekrutyngu-golovnokomanduvach-zsu/	2024-11-25T00:23:24-08:00

Foreign components of 2023 detected in North Korean KN-23/KN-24 missile — GUR	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on November 25. The aggressor state Russia received more than 100 such missiles from the DPRK. The enemy used this weapon for the first time in the war against Ukraine at the end of 2023. Together with the missiles, Pyongyang then sent its military specialists to Russia, who serviced the launchers and actually participated in war crimes against Ukraine. The victims of KN-23/KN-24 strikes were Ukrainian civilians both in front-line communities and in settlements far from the battle line. In particular, on January 2, 2024, four people died as a result of a North Korean missile hitting a Kyiv high-rise building. On August 11, 2024, a four-year-old boy and his father were killed by KN-23/KN-24 debris in the Kyiv region, and three more citizens were injured. The KN-23/KN-24 missile used by Russia against Ukraine contained foreign components produced by companies from five countries — China, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. At least one of them, a voltage converter labeled -XP Power- by a British manufacturer, was made in February 2023, after the full-scale invasion had begun. In order to obtain technologies for their weapons programs, the aggressor state of Russia and its allies - the DPRK and Iran - use joint schemes to circumvent international sanctions, which requires an appropriate response, in particular - the strengthening of export control mechanisms. As reported by ArmyInform, in the GUR we talked about the tactics of using the Magura V5 attack marine drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/u-pivnichnokorejskij-raketi-kn-23-kn-24-vyyavleno-inozemni-komponenty-2023-roku-gur/	2024-11-24T22:57:52-08:00

The RBU-6000 -Smerch 2- was developed back in Soviet times and was intended to destroy enemy submarines and attacking torpedoes. Due to the fact that nothing is known about Ukrainian submarines in Donbas, it can be assumed that the use of such specific weapons is a sign of a certain arms crisis in the enemy. Also, the fighters of the 5th brigade destroyed the mortar and the enemy's shelter. As ArmyInform reported, fighters of the 5th assault Kyiv brigade repelled a foot assault of the invaders on Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/morskyj-bombomet-u-stepah-ukrayiny-na-donechchyni-znyshhyly-ridkisnu-vorozhu-ustanovku-zalpovogo-vognyu/	2024-11-24T22:41:15-08:00

Enemy cesspools were dug somewhere in Odessa -Nikolai Fyodorovich-: what are you lying about	However, all his words are a standard set of Kremlin narratives and clichés used by propagandists every day. It in no way reflects the opinion of the residents of all of Odessa. After all, the only country that makes the residents of Odessa and other cities and villages of Ukraine suffer is terrorist Russia and its dictator Putin. It is the Russians who launch attack drones and missiles over Ukraine every night and every day. According to social survey of the Rozumkov Center, as of September In 2024, 94% of Ukrainian citizens have a negative attitude towards the Russian Federation. By the way, as a result of a Russian missile attack on the city on November 18, 11 people died.

Help has arrived: how recruits are being prepared for a real war in Donetsk region	We asked who and what is taught before being sent to combat positions. The training ground is somewhere in the steppes of Donetsk region. An infantry division moves between barricades made of old tires. They keep their distance, keep their weapons at the ready. — A grenade! The instructor shouts and throws a mock-up of a hand grenade to the side of the compartment. Fighters fall amicably to the ground. They are waiting — Explosion! And we're moving! Let's move! He who does not move will die! The instructor shouts, the fighters pick themselves up and advance further. In general, all recruits have undergone a month's training in training centers, but the battalion believes that it is not enough. -Military personnel come from training centers with a low level of training. They have a small shot, weak tactical skills, everything has to be learned almost from scratch. Currently, 90 percent of the recruitment is without experience of military service. Which, after all, gave at least some initial skills,- says the commander of the department with the call sign Psych, a calm man in his 50s with a beard. According to him, 12-15 bullets are given in training centers, in the best case, up to a hundred. -We give much more. Weapons are attached to military personnel so that they get used to them. This weapon is being fired. We also allow shooting with RPGs, disposable grenade launchers, and various machine guns. Here we are already undergoing disassembly and assembly. We try to prepare as much as possible,- says Psych. -Here, a fighter can shoot more in one day than in a whole month at the training center. This is a fact. We shoot from automatic weapons, from machine guns, from RPGs, throw grenades of various types,- says the senior sergeant with the call sign Romeo, black and cheerful. -There are almost no veterans among the recruits. We have succumbed to this misconception that the army must be professional. In fact, an army can only be professional if it has to fight against a bunch of savages. And against an enemy equal in strength, a common army is needed. After all, the protection of Ukraine is the constitutional duty of its citizens. And I don't have time for civilians now. They can't even line up and march in formation. That's why they have to be taught fast,- says Norman, who is tall and looks like a wrestler. He was just throwing dummy grenades at the soldiers to teach them to immediately lie down and then move quickly. The time that the unit allocates for the training of new recruits depends on the situation at the front. -There were cases when fighters arrived by bus after training, received weapons and immediately went into battle, because the enemy was attacking and it was necessary to hold the front. Now we try to cook for at least a week,- says Romeo. Next, according to the plan, the fighters will have training on conducting combat operations in urban conditions. The department enters the site of the landfill, on which there are models of urban development. Fighters learn to sweep, cover each other, act as a team. -Tactical fighting skills in urban development, which we really need now, none. We are now teaching them this, because there is no way without it. Because what is Donbas? This is an agglomeration! More than five hundred settlements! They flow into each other! In some places, the boundaries of settlements pass along the streets! It is a continuous development. And the war in solid construction has its differences. Here, the offense requires a one-to-seven power advantage, while the field requires a one-to-three power advantage. Considering that Donetsk is almost one continuous population center, it is necessary to sharpen the preparation for this. Because if we surrender Donbas, it will be trouble. Operational space begins behind Donbas, that is, space not occupied by troops and without prepared fortifications. That's it, they go to Dnipropetrovsk region and spread in any direction like a plague or a locust. That's why we need to focus on Donbas!- says Norman. Military personnel move from wall to wall, working in pairs. One takes a position and shouts, -I'm hiding!- The second shouts: -I'm coming- and runs forward, takes the position: -I'm hiding!-. Everyone else watches the pair, the instructor explains and points out mistakes. Another couple starts working. Some try harder, some less. Someone falls when necessary, and someone just kneels so as not to get dirty. -We are trying to teach them so that they don't die stupidly on the first day. The reason some people don't give their all is because people don't fully understand where they are and what they're here for. It has not yet been understood that in war any mistake, wrong step, untimely movement can cost lives,- says Romeo. -There's nothing to do in urban combat without grenades! You should carry at least a dozen with you! And when entering the premises, do not spare a grenade for each room, but rather a few! To make sure that there is no enemy waiting for you! -Raise your hands, who doesn't have combat experience?- Norman looks at the recruits. Everyone raises their hands. This is another example of the quality of training in educational centers. You will have to learn this too. When the exercise is over, the fighters are given time to rest a little. Someone smokes, someone sits down directly on the ground to rest. Everyone is breathing heavily, because the training takes place in full equipment: body armor, helmet, discharge, first-aid kit, weapons, ammunition. A total of at least 15 kilograms. Try to run with a kettlebell, fall, stand up, squat, see if you can last long. I look at the fighters. Most are somewhere around fifty and they don't look like athletes. Fall asleep after exercises. I approach a fighter who was very active in training, did not feel sorry for himself, worked out to the full, and also caught up with his brothers who were lazy. Mykola is of medium height, thin, sinewy, from the city of Gulyaipole in Zaporozhye. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, a front has been passing there nearby. Mykola knows what war is. Especially since he did not work anywhere, but in a funeral service. -I saw different things. People also had to be collected in parts. We are in a war zone, shelled every day: mortars, guns, tanks. It happened that you were digging a grave, and then the shelling began, and you jumped into the hole yourself to wait. Then you dig further. He was wounded twice. Once in the head a fragment, but only -combed-. The second time in the stomach, but saved the phone, a mortar fragment got stuck in it. That phone is still lying at home,- says Mykola. His family left for Zhytomyr, and he stayed to help the old and sick who remained in his hometown. In 2022, he was summoned three times to the TCC, but each time he was not taken to the army. Only now it was his turn. Mykola underwent basic military training in the Poltava region, but he says that here, in the battalion, the occupations were more intense. -We didn't have such movement in urban conditions with weapons there. It was mostly medicine, some more lectures. Well, maybe 5 times in a month they stormed the trenches. And then they tried to storm more. So that it was not so much, truly, as here, in the textbook. And here, of course, it is difficult, especially on the first day. But we are taught to go to the positions and not stay there on the first day,- says Mykola. Sergey stands a little aside. He is from Bohodukhov, Kharkiv region. I was driving from work, stood at a bus stop, the police drove up, and in a couple of days I already went to the educational center. -There's a lot of useful stuff here, it's hard to remember everything. But something must be done, because this is the army,- says Serhiy. Fighters rest before a new exercise. In the battalion, problems are recognized both with the age of recruitment and with its motivation. -Well, what could be the motivation if he was going to work and was taken to the TCC? Will he have motivation? But hardly. It was at the beginning of a large scale motivated guys, but they have either run out or there are few left. That's why you have to fight with the people who are there,- says Romeo. And Norman says that it's not about age, it's about your attitude. -I myself am already under sixty. You just don't need to drink and smoke, you need to do sports. And the boys, of course, complain that it is difficult for them. They often come here already with some kind of clinic,- sighs Norman. He himself was withdrawn from the combat team after a serious injury and has been the head of the battalion's combat training for a year. To his credit, he looks younger than most recruits. The battalion's aerial scouts raise two drones. The next point of training: work under enemy copters. The detachment moves through the territory in pairs, when a drone appears overhead, then the fighter drops to the ground, necessarily in a straight line, to maintain visual contact with the drone. If earlier the training program for new recruits included a run-in with a tank, now it is a drone flight. Because the recruits may not see an enemy tank, but an enemy drone - for sure. -The Kalashnikov assault rifle does not change, but the war has changed very much: both methods and tactics. At the beginning of the war, who would have thought that drones would play such a role? And now it is a technological war, a war of drones. Now they attach to them -lighters- and other ammunition. Drones perform very different tasks and you have to be prepared for them,- says Romeo. -We currently have the biggest losses from enemy drones. Moreover, they already have standard ammunition, thermobaric, cumulative, which allow them to perform any task on the battlefield. Because what is mortar or art? Shot and hit or missed. Because the flight of a mine or a projectile is affected by a large number of factors: the quality of ammunition, wear of the muzzle channel, wind, weather. And the drone is all about it, it can fly up and accurately drop its ammunition on the target. So the focus has now shifted and countering drones is now the main thing,- says Norman. He remembers the year 2022, when he fought near Lysychansk, and the main striking force was artillery. Shows photos on the phone of positions that look like a lunar landscape: dozens and hundreds of craters from artillery shells. -We did not see a live opponent, we were simply destroyed by his arta. A platoon entered the position, and only half left. Or simply ran away in a panic due to continuous fire exposure. But now everything has changed and it is the drones that are making the decisive fire impact. That's why we teach recruits to get used to the idea that they will constantly be in front of our eyes and the enemy's eyes,- says Norman. The copters dive at the fighters, and they learn to notice them in time and not to panic. Vlad is the youngest in the entire department. On September 2, he turned 25, it is from this age that mobilization now begins, and already on September 3 he had a summons. Vlad himself is from Cherkasy, says that since 2022 he has received summons several times, but he was not taken because of his age. -I was told that you are still young, go for a walk for now. I updated my details and waited. September 3 came, I was sent to the VLK, I passed it in two days. In two, because the tests had to be taken the next day. In the TCC, I met with a representative of the battalion, and he offered me to serve in it. I agreed, got the attitude and went to the training center, after which I got into the battalion, everything was as it should be. Is it difficult? It is difficult, but useful. I listen a lot, I try to remember everything,- says Vlad. According to Oleg, deputy chief of staff of the battalion for mobilization work, Vlad's case is not an isolated one. -Our vacancies are on many sites. Now they have also appeared on Army+. If a person is interested in them, write to us. I contact her, ask questions, send a questionnaire. A person is filling it out, and at this time I am checking it on the website of court decisions to weed out people who want to hide in the army from some administrative or criminal cases. If the person is suitable for us, then we will provide them with a letter of recommendation. This is an official document with a registration number and seal. With it, a person goes to the TCC. If he is going to sign a contract, then he will 100% come to us. As for mobilization, there are options, because the General Staff can decide that some brigade needs more replenishment. That's why I always recommend a contract. For the most part, the positions of clerks, UAV operators, and drivers are filled with us through recruiting. There are less snipers or shooters,- said Oleg. Training on the range ends with firing from a Browning machine gun. The guys come two by two, squat down, the instructors show how to prepare the machine gun for battle, how to aim and how to fire. Short bursts fly towards the targets. Some of the cartridges are tracers to make it easier to adjust the fire. -Browning- shoots loudly, out of habit it can cover your ears a little. But the work of the machine gun, it is far from the loudest thing that can happen in the positions. Recruits are animated, they are interested in shooting with a machine gun. Someone sits on a box, someone kneels, short queues, shell casings fly. Fighters listen to the advice of instructors, adjust their fire. Today they still have grenade throwing here at the training ground. And in the evening, classes on tactical medicine. The battalion tries to give its soldiers maximum skills that will help them in battle. And in just a week or two, the boys will be in combat positions. Hold the front and do not let the enemy into the operational space.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/pidmoga-pryjshla-yak-na-donechchyni-gotuyut-novobrancziv-do-realnoyi-vijny/	2024-11-24T20:55:44-08:00
Getting Closer to the Assault Rifle: Introducing the US Army's Newest 30mm Grenade Launcher	As said in a release posted on the Barrett portal, the new Squad Support Rifle System (SSRS) is designed to revolutionize the battlefield with its advanced capabilities and innovative design. This marks a significant step forward in the evolution of soldier protection systems, ArmyInform reports. Manufacturers classify the weapon as a -support rifle-, which is designed to fire both at enemy infantry and vehicles, as well as at drones. -We are pleased to partner with Barrett, the world's leading manufacturer of military weapons, to further advance our 30mm support rifle for the US Army's PGS program,- said Michael Merino, president of MARS Inc. Merino added that the companies are developing a solution that will significantly improve a soldier's ability to counter a wide range of threats on the battlefield. The PGS is a magazine-fed semi-automatic weapon that provides soldiers with greater accuracy and firepower. The grenade launcher is designed to engage targets at a distance of 35 meters to over half a kilometer, including enemy manpower hiding behind shelters. The PGS aims to offer a flat firing trajectory for faster and more accurate target engagement, reducing flight time for long-range shots. In addition, the PGS will include a sophisticated fire control system capable of programming shots and ammunition families for different tactical situations. The arsenal can include rounds for counter-defilade, close combat, and even armor-piercing charges or anti-drone (Counter-UAS) munitions. As inform the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, the program reached its final stage when several companies such as FN America and Plumb Precision Products, submitted their own projects for evaluation by military experts. The new weapon is designed to participate in the PGS (Precision Grenadier System) tender, which is expected in fiscal year 2026, when the US Army will select the final candidate after a successful technology demonstration. The key to the design of the Barrett SSRS is its comfortable assault rifle-based design. The weapon has a stock in the rear, a magazine with five cartridges in the center and a barrel length of 305 mm. The grenade launcher is compact and versatile with a total length of 861 mm and a weight of only 6.3 kg. It can fire a variety of ammunition, including anti-aircraft shells, giving soldiers a decisive advantage on the battlefield. The weapon is also equipped with a Vortex Optics XM-157 scope, similar to the sight installed on the 6.8 mm machine gun XM7 army USA. This sight is used in the marksmanship developed under the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) program. This optical enhancement further strengthens SSRS's ability to deliver precision in combat, aligning with the US Army's modernization goals. With Barrett leading a team of industry-leading partners, this next-generation grenade launcher will be a key component of future lethality systems in the U.S. Army soldier's arsenal, combining firepower, accuracy and safety on the modern battlefield. The US Army announced the launch of the PGS program in August 2024. It is worth reminding, as reported ArmyInform , the products of the arms company Barrett Firearms are on the list of about 20 samples of sniper and anti-materiel rifles, which from the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were codified and accepted for use in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Should we give up propaganda: a military historian on the world experience of working with human con...	-We do not like to mention either the Soviet experience or the experience of other totalitarian states. But in reality, propaganda always works the same way. She worked in the same way in Ancient Rome, in European states, when the Crusades were being prepared. It worked like this in Europe during the 30 Years War. She worked like this during the First and Second World Wars. At the moment, certain democratic circles believe that the use of propaganda is unacceptable, although we see that no country in the world shies away from using propaganda. The only difference is that now the word -propaganda- has been replaced by the construct -strategic communications-. But the essence and methods have not changed from this. We can call them whatever we want, but these principles are absolutely constant, they have always worked the same way. And I don't think that Ukraine should give up on this, it's just that in the end we have to get used to the fact that evil should be called evil, and not the phrase -not everything is so clear-cut.- Good should be called good, struggle should be called struggle, one should go precisely to Victory. And then propaganda turns into just a tool. She is neither good nor bad. It is simply a tool for working with human consciousness. Likewise, someone may not like a scalpel. But the scalpel during surgery cannot be replaced by anything else. In the same way, nothing else can replace propaganda in working with consciousness.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/chy-varto-vidmovytys-vid-propagandy-militarnyj-istoryk-pro-svitovyj-dosvid-roboty-z-lyudskoyu-svidomistyu/	2024-11-24T20:29:15-08:00

Serhii, the spokesman of the volunteer Ukrainian army -South- told about this in ArmiyaTV stream Bratchuk -The week is passing... under the sign of a certain hysteria in the media that the enemy is preparing a large-scale massive offensive on the regional center of Zaporizhzhia. It was again necessary, as they say, to throw the fire information team to explain to people that today the biggest threat to the Zaporizhzhia agglomeration is, of course, the actions of enemy aviation, which is engaged in terrorizing the civilian population: they drop anti-aircraft missiles, use unguided air missiles...-, - Serhii Bratchuk explained. In addition, according to him, separate enemy units are withdrawn from the Zaporizhzhia direction and transferred to the Donetsk front, the Pokrovskoe-Kurakhov direction. The spokesman also emphasized that Velika Novosilka is an important logistics point, because it is actually located on the border of three regions: Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Dnipropetrovsk, although administratively it belongs to Donetsk region. -With the questions that arise around Velika Novosilka, we are talking about the fact that then the enemy will be able to become more active and threaten the Orihiv and Gulyaipil directions more,- Serhiy Bratchuk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians are using all possible forces in the South of Ukraine, from convicts to marines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/okupanty-pogrozhuyut-nastupom-na-pivdni-a-sami-perekydayut-vijska-na-inshi-napryamky/	2024-11-24T10:58:16-08:00

President: Putin cannot be given a week to adapt and find a countermeasure	This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his evening address. He emphasized that it is necessary to focus on the supply of these systems and Russia should feel that every step it takes to expand the war has consequences for it. -The consequences are in our actions at the front, our soldiers, our units. And also — consequences in the actions of the world. In how the world responds. You can't give Putin a week to adapt and find a countermeasure. It is necessary to constantly do everything so that Russia is forced to look for the possibility of peace. Real peace.

The Defense Forces named the reason for the decrease in the number of Shaheds	This was spoken of the Southern Defense Forces Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn on November 24. -When it was windy yesterday, the number of drones was 40 percent less than in the previous days, when the weather was more or less favorable for UAVs and, in general, for the conduct of hostilities,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. Therefore, the weather also affects the intensity of destruction of enemy equipment. -And the same number of destroyed reconnaissance drones, in particular, eagles, zalls, superkams - when the weather is good, we destroy them much more.

However, we learned to fight with them, and, I don't know why, but their -wings- began to fall for some reason. Why? Let it be a mystery,- noted Fox. When asked by the presenter if there are military personnel from the DPRK in the direction where the -Fox- unit is defending, the serviceman replied: -We cannot say that we saw a North Korean soldier at the moment. However, if they appear on our site, we will also destroy them with various forces and means. There is no big difference: we destroy the Russians or we destroy the Koreans.

How is preparation for takmed: a master class from instructors -Kabana- and-Puma-	Such training of fighters already after arriving from the training center to the battalion is a mandatory element of continued training. No soldier will go on combat missions until he has received additional training, including tactical medicine. The instructors told the correspondents of ArmiyaInform how the training in the technical field takes place and why it is necessary for every fighter newly arrived in the battalion. During training, those who have well mastered the basics of tactical medicine during BZVP have the opportunity and will be able to refresh and consolidate their knowledge. Those who were less attentive and diligent must make up for lost time. — Such training takes place with all newcomers. We work in small groups - from 4‒6 to a maximum of 10 fighters in order to be able to pay attention to everyone, says Vladyslava. Medics must firmly make sure that newly arrived fighters at a sufficient level have mastered the necessary set of knowledge, abilities and skills in order to be able to provide first aid to themselves or a brother in case of injury. To do this, with each successive group of replenishment, they go through the same set of classes, exercises and training again and again. After all, as the Ukrainian proverb says: -Until you try, you won't know how.- — With beginners, we always go through the MARCH algorithm and consolidate knowledge and practice skills in practice. This is necessary so that they do not get lost in the position and during combat, so that everything is done as correctly as possible, she says. — When newcomers come, we treat them as if they know absolutely nothing. We understand that they have already received training at the BZVP, but we need to make sure of the level of their knowledge acquisition, - explains the head of the medical center, Senior Lieutenant Yuriy Faustus. This is why medics work in small groups, which, moreover, can be divided into pairs in such a way that the fighters train on each other and check each other. — Today they listen with interest, work responsibly. Therefore, it was easy to train them - they helped each other, applied tourniquets, made bandages. They themselves checked whether the tourniquet was put on properly, -Puma- says with satisfaction. New arrivals are different, doctors explain. It is easier for someone to explain everything and to teach what is necessary, but for someone it is necessary to force. It's not so bad when a person can't do something, they note - it's much worse if he doesn't want to learn. Not everyone immediately understands where they got to, that they are really at war. Therefore, sometimes it is necessary to force. It is very bad when a person himself does not realize how terrible the consequences of his negligence can be, doctors are convinced. — We must teach all those who come to us so that they do not get lost in combat conditions. Of course, they are not seeing these tourniquets and bandages for the first time, but we understand very well that time and opportunities to bring knowledge and skills to a perfect level are not always enough, - explains Vladyslava. She does not hide that not only the attitude of the fighters, but also the level of their training after passing the BZVP can be different. There are those who after the training center really have a sufficient level of knowledge and skills, but there are also those who wasted their time and did not learn even the most necessary minimum at a sufficient level. — There are cases when they think that they only have to learn how to shoot from an automatic machine, and they don't really need everything else. I encountered this quite often. Because of this, we make sure to train all new arrivals and then try to repeat them every time the opportunity arises, says Yuriy. Because of this attitude, some have to be forced to learn through disciplinary measures. Instead, it's always nice to have one or two motivated fighters in a training group who set the tone and become an example for others to follow. — What is important for us is what we have taught them now, what we have taught them right here. Because we understand that from now on the responsibility for their training lies with us, emphasizes Puma. The truth of these words is confirmed by intensive training, during which Yuriy and Vladislava give 100%, either working with the whole group of fighters at the same time, or by dividing them into pairs or singling out someone alone. It is noticeable that doctors treat their mission extremely responsibly and diligently.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/yak-vidbuvayetsya-pidgotovka-z-takmedu-majsterklas-vid-instruktoriv-kabana-tapumy/	2024-11-23T21:02:26-08:00
Barrage -Jackal-: a new high-precision missile with a turbojet engine was presented in the USA	As stated in the abstract of this project on the official portal of this corporation with headquarters in Virginia, the Jackal multi-purpose missile (-Шакал- in Ukrainian) can use both lethal and non-lethal payloads for a range of functions such as electronic warfare and reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence (ISR), ArmyInform reported. Developed in cooperation with AeroVironment, this rocket uses the technological developments of the Switchblade series, a family of ammunition that has already proven itself well in practical applications. It should be noted that the Switchblade barrage drones (-Ejection Knife- in Ukrainian) have repeatedly dopomogy-na-13-mlrd/->included in the packages of weapons that were transferred to the Defense Forces as part of the foreign partnerships and about which our editors in detail she told in her publications. The Jackal missile features a modular configuration that allows integration of lethal and non-lethal payloads suitable for complex military operations. Thanks to its turbojet engine running on JP-10 fuel, the Jackal missile can reach a speed of more than 644 km/h, has a flight range of 100 kilometers and can stay in the air for about 15 minutes. Its useful load capacity is 4.5 kilograms. The open architecture of the Jackal missile allows for flexible integration of various payloads, including electronic warfare (EW) systems, reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence (ISR) equipment. This missile can be deployed on air, land and sea platforms. The Jackal missile was first presented at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) in Tampa, Florida. in May 2022. As the manufacturer explains, the purpose of the Jackal missile was to fill the gap between existing ammunition, such as the Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600, thanks to increased range, speed and versatility. While the Switchblade 300 is ideal for precision strikes at short ranges and is adept at dealing with armor, the Jackal strikes a balance between speed and payload as it can carry heavy warheads and other essential equipment over long distances while maintaining the flexibility needed to dynamic combat conditions. Moreover, as Northrop Grumman points out, the Jackal missile is an excellent choice for counter-terrorism missions, allowing it to gather valuable information in difficult environments for a long time before striking. As emphasize defense market researchers from the profile portal Army Recognition, this high-precision strike missile combines advanced avionics and flight control systems, designed for navigation in conditions where GPS is unavailable, ensuring operational reliability even when conventional navigation systems fail. The Jackal missile's next-generation flight control system offers advanced capabilities such as GPS-disabled navigation and an automatic targeting mechanism that is fine-tuned for target recognition, detection and enhanced situational awareness. Thanks to its high-speed turbojet engine, the Jackal missile quickly reaches targets, providing the necessary response to emerging threats, which is an important feature for maintaining tactical superiority in changing combat scenarios. Due to its modular design, the Jackal missile provides a variety of effects, both lethal and non-lethal. It autonomously follows set waypoints and can be reconfigured in flight depending on tactical tasks. Once a target is detected, the warhead reactively accelerates to intercept the target, setting new standards for tactical superiority in range, accuracy and speed. -Today's rapidly changing landscape requires multi-domain solutions that are flexible, resilient, and able to respond quickly to tactical demands to meet these demands. The Jackal missile is a next-generation high-precision strike missile that provides critical countermeasures in high-stress conditions when launched from air, land and sea platforms at a range of more than 100 km,- says a new video about this munition posted by Northrop Grumman on YouTube . According to Northrop Grumman, the Jackal missile has attracted a lot of military interest since its initial presentation. In November 2022, the system completed a series of successful test flights, and additional demonstrations are planned for 2024 to further improve its capabilities and bring it into line with potential US military missions. In the ever-changing conditions of warfare, the Jackal missile offers a cost-effective and versatile solution for modern armed forces, capable of delivering high-precision strikes and strategic surveillance at the same time, emphasizes Northrop Grumman.

How to become a reckless UAV pilot: tips from an instructor	- What qualities should a UAV operator have? - Let's start with the fact that UAVs are different. The main division is copters and -wings-. And, for example, the skills and mental toughness of FPV strike drone pilots and wing operators are exactly the opposite. Because, relatively speaking, if a person is determined to shoot videos for TikTok, scouting is not an option for him, because there will never be any interesting stories. To shoot such videos, you need to be either an FPV shooter or a fixer. And these are different professions. A scout actually needs a certain amount of boredom and a normal education. That is, if a person does not understand how radio waves work, he will not be able to fly an airplane. It is also necessary to understand that he will not have any spectacular heroism, but will stupidly and methodically perform the same work every day. And not everyone can stand it. I know that people have tried to switch from scouting boards to strike boards or tried to be transferred to artillery by adjusters. This also has to be done by someone, and if the person's character is more suited to it, this is the right decision. - What qualities do an FPV drone operator need? - FPV drone operator is probably one of the most difficult professions in terms of training. A pilot needs a certain recklessness. They are closer than anyone to the front line. It is necessary to dig a lot, to be able to quickly collect and assemble your household, to haul it, because it is a question of their survival, and you need to calmly treat the spectacle of human bodies torn to pieces. In fact, they are probably the last fighters in modern warfare who look the enemy in the eye before he dies. And I know that many people dream about it at night. - What should a person who wants to become a reconnaissance drone operator know? - The cadet should know that he will receive, as a rule, the task of scouting a specific area. That is, either to walk along such and such landings, or to explore such and such a settlement, or simply to conduct preliminary reconnaissance. Here, for example, we know that something was or can be at such and such coordinates. You fly everything again and find out - it's still there, or it's gone, or in that place where it was empty, something has appeared, or confirm the target has been hit. That is, we know that the REB was there, and you take off and find out why it turned off - or it died, or it left, or it is just silent. For his part, the -wings- operator must know the entire terrain of his unit in depth, in fact, reconnaissance, and another 20-30 percent, must clearly know the map in order to anchor at any moment and understand where he is. Simply because the Western fantasy that we will go to war for GPS has little to do with reality. You need to understand where you place your point so that, firstly, you are found as the latest, and secondly, so that you have time to leave this point in time. In other words, the scout does not sit in one place, unlike the adjuster. The task of a scout is to arrive, set up, and it is good if there is a shelter nearby, if there is not and there is no way to prepare it in advance, which, unfortunately, happens often, then he started from the ground, worked, quickly gathered and changed the location. It is advisable to make the second departure in a day from another place. - So that's all you teach your cadets? - Yes, that's exactly it. Here, for example, is the question of how to choose a position for an airplane. It should have many factors, in contrast to vertical take-off boards, such as -quadricopters-. You are tied not only to how to place the antennae, not only to how to place yourself so that you don't get killed. You are still tied to how you will raise and lower your plane based on today's wind. The position may be perfect for everyone, but you either can't raise the plane or you can't lower it. — What other qualities do cadets need? — Let me remind you that -wing- scouts need perseverance and attention, and FPV-schneiders need recklessness. These are incompatible qualities, so we divide the cadets immediately. Well, you need the ability to turn nuts, solder circuits, glue, etc. That is why people of working specialties who can fix something, if necessary, show themselves best in training. If a person still has some imagination to come up with a field upgrade on the plane, this is also a plus, because the shortcomings of the boards are compensated solely by the skills of the crew. — What percentage of cadets drop out during training? — There is a general rule: the cheaper and simpler the plane, the more difficult it is to learn to fly. The number of people who could not finish the course is quite large among the same FPV pilots, there are very difficult piloting skills. That is, what in more expensive boards is partly taken over by automation, you do everything yourself. The control complexity is about the same as that of World War II fighter jets. But overall, not very much. - What are the age restrictions for cadets? - I will say yes. For -wings-, age is not a critical factor. For FPV, this is actually more critical because, once again, there is no automation, and the speed of reaction is very important. That's why people often don't pull because of their age, people with concussions don't pull, people with a bad vestibular apparatus don't pull. Simply because, when you look at this screen, where everything swings around you at full height, it can really make you feel sick and sick. - How long does the training take? - Currently one and a half months. It is possible to train a person from zero to a pilot who will perform the task in that time, and it is almost always successful.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/yak-staty-bezshabashnym-pilotom-bpla-porady-instruktora/	2024-11-23T20:33:19-08:00
The Ministry of Defense named the most popular combat specialties for which women entered in 2024	The Department of Military Education and Science of the Ministry of Defense informed ArmiyaInform about this. -The most popular among women were the majors and specializations that prepare commanders of mechanized units, units of Airborne Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces,- the department noted. In 2024, the number of women enrolled in higher military educational institutions, military educational units of higher education institutions, and professional advanced military education institutions of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system was 31.5%, which is 3.2% more than last year. Earlier ArmyInform reported that at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petr Sahaidachny, many women study such combat specializations, as -Complexes, devices and devices of artillery reconnaissance-, -Management of the actions of artillery units- and -Management of the actions of mechanized troops units-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/u-minoborony-nazvaly-najpopulyarnishi-bojovi-speczialnosti-na-yaki-vstupaly-zhinky-u-2024-roczi/	2024-11-23T20:21:40-08:00
The enemy spreads lies about -provocations- in the capital	The training of all structures, forces and departments, which are working out measures to counter provocations that Putin's fakers are constantly seeing, has really begun in Kyiv. As noted the head of KMVA Serhii Popko, these trainings are conducted with the aim of increasing the level of skills, interaction and combat capabilities of all structures that ensure the defense of the capital. Such trainings will continue to be held systematically in Kyiv. They are needed to better prepare for the important task of protecting Kyiv and its residents from potential threats. Therefore, for everyone who works for the enemy in Kyiv, they definitely pose a danger. After all, sooner or later all separatists and collaborators will be discovered and severely punished. But the purpose of the lies spread by faikomets is to sow distrust of the population in the authorities and the Defense Forces. Such -throwbacks- are a typical reaction of the enemy to the strengthening of Ukraine's defense capabilities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/vorog-poshyryuye-brehnyu-shhodo-provokaczij-u-stolyczi/	2024-11-23T20:05:23-08:00
Falling drones due to the work of friendly EW: how to solve the problem	He told this in an interview with Grunt media. -We all understand very well that our EW, at a short distance to the battle line, is fighting enemy UAVs, anti-aircraft missiles, other types of enemy missiles and vehicles. Therefore, in order to work, we always have to personally establish interaction with such units on horizontal lines,- he noted. According to him, it sometimes happens that their groups directly in the execution area come into contact with each neighboring unit, and only then use their means. As reported by ArmyInform, Charlie previously told that over the past year and a half, Russian invaders have learned to quickly adapt and modernize drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/__trashed-3/	2024-11-23T11:27:05-08:00
Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the G20 summit because of weak support for Ukraine	He said about this while communicating with journalists within the framework of the Third Grain from Ukraine International Conference. The head of state noted that the majority of the Brazilian people support Ukraine, and thanked him for that. At the same time, in his opinion, President Lula da Silva of Brazil, the country that currently chairs the G20 and hosted the summit, has shown a weak stance on the war. -If we want good, normal relations between our nations, between our peoples, then we should probably support people first of all, and not aggressors, leaders of aggression in the world, such as Putin, such as today's, modern Russia,- explained the President of Ukraine . According to him, the weakness shown during the G20 summit gave the Russian dictator the opportunity to hit Ukraine with new missiles during the meeting of the G20 leaders. -I don't think that populism can stop Putin. I don't think cheap energy is going to protect your freedom in the long run. I believe that this is a wrong move,- the head of state noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also emphasized: when there will be strong statements, calls and steps, the Russian dictator will not be able to behave as he is doing now. In addition, the President noted that Ukraine raised the issue of reforming the UN Security Council due to its ineffectiveness. -Everyone is talking about this, but the reform of the UN Security Council is not taking place. There are players who do not want any reforms, because otherwise their influence will be less,- said the head of state. The President of Ukraine added that every two or three months, Putin escalates on the front in order to raise the stakes and not sit down at the negotiating table. Without a clear position of the major countries - the United States, Brazil, Asian and African countries - the agreement with Putin will be a delay and a continuation of Russian intimidation. At the same time, all steps proposed by Ukraine to end the war are based on the UN Charter. Our country hopes that its partners will support them. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky supports the transition to the corps control system in the ZSU, if it reduces bureaucracy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rozkrytykuvav-samit-g20-cherez-slabku-pidtrymku-ukrayiny/	2024-11-23T11:17:17-08:00
How awards are developed: details from the Ministry of Defense	About his work the head of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Lt. Col. Maxim Kayola. -It is staffed by military personnel and civil servants with a history major. We also have an Honored Artist of Ukraine. We try to move away from the specialization of the military for which we produce awards. We also introduce our Ukrainian traditions to encourage soldiers to study history,- he said. According to Maxim Kayol, their task is to make such an award so that the serviceman, when receiving it, feels that the state appreciated what he did. -It's a war right now, so it's very important. And all of this also happens immediately upon contact with the relevant type of troops. They look, we definitely agree with them. If they don't like something, we do it so that everyone is satisfied, there are standards, and our Ukrainian symbols are deployed in the Armed Forces of Ukraine,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, previously the head of the Central Department for the Development of Material Support of the Military Intelligence Servicetold about food standards in the army and the developments that are currently being implemented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/yak-vidbuvayetsya-rozrobka-nagorod-detali-vid-minoborony/	2024-11-23T11:07:54-08:00
The educational process according to the standards of the Russian Federation: another collaborator r...	The Kherson Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. Also, the convicted person is deprived of the right to hold positions in the bodies of state power and local self-government for a period of 15 years. The investigation established that in June 2022, the man voluntarily assumed the position of the so-called -head of the education department of the Novokakhov temporary military-civilian administration.- In this pseudo-position, he ensured the operation of educational institutions according to the standards of the Russian Federation, conducted inspections of schools, inventoried their property, and appointed managers who agreed to cooperate with the occupation administration. As reported by ArmyInform, the guard dog of the occupiers: a traitor in epaulettes who switched to the side of Russia was exposed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/osvitnij-proczes-za-standartamy-rf-chergovyj-kolaborant-otrymav-vyrok-za-robotu-na-voroga/	2024-11-23T10:54:50-08:00
-Generals should be in the trenches-: Volodymyr Zelenskyy supports the transition to a corps managem...	About this head of state said during a meeting with media representatives within the framework of the Third International Conference on Food Security Grain from Ukraine. -This is for the military to decide. If the corps system they are proposing today will reduce the distance between the general and the soldier, if this bureaucracy will be reduced, let them do so to reduce it,- the head of state noted. The president emphasized that the task now is to reduce bureaucracy in the army. In particular, this should be taken care of by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi. -An officer must see a soldier. A general who has not been in the trenches is not a general for me personally. Despite the experience. With all due respect. Today, the most difficult situation is on the front line, in the trenches,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. According to the President, it is necessary not only to talk about problematic issues at Stavka or in the command headquarters, but also to communicate directly with the soldiers. -That's why Syrsky is always at the front, always traveling. We communicate with him every day, twice a day. He has a morning and evening report. But still this is not enough. The generals must be in the trenches. This is the war. The morale of the military is the most important,- the President emphasized. He also emphasized that Putin's main task now is to oust the Ukrainian military from the Kursk region, and by January 20. -It is very important for him to demonstrate that he is in control of the situation. He is not in control of the situation. The Kursk operation is not a toy. We have shown that Putin is unable to fully defend his state. He threw everything at the occupation and destruction of Ukraine,- the head of state said. In addition, as the President of Ukraine noted, the Russian dictator wants to show that he will allegedly achieve the stated goal of occupying the entire Donbas. -From this and our respective results. Difficulties in the East, yes. Not enough armed forces there, yes. Understaffing exists for a variety of reasons. Specifically, delayed delivery, yes. But nevertheless we are there. We are defending our homeland. And under Putin, there have never been such losses as today in the Kursk direction,- the President summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Third International Summit on Food Security Grain from Ukraine metwith the minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic Jan Lipavsky and discussed cooperation between Ukraine and the Czech Republic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/generaly-mayut-buty-v-okopah-volodymyr-zelenskyj-pidtrymuye-perehid-na-korpusnu-systemu-upravlinnya-v-zsu/	2024-11-23T10:25:41-08:00
Dodgers in rubber flip-flops were looking for safe shallow water on the Tisza in the snow	About this informs the State Border Service of Ukraine. According to law enforcement officials, the organizers of the illegal crossing offered a rubber boat and instructions on -safe shallow water- for 10,000 US dollars each. The total amount that the violators paid amounted to more than 400 thousand hryvnias. Four men, three from Donetsk region and one from Ivano-Frankivsk region, agreed to these risky conditions. Their plans were destroyed by the border guards who spotted the trespassers. After several warning shots were fired, the offenders left the boat and tried to escape, but were apprehended. The detainees were taken to the border unit, where administrative protocols were drawn up on them under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code (-Illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine-) and Art. 185-10 of the Criminal Procedure Code (-Malicious disobedience to a lawful order or demand of a military serviceman or an employee of the State Border Service-). The court will soon evaluate the actions of the detainees. In the meantime, operatives continue their investigation to identify the individuals involved in the organization of this illegal border crossing attempt. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/uhylyanty-v-rezynovyh-shlopanczyah-na-snigu-shukaly-bezpechne-milkovoddya-na-tysi/	2024-11-23T10:13:22-08:00
The Ministry of Defense reported how corruption is prevented	This was told by the head of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Kayola. -I had the opportunity to sort employees, both military and civil servants. We have established requirements for their reliability. They were being tested. We have a desire to contribute to our Victory,- he said. The Ministry of Defense also created the Internet platform -Partner MOU-. -Through this platform we work. All requests, all submissions of documents for acts, for military experimental tests must be made through the -MoU Partner-. Why? Because this program is tracked, no applications, no documents will be lost,- he explained. In addition, a technical committee consisting of 11 specialists was established in the MOU for each sector. -They investigate each issue, then meet and make a decision as to compliance or non-compliance. Does this product go to military trials or not; or maybe it needs to be refined. That is, we have created a system that is as transparent as possible, we involve the maximum number of people,- he noted. According to him, in order to prevent corruption, they also involve the Command of the Logistics Forces, the Central Office of Quality Control, the State Rear Operator, so that everyone is in the process and understands what is happening in the MOU. Earlier, the Minister of Defense Rustem Umyerov emphasized the priority of the struggle with corruption in all areas for which his department is responsible. As reported by ArmyInform, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption (NACP) together with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine presented a new study, which identifies the main corruption risks in the rear procurement system for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and offers recommendations for their elimination.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/korupczijni-skandaly-yak-u-minoborony-zapobigayut-korupcziyi/	2024-11-23T09:51:59-08:00

Suits with protection against fragments and thermal imaging systems, women's body armor are new deve...	About this told the head of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Caiola during SMALL TALK. According to him, there will be very big changes in material support, the wishes of the fighters -from the fields- were taken into account. -They have requests to make normal pants with built-in knee pads. The combat shirt will be made of -Coolmax- fabric for moisture removal. Now we are fruitfully working on means of personal protection, such as bulletproof vests and helmets. We have already developed and implemented 8 samples of bulletproof vests and 8 samples of helmets,- said Maxim Kayola. He also reported that a -special ballistic suit- with better protection against shrapnel is currently under development, as shrapnel damage is the predominant one. In addition, a -universal awning- and a -special suit to provide protection against thermal imaging systems- are under development. According to him, this is what our army needs very much. And the task of the management of the development of material support to implement this by the end of the year will be fulfilled. -Also, we are currently developing a women's bulletproof vest. This is very important, because the anthropometric data of women must be taken into account. This is necessary so that it is a little lighter, fits well. So that a woman can perform her tasks like a military serviceman,- emphasized Maxim Kayola. Currently, a -summer special suit- has been developed for women with requirements for their figure. This suit has already been purchased, it is in stock, it is already issued. Management is currently working on underwear for cool and cold winter, winter jacket and pants. -We have anticipated everything our servicewomen want. We will now conduct military experiments, both in the war zone and in the rear areas. After all, before developing something, we always communicate with people from different families, types of troops, to understand what they need, what they want. And they should make what they will use, not what they receive and put somewhere in the closet,- explained Maxim Kayola. As reported by ArmiyaInform, previously the head of the Central Department for the Development of Material Support of the IOM told about the food standards in the army and the developments that are currently being introduced to them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/kostyumy-iz-zahystom-vid-oskolkiv-ta-teplovizijnyh-system-zhinochyj-bronezhylet-novi-rozrobky-minoborony/	2024-11-23T09:02:54-08:00

Decoy drones, repeaters, new enemy tactics: how the occupiers are modernizing UAVs	the commander of the 14th separate regiment of unmanned aviation complexes of the SBS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told about it under the pseudonym -Charlie- in an interview with -Grunt- media. -For example, a year ago they used exclusively their -geranium-shaheds-, and now they have changed their tactics a little: they put various types of equipment on their shaheds, put video communication channels that help them detect various moments on our territory,- he noted . According to him, the first few drones are -going for detection-, other drones are already directed directly to the target. -They use baits, this was not the case before. That is, decoy drones are launched in front of the Shaheds, which discharge our air defense system,- explained Charlie. As he noted, if we talk about Russian intelligence tools, they are modernizing visual surveillance systems that allow them to work in different weather conditions, time of day and observe at a greater distance. They also use different types of repeaters that allow them to fly over long distances. -Today, we see that their reconnaissance drones directly fly to such cities as Dnipro, Poltava. Therefore, unfortunately, they are not in place,- Charlie emphasized. However, according to him, thanks to caring people and organizations that help the Defense Forces, an effective system for countering the enemy's reconnaissance UAVs is currently set up. In addition, the commander of the 14th separate regiment of the BpAK spoke about providing his unit with -wings-. -50 percent is provided by measures from the side of partners, if we are talking specifically about intelligence wings. 50% are partners, 30% are the state and 20% are volunteers,- he said. We will remind, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have started work first training school for operators of unmanned ground robotic complexes (BpNK). As reported by ArmyInform, in the Forces of unmanned systems name the specialists who are in the greatest need: drivers of various categories, clerks, repairmen of various electrical appliances.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/drony-prymanky-retranslyatory-nova-taktyka-voroga-yak-okupanty-modernizuyut-bpla/	2024-11-23T08:08:17-08:00
Torture, abuse and training -specialists-: the GUR spoke about the torture system of the Russian Fed...	told this during a speech at the forum -Genocidal practices of the Russian Federation in Ukraine: from the Holodomor to Russian-Ukrainian War- representative of the State Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov. He cited the facts about the system of violating the rights of prisoners built in the Russian Federation. -In most cases, it was not about the use of force to obtain information. These are intentional tortures to break a person's resistance, break their personality, degrade their dignity and force them to give up everything that is valuable to that person. Or to break someone who is close to him,- said Andriy Yusov. According to him, a whole system of torture operates in the aggressor country. -Individuals are responsible for this. This is how individual -specialists- are trained - the types of torture are described, and they learn from them. This is something that cannot be imagined by any representative of a Western civilized country,- he noted. Andriy Yusov also noted that the structures responsible for monitoring the observance and protection of the Geneva Conventions and humanitarian law do not actually work. -Yes, we are talking about the International Committee of the Red Cross, which Russia, on the one hand, is effectively depriving it of the opportunity to work: it does not allow access to places of detention, does not involve it in training and exchanges. At the same time, the position of the ICRC, frankly speaking, in many cases should be much more proactive,- stressed Andriy Yusov. He emphasized that it is not Ukraine as a victim that should talk about the recorded -absolutely flagrant- examples of violations of the Geneva Conventions on the part of the Russian Federation, but those structures that are responsible for monitoring their observance and implementation. He reminded that even in these difficult conditions, Ukraine continues to work on the return from captivity of our captured defenders and kidnapped civilians. During the full-scale invasion, 58 exchanges already took place: almost 4 thousand Ukrainians managed to return home. -Unfortunately, thousands of others are still in question. And it is necessary to fight for them: both for the military and for the civilians,- emphasized Andriy Yusov. We will remind you that in October-November of this year 13 criminal proceedings were registered /a> according to the facts of the shooting of 54 Ukrainian prisoners of war. This is a third of all proceedings initiated in 2024 on such facts. As reported by ArmyInform, the Prosecutor General's Office reported on the initiated investigation into the fact shooting by Russian servicemen of five captured soldiers of the Armed Forces near Vugledar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/tortury-znushhannya-i-pidgotovka-speczialistiv-u-gur-rozpovily-pro-systemu-katuvan-rf/	2024-11-23T07:54:50-08:00

-Vegan menu-, halal and kosher sukhpai: the MOU spoke about the standards and innovations of food in...	This is what he told during SMALL TALK. -Changes in the food security system are ongoing. This is due to the fact that there are new challenges in the troops, new tasks, new strategy, new tactics. -Basically, our task is to make the use of food supply effective and appropriate, so that the fighters are well provided with caloric, quality and diverse food products,- Maksym Kayola noted. He said that dry food kits, so-called -sukhpai- - halal and kosher - are now being introduced for people with special religious beliefs. Such attention of the military leadership to their needs significantly increases morale. -This was implemented at the behest of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, because he wants to provide for all families, types of troops, servicemen of all religious beliefs. We are also currently working on introducing a vegan menu for people who do not use products of animal origin according to their beliefs. But for this we need to change the -normatives-, we are working on this,- added the head of the Central Department for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Education and Culture.

Shooting lists and mobile crematoria: Russia planned the genocide of Ukrainians long before the inva...	This was announced the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, during the forum -Genocidal Practices Russian Federation in Ukraine: from the Holodomor to the Russian-Ukrainian War-, which took place on November 22, 2024. According to Kirill Budanov, the preparation included the creation of firing lists, the deployment of mobile mobile crematoria and the organization of mass burials. Russian propaganda and the state machine called for the destruction of Ukrainians, based on theses voiced in Putin's article published in July 2021. In this article, the Russian dictator denied the right of Ukrainians to exist, which became the ideological basis of future crimes. Kyrylo Budanov noted that total Ukrainophobia has become not only the policy of the Russian authorities, but also a mandatory public conviction. Before the start of the invasion, the occupiers were briefed on the location of mass graves and the compilation of firing lists. They planned to include Ukrainian language and literature teachers, ATO veterans, journalists, priests, public figures and others who supported Ukrainian statehood. The head of the GUR MOU emphasized that the mass crimes of the Russian military in Buch, Borodyanka, Gostomel, Izyum, Mariupol and other cities were not chaotic, but planned and synchronous. These actions were based on the doctrinal provisions of the Russian genocidal policy. The forum, in addition to military experts, was attended by Holodomor researchers, historians, public representatives and foreign guests, who discussed the crimes of the Russian government against the Ukrainian people, which have continued since the Holodomor until today. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov addressed Ukrainians on the Holodomor Memorial Day, emphasizing the importance of preserving historical memory and countering Russian aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/rozstrilni-spysky-ta-mobilni-krematoriyi-rosiya-planuvala-genoczyd-ukrayincziv-zadovgo-do-vijny/	2024-11-23T01:33:07-08:00
An ambulance that will not come: Russia has brought a decline in the medicine of the occupied Luhans...	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In many cities, even before, only one ambulance crew was on duty per shift, as a result of which calls often went unanswered, and patients waited for hours. Tragic cases when people did not wait for a doctor have repeatedly become a reason for criticism. Although the number of special vehicles allegedly increased on paper, the real ambulances provided by Russia disappeared without a trace. Instead, doctors, paramedics and drivers are now being cut. In Starobilsk, air alerts are regularly announced, even when there is no threat in the neighboring areas or in the entire -rear- part of the -LNR-. During such events, propaganda meetings are held in schools, during which children are moved to damp, unfurnished basements, where anti-Ukrainian lectures are organized. In addition, the occupation administration regularly organizes meetings of children with the Russian military, using them to plant propaganda. These actions of the occupiers cause increasing indignation among the population, which is faced with the decline of the medical field and aggressive propaganda in educational institutions. As reported by ArmyInform, in Alchevsk, as well as in other settlements of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region, the situation with the removal of garbage has remained critical for more than ten years. Spontaneous landfills continue to grow, and instead of solving the problem the occupation administration chose the path of repression, installing more than 100 video surveillance cameras to fine citizens for littering.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/shvydka-shho-ne-pryyide-rosiya-prynesla-zanepad-u-medyczyni-okupovanoyi-luganshhyny/	2024-11-23T01:11:12-08:00

-They are activated to destabilize the situation-: how the occupiers disguised as pixels act	told the commander of the battalion of strike unmanned aviation complexes of the 92nd separate brigade named after the Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk Yuriy Fedorenko told about this. -Now they are resorting to a new tactic, namely: dressing up as a Ukrainian pixel, trying to infiltrate through our battle formations into the rear areas,- he said. The officer explained the purpose of the Russian invaders. - They are there in a certain waiting mode, while the strike group is assembled, which begins active operations from the front. And that's when they step up to destabilize the situation, damage our reserves, mortars and other firepower, the military said. However, the Defense Forces are well aware of this insidious enemy tactic and effectively counter it. — Since we are talking about this with you, the Defense Forces are very well aware of such tactics of the enemy, since he has been using them since the beginning of an essentially full-scale war. Only now it is gaining a larger volume, said the commander of the Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian defenders timely detect the occupiers hidden in the pixel and eliminate them or capture them. - The vast majority of these groups are detected by the Defense Forces, eliminated and captured when the opportunity arises. But not all of them surrender, so they are mostly liquidated, said Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that occupiers dressed in Ukrainian uniforms are effectively detected on the field battle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/aktyvizuyutsya-shhob-destabilizuvaty-sytuacziyu-yak-diyut-perevdyagnuti-u-piksel-okupanty/	2024-11-22T23:57:11-08:00

Kupyan adventure in kamikaze mode: the Armed Forces explained how the Russians managed to jump into ...	told the commander of the battalion of strike unmanned aviation complexes of the 92nd separate brigade named after the Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk Yuriy Fedorenko told about this. — The situation unfolded as follows: taking advantage of the unfavorable weather conditions - the fog, which was thick enough, the enemy in kamikaze mode used one unit of armored equipment, such as a tank with trawls that removes mine barriers, and two MTLB. These are combat armored vehicles for transporting, in particular, infantry units, he said. For the place of an unexpected attack, the enemy chose an area least suitable for the use of armored vehicles. -At high speed, [the Russians] jumped in at the place that is the least passable for lightly armored and armored vehicles,- explained the soldier. However, as soon as the equipment and manpower of the occupiers were discovered by the fighters of the Defense Forces, the enemy was inflicted with fire damage. The equipment was burned, and the landing party was partly destroyed, partly captured. - As soon as they crossed this line, they were detected by the Defense Forces, after which a fire was inflicted, as a result of which the tank was burned, two MTLBs were burned, and the enemy's assault infantry was eliminated, - Yuriy Fedorenko said. Those of the Russian military who were lucky enough to be captured provided important intelligence. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how in Kharkiv Oblast, a Ukrainian Paladin hit a Russian tank hiding in a garage.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/kupyanska-avantyura-v-rezhymi-kamikadze-v-zsu-poyasnyly-yak-rosiyanam-vdalosya-zaskochyly-v-misto/	2024-11-22T23:29:34-08:00

Minister of Defense: Hunger as a weapon is a crime we will not forget	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. -This day reminds us that the enemy is willing to use any means to achieve their goals. Hunger as a weapon is a crime for which millions of Ukrainians paid with their lives. We remember our ancestors and honor their memory,- the minister noted. Rustem Umyerov emphasized that Russia still uses the same methods today: spreading disinformation, denying historical facts and using economic pressure. The Kremlin, as in the past, is trying to manipulate grain, creating a threat of famine not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole world. -In the 21st century, the enemy will not go unpunished. We are destroying the Russian fleet that is blocking the grain corridor, and we are striking bases and warehouses where attacks on our agricultural infrastructure are being planned. Ukraine is already bringing the aggressor to justice,- he emphasized. The minister appealed to his compatriots to honor the memory of the Holodomor victims and to continue the struggle for independence. -We are fighting for a peaceful future of Ukraine and the world. We remember the tragedies of the past and take revenge for our tortured ancestors. Ukraine will win, and Russian evil will be punished,- Rustem Umyerov concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/ministr-oborony-golod-yak-zbroya-zlochyn-yakyj-my-ne-zabudemo/	2024-11-22T22:44:08-08:00

Is it possible to freeze the war: the expert told when the new phase of the conflict will begin	-There will be a great truce after all. We will not miss it. Why? In order for it not to exist, the Russian Federation must lose the war. The loss in the war of the Russian Federation, if we go to the borders of 1991, is its disintegration. It is reinforced concrete. But there is no solution to its disintegration. If there is no such solution, then in some part there will be a frozen conflict - exit from the phase of hostilities. As soon as this -freeze- or suspension of hostilities takes place, both we and they will go into military capacity building. It will be so without fail. And if at this moment of the historic truce a decision is not taken on the collapse of the Russian Federation, then the next Russian-Ukrainian war is only a matter of time. It can be in half a year, it can be in a year. I am a fan of the version that is at least five years old. Because they still have to recover. At this moment, the Russian Federation has lost within 50% of its convention potential. With the exception of nuclear. It is still very powerful - the second on the planet Earth. Because this war will only end when they are defeated or get their way. That is, they will join Ukraine to Russia. But, in my opinion, this is already impossible in this historical context. For two simple reasons. First, we are supported by the entire civilized world. And primarily the Anglo-Saxons. This is very fundamental. And the second important point is that we managed to keep the capital. There is even such a historical saying: -who owns Kyiv, owns Ukraine.- They are doomed to defeat. The only question is when this defeat will come. But they cannot refuse us, because it is part of their social ideology. Lenin has a brilliant saying for this case: -losing Ukraine is the same as losing one's head.- State identity is the most powerful feature of any human community. And their state identity sprouts from the concept of our Kyivan Rus. That's how everything will be. I am sure that in the next phase of the war we will achieve a historic victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/chy-mozhlyva-zamorozka-vijny-ekspert-rozpoviv-koly-rozpochnetsya-nova-faza-konfliktu/	2024-11-22T21:12:50-08:00
Ready for any mission: a surveillance drone with ultra-fast transformation properties was presented ...	Presenting its aircraft, this firm, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, on the official portal said's Group 2 eVTOL autonomous drone, the P550, redefines battlefield adaptability, setting a new standard for rapid deployment in any environment, ArmyInform reports. The goal of the new P550 project was to create an unmanned aircraft with high flight and operational characteristics. Representatives of AeroVironment note that there are already UAVs on the market that are equipped with effective reconnaissance and/or weapons, as well as devices capable of flying for several hours. Within the framework of the new project, the company sought to combine all these qualities in one drone. To simplify the design process, the design of the P550 used many ideas and components from existing products. The main sources were drones well-known in the United States military Puma and Raven by AeroVironment. At the same time, it was not possible without the introduction of new solutions and components. As a result, a medium-sized UAV was created, capable of vertical takeoff and landing, as well as a horizontal flight lasting several hours. The P550 may carry reconnaissance equipment, a communications relay, light weapons, or other equipment. Currently, the new UAV is undergoing flight tests, during which it demonstrates its capabilities and confirms the correctness of the applied technical solutions. After the tests are completed, the company will be able to offer this drone to potential customers. For obvious reasons, the main commercial hopes are tied to the Pentagon. The P550 product is an unmanned aircraft with a classic aerodynamic scheme. At the same time, its design has some features due to which additional working and operational capabilities are achieved, as well as important advantages are provided. The P550 UAV has a torpedo-shaped fuselage, complemented by a thin tubular tail beam. A mid-positioned wing with a slight sweep is combined with the fuselage. Near the centerplane on the wing are two compact nacelles of marching engines. At a distance from them, longer gondolas with lifting propeller groups are placed. Tail feathers are traditional, with stabilizer and keel. For transportation, the drone is separated into several units. All of them fit into three containers that can be transported by any vehicle. Pre-launch assembly takes minutes and is done without any tools: it takes less than 10 minutes to prepare for flight after unpacking. The total length of such a drone reaches 2.7 m, the wingspan is 4.25 m. The maximum take-off weight is set at 25 kg and includes a significant payload. For example, a drone can carry up to 7 kilograms of explosives. The AeroVironment company classifies the P550 as the 2nd group of UAVs according to the Pentagon's classification. The drone has six traction electric motors with propellers. Four are placed on wing nacelles and provide vertical take-off, landing and hovering. Two more are on the wing and provide horizontal flight. Engine types and specifications are not disclosed. The flight data of the UAV is also still unknown. It was only reported that the P550 will be able to stay in the air for up to 5 hours. The communication range is 40 km, but can be increased to 60 km. In all configurations and configurations, the drone has an autopilot and a remote control system. They must interact with the operator and carry out his commands, as well as control the payload of all types in solving any assigned tasks. The control panel reportedly has software to automatically process intelligence data. A special program based on artificial intelligence should study the picture from the cameras and look for potential targets to hit on it. Such software should simplify the operator's work and increase the speed of the entire unmanned intelligence system. The issue of installing and replacing the payload is solved in a rather interesting way. A removable part of the fuselage, which includes the nose fairing and part of the bottom, is designated for the placement of various devices. The module with the necessary equipment is attached to the centerplane of the wing, and the UAV receives the necessary functions. All module variants are equipped with optical-electronic systems. -Bullets- of various types carry video cameras, thermal imagers and/or laser rangefinders. It is possible to use other equipment. So, at the AUSA 2024 exhibition, as the Shephard publication informs, showed modules with a radio signal repeater and a weapons carrier module. The combat variant of the P550 carries a swappable module with a pair of pylons on the bottom. At the exhibition UAV on them placed Shryke-type small-scale guided bombs. The principle possibility of using other ammunition is reported. AeroVironment is currently studying such possibilities and plans to expand its range of repellents. The company AeroVironment proposes to use its new P550 UAV in military units at the tactical level. With its help, the army units will be able to effectively solve several basic tasks, and it is expected that the efficiency of such processes will increase. The successful application of the new UAV should be facilitated by its high characteristics as an aerial platform. This drone is easy to operate, able to take off from small areas and stay in the air for several hours. Not all modern drones of this class can boast of such capabilities. Three variants of variable payload modules have already been created for the P550. With their help, the drone can perform various tasks: conduct reconnaissance, target guidance, relay signals or use weapons. The ability to solve various tasks with one UAV as such is a plus. In addition, they have their own capabilities and advantages of various modules, devices and weapons. The automation of intelligence processes is of great interest. It is claimed that the software of the unmanned complex is capable of analyzing images from optical-electronic systems and finding various objects. If this feature is fully implemented, the P550 will become a much more user-friendly reconnaissance tool and give it a significant advantage over the competition. However, the P550 has its drawbacks. Its main problems are common to all such UAVs. First of all, this is the dependence on radio communication and vulnerability for modern air defense. In addition, this project implements several bold ideas that may have some technical risk. Therefore, the AeroVironment company continues to develop existing UAVs and create new models based on them. During these processes, innovative solutions and technologies are developed and implemented, aimed at improving the main characteristics and expanding working capabilities. Another result of such activity was shown in October at the exhibition AUSA 2024 . Now the new UAV P550 must go through all the necessary tests and confirm the declared potential. And even after that, future customers have to decide whether they need such a smart and versatile new drone. Reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicle P550.

- Adrenaline is going through the roof. Class!-: paintball training was included in the combat train...	According to the plan of the institute's management, the training was supposed to stimulate team actions of cadets in combat groups during search and sweep in an urbanized area. Practical training is based on the scenarios of real combat experience of teachers. Reconciliation, cohesion, mutual support and mutual assistance are the main priorities in the training of future officers. -Alone in the field is not a warrior! Only the team wins. This should be the philosophy of the signalman's victory,- says the deputy head of the institute for psychological support of personnel, Colonel Oleg Petrovskyi. He is convinced that only practical work on training grounds can form a new quality of servicemen, give them the necessary skills to handle weapons in extreme combat conditions. Almost an hour of grueling confrontation between yellow and blue: conventional opponents, but with real physical and psycho-emotional stress. In addition to the tasks of destroying a hypothetical enemy, the cadets practiced the basics of first aid in the area under fire in the scope of self and mutual aid. -For the first few minutes, I couldn't calm myself down, then I was panting, I remembered what was taught at the institute during combat and psychological training, and - I rushed! - says one of the cadets. The guys willingly share their thoughts: -And even though you understand the conventionality of the fight, the adrenaline still goes through the roof. Class!- Military psychologists call this method operational stress sensitization. It is the best practical method of entering the military profession and forming combat readiness. Practicing tactical actions by cadets in the conditions of intense training combat also ensures the development of critically needed marksmanship skills. Paintball training has already been included in the combat training program of the institute and consistently arouses great interest among cadets.

Firing live rounds is the final element of the entire training course of basic general military training. By this time, the soldiers have been regularly dealing with weapons for several weeks and have fired at least 700−800, and some even 1000−1200 blank cartridges during training exercises. While we fire blanks during tactical exercises, practice changing magazines, and cleaning our assault rifles, the instructors keep a close eye on how we treat weapons and follow safety rules. Even though the grades are not reported to us, it is clear from the comments themselves that the instructors grade us quite meticulously. It is noticeable that they observe and record all our actions, discuss us among themselves and inform each other about the positive features and problematic points in the training of each cadet. So when it comes to combat shooting, no one causes I am surprised that one soldier from the platoon is not allowed to join them. Systematic indiscipline and inattention to weapons take their toll - he does not go to the range on any of the following days, during which there is intense firing with live ammunition. of us For some, they also related to the handling of weapons, but everyone tried to correct mistakes and eliminate shortcomings. It seems that he is the only one not only for the entire first platoon, but also for the entire company, because everyone else has well learned the basic rules of behavior with weapons. Some may be less skilled or accurate than others, but they certainly won't pose a danger through carelessness or sloppiness. Safety rules at British shooting ranges are quite strict and foreign instructors strictly enforce them. At the same time, the control is triple. We are watched by the British, as representatives of the host country, the instructors of the country that conduct the training, as well as the Ukrainian instructors and the platoon leader. Every time we receive a full briefing from the responsible instructor, we are in the waiting area in full protective equipment , and stores equipped with cartridges are obtained only when entering the firing line. We set up a store, load and open fire only under individual commands of instructors. Extreme responsibility and vigilance will eventually give the desired result - during the entire time of combat firing, not a single problematic, but even unfortunate incident will happen. And this is despite the fact that we shoot a lot, especially when we move from -stationary- shooting to simulated combat. During the entire time of firing live cartridges, each of us shoots at least 500−600 bullets. Those who showed increased activity easily increase this indicator to 750−800 cartridges or even double to 1000. Starting to count shots from the first day, I am already losing count on the second day. And in the last three training days, I generally shoot more than 200, 250, and 300 rounds during exercises, respectively. I will not be surprised if some of the cadets have even higher scores. — asks the instructor in the evening of the penultimate day. -Can you still shoot? Then shoot,- I answer. -Great, but this is already the last store, it has 20 cartridges,- he says and hands me the rest of today's ammunition. In 15 minutes I will regret my decision, because I will be forced to catch up with my brothers, who have already started disassembling and cleaning weapons But not now - another rehearsal of fire contact with a hypothetical enemy is ahead while patrolling the territory. Despite the fact that by the end of the evening I had already managed to get exhausted, this time everything works out as best as possible - it is difficult to do something for the tenth time and not correct the mistakes made during the first few attempts. This is one of the exercises during the execution which we shoot or the most bullets, moving between trees and changing position. More interesting and more difficult than it is only work in pairs or fours, when we alternately cover each other, firing at a hypothetical enemy at the time when the partner changes position. It is easier to practice this exercise on the training ground, however, after all, we are given the same task in the forest, where it is impossible to move in a straight line and maintain eye contact between all fighters. Forced to run between trees, we inevitably break the interval and straight line set from the beginning, and also lose sight of the other members of the group. It remains to be guided by voice commands. -Hide, hide!- — I hear from somewhere to the left. -I'm running!- - I shout back with all my might and make a dash for 20 meters forward to a rhizome that is convenient as a cover. Shots are heard on the left, but in a few seconds I, having fallen under a tree trunk, shoot and shout: -Hide, hide!- Constantly maintaining communication between fighters and duplicating commands is one of the most important requirements of instructors, and completion of training in our -small infantry groups-, we already do it without thinking. -Drone!-, -arta!-, -grenade!- - the one who first reacted to the danger shouts the loudest. Others pick up and repeat the shout, confirming that they have heard and understood the warning and passing it on. This skill will be most needed on the last day of training, when we simulate a defensive battle and must maintain contact with our nearest neighbors in the chances and between two adjacent chances. Then you have to shout very loudly, especially to the commanders of the units who have to coordinate the actions of the fighters. The simulation of mortar -arrivals-, especially when the charges explode very close, is quite convincing, and the crackle of live rounds is as loud as in real combat. It is difficult to shout over the roar of explosions and the numerous sounds of gunfire, but it is necessary , because the completion of the task and the survival of the unit depend on it. We give our all, and we do it also because we know that today is the final day of training. It was on that day that each of us managed to shoot the most rounds in one training day - sometimes by chance and along with with them, the casings lay in several layers and crunched under the berets. The number of rounds fired is the best evidence that training firings are combat rounds during BZVP at Interflex in Great Britain are extremely tense and intense. Only two circumstances can stop them. The first is a problem with one of the fighters or his weapon. Then, loudly repeated three times by the instructor or any of the participants, the command -Stop, stop, stop!- must immediately stop the shooting. This never happened during the training of our platoon. On the other hand, the second circumstance occurred several times and made us wait for several tens of minutes until the problem was solved. It concerned local residents — sheep and rams, whose herds grazed near the shooting site and occasionally wandered into the zone of possible damage. As soon as the observers noticed that the rams again approached the dangerous zone for them, the command was immediately sounded. stop shooting Soon, a specially trained dog was brought on a pickup truck, which flew out of the car window in a flash and rushed towards the violators, driving them to a safe place. From several minutes to half an hour passed, and the four-legged commander of the rams returned, jumped into the pickup truck and with the look of a winner left to return in the event of the next security breach. We, having received an unexpected break thanks to the rams, resumed shooting.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/barany-na-bojovyh-strilbah-zavazhayut-najbilshe-pro-osoblyvosti-bzvp-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-11-22T20:31:01-08:00
Today, Ukraine commemorates the victims of the Holodomor	In 1932–1933, the communist totalitarian regime committed the crime of genocide against the Ukrainian people. Today, the Rashists, as the heirs of that regime, are once again committing crimes against humanity and genocidal acts on Ukrainian soil. This year, for the third time, we honor the victims of the communist genocide in the context of the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The tragic events that we are going through testify that living memory is extremely important. Those who commit crimes against humanity must be condemned by the world community and the victims must be honored. Then, as now, the enemy's goal was to destroy the Ukrainian people as a national group. The communist totalitarian regime, due to the forcible withdrawal of food, the blockade of villages and entire districts, the ban on travel outside the borders of famine-stricken Ukraine, the curtailment of rural trade, and repression against dissenters created conditions for Ukrainians incompatible with life. The Holodomor became possible because, during the Liberation Struggle, Ukrainians could not withstand the large-scale invasion of Russian troops and establish the democratic Ukrainian People's Republic, proclaimed in 1917 in Kyiv. the Russian Bolsheviks seized the territory of the Ukrainian People's Republic by direct occupation and proclaimed the creation of their own quasi-state of the USSR with the center in Kharkiv. In the USSR, which included the territory of the Ukrainian state captured by the Bolsheviks, a totalitarian communist regime with a strict social hierarchy was established. Any expression of dissent was immediately brutally punished and suppressed. Because of this, almost the entire Ukrainian nation, which had a huge cultural and historical heritage, its own glorious traditions of state-building, and the experience of the national liberation struggle, immediately found itself -outlawed.- The occupation of Ukraine led to numerous crimes, mass repressions, terror, deportations. But the primary goal was the destruction of Ukrainians as a political nation that could raise the question of creating an independent state. To achieve this goal, the horrible tool chosen was starvation. The mechanism of forcible procurement of bread, which led to the Holodomor, was set in motion from Moscow. In less than a calendar year (1932–1933), millions of people died in Ukraine. Mortality exceeded the average level by 8-9 or more times, especially many children died. To this day, the terrible circumstances of the crime and the deliberate ban on keeping death statistics make it impossible to establish the exact number of dead. The Holodomor led to moral and psychological changes in the nation's consciousness. The consequence of the crime of genocide was the destruction of the traditional Ukrainian way of life. The year 1933 was a time of national catastrophe for Ukraine, the consequences of which are felt to this day. Today, the Russians are once again using genocidal methods against Ukrainians to destroy our identity, culture, and language. Therefore, the modern Russian-Ukrainian war is aimed not only at destroying the independence of the Ukrainian state, but also at destroying Ukrainians as an independent people, as a nation. Putin in the 21st century, like Stalin in the 20th, resorted to genocide because other methods of subjugating the Ukrainian people did not work. Stalin organized a total confiscation of food, a blockade, mass terror. Putin used a full-scale military invasion with atrocities, violations of international laws and customs of war. Terror, mass murders, deliberate attacks on shelters, evacuation routes and humanitarian corridors, bombing of residential areas, sexual violence, military sieges, deportations (forcible displacement of Ukrainians, in particular children) became the components of the genocidal policy of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. During the Holodomor, the leadership of the USSR deliberately disoriented the world public, made special statements about the absence of hunger in the country. The regime refused foreign aid, and the totalitarian Moscow government sold seized bread to other countries for foreign currency, which was used to purchase machine tools and other equipment for industrial enterprises. Today, the democratic world is well aware of what is happening in Ukraine and supports us. The security and defense forces of Ukraine are heroically resisting the enemy. And each of us, remembering the crimes of the Moscow totalitarian regime in the 20th century, directs all our efforts to support our defenders. In the conditions of ongoing Russian aggression, our memory of the Holodomor of 1932-1933 is a factor in the social mobilization of Ukrainians and the world community to oppose the aggressor. So let's remember in the National Minute of Silence on November 23 at 4:00 p.m. the millions of human lives that Ukraine lost due to the Holodomor and massive artificial famines organized on orders from Moscow. Let's visit the places of memory of the Holodomor victims in our locality, and with the onset of darkness, let's light candles of memory wherever we are. After all, every light is a manifestation of our sorrow, memory and faith in the future inevitable Victory over the aggressor.

Rospropaganda spreads a false video: a photo helped to expose the fake	As -evidence-, a video is shown where a woman, presenting herself as the wife of the deceased, claims that her husband is not on the lists of military personnel. For specialists StopFake was able to identify the person in the photo and find out the circumstances that contradict the information provided in the video. In the fake video, which is a hostile production, the woman says that she cannot receive the benefits promised by the state. According to her, she allegedly -called the headquarters-, where she was told that the man -is not on the lists-. At the same time, she does not mention her name, her husband's name, or the headquarters to which she addressed. The photograph that the woman in the video was holding helped to expose this fake. It depicts the defender of Azovstal Andriy Kainara, who was captured by the Russians in Mariupol. After a year and a half in captivity, Kainar was exchanged and he returned to serve in the 56th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On the website of the non-governmental organization Polygon 56 Berdyansk, which takes care of the families of missing prisoners and fallen soldiers, a photo of Andrii Kainara, taken on the occasion of his return from captivity, was found. On it, he is depicted with Olena Dobycha, the head of this organization. On September 18, 2024, she announced his death on her personal Facebook page. The photo featured in the fake video was published by the Ukrainian mass media in a report on the death of Andrii Kainara near Bakhmut in September 2024. StopFake contacted Olena Dobycha to view the video being circulated and to comment on the -delisting- situation. According to her, this video is an -absolute fake-, primarily because Kainara did not have a wife, but only a sister. The obvious goal of this and similar fakes is to undermine the trust of Ukrainian citizens in state institutions, in particular in the Armed Forces and authorities. Propaganda seeks to create the impression that the state allegedly does not fulfill its obligations to the families of fallen soldiers, which can sow despair and demoralization among the population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/rospropaganda-poshyryuye-nepravdyve-video-vykryty-fejk-dopomogla-fotografiya/	2024-11-22T20:01:27-08:00

Since the morning, the workers of utility companies and energy services have been putting things in order at the site of the impact. — Now we are helping people to sew up broken windows, doors, and all establishments where it is possible. We work, restore, clean - so that you can walk, drive. We take out garbage, help people with materials, give out repair kits, Serhiy Gorbunov said. There are noticeably more people in brightly colored reflective vests than passers-by and high-rise residents trying to find out where to get help. - Previously, they drove directly to the site, but after repeated shelling, when my employees were injured, now there are separate delivery points. People know everything, they have been notified, Serhiy Gorbunov explains. Such security measures are fully justified, because earlier in many settlements near the line of combat, the Russian occupiers repeatedly resorted to insidious tactics of repeated strikes. The military armies of the Russian Federation attacked the emergency rescue services, medics, energy workers and utility workers when they arrived at the site of the preliminary shelling to provide aid to the victims and eliminate the consequences of the shelling. At the site of the previous shelling, which On November 20, utility workers are also working, dismantling debris and removing construction debris. Here, as a result of the Russian strike, six people were injured, and 10 multi-story buildings were damaged. Local residents are trying to reach half-destroyed homes, where it is safe to do so, hoping to save the remains of destroyed property. A few dogs try to flatter anyone who pays attention to them. They used to live together with other people in these destroyed houses, and now, together with their owners, they became homeless as a result of another Russian shelling.

According to Dmytro Pelikh, the attacks of the occupiers are as incomprehensible as possible.

The Military Law and Order Service talked about three options for returning to service after the SZH	About this in an interview with ArmiyaInform, the deputy chief of the Main Department of the Military Law and Order Service, Colonel Oleksandr Grynchuk, said. The first option concerns servicemen, about whom information has already been entered in the Unified Register of Pretrial Investigations. In such a case, the serviceman can independently, at the stage of the pre-trial investigation, apply in writing to the investigator, the prosecutor, directly to the court or come to the nearest administrative body of the VSP. But there are still certain conditions. In particular, this applies to servicemen who have committed FGM for the first time. There must also be a written consent of the commander of the military unit to continue his military service. The second most common return option. It applies to servicemen who have committed a felony, the duration of which did not exceed three days. That is, before the acquisition of signs of a criminal offense. In this case, this serviceman can independently return to the military unit to continue his service. The commander has to find out the circumstances why the serviceman committed the SZH. And then disciplinary responsibility is applied to him. The third option is when a serviceman who has committed a criminal offense wants to return to service, and at the same time, the information about the offense is not entered in the EDPR. That is, 3 days have already passed, according to the disciplinary statute, the commander of the military unit has appointed an official investigation, which can last a month, but there are also different situations. If the official investigation has not been completed or the investigator has sent the materials for revision, and the information has not yet been entered into the ERDR, such a serviceman with the participation of the VSP is delivered to the reserve battalions that are part of the Armed Forces. There is an algorithm approved by the Commander-in-Chief, and in reserve battalions such a serviceman is transferred to military units and units of the Armed Forces. Depending on the situation, a decision is made to return him to service: either to the place where he served, or to another place. Read more in our material: How to return from the SZH correctly: about search, reserve battalions and transfer to another part ArmyInform reminds that you can join the army either directly at >recruiting centers, as well as use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/u-vijskovij-sluzhbi-pravoporyadku-rozpovily-pro-try-varianty-povernennya-na-sluzhbu-pislya-szch/	2024-11-22T01:47:07-08:00

In addition, in terms of the number of applications for the production of interceptor drones, Ukrainian UAV manufacturers became the first - submitting 32% of the total number. In advanced FPV drones, our companies were second with a result of 26% of submitted proposals. Kateryna Chernogorenko emphasized that such a number of proposals from our companies proves that we are achieving the goal of scaling drone production in Ukraine. -It is already helping to create an asymmetric advantage in technology over the enemy. Especially in the context of interceptor drones, as our companies have the best expertise in the manufacture and application of such technologies. We want to push the world industry so that such drones go into mass production,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. Applications for the production of advanced FPV drones ended in October. The call for proposals for the interceptor drones ended on November 11. Companies that win the tenders will receive orders for drones that will be tested and evaluated. If their designs show good results at this stage, larger orders for FPV drones from the winning manufacturers are planned. The agency recalled that the Drone Coalition was created in February 2024 during the 19th Ramstein-style meeting. The initiative was proposed by Latvia and is jointly coordinated with Great Britain. Currently, the Drone Coalition includes 16 partner countries. Ukraine has already received thousands of drones as part of the initiative. It is expected that another 20,000 to 30,000 drones will be purchased and delivered on top of the joint procurement funds already accumulated by the Coalition (€71 million).

Notarial isolation: documents in the occupied Luhansk region became unreachable	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In Severodonetsk, the occupation authorities limited the possibility of applying to notaries. Previously, services were provided by a notary from Lysychansk, who came once or twice a week. However, after the prohibition of the so-called -extraterritorial principle- of service, citizens from Severodonetsk are prohibited from using the services of notaries in other cities of the -LNR-. Currently, one notary has been appointed in the city, but the documents pending in other settlements have not yet been handed over. The queue for a notary is scheduled until the spring of 2025, which creates significant difficulties for the population, forcing them to wait for months. In Starobilsk there is an increase in control over the school process. Teachers, cooperating with the occupying power structures, conduct informal surveys among the parents of students, finding out their attitude to the teaching of the Ukrainian language. Despite this, the return of the Ukrainian language to the school curriculum in the occupied territories is not foreseen. Such actions are aimed at identifying residents who are -disloyal- to the Russian authorities. According to Artem Lysohor, these cases are another example of oppression of the local population in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region. As reported by ArmyInform, to the temporarily occupied territories of the Luhansk region /->funds for the implementation of the housing restoration program have arrived. However, in three years, from 2024 to 2026, only the roofs and foundations of about 200 apartment buildings are planned to be restored.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/notarialna-izolyacziya-dokumenty-na-okupovanij-luganshhyni-staly-nedosyazhnymy/	2024-11-21T23:23:46-08:00

Ukrainian scouts have mastered the art of controlling combat boats	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -School of skippers- is part of the -Steel Front- military initiative, founded by the -Metinvest- company. Within the framework of the first set of training, 30 military personnel, in particular scouts of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense, were trained. The course program included 30 hours of theoretical classes and more than 50 hours of practice. The cadets mastered the skills of radio communication, navigation, maneuvering in difficult conditions, countering drones, evacuating the wounded and towing ships. About 10 hours each participant spent at the helm of the boat as the main skipper-captain. Training was conducted under the leadership of foreign instructors, and the program was adapted to the needs of the Ukrainian military. -This course made it possible to train qualified skippers capable of performing difficult tasks in the Black Sea in a short time. We hope for further development of this initiative,- noted one of the course graduates. Metinvest has already invested 200 million hryvnias in the development of the maritime program, which includes the training of skippers, the purchase of speedboats and ships. In October 2024, the special forces of the GUR of the MoD received the Swedish-made Combat Boat-90 armored amphibious assault ships from the -Steel Front-. The representative of -Steel Front- Oleksandr Vodoviz emphasized that the initiative received positive feedback, and work on the program will be continued to strengthen Ukraine's maritime security. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministers of Defense of Ukraine and Finland discussed the training of servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/ukrayinski-rozvidnyky-opanuvaly-mystecztvo-keruvannya-bojovymy-kateramy/	2024-11-21T22:52:46-08:00

What will be the result of lowering the age and enlisting women in the army: the historian spoke abo...	Should we be afraid of mobilization measures? What will reducing the mobilization age, conscription of women, or the introduction of other mechanisms operating in the world bring to Ukraine? A military historian, head of the Center for Military History, Vasyl Pavlov, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent about this: -If we talk about mobilization, we will not find any other recipes for effective resistance to the aggressor. The only question is that until 2014 Ukrainian society was generally in a certain -lethargic- state, no one was preparing for war. From 2014 to 2021, the Ukrainian authorities, the Ukrainian state, managed to minimize the impact of the war on society, which led to the fact that the war and its feeling ended at the administrative borders of the anti-terrorist operation or the operation of the joint forces, while the rest of the country did not feel it. And when the question of mobilization arose, it became clear that the population was absolutely not ready to participate in the war. I don't know how to rate it. Is it very bad or not. We are very fond of saying, -I was not born for war.- Indeed, no one is born for war, no one is born for murder. Most likely, people are born to realize higher, more beautiful goals. But life works out the way it does. And if we talk about mobilization, then sooner or later Ukraine will go through all the stages that states that found themselves in a state of total war went through. We are now in a state of total war, that is, it is taking place on the entire territory of our state, regardless of whether there are military actions on the ground, or rocket attacks, or daily night attacks by Shaheds, or whether there is a threat of actions by subversive and intelligence groups. That is, we now have a situation where the entire population of the state is in one way or another related to the war. But a certain part of the population does not believe that this is their war. And the reason here is that for 30 years, the youth education policy was not carried out properly, the society education policy was not carried out, the state was not preparing for war. We constantly mentioned that it would be good for Ukraine to become Israel, but in the end we became Israel. But then we have to accept all those norms that exist in Israel itself. This is a certain mobilization age, this is the mobilization of women, this is the participation of all strata and strata of the population in the war. Therefore, I hope that just as Ukrainian society has overcome many problems of its growth since 1991, we will also overcome the problem of mobilization. Sooner or later it will all be evened out, because in a state of war, and everyone should understand this, we still have a long, long time to live. And again, here the question will be that the state should take a proactive position in the matter of the formation of a mobilization resource. We very often make fun of Russians that they are trying to do something from kindergarten. But we have to understand a very simple thing: they have been preparing for war for several generations. And the Russians have been openly talking about this since 2015. That they have the mobilization resource to wage war for one to two generations, that is, for 25 to 50 years. In other words, the Russians completely deliberately moved to a war of attrition, to a long-term war. In the same way, we need to prepare for this: prepare society physically, technologically and mentally.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/shho-dast-zmenshennya-viku-ta-pryzov-zhinok-u-vijsko-istoryk-rozpoviv-pro-svitovyj-dosvid-mobilizacziyi/	2024-11-21T20:57:07-08:00
How to return from the SZCH correctly: about the search, reserve battalions and transfer to another ...	— Not so long ago, changes were made to the Criminal Code of Ukraine in relation to SZH. From now on, there is an opportunity for military personnel to return to service, avoiding criminal punishment. So, what is the legal way to return from the SZH now? - Currently, there are several options for returning to military service. Everything depends on the categories of servicemen. There are three in total. If we talk about changes in the Criminal Code, then this applies to military personnel, about whom information has already been entered into the Unified Register of Pretrial Investigations. In such a case, a military serviceman can independently, at the stage of the pre-trial investigation, submit a written request to the investigator, the prosecutor, directly to the court or come to the nearest administrative body of the VSP. If, at this stage, criminal proceedings are ongoing against such a serviceman and his military service is suspended, the prosecutor may submit a motion to the court to release him from criminal responsibility to continue his service. But there are still certain conditions. In particular, this applies to servicemen who have committed FGM for the first time. There must also be written consent of the commander of the military unit for his continuation of military service. Accordingly, the court may decide to close the criminal proceedings and release the serviceman from criminal liability. In this case, the serviceman is given three days to arrive at the military unit or at the place of service, and already the unit is obliged to reinstate this serviceman in the service. At the same time, it should be noted that there may be certain circumstances that will not allow a serviceman to return to the military unit where he served, for example, the commander's refusal to give consent. In this case, he can return to service in another military unit. The list of these parts is determined by the General Staff of the Armed Forces. There is a different category of servicemen, and a correspondingly different return option. It is usually the most common. Up to 45% of the cases when servicemen committed a SZH, the duration of which did not exceed three days. That is, before acquiring signs of a criminal offense. In this case, this serviceman can independently return to the military unit to continue his service. Of course, the commander has to find out the circumstances why the serviceman committed the SZH. And then disciplinary responsibility is applied to him. And there is a third category. This is when a serviceman who has committed a criminal offense wants to return to service, and at the same time, the information about the offense is not entered into the ERDR. That is, 3 days have already passed, according to the disciplinary statute, the commander of the military unit has appointed an official investigation, which can last a month, but there are also different situations. Perhaps the serviceman fell ill or was insulted by someone in the service, or there were certain family circumstances, and he was not heard and was not given leave. entered in the EDPR, such a serviceman with the participation of the VSP is delivered to the reserve battalions, which is in the Armed Forces. There is an algorithm approved by the Commander-in-Chief, and in reserve battalions such a serviceman is transferred to military units and units of the Armed Forces. Depending on the situation, a decision is made to return him to service: either to the place where he served, or to another place. For example, there are task forces, let's say -buyers-, who carry out the recruitment of military personnel. — Tell us more about these reserve battalions. What is their function? - Every operational command has reserve battalions. And now the initiative to increase the staff and the number of these battalions has started. This was done in order to go to a meeting and receive servicemen who decided to return to service. True, there are also certain nuances here. First of all, we are talking about the return to the units identified as a priority for completion. It is intended that the soldier return to the combat unit, and not just to the rear. It is important not to legalize the process of transferring servicemen through the SZH. But, of course, each case must be considered separately. If a serviceman is medically unfit to serve in combat units, then other options are considered. Someone can't be an attack fighter, but can be, for example, a UAV operator, a signalman, or an IT person. That is, efforts are focused on what is most needed now and on human capabilities. — Let's take a closer look at the issue of returning to service in another unit. And how does it work in practice? Is only the consent of the commander of the unit where the serviceman wants to serve sufficient? -According to Article 401 of the Criminal Code, the written consent of the commander of the military unit to which the serviceman wants to return to continue his service is sufficient. Today, this mechanism is implemented in reserve battalions. You can find out more about this in any department of the VSP. But this applies to those servicemen against whom criminal proceedings have been opened and there is information in the EDPR. If we consider the option when the information is not entered in the ERA, then the general norms of departmental regulatory and administrative acts of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine on issues of military service, according to which the consent of the commander of the military unit where the serviceman served, and the commander of the military unit to which the serviceman is transferred. And here, as I have already said, a special action algorithm has been developed. In particular, working groups have been created in the reserve battalions to speed up decision-making. There are also medical workers, and employees of personnel agencies, and psychological support, and Law Enforcement Services. To process documents, in addition to mail, messengers are used so as not to wait for the documents to arrive. In particular, servicemen submit reports, commanders confirm their approvals. This working group then considers the expediency of moving the serviceman, and a relocation plan is developed within a day and submitted to the Commander-in-Chief for review. Transfers may be approved within the Armed Forces. In the case of a positive decision on the transfer of a serviceman, an order is issued for personnel. The personnel center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine sends an electronic notification of the adoption of a personnel decision to the unit where the serviceman is serving and to the unit where the commander agreed to the transfer. Also, within three days, the senior group informs the serviceman about the adopted or unadopted personnel decision. Decisions may not be made, for example, due to health, profession, presence or lack of certain experience. It is possible that the serviceman needs to be sent for additional training or retraining. There may be cases when it needs to be sent to the VLK. There are medical companies in the new staff of reserve battalions. Because this is not only an entry into the Armed Forces, but to some extent also an exit from them. If the serviceman needs additional examination. There are such flagrant socially unjust cases when a person has lost a limb, but for some reason is listed in the SZH. Therefore, we make an appropriate decision and report such situations to the command. —Are there any units that are interested in sending those who went to the SZH to them? Perhaps some brigades have approached you? — Many military units are interested in being equipped, in particular, at the expense of servicemen who have completed SZH and wish to return to service. Therefore, in reserve battalions, conditions have been created for the selection of such servicemen, which is carried out by representatives of military units. They come there, study personal files, documents, and in accordance with this, the units carry out selection. Someone is looking for certain specialists, for example: signalmen, REB officers, engineers, sappers or drivers, because there is a shortage of them. The interest is there, and so is the action algorithm. That is, something like recruiting is conducted. Only in this case, not the civilian population, but active servicemen. And it is even better, because the military serviceman is already trained, was in the formation, performed tasks. — Has the number of those who voluntarily return to the army increased due to the introduction of changes to the law? —The rate of servicemen who voluntarily return to military units and show willingness to serve, increased, and a positive trend is observed in the future. Other measures also contribute to this. For example, the Commander-in-Chief decided on a large-scale search. When we'll peak, I can't say. But we predict that growth will continue. Courts consider the petitions of military personnel. The return algorithm works. Working offices have been created in the battalions. In fact, we are now going down the path of selecting a category of parolees who have volunteered to serve. They made study rooms. Online court sessions were held, decisions were made, decisions were sent to the battalions. There are also additional places for working groups of pre-trial investigation bodies and procedural heads from the prosecutor's office. These meetings are scheduled daily. There was also a decision of the Supreme Court, which appointed certain judges to hear these very cases in order to speed up the processes of returning servicemen to service. Next, we will look at the dynamics. — You said a large-scale search. How is the search for those who have committed FIR or desertion generally carried out? -The search is carried out in cooperation with many authorities. We work with the SBU, the National Police, the TCC and SP, the SBU, the Border Service. The case is being investigated, and a search is being made for all possible locations or hiding places of servicemen. For example, by the place of residence of parents, family, close relatives, loved one; by the place of recruitment or work. In addition, data are transferred to general registers that are relevant to the search. Operational information exchange is carried out. Our search system is constantly being improved. An interaction manual has been developed, where the processes are defined by the direction of work. According to the result of the search, servicemen are delivered either to the reserve battalions, if the information is not entered in the EDPR, or to the nearest pre-trial investigation body. You should not think that no one is looking for anyone. There are already many examples when servicemen received real sentences. But we also understand and emphasize that there is no single main problem of the implementation of the SDF or the desertion of servicemen. Each case should be considered only individually and the circumstances of the offense should be studied. In individual cases, appoint additional investigations and inspections. In particular, regarding the activity or inaction of the officials of the management structure, which forces the serviceman to commit the specified offenses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/yak-povernutys-iz-szch-pravylno-pro-rozshuk-bataljony-rezervu-ta-perevedennya-v-inshu-chastynu/	2024-11-21T20:48:12-08:00
Autonomous anti-ship symbiosis: the US announced the transfer of unmanned ground vehicles to the KMP...	As stated in to the official release posted on the Oshkosh Defense portal, ROGUE-Fires (Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires fire action-) is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that uses the extreme off-road mobility and cargo capacity of the Oshkosh JLTV off-road vehicle, as well as advanced autonomous vehicle technologies to support ground-based anti-ship missile (GBASM) operations, ArmyInform reports. ROGUE-Fires have two modes of operation: tele-controlled and fully autonomous. This allows effective performance of combat missions in conditions of minimal operator intervention. The platform is capable of carrying a wide range of warheads, including the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a modern missile designed to engage sea targets at a distance of up to 185 kilometers. One of the key advantages of ROGUE-Fires is the ability to conduct distributed logistics operations, which makes it not only a weapon platform, but also a versatile machine to support operations in the rear. ROGUE-Fires is also integrated into the NMESIS (Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System), which includes proven remote control technologies and the Naval Strike Missile. One of the key tactics used with NMESIS is the -scoot-and-shoot- method (quick movement after a shot), which allows you to minimize the possibility of receiving hits from the enemy in response. The NSM is a high-precision missile developed by Kongsberg Defense. Its feature is the ability to fly at low altitudes, avoiding radar detection, and hit both stationary and moving targets with maximum accuracy. To create the missile body, composite materials are used to reduce the radar signature. The NSM has a high-explosive high-explosive warhead made of a high-strength titanium alloy, filled with an insensitive explosive with a reduced probability of detonation when the missile is fired. One launcher accommodates 4 missiles, after firing, the NSM can travel a long distance over land, and then go to a target in the sea. This is followed by recognition and selection of an object for destruction, the missile hits the ship in the waterline area and uses a programmable detonator to inflict maximum damage on heavily armored targets. SUV JLTV, about which ArmyInform details told in one of her materials, was developed for the US Army and Marine Corps as a replacement for HMMWV (Hummer) military vehicles. In August 2015, the first contract for the supply of 16,901 vehicles to the armed forces was signed. JLTVs provide better protection than HMMWVs, comparable to the level of heavier and larger MRAP-type armored vehicles. The Gale Banks Engineering 866T diesel engine is capable of accelerating the armored car to a speed of 110 km/h. In total, the Pentagon plans to deploy 14 such batteries. By 2025, the Marine Corps wants to have four NMESIS batteries, which will allow it to achieve initial operational readiness. Full combat readiness is planned for 2030. The appearance of such ground-based unmanned systems as ROGUE-Fires demonstrates the rapid development of technologies of autonomous combat vehicles. This machine not only increases the flexibility and mobility of the troops, but also reduces the risks to the personnel by allowing tasks to be carried out remotely. The ability to adapt the platform for different tasks makes it valuable in the changing nature of modern warfare, where flexibility and speed of reaction play a crucial role.

Telegram channels of the Russian Federation spread a fake about the supply of dozens of mobile morgu...	The disinformation post is accompanied by a photo showing mobile containers with what appears to be the English inscription -Mobile Morgue-. As reports the Countering Disinformation Center, in fact this is another fake of Russian propaganda, and mobile containers, about in question are mobile boiler houses that the Ukrainian Red Cross, in cooperation with Coca-Cola, delivers to local communities to support the population of Ukraine. The theme of -use of crematoriums in the Armed Forces- is strongly supported throughout the full-scale invasion.

Buntar-1 operates at a range of 80 km, so it was difficult to test it on the test site. With this request, the developers turned to Brave1. The cluster helped with test flights and introduced the company to the defense tech community. After that, the drone was successfully used on the battlefield.
