Freed Palestinian prisoners wear Star of David shirts	Israel Prisons Service changes release attire of freed Palestinian prisoners including Jewish symbols and Arabic phrase in warning The Israel Prison Service (IPS) changed the release attire of Palestinian prisoners freed in Saturday's hostage-prisoner exchange, dressing them in tracksuits emblazoned with a Star of David, the IPS logo, and the phrase 'We will not forget, we will not forgive', Israeli officials said. In previous prisoner releases, Palestinian inmates were given bracelets with the IPS logo and shown videos of destruction in Gaza before their departure. As in previous exchanges, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli prisons in exchange for the return of hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Iair Horn and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov. Palestinian media broadcast footage of celebrations in the West Bank’s Ramallah following the release of prisoners. This handover included the lowest number of West Bank prisoners released so far — with only 10.

Sagui, Sasha and Iair reunite with families in Israel	After 498 days in Hamas captivity, Sagui meets his wife and learns his newborn daughter’s name, while Sasha informed of his father’s death in October 7 attack; hostages taken to hospitals for medical evaluation Sagui Dekel-Chen, Iair Horn and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov arrived in Israel on Saturday after 498 days in Hamas captivity, with the IDF confirming they were transferred to hospitals for medical evaluation following their release as part of the hostage-prisoner exchange. The three men, kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 attack, were first brought to a military reception center in Re’im, near the Gaza border, where they underwent initial health assessments before being airlifted to Sheba and Sourasky hospitals. 'IDF personnel from the Medical Corps and Manpower Directorate are accompanying the freed hostages, providing medical evaluations and support,' the IDF said in a statement. Military representatives also remained in close contact with their families, who were waiting for updates at the hospitals. Horn’s family, overjoyed but still anxious, said they could 'finally breathe' after more than a year of uncertainty. 'Iair is home after surviving hell in Gaza. Now, we need to bring back Eitan, so our family can truly breathe again,' they said, referring to his younger brother who remains in Hamas captivity. As he arrived in Israel, Horn, a devoted fan of the Hapoel Be’er Sheva soccer team, was gifted a team jersey and requested to fly over the club's Turner Stadium in the southern city. Meanwhile, Dekel-Chen met his wife Avital and parents at the Re’im reception center for the first time since his abduction, learning that he had become a father for the third time during his captivity. His daughter, Shahar, was born four months after he was kidnapped, and he had never met her. Avital revealed their daughter’s name to him, explaining that she had followed through with a name he had chosen before his kidnapping. 'Do you remember what you wanted to name her? That’s her name—Shahar Mazal,' Avital told him. 'Perfect. What a name,' Dekel-Chen responded, moved by the moment. On his way to the hospital, Dekel-Chen sent a heartfelt message to his daughters: 'Bari, Gali, Shahar—thank you for watching over me. Dad is on his way.' His wife Avital, overwhelmed with relief, expressed gratitude to everyone who supported her throughout the ordeal. 'I have been waiting so long for Sagui, and I am so proud of him for holding on through this nightmare,' she told Israeli media. 'We are about to begin a new chapter together.' She recalled how one of their daughters had told her with confidence: 'I told you Dad would come home.' For Trupanov, the joy of freedom was shadowed by devastating news. On his way back to Israel, he was informed that his father, Vitaliy Trupanov, had been murdered by Hamas during the October 7 attack. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trupanov’s family, anxiously awaiting his return, had no idea whether he knew about his father’s fate before crossing into Israel. 'This revelation will turn what should be a day of joy into a day of deep mourning,' they said. 'On October 7, Sasha was violently kidnapped from his home and shot in both legs,' his family said in a statement. 'Seeing him today gives us immense strength and hope for his long road to recovery. This is a moment of immense relief for us, his friends, and everyone who never stopped hoping and praying for his return.' Defense Minister Israel Katz welcomed the freed hostages back, vowing to continue efforts to secure the release of all captives still held in Gaza. 'Iair, Sasha, Sagui—welcome home. The entire nation embraces you and celebrates your reunion with your families,' Katz said. 'The IDF remains fully deployed and prepared for any scenario, ensuring Hamas cannot violate the deal or obstruct future hostage releases.' He also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for his firm support of Israel, saying: 'We will continue working with him to ensure that all hostages return home as soon as possible, and that the Palestinian terror threat is crushed and eradicated from Gaza.' So far, 19 hostages have been freed as part of the latest exchange, while 14 more remain on the list for the first phase of the agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywrogrkjg	2025-02-15T02:52:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/ryJdigAtye/ryJdigAtye_0_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

Attempted to violate agreement': Netanyahu's office slams Hamas ...	Following the release of Alexnader Trupanov, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn, Prime Minister's Office condemns terrorist group's attempts to derail deal Following the release of hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, 'Hamas once again attempted to violate the agreement and create a false crisis. Thanks to our forces inside and around Gaza and U.S. President Donald Trump’s clear and unequivocal statement, Hamas backed down and the hostage release continued.' The statement stressed full coordination with the U.S. to secure the return of all hostages, both living and deceased, 'as quickly as possible' and added, 'We welcome them with open arms. We have prepared for their return and, together with their families, will support their rehabilitation after their long and harrowing captivity.' 'Israel has yet to open negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire agreement. We seek to implement the deal in full,' Hamas politburo member Basem Naim said. Netanyahu has remained vague regarding Israel’s stance on the deal, which includes the release of 369 Palestinian prisoners. Pressure from his far-right coalition partners led his office to issue contradictory and unclear statements throughout the week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Friday, the Prime Minister’s Office was forced to correct a statement regarding Israel’s acceptance of the list of hostages slated for release, changing 'accepted by Israel' to 'received by Israel' 20 minutes later, clarifying that it was 'a factual description, not a policy statement.' President Isaac Herzog also addressed the release, condemning Hamas’s 'cruel spectacle' and calling for the deal’s completion: 'Sagui has yet to meet his daughter, born after his abduction; Sasha's father was murdered, and his mother, grandmother and partner were kidnapped and later released; Yair returns while his brother Eitan remains captive. These are not horror movie scripts — this is the reality of innocent civilians abducted by terrorists and freed today after 498 days in the depths of hell. 'Sagui, Sasha, Yair — we waited so long for you! After the cynical and repulsive show you were forced to endure, we are relieved that you are on your way to reunite with your families. Completing the hostage deal is a moral, humane and Jewish imperative. We will continue doing everything in our power to bring home all our brothers and sisters still held in Gaza — until the last one is returned.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjn9wyryjg	2025-02-15T01:25:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/H1FPqcwF1e/H1FPqcwF1e_0_90_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Abbas slams ‘delusional’ Trump over Gaza displacement plan	Palestinian Authority chairman calls Trump plan 'attempt to erase the Palestinian cause,' warns of Israeli 'war crimes' and accuses settler groups of undermining the two-state solution Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday rejected any attempt to impose a new U.S.-backed peace proposal, warning that efforts to forcibly remove Palestinians from their land were 'delusional.' 'Anyone who believes they can impose a new 'Deal of the Century,' displace our people and seize every inch of our land is delusional,' Abbas said in a speech at the African Union Summit in Ethiopia. His remarks were seen as a direct rebuke of U.S. President Donald Trump, who in his previous term attempted to advance a peace plan involving territorial swaps and Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The comments also follow Trump’s recent statements about his intent to relocate Gaza’s population, a move Abbas claimed was designed to erase the Palestinian cause and divert global attention from what he described as 'war crimes, genocide, settlement expansion, land theft and attacks on holy sites in the West Bank and Jerusalem.' Abbas accused Israel and settler groups of systematically undermining the two-state solution, saying, 'These actions are carried out by the occupation forces and settler terrorist gangs, with the aim of dismantling the Palestinian Authority and burying the two-state solution.' Abbas’ remarks come just days after he issued a presidential decree repealing Palestinian laws that had authorized payments to families of prisoners held in Israeli jails and to relatives of terrorists killed in attacks. The move was viewed as a signal to Washington, but it quickly drew condemnation from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who accused the PA of capitulating to U.S. and Israeli pressure. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjpdy1cf1x	2025-02-15T01:22:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2017/09/20/8048675/8048675_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Russian news agency notes terror group is mulling Herkin's release in the deal's first phase but doesn't provide details; Hamas official tells Moscow release hangs on deal's second phase Hamas said it would 'consider' Russia's request to release hostage Maxim Herkin, whose daughter and mother hold Russian citizenship, Russian news agency TASS reported Friday. No further details were provided. Earlier this month, senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk visited Moscow and said Herkin's release would be decided in the negotiations of the deal’s second phase with Israel. He added Hamas was willing to prioritize him, after previously promising that Sasha Trupanov would be freed soon. A week earlier, Israeli Ambassador to Moscow Simona Halperin revealed that Israel and Russia were working together to secure the release of three hostages held in Gaza who are not included in the first phase of the deal and do not hold Russian citizenship. In an interview with Russian news outlet RBC, she identified one of them as 36-year-old Maxim Herkin, originally from Donbas and living in Tirat Carmel. While he is not a Russian citizen, his daughter was born and resides in Russia and his mother received Russian citizenship after his abduction. The names of the other two hostages were not disclosed.

In June, reports said that 'Hamas leadership promised Russia it would release two Russian citizens still held in Gaza, but this requires a cease-fire' to allow their transfer to the Red Cross. 'As early as March, we actively raised these issues with Hamas to release Russian citizens without an agreement,' Bogdanov said. Activist Alex Tenzer suggested Hamas might make a 'gesture' toward Russia and release 34 hostages in the deal’s first phase, including Herkin, adding that failing to release the two Russian citizens would be a slap in the face to Moscow. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjzn4pafke	2025-02-14T23:02:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/17/B1vix112116/B1vix112116_1_34_400_225_0_small.jpg

Hamas terrorists arrived at the hostage release site in Khan Younis on Saturday morning wearing stolen IDF uniforms and military vests, while carrying Israeli weapons seized during the October 7 attack, according to footage in Arab media. The three Israeli hostages—Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov—were reportedly transported to the release point in a vehicle also stolen by Hamas during the October 7 massacre. The highly choreographed handover is part of a wider propaganda display by Hamas, aimed at reinforcing its psychological warfare tactics against Israel. This release marks the sixth phase of the ongoing hostage deal, with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad jointly freeing captives for the first time. In exchange, Israel is set to release 369 Palestinian prisoners.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sycqxapfkx	2025-02-14T22:34:41-08:00	
Hamas stages propaganda event as 3 hostages released in Gaza	Terror group to release hostages in propaganda-filled handover in Khan Younis, featuring stolen IDF uniforms, weapons and banners in broken Hebrew; hourglass with Israeli hostage’s image displayed, as Hamas warns Israel to uphold cease-fire deal The sixth round of the hostage release deal is underway, with Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov set to be handed over by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) on Saturday. As in previous exchanges, Hamas used the event for a highly staged propaganda display, reinforcing the brutality of Gaza’s terrorist factions. This marks the first time that both Hamas and PIJ have jointly released hostages. In previous exchanges, PIJ conducted its own separate handovers, including the recent release of Gadi Mozes and Arbel Yehoud, during which the two hostages were placed in serious danger from an angry crowd surrounding them. At the release point in Khan Younis, Hamas erected large banners in broken Hebrew, and the stage was decorated with images of the Al-Aqsa Mosque alongside Hamas propaganda footage showing attacks on Israeli communities on October 7 and clashes with Israeli forces. One sign referenced former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to evacuate Gazans, reading: 'No migration except to Jerusalem.' Adding to the spectacle, Hamas terrorists arrived dressed in stolen IDF uniforms and vests, carrying Israeli weapons, and according to reports, the hostages were transported to the release point in a vehicle stolen during the October 7 attack. As part of its propaganda drive, Hamas placed an hourglass on the stage featuring images of hostage Matan Zangauker and his mother Einav, one of the most prominent advocates for the release of the captives, with the caption: 'Time is running out.' Reports suggest that Hamas intended to hand the hourglass to one of the released hostages to deliver to Zangauker’s family. Additionally, Hamas reportedly gave Sagui Dekel-Chen a 'gift' in reference to the birth of his daughter, Shahar, whom he has never met. Shahar was born four months after Dekel-Chen’s abduction on October 7.

Flags of Arab nations opposing the displacement of Gazans were displayed as a symbolic gesture. A Hamas spokesperson claimed on Saturday that the group was 'waiting for Israel to implement the humanitarian protocol' agreed upon with mediators before proceeding with further releases. 'The release of the hostages in this phase was confirmed only after we received guarantees that Israel would uphold the agreement,' the spokesperson said. He warned that Israel 'has no alternative to releasing all hostages other than implementing all clauses of the cease-fire agreement.' The release is part of an ongoing deal negotiated with international mediators, under which Israel is expected to free 369 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of three Israeli hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkmcrnpk1e	2025-02-14T22:21:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/S1ejsC2aYkl/S1ejsC2aYkl_0_241_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Terrorists with blood on their hands: 36 convicted killers among ...	Israel readies to free 369 prisoners in exchange for release of hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Sasha Trupanov as part of deal As part of the ongoing hostage release deal with Hamas, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are set to be freed from Israeli jails on Saturday in exchange for the release of hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Sasha Trupanov. According to Hamas' Media Office for Prisoners, 369 prisoners will be released — 36 serving life sentences and 333 Gazans who were arrested after October 7. This is the largest batch of Gazan prisoners released in the first phase of the deal so far. One of the prisoners reportedly set for release is Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in the Jabaliya refugee camp. He was arrested in December 2024 on suspicion of working for Hamas during an IDF raid on the facility. Also on the list is Ahmed Barghouti, an aide to terrorist Marwan Barghouti, who was Fatah’s secretary-general in the West Bank. He was arrested on April 15, 2002, and Hamas reportedly demanded his release as part of the deal. Marwan Barghouti orchestrated attacks that killed five Israelis and injured many others. In 2004, he was sentenced to five life terms and an additional 40 years. Israel has denied he will be freed. Another prisoner set for release is Mohammed Shra’iya, a Palestinian Authority intelligence officer from Bethlehem, who shot and murdered Superintendent Moshe Dayan on March 2, 2002, while Dayan was riding a motorcycle in the Judean Desert. Dayan, 46, left behind a wife and three children. Shra’iya, originally from Za’atra, was arrested two months later by the Shin Bet after being wounded in a clash between Israeli forces and wanted terrorists holed up in a Bethlehem church. He later admitted to carrying out the attack, saying he targeted Israeli hikers. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another terrorist expected to be released is Mansour Muqada, who murdered Dr. Mordechai Shafir on February 26, 2001. Shafir, a 56-year-old Kfar Saba resident, was found dead in his orchard, and his death was mistakenly believed to be an accident for over a year and a half. In August 2002, IDF forces arrested Muqada, a resident of Zawiya, who admitted to the murder, saying he set out to kill Jews 'as revenge for Intifada casualties,' referring to the mass uprising of Palestinians against Israel in the early 2000s. He was also linked to other attacks in the West Bank. In February 2003, a Tel Aviv court sentenced him to life with an additional four years. Another terrorist slated for release is Samir Aite, who participated in the murder of Moran Amit in 2002 in Jerusalem. He was part of a seven-man terror cell he had formed. Aite, 19 at the time, worked as a janitor at an East Jerusalem school where other cell members studied. According his the indictment, he founded the terror cell to carry out attacks against Jews. Amit, 25, from Kibbutz Kfar Hanassi, was a law student at the University of Haifa and managed an online singles forum. She was hiking with a friend in the forest when masked terrorists ambushed them. The two fled, but Amit tripped. The terrorists caught her, stabbed her repeatedly and fled. She was rushed to the hospital where she succumbed to her wounds. In January 2003, a Jerusalem court sentenced Aite to life plus 20 years. He was also convicted of prior attempts to carry out attacks in Jerusalem, including a stabbing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byksmnaykx	2025-02-14T21:58:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/18/ByK8c300Pyg/ByK8c300Pyg_0_0_794_443_0_small.jpg
Red Cross en route to collect 3 hostages for release in Khan Youn...	The Red Cross is currently making its way to the designated pickup point in Khan Younis to collect the three Israeli hostages set for release, an Israeli security source said Saturday. According to intelligence received by Israeli authorities, the transfer process is now underway, marking a critical moment in the latest phase of the hostage release deal. The three hostages—Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Yair Horn, 46, and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov, 29—were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 attack and have been held in Gaza for 498 days. The hostages are expected to be handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which will transport them out of Hamas-controlled territory before their return to Israel. This release comes as part of an ongoing agreement, in which Israel is expected to free 369 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of the three captives.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b15kph6tje	2025-02-14T21:43:34-08:00	
Senior UN peacekeeping officer injured as Hezbollah supporters at...	Terror group's supporters attack UNIFIL convoy near Beirut airport amid protests over Lebanon blocking an Iranian flight allegedly carrying cash for Hezbollah; UN and US condemn violence as Lebanon’s army warns of escalating unrest A senior UN peacekeeping officer was injured Friday as Hezbollah supporters attacked a UNIFIL convoy near Beirut’s international airport, in a second consecutive night of violent protests over Lebanon’s decision to block an Iranian flight suspected of carrying funds for the terrorist group. Videos circulating on Arab media show dozens of Hezbollah supporters gathering at the scene, where UN peacekeepers were forced to flee. Protesters also torched one of the UN vehicles, and a child was filmed boasting about stealing equipment from a UN officer. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) confirmed that the injured officer was a Nepalese deputy commander, condemning the attack as a 'blatant violation of international law' that could constitute a war crime. The violence comes amid growing tensions in Lebanon following Israel’s warning against Iranian flights allegedly transferring millions of dollars to Hezbollah. The Iranian Mahan Air flight, scheduled to depart Tehran for Beirut on Thursday, was grounded after the IDF issued a rare public threat against civilian flights suspected of smuggling funds to Hezbollah. According to Israeli intelligence reports, the plane was carrying millions in cash to help Hezbollah recover from losses sustained in the recent war with Israel. On Wednesday, Israeli fighter jets conducted a sonic boom over Beirut, a move seen as a direct warning to Hezbollah operatives. Following the Israeli warning, two separate Mahan Air flights to Beirut were canceled, sparking Hezbollah-backed protests outside Rafic Hariri International Airport in the Lebanese capital. Lebanese security forces dispersed the initial demonstrations on Thursday night, but violence escalated on Friday, targeting both the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL peacekeepers. UN Secretary-General António Guterres issued a strong condemnation, saying: 'I strongly condemn the attack on a UNIFIL convoy near Beirut airport, where several peacekeepers were injured by demonstrators. A UN vehicle was also set on fire. Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable, and those responsible must be held accountable. UN personnel and property must be protected at all times. Attacks against peacekeepers violate international law and may constitute war crimes.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The U.S. State Department also denounced the violence, blaming Hezbollah supporters for the attack on UN forces. 'The United States condemns the violent attack on a UNIFIL convoy in Beirut, reportedly carried out by Hezbollah supporters, injuring multiple UN peacekeepers. We commend the Lebanese Army’s swift response to prevent further violence and urge the Lebanese government to take all necessary measures to bring the perpetrators to justice.' The Lebanese Army, which has been struggling to maintain stability amid Hezbollah’s growing influence, warned that the unrest could spiral into broader internal conflict. 'Several areas, including the airport zone, have witnessed violent protests involving assaults on soldiers, attacks on UNIFIL vehicles, and attempts to block airport roads,' the Lebanese military said in a statement. 'The army will act firmly to prevent further disturbances and safeguard public order. We caution against actions that could inflame tensions and destabilize the country during this critical period.' Following the violent clashes, the Hezbollah-affiliated network Al Manar initially distanced itself from the demonstrators, describing them as 'unruly elements'. However, the wording of the report was later removed, raising questions about Hezbollah’s role in orchestrating the protests. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sktdnnafyl	2025-02-14T21:38:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/14/HJY67GpY1g/HJY67GpY1g_0_236_406_229_0_small.jpg
Hamas and Islamic Jihad stage propaganda event ahead of hostage r...	Terror groups prepare propaganda-filled hostage release, set to free Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Sasha Trupanov after 498 days in captivity; Trupanov’s mother lobbied Russia for his release, while Dekel-Chen meets his daughter for the first time; Israel to free 369 Palestinian prisoners in exchange Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) are preparing a highly choreographed release of three Israeli hostages in Khan Younis, with a stage already set featuring propaganda banners in broken Hebrew, according to footage published in Arabic media on Saturday morning. Dozens of Hamas and PIJ operatives were seen gathering at the site, which prominently displays images of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem alongside Hamas footage of the October 7 attacks on Israeli communities and clashes with Israeli forces. One banner references U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed evacuation plan for Gaza, declaring: 'No migration except to Jerusalem.' The sixth round of the hostage-prisoner exchange deal will see Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Yair Horn, 46, and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov, 29, freed. The three men were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and have been held captive for 498 days in Gaza. The location of the handover ceremony appears to have been carefully chosen to showcase the destruction in Khan Younis, allegedly just feet from the house of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in a clash with Israeli forces last October. Flags of Arab states that have opposed the displacement of Gazans have also been displayed at the site. Trupanov, a 29-year-old from Tel Aviv, was kidnapped while visiting his mother Yelena and grandmother Irena Tati with girlfriend Sapir Cohen at Kibbutz Nir Oz. His father, Vitaliy Trupanov, was murdered in the October 7 attack. His mother, grandmother and girlfriend were freed in the November 2023 hostage exchange, but Sasha remained in captivity, held by PIJ. Russia had been actively lobbying for Trupanov’s release, as he holds Russian citizenship, and Hamas had assured the Kremlin he would be freed. PIJ released a new video of Trupanov on Friday, purportedly showing him walking and fishing on a beach in Gaza. However, previous propaganda videos showed him pleading for food and water under clear signs of duress. 'A year that I have been here in captivity, a year in which there is a shortage of food and water, no electricity,' Trupanov said in an earlier video. 'Please, please, don’t forget about us. Go out and demonstrate.' Brothers Yair and Eitan Horn were both abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where Eitan had been visiting from Kfar Saba. Their mother, Ruthie Horn, has spent nearly 500 days awaiting news of their fate. While Yair, 46, is set for release on Saturday, Eitan, 38, remains in captivity, as he is not included in the first phase of the release deal. In the lead-up to the exchange, Ruthie said she tried to shut out the noise of the media: 'I don't listen, I don't hear, it's not healthy. I just hope that this time things will happen. That Bibi [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] will fix what hasn't been done yet—and bring them all home.' As she prepares to reunite with Yair, she remains focused on the son still missing: 'I'm waiting for both my children to be here,' she said. 'We've thought about what to bring him, what to do, but honestly, it's different for us—because I'm still waiting for both my boys.' Dekel-Chen, 36, from Nir Oz, is expected to experience a deeply emotional reunion—meeting his newborn daughter for the first time. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the attack on October 7, 2023, Sagui’s wife, Avital, was seven months pregnant. She hid in the safe room with their two daughters, Gali and Bar, while Sagui was abducted. Before being taken, he told his wife there was no way to survive, as no Israeli forces had arrived to defend the kibbutz. In the 498 days since, Avital gave birth to their daughter, Shahar, who is now over a year old. On Friday afternoon, Avital shared a post on social media featuring her and their daughters, playing together at home. 'Updating everyone—Daddy is coming home,' she wrote. In the video, their middle daughter, Gali, excitedly shouts, 'Daddy!' when asked who is returning. Dekel-Chen was known for walking barefoot and working in Columbus, a convenience store built into a bus. His daughter Bar recalled: 'He’s really sweet and such a good dad. He always wears torn shirts and never wears shoes. I love going with him to the store because it’s fun there, and you can eat candy.' In exchange for Sagui, Sasha and Yair, Israel will release 369 Palestinian prisoners, including 36 convicted of crimes serious enough to have received life sentences. Among those set for release: Ahmed Barghouti, former aide to the Fatah secretary-general in the West Bank; Mohammed Sharaia, a Palestinian Authority police officer who murdered Israeli officer Moshe Dayan in 2002; Mansour Muqada, who murdered Dr. Mordechai Shafir in 2001; and Samir Aite, who orchestrated a terrorist attack that killed Moran Amit in 2002. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjr7ts6yyx	2025-02-14T21:16:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/ryXLProTY1e/ryXLProTY1e_0_172_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The terror group holding Sasha Trupanov captive for 497 days has released a video of him walking along a Gaza beach without specifying when it was filmed, just hours before expected release along with Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn The Islamic Jihad released a video Friday showing a new sign of life from Sasha Trupanov, just hours before he is set to be freed on Saturday as part of the sixth phase of the hostage deal. Trupanov is set to be released alongside Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn who have been held by Hamas. The video, which does not specify when it was filmed, shows Trupanov 'walking' on a Gaza beach and fishing. At the family's request, Ynet has not published the video. The video appears to be aimed at portraying Trupanov as healthy, amid public outrage over the release of three malnourished hostages last week—Eli Sharabi, Or Levy, and Ohad Ben-Ami—following the previous phase of the deal. These hostages, along with others released earlier, testified about the severe deprivation they faced in captivity. It should be noted that both they and previously freed hostages reported receiving significantly more food in the days leading up to their release, likely part of a deliberate display by terrorist organizations to suggest that hostages were held under better conditions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sasha, 29, from Tel Aviv, was kidnapped on October 7 along with his girlfriend, Sapir Cohen, his mother, Yelena, and his grandmother, Irina, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, where Sasha and Sapir had been visiting. Yelena and Irina were released in the November 2023 prisoner exchange. Sasha’s father, Vitali, was killed in the massacre. Sasha remains in the custody of Islamic Jihad, which has previously released two videos of him during captivity. In these videos, Sasha is seen speaking to the camera, presumably reading statements dictated by his captors. 'I've been here for a year, a year with food and water shortages, and no electricity,' he said in one of the videos. Yelena, a Sabbath observer, arrived earlier in the day at the forward reception point where she will reunite with her son at the Re'im camp on Saturday. She called on the people of Israel to pray for the safe return of all hostages. 'Pray for their safe return, and ask for peace, tranquility, and safety for Israel and the people of Israel,' she said. Sasha also holds Russian citizenship, and throughout the war, Hamas has assured Russia that he will be freed. A young engineer at Amazon, Sasha had moved to Ramat Gan with Sapir a month before the massacre. Friends describe him as a humble, quiet person who enjoys sports and has a regular routine of meeting friends for coffee. His mother, Yelena, has previously said, 'I am waiting to hug my only son. He is my heart and soul. Without him, I have no life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r111kfn6kjg	2025-02-14T12:31:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/rJ11SyrEMa/rJ11SyrEMa_1_57_574_323_0_small.jpg

'A few days after being discharged from Sheba Medical Center, Ofer contracted the flu, which developed into pneumonia, requiring readmission,' the family said in a statement. 'He is under close observation and receiving care from the wonderful medical staff looking after him.' To protect his recovery, Calderon is limiting contact with people outside his immediate family. He spent Friday dinner in his hospital room with his brother Nisan and sister-in-law Sharon. His condition is improving, and he is expected to be discharged soon. Professor Hagai Levine, head of the health division at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, stressed the vulnerability of former captives. 'Survivors of captivity suffer from suppressed immune systems due to malnutrition and extreme stress,' he said. 'Ofer is receiving dedicated care, and we wish him a full recovery.

Hamas to release 3 hostages from Khan Younis on Saturday morning	Hostages, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Sasha Trupanov will be released from Gaza’s Khan Younis as part of the sixth prisoner exchange; They will be transferred to Israeli authorities, with medical care and reunions with their families planned afterward Hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Sasha Trupanov are expected to be released from a single location in Khan Younis, the same site where two hostages, Ofer Calderon and Yarden Bibas, were released two weeks ago. The hostages are expected to be handed over to the International Red Cross in the morning, between 8 and 10 a.m., with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad likely using the transfer as a display of power, as they have done in previous exchanges. After being handed over to the Red Cross, the hostages will be transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza and reunited with their families at the initial reception point in the Re’im Camp. Following a medical evaluation, they will be flown by helicopter to the Sheba and Sourasky medical centers in Israel. The Health Ministry announced that the Barzilai and Soroka hospitals will be prepared to offer immediate medical care if necessary.

'These are sensitive moments for the hostages and their families, and we ask for privacy to be respected to ensure their safe return, recovery, and rehabilitation.' Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, while his wife, Avital, then seven months pregnant, hid in the safe room with their two young daughters. Before Hamas terrorists reached him, Dekel-Chen managed to tell his wife that no Israeli forces were coming to defend the kibbutz. Avital and their daughters remained safe, and in his absence, their third child, Shahar, was born. His family has been at the forefront of U.S. lobbying efforts, advocating for his release. Sasha Trupanov, 29, from Tel Aviv, was visiting his mother, Yelena, and grandmother, Irena Tati, at Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas launched its attack. His father Vitaliy was murdered, and Trupanov, along with his mother, grandmother, and girlfriend Sapir Cohen, was taken hostage. The women were freed in the November 2023 hostage deal, but Trupanov remained in captivity under Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Yair Horn, 46, was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his younger brother, Eitan, who had come to visit from Kfar Saba. Their family had immigrated to Israel from Argentina, and their mother, Ruthie Horn, said they only received confirmation of Yair being alive from freed hostages in November 2023. However, Eitan, 38, is not among the hostages set to be released in the first, humanitarian phase of the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skeqalttye	2025-02-14T09:03:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/14/B1Y1lyTtJe/B1Y1lyTtJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israeli warning grounds Iranian flight suspected of carrying Mill...	Iranian Mahan Air flight to Lebanon was halted in Tehran after an Israeli warning, as it allegedly carried millions in cash for Hezbollah; The move, backed by US pressure, led Lebanon to deny landing rights, sparking protests and diplomatic tensions with Iran An Iranian Mahan Air flight bound for Lebanon was grounded in Tehran after an Israeli warning, as the plane was reportedly carrying millions in cash from Iran to Hezbollah. The funds were intended to help the terror group recover from the blows it has sustained in its ongoing war with Israel, according to a report on Friday. The incident follows a sonic boom over Beirut by Israeli fighter jets two days ago, intended to intimidate Hezbollah operatives and reinforce Israel’s stance against ceasefire violations. Israeli intelligence identified the Mahan Air flight in advance, prompting a warning late Wednesday night from IDF Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee. He cautioned that Israel would act against civilian flights used to transfer Iranian funds to Hezbollah—an implicit threat that Beirut’s airport could become a target. As a result, the Mahan Air flight, originally scheduled to depart Tehran for Beirut at 2:30 p.m. Thursday was canceled. Another flight by the airline, scheduled for Friday, was also postponed. The disruption sparked protests by Hezbollah supporters outside Beirut’s airport, leading to rare clashes with the Lebanese army, which forcibly dispersed demonstrators blocking access roads. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar, a newspaper aligned with Hezbollah, the United States alerted Lebanon’s government—via the ceasefire monitoring committee—that Israel had intelligence indicating the Mahan Air flight was carrying cash for Hezbollah. The U.S. reportedly warned that Israel was determined to prevent the plane from landing, leaving Lebanon with little choice but to comply. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam instructed Transport Minister Faiz Rasami to deny the aircraft landing rights, forcing the cancellation. The plane had around 300 Lebanese passengers, mostly returning from religious pilgrimages in Iran. Hezbollah’s media outlets condemned the move, accusing the government of 'surrendering to Israeli threats and American dictates.' To resolve the crisis, Lebanon’s national carrier, Middle East Airlines, planned to send planes to retrieve the stranded passengers. However, Lebanese reports indicated that Iran had not approved the request, insisting that it be processed through diplomatic channels. As of Friday, the passengers remained stranded in Tehran. Iran condemns Israel’s actions Iran’s government reacted angrily, issuing a formal condemnation of Israel. 'The threat against an Iranian civilian aircraft carrying Lebanese citizens is a continuation of Israel’s violations of international law and Lebanon’s sovereignty,' Iran’s Foreign Ministry said. Tehran urged international aviation organizations to take 'serious action' against Israel’s 'dangerous conduct' toward civilian air travel. This is not the first time a Mahan Air flight has been caught in such a controversy. In January, Lebanese authorities delayed unloading cargo from a Mahan Air flight suspected of carrying Iranian cash for Hezbollah. Security forces also searched the luggage of an Iranian diplomat on board. That incident led to protests in Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut, with motorbike convoys waving the group’s flags in defiance. Throughout the ongoing war, several Mahan Air flights bound for Lebanon have reportedly been forced to turn back mid-flight, underscoring the growing pressure on Hezbollah’s supply lines. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjtzjchkjl	2025-02-14T06:33:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/07/27/HkD3kmJT9/HkD3kmJT9_0_146_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
IAEA chief sees time running out to revive Iran nuclear deal	Time is running out to get an accord to rein in Iran's nuclear program as Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of uranium to near weapons grade, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Friday. Speaking to Reuters, Grossi said he had still not been able to have political consultations with the new U.S. administration on the Iran issue, but that he would likely delay issuing a comprehensive report on its nuclear activities beyond March because it would add little value to what had already been reported.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjjgb0ny1g	2025-02-14T05:40:20-08:00	
Afghan national confesses to Munich car ramming, prosecutor cites...	Assailant leaves vehicle shouting 'Allahu akbar' (God is great) after wounding dozens; under investigation for 36 counts of attempted murder An Afghan national has admitted to purposefully driving into a crowd in the German city of Munich and authorities have determined an Islamist motive for the crime, a prosecutor said on Friday. At least 36 people including a toddler were hurt on Thursday when the 24-year-old man ploughed into demonstrators gathered in the city centre, putting security back in focus before next week's federal election. 'He has admitted that he deliberately drove into the participants of the demonstration,' lead prosecutor Gabriele Tilmann said, adding that the suspect, under investigation on 36 counts of attempted murder, had spoken German in a two-hour interrogation. 'I'm very cautious about making hasty judgements, but based on everything we know at the moment, I would venture to speak of an Islamist motivation for the crime,' she added. Officers fired on his car after the attack, but the suspect was not hit. According to Tilmann, he subsequently said the words 'Allahu akbar' ('God is greatest') and prayed in the presence of police. The attack came hours before leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy arrived in the southern city for the Munich Security Conference, but police said there was no link between the two events. Store detective Tilmann said there was no evidence to suggest the suspect, identified as Farhad Noori, was affiliated with any Islamist or terrorist organisations. She added that there was no indication of accomplices, but that investigators were evaluating his communications - mostly in Dari, a language spoken in Afghanistan - and items obtained during searches to ascertain whether anyone had prior knowledge of the crime or was involved. A Munich court was to decide later on Friday whether Noori would remain in investigative custody. German authorities say the Afghan national arrived in Germany as an unaccompanied minor in 2016, and that he was in Germany legally and had been working as a store detective. Tilmann said Noori had used social media to present himself as a bodybuilder and an athlete, and had also posted religious content. He did not have any prior convictions and had not been due for deportation, deputy police chief Christian Huber said, correcting false police statements from the day before that were seized upon by conservative and far-right politicians. That false information had been announced 'in the chaos of the early hours,' he said. Immigration and security issues have dominated campaigning ahead of the February 23 election, especially after other violent incidents in recent weeks, with polls showing the centre-right conservatives leading followed by the far right.

Hamas to release Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn Sasha Troufanov	Sagui to meet new baby daughter, Yair leaves young brother behind, Sasha finally reunites with girlfriend Sapir; after 497 days in captivity families brace for their return Sagui Dekel-Chen, and American-Israeli national, Ohad Horn and Russian Israeli Alexander Sasha Troufanov are the three Israeli hostages to be released from captivity on Saturday, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) confirmed on Friday.

Before the terrorists reached him, he was able to tell his wife that there was no way to survive the attack because no Israeli forces were there to defend the Kibbutz. Avital and the girls remained safe and the new baby, little Shahar was born while her father was being held in Gaza. His family has worked tirelessly to advocate for his release, lobbying U.S. officials for intervention. Sasha Troufanov, 29 from Tel Aviv was visiting him mother Yelena and his Grandmother Irena Tati at Kibbutz Nir-Oz, along with his Girlfriend Sapir Cohen when the Hamas massacre began. All four were abducted by the terrorists. The women were later freed in the November 2023 deal, but Sacha remained in the hands of his captors from the Islamic Jihad. In a video posted by the Islamist group Sacha described his condition. 'A year that I have been here in captivity, a year in which there is a shortage of food and water, no electricity,' he said in the psychological warfare clip. 'I want to remind the citizens of Israel, every time you eat something or drink something, remember us hostages, we don't have this opportunity to enjoy the food and water you eat or drink,' he said. 'Please, please, don't forget about us. I am asking you, citizens of Israel, please, please, go out and demonstrate.' Sasha's mother repeatedly urged Russian officials to intervene and secure her son's release. In January Russia's ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov said Hamas had promised the Kremlin that Troufanov would be soon freed among the hostages released in the first phase of the cease-fire deal.

Netanyahu, Trump discuss level of US support for Israeli strike o...	Support could range from active military support - such as intelligence, refueling or other assistance, to political backing for a coercive ultimatum; After Biden administration rejects Israel's requests, decision now in the hands of Trump Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the levels of American backing in an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, ranging from active military support - such as intelligence, refueling or other assistance, to political backing for a coercive ultimatum, according to a report by the Washington Post's David Ignatius in an article published late on Thursday. According to the report the United States has already provided Israel with bunker-busting bombs that could severely damage Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges and other equipment buried in a mountain fortress in Fordow, near Qom. Ignatius quoted American and Israeli officials who said that if Iran refuses a 'Libya-style abandonment' of its nuclear facilities, Israel would strike them with or without American support. The decision of the Biden administration not to support Israel's ultimatum, is now put to Trump. According to reporting in major U.S. media outlets in recent days, American intelligence reports claimed that Washington believed an Israeli strike on Iran would come in the first half of 2025. CNN also said that Israel intended not only to attack Iran's nuclear capabilities but to bring down the Iranian regime. The network quoted European intelligence sources who said Iran had received a shipment of over more than 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles. The arrival of the shipment at the Bandar Abas port in Iran was reported on Thursday, and the materials would be enough for 260 solid rocket motors for Iran’s Kheibar Shekan missiles or 200 of the Haj Qasem ballistic missiles, the network said citing the intelligence sources.

‘Clock is ticking’ on Iran, say military expert	A U.S. intelligence report indicating that Iran has significantly resumed uranium enrichment. According to the report, the country is now just steps away from obtaining as many as five nuclear bombs Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated his commitment to preventing Iran from ever becoming a nuclear state, warning that such a development would pose the gravest existential threat to Israel.

What does hell look like?	According to Dan Perry, former chief editor of the Associated Press in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, Trump could authorize Israel to resume the war with even greater force than before Hamas backtracked on its threat not to release any more Israeli hostages after former U.S. President Donald Trump warned that if the hostages were not freed by Saturday, 'all hell would break loose.' What does Donald Trump's hell look like? According to Dan Perry, former chief editor of the Associated Press in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, Trump could authorize Israel to resume the war with even greater force than before. 'I suppose in some version of the universe that might terrify Hamas, but not in my version of the universe, because these are nihilist jihadis who thrive off the destruction of their own territory, the suffering of their own people,' Perry said Tuesday on ILTV News' Insider. 'I think Trump's greater leverage might be on the Arab states that, to various degrees, support, enable, acquiesce to, or maybe even are fearful of taking on Hamas.' Perry suggested these states could include Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and especially Qatar, which maintains a delicate relationship with the United States while hosting an important American military base. 'It’s not clear who has leverage over whom in this situation, but Qatar does like to make nice with the world,' Perry said. 'They like to pretend they’re a normative country, and that doesn’t really go hand in hand with supporting a terror group.' Watch previous episodes of Insider: Should Israel Consider a Nuclear Strike on Iran? Will Trump’s Return Rewrite Middle East History? Netanyahu or Hamas: Who’s Really to Blame for the Ceasefire Delays? In contrast, Pesach Wolicki, executive director of Israel365 Action, told Insider that the real power of Trump’s warning lies not in an actual threat of destruction or war but in the speculation it creates. 'This whole speculation, the whole doubt, is really part of what Donald Trump’s game plan is,' Wolicki said. He called it 'refreshing' to see a U.S. president navigate Middle East negotiations more effectively than most Western leaders. He added that one of the great ironies of Trump’s presidency is that, despite entering office in 2016 with no foreign policy experience, he seems to handle the region better than many of his predecessors. In the past, Wolicki noted, Arab leaders would stake out extreme positions, knowing that over time, Israel would shift closer to their demands. They would simply wait it out. But Trump changed the paradigm. When Hamas threatened to stop releasing hostages, he didn’t return to the negotiating table or plead for the deal to continue. Instead, he issued an ultimatum: release them all by Saturday at midnight—or else. 'It is a negotiating ploy that I think is the right way to play,' Wolicki said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkfkmvntyx	2025-02-13T21:38:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/SkOTAFvF1g/SkOTAFvF1g_0_194_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Here's how Israelis celebrated Tu Bishvat on Thursday	This unique holiday highlights Israel’s vibrant nature—everything from trees to flowers—symbolizing renewal and restoration Thursday was Tu Bishvat in Israel, a holiday marking the new year for trees and a celebration of the country's natural beauty. This unique holiday highlights Israel’s vibrant nature—everything from trees to flowers—symbolizing renewal and restoration. Traditionally, Israelis celebrate with a Tu Bishvat Seder, a meal featuring dried fruits, nuts, and other early-season foods. Each item is accompanied by a special blessing, recited together. Many Israelis also mark the occasion by planting trees, strengthening their connection to the land. Tu Bishvat symbolizes renewal and rebirth, as trees in Israel begin to recover from winter, filling with fresh green leaves and colorful blossoms ahead of spring. Israel’s history is deeply tied to nature. In the early 20th century, much of the land was covered in swamps and disease-ridden pools. However, determined Jewish pioneers transformed the landscape, turning it into the agriculturally rich tapestry we know today. Tu Bishvat is a holiday for all Israelis to enjoy—a time to celebrate nature, honor history, and savor the fruits of the Holy Land.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1herinyke	2025-02-13T21:12:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/17/Skn1RKLa0/Skn1RKLa0_0_234_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Parents say hostages endured unimaginable hardships: cursed by captors, sharing rooms with terrorists, n electricity and wearing the same pair of underwear since October 7; The parents of Karina, Liri and Naama recount how their daughters struggle to speak of the horrors Weeks after returning to Israel following 477 days in captivity, a stark contrast remains between the relative openness of the released IDF lookouts about their time in Gaza and their silence regarding the events of October 7. While they have spoken in detail to their families about their conditions in captivity — the constant life-threatening danger, their captors' treatment, hunger and poor hygiene — they avoid discussing what happened in the shelter at the Nahal Oz base that Saturday. During those hours, they waited in vain for help, were beaten by terrorists and watched their comrades killed before their eyes. 'She just doesn’t talk about it,' said Albert Ariev, father of Karina Ariev. 'What happened in that shelter was horrific. It makes her rehabilitation even harder — I can see it. Something terrible happened to my daughter on October 7. The captivity wasn't easy but the nightmare is split into two parts.' Why is what happened in the shelter off-limits, while she discusses more than a year in captivity? 'She says she saw and experienced terrible things there. She was severely wounded and told us that she wanted to die on that day. She wished for an airstrike to end her suffering. They abused and beat her endlessly. That’s it — she won’t go further. She just says, 'I went through hell that day and wished to die.' It was the worst day of her entire period in captivity.' Since the second hostage deal began, Israelis have struggled to process the harrowing accounts of those who returned. The challenge is even greater for their families, mixing relief with the horror of what they endured. Ynet spoke with three parents of the five released observers: Albert Ariev, father of Karina; Shira Albag, mother of Liri Albag and Yoni Levy, father of Naama Levy. They all agreed: The wounds from October 7 have not begun to heal yet. Shira Albag: 'October 7 is as much a trauma as captivity and we haven't even begun addressing it. They saw their friends murdered and then sat there for four hours. Liri told me, 'Mom, we’ll have to process that later.' She hasn't spoken about what happened there. 'At the time, they thought it had only happened at their base — they had no idea of the scale. Only after four days, when they met other hostages, did they start to grasp the full picture. It took time for them to realize how many people were kidnapped.' 'Liri heard radio broadcasts and watched TV, mostly Al Jazeera. When she and her friends learned Arabic, they understood the situation — there was a war. They knew about the first hostage deal because people held with them were released. 'The captors made sure to hide anything relevant from them, except for negative news about Israel — saying there were no agreements, no efforts to bring them back. They used psychological terror, telling them, 'We’ll marry you off and convert you to Islam.'' 'October 7 is as much a trauma as captivity and we haven't even begun addressing it. They saw their friends murdered and then sat there for four hours.' Yoni Levy: 'Naama was exposed to the famous image of her from October 7. People told her about it — there was no way around it. She became famous against her will. From what little she’s shared, the real trauma, the breaking point and the most horrifying scenes were on October 7. Her world collapsed on that day.' Bread made of donkey food The upright posture and piercing gaze of the four lookouts released on January 25 gave the impression they had been together the entire time, but in reality, they were often separated. 'Liri was with Agam Berger from day one and, at times, with Naama,' said Shira Albag. 'She wasn’t with Daniella Gilboa or Karina. They have a deep connection. They experienced something we will never understand.

Each of them went through it alone but their bond gave them strength. Even now, outside of captivity, being together helps them cope.' Did they see the Hamas videos of them? 'They saw them on TV. Their captors made sure they did. But Liri told me, 'Mom, it passed quickly.' They didn’t dwell on it. Not like us, who watched them over and over for days.' Where was Liri held? 'She was in both houses and tunnels. Mostly homes. The tunnels drove her crazy with the silence, even though they technically had more freedom to move. But they were humid and eerily quiet — total silence. At least in the houses she could hear movement outside, which helped her feel that something was happening.' 'The houses she was in belonged to families with children and those kids cursed at her, spat on her and threatened her. We’ll have to deal with these kids when they grow up to be terrorists. That’s our reality in the Middle East.' What did they eat? How did they maintain hygiene? 'Sometimes they got two meals a day; sometimes they had nothing for days. At times, they ate food meant for donkeys. They made pita bread from it because there was no flour. Hygiene was minimal. Liri wore the same underwear from October 7. As women, we understand what that means — it’s not easy. They got sick a lot.' How did they pass the time? 'With a lot of thoughts and imagination. They played word-association games. They all kept diaries but weren’t allowed to take anything out of captivity. They also sang — rewriting lyrics to familiar songs.' Anger at the state Karina, on the other hand, preferred staying in tunnels. 'She had a logical explanation,' said Albert Ariev. 'Being above ground in Gaza was a death trap. She preferred to be underground because there were constant airstrikes above. 'Some days, they were moved while buildings collapsed around them, with shrapnel flying everywhere. She just wanted to be somewhere safe — even if it was a tunnel. She didn’t care as long as she survived.' 'Sometimes they got two meals a day; sometimes they had nothing for days. At times, they ate food meant for donkeys.' What were the conditions like? 'They only had cold water and washed with a funnel. She had no spare underwear but asked for a toothbrush and got one. There was no electricity. Some days, she didn’t leave her bed. They could move between locations, but they were stuck in a room for a month at times.' How was the food? 'She said it was 'not tasty,' but she forced herself to eat. She ate whatever the terrorists ate. During tough times, they gave them their own food.' Karina spent more than a year with Daniella Gilboa. How did they pass the time? 'My daughter came back speaking fluent Arabic. It’s surreal. She translates Al Jazeera for us. They also wrote songs. They enlisted together, served at the Nahal Oz base for nine months and were among the few lookouts who knew exactly what was happening that morning. When Karina called us, she simply said, 'War broke out. Dad, don’t come here.' That’s how she said goodbye.' 'They were a trio — Karina, Daniella and Aviv Hajaj, who was murdered in the shelter before their eyes. They were always together in the operations room, deeply bonded. That helped them survive, despite the occasional arguments in captivity.' Yoni Levy: 'Naama was held with other hostages and, at times, with some of the lookouts. There were many relocations, separations and regroupings. She’s mostly angry at Israel. She feels the state tried to kill her because it bombed the houses she was in. In one case, they barely escaped and a collapsing wall injured her. Her biggest fear was our own bombings.' How were they treated by their captors? Shira Albag: 'Liri reads people well. The moment she was taken, she understood: 'This is my reality now. I’m in Gaza and I need to survive like a Gazan.' She knew how to handle them — not by fighting, but by playing their game. 'It worked well beyond our expectations. At the same time, the terrorists slept in their room 24/7, always watching them. Every moment was a threat — one wrong word or a captor in a bad mood and everything changed.' Albert Ariev: 'The captors explained why they carried out October 7—it was the blockade, the food shortages, the power cuts. They were both angry and emotional. Karina kept her distance, avoiding debates.' 'She saw firsthand what happened when Israel bombed. She’s furious that people, including her, weren’t evacuated before the airstrikes. She knows Hamas is a terrorist group responsible for October 7, but she’s also angry at Israel because she lived through the war on both sides—as an abandoned target on October 7 and as a captive under bombardment in Gaza.' 'At the same time, the terrorists slept in their room 24/7, always watching them. Every moment was a threat — one wrong word or a captor in a bad mood and everything changed.' 'Every little thing brings them back' Even now, surrounded by loved ones, captivity lingers. Albert Ariev: 'Karina told us there were constant bombings in Gaza. Even today, she covers her ears when a helicopter flies overhead. We hope it passes with time.' Yoni Levy: 'We were at home when a passing car made some noise — something we didn't even notice — but she got terribly scared. She watched a bit of the release on Saturday and you could see it shook her. She doesn't understand what it means — whether there will be another round or not. 'We can't even explain to her what a 'humanitarian phase' means and that young people and soldiers would come later. She keeps saying, 'Everyone needs to get out of there, what don't you understand?' Even on a personal level, her recovery can't begin until it ends and everyone comes back.' Shira Albag: 'Liri said right after she was released, 'We were in hell and the boys are in an even worse hell.' We see the girls now and they look strong, like they're okay and they laugh — but nothing is okay. People need to understand that. 'We need to get everyone out urgently just so they can get close to being okay. There's no set formula for their recovery and we still don't know how to approach it. No one in this country does — not even the therapists. Everyone is learning, us and Liri too.' Did she watch the hostage release on Saturday? 'I didn't watch TV. I only looked at Liri and when I saw her reaction, I quickly told them, 'Turn it off.' I saw it wasn't good for her. She froze. Every little thing like that brings them back. I saw that even though she was home, at that moment, she was still in captivity. 'Liri said that more than once that the terrorists told them, 'When you're united, we fear you. You're strong.' They kept repeating it. That's something everyone needs to take in — the leaders and the people. Over these 15 months, I've realized the people are very united but our leadership isn't.' Albert Ariev: 'Karina also thinks about the hostages still there a lot. She said, 'Our hearts are split into 255 pieces.' Every person who doesn’t return shatters her heart. She was only with Daniella throughout captivity, but she heard from others about different hostages and knows the horrors they're enduring.' 'You can't be fully happy' The returning lookouts have modest dreams: waking up and making coffee, eating breakfast at home, opening their own closet, sleeping in their own bed and showering in their own bathroom. The small things that were taken from them for 15 months now bring them immense joy. Shira Albag: 'Everything is in her hands now and those little things do her good. Even just sitting with us and watching TV — not that we get to do much of it. Yesterday, she got a tattoo she dreamed of while in captivity and even drew it — a postage stamp with hearts and a phrase that gave her strength throughout. The funny thing is, I don't even remember what it says.' Yoni Levy: 'In her first days back, Naama really wanted to go to the sea. She said she had dreamed about it for a long time underground. Even in the hospital, there was a window and every afternoon, when there was nothing else to do, she would go look at the sunset over the sea. 'So, when we had the chance, we took her for half an hour — to see the horizon, to hear the waves. She and I are trying to figure out when she can run a few kilometers again. Sports was a big part of her life and we're looking for the first opportunity for her to reconnect with herself, with her body.' Albert Ariev: 'Karina has a long rehabilitation ahead of her. She was injured in the head and lower limbs. Her legs are full of shrapnel, which makes standing and walking for long periods difficult. She also has shrapnel in her face, so it'll take time.' What would you say to the hostages’ families still waiting? Shira Albag: 'Three weeks ago, I was in their place. Nothing I say can help — they’re at their lowest point. But you can't lose hope and faith. You have to hold onto them. Talk to the hostages, on the radio and TV. 'We don’t know who’s listening. It strengthens them. Liri didn’t hear us, only other families, and still, it gave her strength. Just by reaching out, they don’t lose hope. We're in a battle to bring them home. Liri is here, but for me, this war isn’t over until the last hostage returns.' Albag can’t hold back her tears. 'It's still hard for me,' she says. 'I see Idit, Alon Ohel’s mother, and I cry with her. Just a moment ago, Liri was in his place. You can’t be fully happy. Even Liri isn’t fully happy as long as there’s a hostage still in there.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywga0iy1g	2025-02-13T13:47:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/r1zs8pHMdyl/r1zs8pHMdyl_0_99_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Crowdfunding for ex-hostage Eli Sharabi's rehabilitation raises o...	Friends of Sharabi, who returned from captivity and discovered that his family had been murdered, are leading a fundraising campaign to help him get back on track. Within hours, over a million shekels were raised: 'We can't change what happened, but we can promise Eli a new start' Eli Sharabi was held captive by Hamas for 491 days. Upon his return to Israel less than a week ago, he discovered that his family had been murdered at their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, and his brother, who was kidnapped with him, had been murdered in Gaza. Now, his friends and supporters are leading a crowdfunding campaign aimed at helping him rehabilitate and rebuild his life. Within a few hours, more over 1 million shekels had been raised. The campaign states that its goal was to raise one million shekels within 24 hours, in order to finance Sharabi's physical and mental rehabilitation, provide him with financial support, and assist him in finding suitable housing. 'Eli is coming back to life – and we are here to build him a new future,' the campaign states. 'Eli has returned to a reality that is hard to even imagine. The home he had is gone. His beloved wife, Liane, and his daughters, Noya and Yahel were murdered. His brother Yossi, who was kidnapped with him, was murdered in captivity and his body is still in Gaza. But amidst all the pain, there is one thing that is invincible: Eli's spirit.' The message from the campaign also said: 'We cannot change what was, but we can guarantee Eli a new beginning. Physical and mental rehabilitation, a life with meaning, real support – it is in our hands. The goal: one million shekels in 24 hours. The time: now. There is no later. The power: you. Everyone who donates, everyone who shares changes Eli's fate. Eli belongs to all of us. Today, we are all his family. Donate now, share, be part of this great thing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharabi's friend, Sharon Adam, one of the project's initiators, told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth about the idea of ​​raising money for his rehabilitation 'Eli's friends and I thought about what could be done for him and we realized that there was also a desire from the people to help him recover after everything he went through, and we don't know what will happen to him. It's also not clear what he is supposed to receive from the state, so we decided to raise money for him to help him with the long rehabilitation that awaits him,' she explained. The campaign that went live on Thursday morning, on Sharabi's birthday, has so far raised over 1.2 million shekels. 'I'm surprised by the pace,' said Adam. 'There are amazing people in the country. Eli is aware of the extent of the support he receives and he is shocked by what he sees. He doesn't understand why he receives this love and he gets excited about everything. He tears up many times from small gestures and is grateful to the team that is taking care of him. He is very excited.' Aden added that 'from the moment I saw him get out of the Hamas car and he was thin and emaciated and everyone here was crying, I smiled because he arrived in relatively good condition compared to what he could have been and in a condition that was relatively easy to fix physically. We told him we thought they would break him and he said 'they don't have a chance'. He is sad and it will take time to recover, but he is a strong man.'

Texas measles outbreak hits at least 22 children and two adults	At least 24 cases of measles have been reported in an outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, state officials said, warning that more cases of the highly contagious disease were likely to surface. None of the infected people in the community, about 90 miles southwest of Lubbock, Texas, and near the New Mexico state line, were vaccinated, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in an alert on February 11. Twenty-two were children and two were adults. Nine people have been hospitalized. The outbreak marks a jump in the known measles cases in the U.S., with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting only 14 other cases in the country so far this year. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year. The virus can spread via travelers from countries where measles is common.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdiurikje	2025-02-13T11:33:17-08:00

Teacher fired after showing 5th graders shocking October 7 footag...	Educator says she intended to show fifth grade students footage of Magen David Adom activities but mistakenly played emergency service reels from murderous attack A teacher at a school in central Israel’s Tzur Yigal exposed fifth-grade students to a graphic video from the October 7 massacre during a lesson. The footage included severed limbs, gunshot victims and the screams of the wounded. Some students panicked, with several breaking down in tears and later experiencing anxiety. A school probe found that the teacher had intended to show a video about Magen David Adom’s (MDA) activities but mistakenly played a different video from the MDA depicting the October 7atrocities. She was unaware of the mistake as she had left the classroom after starting the video. Parents reported their children were in shock and distress. 'This is exactly what we’ve tried to shield them from for the past year and a half. The kids are severely traumatized,' one mother said. 'This is a serious incident that occurred during an extracurricular lesson taught by an external instructor not employed by the ministry,' The Education Ministry said in a statement. 'Once the incident became known, she was immediately dismissed from the school.'

Family of hostage Segev Kalfon says received a sign of life from ...	Segev was kidnapped from the Nova festival and has spent 496 days in Hamas captivity; released hostages told his family that he is still alive; Despite his medical problems, Segev is not on the list of hostages to be released in the first phase of the deal; The family found out he had been taken to Gaza when they saw a video clip showing him being loaded into a van by terrorists Another sign of life has been received for a hostage who is not included on the list of those to be released in phase one of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. The family of Segev Kalfon said that hostages who were released from captivity in the Gaza Strip have provided them with a sign of life from him. Kalfon, 27, from Dimona, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 and has been in Hamas captivity for 496 days. His family discovered that he was kidnapped into Gaza after footage showed him being loaded into a pickup truck by Hamas terrorists. Segev's sister-in-law, Rotem, shared: 'We received a sign of life and we are waiting to hug him.' In an interview with Ynet this week, his family said that Segev suffers from medical problems; but despite this he was not included in the humanitarian deal, and does not appear on the list of 33 hostages whowill be released in the first phase of the deal. 'He suffers from anxiety disorders and is on medication, he has post-traumatic stress disorder from an accident he had at a young age, and he underwent surgery where he had platinum plates inserted into his leg,' said his sister-in-law Rotem. 'We understand that they could get infected, and he could need another surgery. How can you determine that someone in captivity is not a humanitarian case? We saw how they came out of captivity, extremely malnourished. How can you even sort out who is and who is not?' Galit, Segev's mother, also failed to understand the criteria used to determine who was eligible for release in the first stage and who was not. 'What we saw on Shabbat was like a punch in the stomach,' she said, referring to the sight of Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy and Eli Sharabi, who were released emaciated and pale, and later testified to severe abuse in captivity, which included starvation and being held in chains. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'There was euphoria when the women returned, because they looked relatively okay, but I knew that in the pictures of the men it would be something else. My son has already marked two birthdays in captivity. He is 27 years old, and Hamas still sees him as a soldier. I don't understand how this happens - we are in a country that studies history, how come we don't learn from our past?' asks his mother. The sign of life from Segev is added to a series of signs of life received in recent days, following the return of the three hostages in the lastroundh: Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi. On Wednesday, another sign of life was received from a hostage who is not included in the list of those who are supposed to be released in the first phase of the deal. The Tikva Forum reported that the family of the kidnapped Eitan Mor recently received a sign of life from him. 'We are praying for the return of all the hostages, including our son Eitan,' they said. Yesterday it was learned that signs of life were recently received from the kidnapped soldier Matan Engerst and hostage Yosef Haim Ohana. Hagai Engerst, Matan's father, said that the family received a sign of life from him through kidnapped people who were released in the last few days. The evidence that the armored soldier is alive, but is injured and being held in difficult conditions, was received six months after he was seen in a psychological terror video found in Gaza. In addition, Ynet reported for the first time that Yosef's aunt, Hanna Mastronov, said: 'We have a clear indication that he is alive . There are signs of life that indicate that he is alive.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rko2r3styx	2025-02-13T10:22:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/07/SkbQMzV00006/SkbQMzV00006_0_140_831_468_0_small.jpg

France proposes plan to speed up Israeli troop withdrawal from Le...	France has put together a proposal for United Nations peacekeepers, including French troops, tp replace Israeli forces at key points to ensure those forces leave Lebanon by a February 18 deadline, Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Thursday. Israel's public broadcaster said on Wednesday the U.S. had authorized a 'long term' Israeli troop presence in southern Lebanon, after sources told Reuters Israel had sought an extension to a Feb. 18 deadline to withdraw its forces. Under a truce deal brokered by Washington in November, Israeli troops were granted 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon where they had waged a ground offensive against fighters from Lebanon's armed group Hezbollah since early October. Hezbollah combatants were to leave the zone and Lebanese troops were to deploy in the area within the same period. 'We have worked to formulate a proposal that can satisfy the security expectations of Israel which planned to stay longer at certain points on the blue line,' Barrot told reporters after a conference on Syria in Paris. He said that the proposal would see UNIFIL peacekeepers, including French forces, substituting Israeli forces at observation points and that the United Nations backed the idea.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkcyw6ofkl	2025-02-13T10:00:09-08:00

RFK Jr. to take top US health post after Senate confirmation	Robert F.

US imposes sanctions against ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan	Trump administration blocks international court official's assets and visitation rights; Khan responsible for issuing arrest warrant against Netanyahu and Gallant before being faced with sexual harassment charges Less than three months after issuing arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, which had announced plans to sanction the ICC, designated Khan, a British citizen, as its first target. He was added to a blacklist signed by Trump last week with Reuters confirming the decision to impose sanctions. The sanctions freeze Khan’s U.S. assets and bar him and his family from entering the country. The ICC condemned the move, saying, 'We will continue to provide justice and hope to millions of innocent victims worldwide.' In November 2024, after the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant were approved, Khan said: 'With respect to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and former Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, the judges of the International Criminal Court have found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that each has committed the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare and crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts, as a direct perpetrator, acting jointly with others. 'The Chamber also found reasonable grounds to believe that they are each responsible for the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against civilians as a superior.'

We count on their cooperation in this situation, as with all other situations under the court’s jurisdiction. We also welcome collaboration with non-states parties in working toward accountability and upholding international law.' After the warrants were issued, Khan became embroiled in a sexual harassment case. The British Daily Mail reported that a staff member who was allegedly assaulted by Khan told a colleague, who then reported it to senior ICC officials. Reuters later reported that the court would launch an external investigation and in a letter to member states, Khan was urged to suspend himself during the probe. Khan faced further controversy after hiring the British law firm Bindmans Lawyers, which represents several Palestinian organizations — some of which had petitioned him to issue the arrest warrants against Israeli officials — raising concerns over a clear conflict of interest. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdkqsofkg	2025-02-13T09:10:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/HyU2E63fyg/HyU2E63fyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Rocket fired from Gaza at Israel lands inside strip , killing tee...	Launch during cease-fire is first since January and comes amid tensions ahead of sixth hostage handover set for Saturday; IDF sees incident as infringement on agreement A rocket was fired from Gaza toward Israel on Thursday for the first time in weeks despite the cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza and ahead of the sixth hostage exchange set for Saturday. It exploded inside the Strip’s Al-Bureij refugee camp, killing a 14-year-old boy. 'A rocket launch was identified in the Gaza Strip. The rocket fell inside the Gaza Strip. The IDF is committed to fully implementing the conditions of the agreement for the return of the hostages,' the military said in a statement. Shortly after, the Israeli Air Force carried out an airstrike on the launch site. Security officials consider the presence of the launcher in the area a violation of the agreement. Palestinian sources claimed the rocket was made from 'remnants of an Israeli missile.' The last known launch from Gaza was on January 11, with subsequent sirens proving to be false alarms.

A severe, disproportionate response is needed to make clear we won't return to the October 6 mindset. And to those calling for an end to the war – wake up!

Meanwhile, Defense Minister Israel Katz held a security assessment ahead of a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the IDF Southern Command joined by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, incoming Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and other senior officials.

Israel seeks to expedite release of six hostages amid cease-fire ...	International outlet reports that mediators are working to accelerate the release of six hostages set to remain in captivity after Saturday’s exchange, as Israel and Hamas trade accusations over aid delays Mediators in the hostage release and cease-fire deal with Hamas — at Israel’s request — are working to expedite the release of six living hostages included in the first phase of the deal, who will remain in captivity after the next exchange on Saturday when three more hostages are set to be freed, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. According to the report, Hamas agreed to release the three hostages as scheduled after reaching an understanding that more tents, caravans and heavy equipment for clearing rubble would be sent into Gaza. The report, citing mediator sources, did not explicitly link the efforts to accelerate the release of the six hostages to the agreement on aid deliveries. Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, but officials previously indicated that one potential resolution could involve releasing three hostages on Saturday, followed by an expedited release of the six others rather than spreading it over two weeks. The report also detailed that Israel requested additional hostages be added to the original 33 set to be released in the first phase amid speculation that Jerusalem may seek to extend this phase rather than proceed to phase two, which involves ending the war in Gaza and securing the release of all remaining living hostages. Hamas’ response to this request remains unclear. So far, 16 hostages have been freed in the deal’s first phase along with five Thai nationals released outside the deal. Of the 33 hostages included in this phase, 17 remain — nine alive and eight dead. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a security assessment at the IDF Southern Command amid the reinforcement of Israeli forces in the south. The meeting included Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, incoming Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and other senior security officials. The crisis over the deal’s first phase remains unresolved, while tensions in Netanyahu’s coalition have emerged over its second phase. Responding to pleas from hostage families, Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuli Edelstein said Israel is 'unequivocally' addressing the second phase. However, Netanyahu’s spokesperson Omer Dostri contradicted him, saying: 'Contrary to Edelstein’s claim, Israel is not currently negotiating phase two of the deal.' Earlier this week, Hamas threatened to derail the deal, saying it would not release the three hostages in the sixth handover round on Saturday, citing Israeli violations of the cease-fire, particularly delays in delivering shelters for displaced Palestinians. The terror group also reportedly was angered by former U.S. President Donald Trump's call for the relocation of Gazans and delays in launching negotiations for the deal’s second phase, which were set to begin last week. In response, Israel threatened to resume the war and reinforced troops in the south, while Trump demanded all hostages be freed by Saturday at noon, suggesting Israel 'let hell break out' on Gaza if Hamas failed to comply. Amid right-wing pressure to adopt Trump's deadline, Netanyahu sent mixed signals about the number of hostages Israel expects to be released but ultimately appears to accept that only three will be freed. A message sent to ministers by Israel’s National Public Diplomacy Directorate stressed; 'We insist on upholding the agreements as they stand,' meaning three hostages released in the next exchange. Egypt and Qatar have intensified mediation efforts to salvage the release deal and cease-fire. According to Hamas and reports in both mediating countries, Hamas agreed to the hostage release after receiving assurances that caravans and medical supplies would enter Gaza immediately. While thousands of tents already have been sent in, no caravans had been delivered before now. The deal originally stipulated that Gaza would receive at least 200,000 tents and 60,000 caravans. Dozens of trucks carrying caravans and tractors were seen near the Rafah crossing Thursday morning. Netanyahu’s office denied any coordination regarding their entry but didn’t rule out their possible delivery through other border crossings, such as Kerem Shalom, after Israeli inspections. Egyptian media also reported that the equipment would enter only after security checks, as is done for all humanitarian aid trucks. Signs of a compromise emerged Wednesday, with reports of dozens of trucks carrying tents reaching northern Gaza. A total of about 800 trucks entered Gaza that day, 200 more than required by the agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h100l15otyg	2025-02-13T08:07:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/HJbsQHXotke/HJbsQHXotke_0_98_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

At least 28 people were hurt when a car driven by an Afghan asylum seeker ploughed into a crowd in Munich on Thursday in what the state premier said was probably an attack, putting security back in focus before next week's federal election. The suspected attack came hours before international leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were due to arrive in the southern German city for the Munich Security Conference. Police said a white car had approached police vehicles that were accompanying a demonstration of striking workers, before speeding up and slamming into people. One shot was fired at the suspect and it was unclear if he was wounded, police added. Officers detained the 24-year-old driver. They said his motive was unclear. 'It was probably an attack,' Bavaria state premier Markus Soeder told reporters. Bavarian interior minister Joachim Herrmann said the suspect had been known to police for drug and shoplifting offences. His asylum application had been rejected, said Herrmann, but he had not been forced to leave due to security concerns in Afghanistan.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjklf5jf1e	2025-02-13T07:10:48-08:00

In a speech in Yemen, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi threatened that if the US and Israel 'attempt to implement the Trump plan by force or agree to it with the Arab regimes, we will intervene with missiles, drones, naval operations and other means'; He defiantly said that 'if Trump wants to take care of the Jews, let him give them one of the states in the US' The Houthi leader threatens in a speech in Yemen that if the United States and Israel try to implement U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza by force, 'we will intervene militarily, using missiles and drones,' and defiantly says that if 'Trump and the Americans want to take care of the Jews, let them transfer them to the United States.' In a speech, terrorist leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said that 'Trump's plan to uproot the Palestinian people from their land and homeland is an expropriation of rights. Trump is a criminal and insists on his criminal plan that denies rights and justice. His plan is wrong and unjust, and it seems that he is serious about putting pressure on several Arab countries to accept it. We are not surprised by the plan, there is no limit to the ambitions of the American president who believes in the unjust Zionist project.' 'I call on the armed forces to be prepared for military intervention if Trump carries out his threats. We will be monitoring and coordinating with the fighters in Palestine and the resistance axis,' he said. 'Trump, who in his first term brought the 'deal of the century', has committed the 'crime of the century' in his current term,' the Houthi leader accused. 'If Trump and the United States want to take care of the Jews, they should transfer them to the United States. There are very large areas there. They can transfer the Jews to America and give them one of the states, the United States has uninhabited areas.' Throughout the current war, the Houthis launched more than 40 surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, and more than 320 drones. Al-Houthi threatened that the launches - which had stopped with the start of the cease-fire in Gaza - would be resumed in the event of an attempt to implement the Trump plan. > 'If the Americans and Israelis try to implement the plan by force or agree with the Arab regimes to implement it, we will intervene even with military force,' he threatened. 'We will intervene through missiles, drones, naval operations and other means if the U.S. and Israel implement the displacement plan by force. We will confront them with all means. We will never stand idly by in the face of a plan of attack against the Palestinians.' The Houthi leader also called in his speech for people to attend demonstrations in Sana'a and throughout Yemen on Friday, to 'send a warning message to the Israeli and American enemies against displacement or aggression.' Support marches were held in Gaza every Friday during the war, but they have no longer been held weekly since the cease-fire. Two days ago, al-Houthi also threatened Israel, saying that members of the terrorist organization 'are ready to launch attacks on it if it attacks again in Gaza and does not abide by the cease-fire agreement.' 'We will stand by the Lebanese people if the occupation decides to escalate,' he added. 'We confirm the principle of supporting the Palestinian people militarily, politically and with information. We are ready for military intervention in the event of Israeli escalation against Gaza. The Palestinian Authority is cooperating with the Israeli enemy, even these days, unfortunately.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rq1kikjg	2025-02-13T06:08:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/ByhMVq9BJx/ByhMVq9BJx_0_74_971_547_0_small.jpg

Groups that refuse to lay down their arms and submit to the defense ministry's authority will play no part in a national dialogue on Syria's future, a committee set up to prepare for a national conference said on Thursday. The statement raises the prospect of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which hold much of northern and eastern Syria, being excluded from the national conference unless they disarm in line with the demands of the new Damascus government. The seven-member preparatory committee was launched on Thursday to lay the ground for the national conference, which interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has said will produce a statement forming the basis of a constitutional declaration. The new Syrian administration wants the U.S.-backed SDF to become part of the national armed forces but has rejected an SDF proposal for the Kurdish-led group to be merged into the army as a single military bloc.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1swoyokyl	2025-02-13T05:56:56-08:00

Iranian president mocks Israel: 'Attack on nuclear facilities? We...	Masoud Pezeshkian warns Tehran could quickly rebuild any nuclear sites targeted in potential Israeli strike, as US intelligence assesses Israel may attack Iran’s facilities by mid-year, possibly with US support Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday that Tehran's enemies may be able to strike the country's nuclear centers but they cannot deprive it of its ability to build new ones. He made his comments following a Washington Post report that U.S. intelligence believes Israel may launch a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear sites in Fordow and Natanz by mid-year, aiming to exploit damage to Iranian air defenses from an IDF attack in October. 'They threaten us that they will hit nuclear facilities... If you (the enemy) strike a hundred of those we will build a thousand other ones... You can hit the buildings and the places but you cannot hit those who build it,' Pezeshkian said, according to state media. U.S. President Donald Trump raised on Monday the possibility of Israel hitting Iran in an interview with Fox News saying he would prefer to make a deal with Iran to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of them. I would prefer that not to happen,' Trump said. On Thursday, the commander of Iran's conventional air force Hamid Vahedi said: 'We tell all countries, friends and foes alike, that our country's doctrine is defensive but we will respond with force against any enemy attack.' Israeli officials believe a potential attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities would have a significant impact, despite U.S. intelligence assessments suggesting it would only delay Tehran’s program by weeks or months, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reportedly confirmed. According to American intelligence reports detailed in The Wall Street Journal, Israel is weighing two possible strike options, both of which would require U.S. support for aerial refueling, intelligence gathering and surveillance. Analysts say such reliance underscores Washington’s influence over any Israeli military action. One attack scenario involves Israeli fighter jets launching ballistic missiles from the air without entering Iranian territory, similar to October's strike. Another option would see aircraft flying over Iranian nuclear sites and deploying bunker-busting bombs, for which the Trump administration recently approved the sale of training kits. The intelligence report also suggests Israel would pressure the Trump administration to back the operation, with officials assessing that Trump is more likely to support direct U.S. involvement than his predecessor, Joe Biden. Sources familiar with the matter indicate Israel fears that its window of opportunity to halt Iran’s nuclear advancements is closing. During Trump’s initial days in office, U.S. intelligence noted that Israel was considering a strike on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. American military officials reportedly believe that given the complexity of such an operation against fortified sites, Israeli forces would likely require direct U.S. military assistance. The Wall Street Journal also cited Defense Minister Israel Katz, who in November said Iran was 'more vulnerable than ever to attacks on its nuclear facilities,' adding that Israel had 'an opportunity to achieve the most important goal: to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel.' Iran and Israel engaged in tit-for-tat strikes last year amid wider tensions over Israel's war in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkatddotyg	2025-02-13T05:26:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/29/SkrjwMPRR/SkrjwMPRR_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg
Lookouts made to drink contaminated groundwater, Daniella was on...	In exclusive Ynet interview, Ran Gilboa calls his daughter a hero, revealing she outsmarted captors to access radio and TV, keeping informed while in Hamas captivity, Daniella still has shrapnel from wounds sustained on October 7 and requires surgery 'My daughter is a hero who returned from hell,' Daniella Gilboa's father Ran said in his first exclusive interview with Ynet after her release from captivity. 'We have a wonderful people who fight for each one of the hostages, and it is our duty to ensure they all return.' Ran, who had stayed out of the public eye during the long weeks since Daniella was abducted from her base during the Hamas massacre on October 7, said his daughter still had shrapnel in her foot and would require surgery. 'We did not know what had happened to her on October 7. The last thing we knew was that she had heard gunfire and asked us to pray for her. For two days, we had no idea if she was dead or alive. Only after her friend analyzed video footage did we learn that she was lying at the bottom of a car carrying other IDF lookouts, on her way to Gaza.' 'The terrorists shot their friends before their eyes and then separated them from the dead. They saw bodies being mutilated and other horrifying things,' he said. 'After being bound for hours, they were moved to a jeep, while we still thought they were on the base. We were naïve.' > During her time in captivity, Hamas released a video falsely depicting Daniella as dead. 'All I could see from that moment was black. Time stopped. After being held hostage for a year, enduring captivity, I thought she had been murdered. But later, we learned the clip was staged. They told her to lie down, covered her with sheets, applied makeup to her face and highlighted her tattoo. They did it on purpose, and at home, we were devastated. We were helpless.' Where was she held? 'She was kept in stifling tunnels where she couldn't stand, as well as in apartments. At one point, there was intense shelling nearby. There was no water, and Daniella and the other girls had to drink contaminated groundwater. It made her gravely ill, and for weeks, she was on death’s door. Some days, they were fed animal feed—inedible scraps of dirty vegetables and some kind of tough flour.' How were they moved around? 'She was with Karina Ariev, a close friend, the entire time. Without the terrorists realizing, she learned fluent Arabic, so they knew what was happening. At some point, Doron Steinbrecher joined them. Daniella was injured, and Doron, a veterinary nurse, dressed her wounds and helped her. All the girls had shrapnel in their bodies, and Doron cared for them as much as she could.' 'Daniella is incredibly smart and managed to manipulate her captors into letting her listen to the radio and watch Al Jazeera and i24 on TV. She saw her mother, who fought like a lioness. She said that had the girls been freed two weeks earlier, they would have looked as emaciated as the three hostages who were freed last week. Their captors gave them more food in the days leading up to their release. They were only told they would be freed three days before it happened.' When the IDF lookouts faced the Gazan crowd during their release, they smiled and held up victory signs. 'She told the girls to smile and hold their heads high. To be proud Israelis. She is an amazing girl. There are ups and downs, but she survived captivity. Now, she wants to embrace life fully. All of the hostages must be returned as quickly as possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjpxuxot1l	2025-02-13T05:07:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/yk14259391/yk14259391_0_23_851_479_0_small.jpg

US president calls King Abdullah II 'one of the great leaders of the world' in video aimed at easing Jordanian concerns over plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza U.S. President Donald Trump released a video on Wednesday praising Jordan’s King Abdullah II, calling him 'a tremendous man' and 'one of the true great leaders of the world.' 'You have a king who is a tremendous man. He's a leader. He's got a wonderful heart. He loves you so much, he loves his country. He's done amazingly,' Trump said in the message directed at the Jordanian people. 'You are lucky to have him.' He also commended the Jordanian people, describing them as 'a spectacular group' with 'tremendous brilliance and energy.' > The message came after Trump hosted Abdullah at the White House, where the two leaders discussed Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinian residents of Gaza to neighboring countries while rebuilding the enclave as a tourism hub. Trump suggested U.S. financial aid to Jordan and Egypt could play a role in securing regional cooperation. 'I believe we can reach understandings,' he said. King Abdullah, for his part, said Jordan planned to take in 2,000 Palestinian children in need of medical treatment and voiced support for efforts to promote regional stability. He added, however, that further steps should wait until Egypt presented its own plan for Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1eqq4ifje	2025-02-13T04:36:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/rkW3azGjKJx/rkW3azGjKJx_0_120_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF strikes explosives-laden vehicle in Jenin, thwarts suspected ...	Troops detonate booby-trapped car, secondary explosions confirm it was rigged with explosives; in separate incident, soldiers shoot Palestinian who rammed stolen car into military base gate; military continues month-long terror sweep The IDF said Thursday it struck a vehicle packed with explosives in the eastern sector of Jenin, in the northern West Bank, as part of its ongoing counterterrorism operation. According to the IDF, the car was intended to detonate near troops operating in the area. Soldiers isolated the site and detonated the vehicle using a grenade, triggering secondary explosions that confirmed the presence of explosives inside. Shortly after, a suspected car-ramming attack was thwarted near an IDF headquarters in the northern West Bank. The military said a Palestinian suspect drove a stolen vehicle into the base's gate before exiting the car and approaching soldiers on guard. Troops responded by opening fire. > The strikes and clashes occurred as the IDF entered the 24th day of its operation targeting terror networks in and around Jenin and Tulkarm. Troops have been conducting house-to-house searches, often based on Shin Bet intelligence, in an effort to disrupt organized terrorist activity in refugee camps. Much of the fighting involves hit-and-run tactics, as terrorists avoid direct confrontation with Israeli forces. On Wednesday, a soldier was wounded in an exchange of fire in the Nur Shams refugee camp, and his comrades from the elite Maglan unit killed a terrorist in the ensuing battle. Since the start of the operation, the IDF has killed approximately 60 terrorists, arrested over 200 terror suspects, conducted 15 airstrikes and used heavy machinery to demolish buildings and roads where explosives were planted, the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqxvejyyl	2025-02-13T02:27:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/rkxGudzoYJx/rkxGudzoYJx_40_200_414_233_0_small.jpg
Two Israeli Arabs charged with planning terror attacks	Suspects, 18 and 21, indicted for plotting attack on civilians and security forces while expressing support for Hamas; they conducted surveillance, attempted to obtain weapons and explored alternative attack methods Israeli security forces announced Thursday they had thwarted a planned ramming and shooting attack by two Arab Israeli citizens. The suspects, aged 18 and 21 from the village of Zemer, allegedly plotted to target civilians and security forces and expressed support for Hamas following the October 7 massacre. The two were indicted at Lod District Court on charges of conspiring to commit murder and terrorism-related offenses, including training for an attack and attempting to obtain firearms. > According to the indictment, one of the suspects began identifying with Hamas, purchased paraphernalia affiliated with the terrorist group and filmed himself expressing support. He then shared inciteful content online and suggested carrying out a shooting attack on a military transport bus near his home. His accomplice later proposed attacking civilians in the nearby city of Netanya instead. The suspects reportedly conducted surveillance of a military base, recorded videos and researched the cost of weapons. After realizing they lacked sufficient funds, they considered alternative methods, including car-ramming, firebombs or explosive devices. One suspect attempted to manufacture an explosive using online tutorials but was unsuccessful. Prosecutors have requested the suspects remain in custody throughout legal proceedings, arguing they had embraced extremist ideology and sought to maximize harm to Israeli soldiers. 'Their actions demonstrate clear intent to carry out a serious attack,' the prosecution said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy002qsoykx	2025-02-13T02:12:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/04/06/SJ5Zxt2W2/SJ5Zxt2W2_1_89_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Hamas confirms hostage release to proceed under cease-fire agreem...	Terror group reaffirms commitment to Gaza truce and Saturday’s hostage release; heavy machinery and caravans bound for Gaza; Netanyahu's office denies reports Israel agreed to allow heavy machinery into enclave Hamas has reaffirmed its commitment to the Gaza cease-fire agreement and the scheduled release of hostages on Saturday, three days after it unilaterally suspended the deal citing alleged Israeli violations, Palestinian sources told Arabic media on Thursday. The terrorist group has conditioned the next phase of hostage releases on Israel ensuring the continued flow of humanitarian aid beyond Saturday. The statement comes after footage surfaced showing dozens of caravans waiting to enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, along with numerous tractors—aligned with Hamas' demand to allow heavy equipment for clearing debris. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office denied reports that Israel had agreed to allow heavy machinery into Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday that the government remains committed to securing the release of all hostages. 'Our top priority is the release of the hostages. We will not blink, and we will not back down,' Katz said at a tree-planting ceremony marking the establishment of a new neighborhood in the southern city of Arad. 'From here, I am heading to another meeting with all IDF command units, where the prime minister will also participate. We are preparing to act with full force. If the hostages are not released, we will respond with strength in Gaza and wherever necessary.' The Israeli National Public Diplomacy Directorate issued a directive to government ministers reinforcing the country’s stance on the hostage deal. The directive stated that 'the cease-fire in Gaza is conditional on the deal’s implementation: If Hamas does not release hostages by Saturday afternoon, the IDF will resume intense military operations.' Israeli officials reiterated that Hamas must uphold its commitments under the cease-fire agreement but did not specify how many hostages are expected to be freed in the upcoming phase. The directive also condemned Hamas for its treatment of hostages, saying the recently released captives exhibited signs of severe mistreatment. 'The condition of the three hostages freed last Saturday highlights the inhumane conditions in which they were held and the unbearable cruelty of Hamas,' the statement read. 'Israel takes these disturbing images seriously, recalling dark periods in history, and will not let this stand.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Israeli estimates, 76 hostages remain in Gaza, both alive and deceased. 'The State of Israel has a moral and ethical obligation to bring them all home—every last one,' the statement concluded. The announcement follows a call from U.S. President Donald Trump demanding the immediate release of all remaining hostages, warning that those still in captivity 'do not have much time left.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reinforced Trump's stance, saying, 'If Hamas fails to uphold the agreement on Saturday, we will return to the situation we were in months ago—Hamas will be destroyed, and Israeli forces will move in to resolve the issue.' Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad held talks with a Hamas delegation in Cairo on Wednesday. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, the meeting was described as 'positive,' with both sides reaching an understanding on humanitarian aid provisions necessary to facilitate the completion of the deal. A similar report aired on Egypt’s Al-Ghad channel overnight, claiming Egyptian mediation had brought Hamas and Israel closer to resolving outstanding issues. The report said Hamas confirmed its commitment to the deal, and an agreement was reached to allow additional aid into Gaza, including caravans for displaced residents. The number of aid trucks entering northern Gaza is also expected to increase. Hamas-affiliated Quds Network reported that 801 aid trucks entered Gaza on Wednesday, marking the highest single-day delivery since the cease-fire began. Of those, 231 trucks were directed to northern Gaza, including 139 via the Erez crossing and 92 through Zikim, while the remaining 570 entered through the Kerem Shalom crossing. Under the cease-fire agreement, Israel had committed to allowing 600 aid trucks per day into Gaza, meaning Wednesday’s deliveries exceeded the quota by 201 trucks. Hamas previously claimed that Israeli delays in permitting the entry of shelters, tents, and caravans for displaced Palestinians were among the reasons it temporarily halted the hostage deal. An Egyptian official said Wednesday that the parties were 'close to an agreement' and that Israel had committed to increasing the supply of tents, shelters, and heavy equipment into Gaza. New images released Thursday showed dozens of caravans and tractors waiting at the Rafah crossing, pending approval to enter. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h12owhofkl	2025-02-13T01:42:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/HJlaZrrt1g/HJlaZrrt1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Nationwide payment system failure disrupts transactions across Is...	A widespread malfunction in Israel’s national payment system disrupted transactions across the country on Thursday, forcing many businesses to request cash-only payments. The issue was reported by Automated Bank Services (Shva), the company responsible for Israel’s automated banking and payment infrastructure. 'Our professional teams are investigating the cause of the failure,' the company said in a statement. This is not the first disruption to affect Israel’s payment processing networks. In November, a malfunction at Credit Guard, a clearing service provider for major retail chains, caused widespread payment issues. A month earlier, a Shva system failure impacted businesses relying on servers abroad. Cybersecurity concerns have also played a role in past disruptions. Over the past year, several payment system failures have been linked to cyberattacks, raising questions about the resilience of Israel’s financial infrastructure. Authorities have yet to determine whether the current outage is related to a cyber threat.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1kkjsjfkl	2025-02-13T00:47:39-08:00	
New class of lookouts at Nahal Oz base fight through grief, remem...	Capt. Shahar Azran recognized freed hostages Liri Albag and Naama Levy as her former trainees, abducted from Nahal Oz on October 7; now stationed at Re’im base, she and fellow IDF lookouts continue their mission while mourning fallen comrades and supporting survivors 'These are my girls!' declared Capt. Shahar Azran, 25, of the Northern Brigade’s lookout trainees as she viewed the first footage of Liri Albag and Naama Levy, who were abducted from the Nahal Oz post on October 7. Just two days earlier, alongside Agam Berger, the late Noa Marciano, and the late Shirat Yam Amar, she had awarded them their course completion pins. Even before the full situation was clear, Shahar—with six years of experience on the front—recognized its gravity and headed toward the division base. 'It was hard, but I felt I was needed here, with my experience, knowledge, and support,' she explained. 'The girls were coping with the loss of friends who had been killed or abducted. I, too, lost people along the way, including Capt. Shir Eilat, the operations room officer, and Col. Asaf Hamami, my brigade commander.' After the Nahal Oz operations room was moved to the Re’im base and the lookout trainees subsequently received personal weapons, what happened that morning continues to haunt everyone. 'We deal with it every day, tending to them with the utmost care and consulting professionals,' said Shahar. 'We mainly remind the girls that we are here for them—we listen and embrace them.' The return of the five lookout trainees who had been held captive brought a sense of closure for Shahar. 'I'm being discharged in three weeks, and I knew it would be very hard to be released knowing they were still captive,' she said. 'When they returned, a weight was lifted from our hearts. Still, we didn't know in what condition they'd come back, and we were sensitive about the friends who remain in service. I told them it wasn’t easy for me either—being responsible for signing their training certificates and assigning them to the Nahal Oz base—leaving me wondering if I could have done something differently.' At the massacre at the Nahal Oz base, 15 lookout trainees were killed, and Marciano was abducted and murdered in Hamas captivity. 'We continue the legacy of those we've lost in their spirit,' said Shahar. 'We commemorate their birthdays and share the stories of who they were. On the last Memorial Day, we embarked on a tour in the periphery, stopping at 16 sites—each dedicated to a fallen comrade. Alongside that, we choose to rise again.' In the new operations room at the Re’im base, Cpl. Maayan Monsongo, 19, and Sgt. Maayan Shimon, 20, sit absorbed in their screens, never taking their eyes off the front they oversee. Joining them is Pvt. Talia Ashram, 18, the niece of Shay Ashram, who was murdered in the operations room on October 7. That morning, Cpl. Shimon—who had been in training with Uri Megidish, Marciano, Hadar Cohen, and Mia Vialovo, who was at home reading frantic messages from her comrades—recalled, 'I heard gunshots, there was an assault, they were at our post; I heard screams in Arabic.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The girls who didn’t observe the Sabbath set up their own makeshift operations room and tried to gather information about their friends—who was where, how each was faring, and what was occurring at the base, their second home. 'At first, my mind couldn’t process it; I refused to believe these were the girls I knew,' said Shimon. Reflecting on the first shift after that Sabbath, amid news of friends being killed or abducted, she recalled, 'We understood each other only through glances. We didn’t speak much—it was still hard to process. One moment we could be joyful, and the next, tearful. It’s hard to know that your friends performed their duty, even while reporting on terrorist infiltrations, and yet there were those who disrespected them.' Cpl. Monsongo, 19, from Jerusalem, joined the operations room a few days after the war broke out. 'I was driven to come here. For me, it's an honor to continue the path of those who fought for us,' she said. Having served in the original operations room near the Gaza Strip border, she added, 'We saw the front with our own eyes, met the residents we defended. It profoundly influenced our role.' Sgt. Shimon also recalled the old operations room: 'It used to be a cheerful, bright place. The photos after October 7—burnt and gray—are a far cry from how we remembered it.' One cherished tradition was 'tea time,' a Friday meal that stretched throughout the day, culminating in the evening when the lookout trainees gathered around a table to sing songs about the operations room. 'We stood out in the landscape,' they described themselves. 'It’s hard to miss us, in a good way.' The latest to join the operations room is Pvt. Talia Ashram, 18, from Rehovot, assigned after the loss of her cousin and close friend, Shay Ashram. Initially, when she received her assignment, she considered refusing, but when she realized the date coincided with the day Shay was taken for burial, she saw it as a sign. At the end of her course, she requested to serve in the same operations room where Shay had worked, and today she occupies her position, keeping watch over a front she knows better than anyone. 'It’s both moving and nerve-racking,' she explains. 'The role is not easy, but it carries a deep sense of mission and meaning. I waited for the moment when I could sit in Shay’s position and feel complete. Here, I feel she is with me, watching over me. I am here to stay, relying on myself and the army. They might break our hearts, but they cannot break who we are or the people of Israel—we are stronger than anything.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyfv3f5tkg	2025-02-13T00:34:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/S1N239MKKye/S1N239MKKye_62_127_1054_593_0_small.jpg

After the overthrow of his regime, Bashar Assad and his family fled to the Russian capital and have been staying there in complete secrecy ever since; his son Hafez shares about the escape and the moments leading up to it Information about the refuge of the ousted Assads in Russia is shrouded under complete secrecy. The media is not covering it at all; they are apparently following instructions above. Meanwhile, the new leadership in Syria is demanding the extradition of the dictator who massacred his people. A short video uploaded by Hafez, Assad's eldest son, circulating on social networks has followers trying to geolocate where exactly he is on the streets of Moscow. In the video, Assad Jr. sought to clarify that the accounts in his name on X and Telegram are indeed his. These are the accounts in which he published information in recent days about the last moments before the fall of his father's regime and the family's escape to Moscow, but X removed the long and detailed post in less than an hour and closed the account without an official response. In a video published online on Wednesday, Assad is seen walking in an upscale Moscow neighborhood and clarifying: 'There were questions about the accounts on X and Telegram, and whether they belong to me. I wanted to clarify that they do belong to me and I have no other accounts on any other platform. Hello.' The new video sparked several reactions on social media. This is the younger Assad's first appearance from Moscow, and some users have tried to geolocate where it was filmed and posted possible landmarks on X. Some users claimed that Assad revealed his personal information on Telegram without noticing, but these were not verified. On his Telegram and now-blocked X accounts, Assad described the moments before the family fled Syria. 'There was no plan to leave Damascus, let alone Syria,' he claimed. Assad, whose father had massacred hundreds of thousands of his own people through the course of the war, said: 'Over the past 14 years, Syria has gone through circumstances no less difficult than those that occurred in late November and early December.' Assad said that he had come back to Moscow to complete his doctoral dissertation shortly before the rebel blitz attack that led to the collapse of the regime of his father. Meanwhile, his mother Asma, who is battling leukemia, was in the Russian capital at the time for a bone marrow transplant. He said he had planned to stay in the city to complete paperwork for his degree but returned to Damascus on December 1 due to the worsening situation in Syria. His mother remained in Moscow for treatment, with his sister, Zain Assad, staying by her side.

Hamas willing to release three hostages on Saturday, report says	Terror group yet to issue official statement, but Arabic media report it informed mediators that Saturday's hostage release will proceed amid increased aid deliveries to Gaza Three days after Hamas unilaterally froze the hostage deal, citing alleged Israeli violations, Palestinian sources told Arabic media Thursday that the terrorist group has reaffirmed its commitment to the agreement and plans to proceed with the next hostage release on Saturday. However, Hamas has conditioned the release on Israel ensuring the continued flow of humanitarian aid beyond Saturday. Despite this demand, mediators believe the crisis has effectively been resolved. The reports follow a call from U.S. President Donald Trump for the immediate release of 'all hostages,' warning that those still in captivity 'do not have much time left.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reinforced Trump’s stance, saying Wednesday, 'If Hamas fails to uphold the agreement on Saturday, we will return to the situation we were in months ago—Hamas will be destroyed, and Israeli forces will move in to resolve the issue.' Speaking to Fox News and NewsNation, Rubio accused Hamas of violating the agreement. 'Hamas is in breach. They are at fault,' he said. 'The president is fed up with this trickle of hostage releases—he wants people out now. We saw the condition of those freed last week—they were on the brink of death. They looked terrible, and the president has had enough.' Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar cited sources describing Wednesday’s meeting in Cairo between Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad and a Hamas delegation as 'positive.' The report said agreements were reached to facilitate the deal’s completion, with a focus on humanitarian aid commitments. According to the sources, Egypt proposed a compromise ensuring partial implementation of the humanitarian aid provisions rather than full compliance. 'Everything now depends on Israel’s response to the Egyptian proposal,' the report said. A similar report aired on Egypt’s Al Ghad channel overnight, claiming Cairo had bridged gaps between Hamas and Israel, paving the way for the scheduled hostage release on Saturday. The report said Hamas confirmed its commitment to the deal, and an agreement was reached to allow more aid into Gaza, including caravans for displaced residents. Additionally, the number of aid trucks permitted to enter northern Gaza is set to increase. > Hamas-affiliated Quds Network also reported that the 801 trucks that entered Gaza on Wednesday marked the highest number of aid deliveries since the cease-fire began.

An Egyptian official said Wednesday that the parties were 'close to an agreement' and that Israel had committed to increasing the delivery of tents, shelters and heavy equipment into Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkufqfjtje	2025-02-12T23:06:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/r1gyNt1K1x/r1gyNt1K1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel to deport 3 Jerusalem residents for supporting terror	Interior Minister says those who praise terrorism 'have no place among us'; says he is using new legislation to exercise his authority because the three chose to stand with Israel's enemies in time of war Interior Minister Moshe Arbel said on Wednesday that he intends to exercise his legal authority to deport three Palestsinian residents of east Jerusalem accused of supporting terrorism, pending a hearing. Tasneem Oudeh, Mohammed Abu Helwa, and Zina Barbar are alleged to have expressed support for terrorist organizations and incited violence. Explaining his decision, Arbel told Ynet: 'I have decided to exercise my legal authority to deport three terror supporters—relatives of terrorists—who chose to stand with the enemy during wartime and support attacks on Israeli civilians. Those who incite, praise, and support terrorism have no place among us. I will continue to act decisively against anyone who threatens the safety of Israeli citizens.' In a letter outlining the case against Oudeh, Arbel cited multiple instances of pro-terror activities over the past three years. In one incident, in October 2022, she was arrested alongside her mother at the Temple Mount while wearing a necklace featuring the image of terrorist Ibrahim Nabulsi. In 2024, she allegedly distributed propaganda materials online. Oudeh is the daughter of Barakat Oudeh, who carried out a car-ramming attack on Route 1 on October 30, 2022, injuring five Israeli soldiers. Arbel also informed Abu Helwa, a convicted prisoner, that he is considering his deportation due to his affiliation with Hamas. The minister noted that Abu Helwa was indicted in August 2023 for incitement and supporting a terrorist group. He also hinted that the decision was influenced by the fact that Abu Helwa’s brother carried out a terrorist attack in Israel in October 2023.

Israel seen as likely to attack Iran by midyear, report	Joint Chiefs and DNI report says attacks likely on Fordow, Natanz nuclear facilities; White House National Security Spokesperson says Trump 'prefers negotiating a resolution' but will not wait indefinitely if Iran is not willing to deal U.S. intelligence warns that Israel is likely to launch a preemptive attack on Iran's nuclear program by midyear, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing multiple intelligence reports. Such an attack would set back Iran's nuclear program by weeks or months while escalating tension in the region and risking a wider conflict, according to multiple intelligence reports from the end of the Biden administration and start of the Trump administration, the newspaper reported. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The White House declined to comment. The Post said the Israeli government, CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, told the Post that President Donald Trump 'will not permit Iran to get a nuclear weapon.' 'While he prefers negotiating a resolution to American's long-standing issues with the Iranian regime peacefully, he will not wait indefinitely if Iran isn't willing to deal, and soon,' Hughes told The Post. The most comprehensive of the intelligence reports came in early January and was produced by the intelligence directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Post said. It warned that Israel was likely to attempt an attack on Iran's Fordow and Natanz nuclear facilities. Current and former U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence said Israel has determined its bombing of Iran in October degraded Iran's air defenses and left the country exposed to a follow-on assault, said the Post, which did not name the officials. Iran and Israel engaged in tit-for-tat strikes last year amid wider tensions over Israel's war in Gaza. The intelligence reports envisioned two potential strike options that each would involve the United States providing aerial refueling support and intelligence, the Post said. Trump told Fox News in an interview that aired on Monday he would prefer to make a deal with Iran to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon, saying he also believed Iran would prefer a deal over an armed conflict. > 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of them. I would prefer that not happen,' Trump said. The United States under President Barack Obama and European allies negotiated an agreement with Iran to halt its nuclear program, but Trump in his first term in office, encouraged by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, withdrew the United States from the landmark accord and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran in 2018. Iran has since restarted its nuclear program and is enriching uranium, according to the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryxaixofjx	2025-02-12T19:53:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/18/r1NKX5RxA/r1NKX5RxA_277_0_1885_1061_0_small.jpg

Is the Palestinian Authority really cancelling pay-for-slay payme...	According to Itamar Marcus, founder of Palestinian Media Watch, the PA has made it clear that it is on the verge of total financial collapse Is the Palestinian Authority (PA) truly ending its controversial pay-for-slay program? According to Itamar Marcus, founder of Palestinian Media Watch, the PA has made it clear that it is on the verge of total financial collapse. 'They've said they've loaned billions from their own banks, and they can't loan anymore. They've reached a maximum,' Marcus said. 'The only way they can survive is if Israel stops deducting tax transfers and if the United States and other countries start funding them again.' However, the U.S. cannot provide funds to Hamas due to the Taylor Force Act, which prohibits payments to any individual or organization that supports terrorism. As a result, in order to receive U.S. funding, the PA would have to repeal its pay-for-slay law. At the same time, Marcus explained that for the past 15 years, the Palestinian public has been told that nothing would ever threaten the salaries of terrorists in prison. 'What we're seeing today is that [President Mahmoud Abbas] has canceled the old law. He said that the prisoners and the martyrs’ families will continue to get funding from a new framework,' Marcus said. 'The language he used is intentionally ambiguous so that the families of the terrorists can imagine and believe that they’re going to get the same amount. And the Americans, if they want to, can believe that it’s going to be a normal welfare amount.' But there is a significant difference. 'A Palestinian terrorist who was a murderer and is in jail for 30 years—his family is receiving 12,000 shekels a month, whereas the highest welfare payments are 600 shekels a month,' Marcus said. 'So if Abbas really follows through and replaces these payments with standard welfare, there is going to be a lot of noise and a lot of anger in the Palestinian Authority,' Marcus added. 'We will know very soon what’s really happening based on how the families and the population respond.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ibyjiyyx	2025-02-12T17:58:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/24/B19009FBz6/B19009FBz6_0_111_1300_732_0_small.jpg
How a historic Six-Day War battlefield is keeping the legacy of I...	The 'Adopt a Liberator' initiative aims to preserve and honor the legacy of those who fought for Jerusalem’s reunification while creating an inspiring educational asset for future generations ILTV was joined in the studio by Alon Wald, head of operations for Ammunition Hill, the historic battle site from the Six-Day War that is being transformed into a modern educational center. Wald discussed an exciting initiative called 'Adopt a Liberator,' supported by Jewish National Fund-USA. This initiative aims to preserve and honor the legacy of those who fought for Jerusalem’s reunification while creating an inspiring educational asset for future generations. ILTV: Why is Ammunition Hill important for telling this story and preserving the legacy? Wald: Ammunition Hill is a battlefield intact, exactly as it was 57 years ago when the paratroopers of the IDF stormed inside, facing one of the toughest battles the paratroopers ever faced during the 77 years of our existence. Against all odds, outnumbered, with no artillery support, no intelligence, no aerial support, they came out victorious, and it's considered to be the pivotal battle that paved the way for the reunification of Jerusalem. The bereaved families decided not to allow it to be demolished, and it evolved to become an educational asset. ILTV: Tell us about the brave individuals who fought on Ammunition Hill and how this initiative is honoring their legacy. Wald: They are part of an amazing generation. They fought, they won, they united Jerusalem. But as far as we are concerned, they became our adopted fathers. This amazing generation literally adopted us, the kids of Ammunition Hill. I lost my father there, 57 years ago, without being asked, when all of the nation was marveling at the reunification of Jerusalem, they reached out to our mothers, to our families, making a vow that lasted. Today, I lost my father, but I have gained 10 amazing idol figures. All through the years, they gave us the core values they stood for, not only as soldiers, but as human beings. We are losing them on a yearly basis. So we decided to reach out over the last four years, with the blessing and the support of Jewish National Fund-USA, urging students all over Israel to adopt a liberator that lives in their proximity. Three of these liberators are members of the kibbutz movement in the Gaza envelope. They were supposed to be involved in this initiative soon after Sukkot, on October 23. But they were abducted, and the kids waited for them for more than a year. Eventually, all three of them—liberators of Jerusalem, brave fighters, warriors—lost their lives in the tunnels where they were murdered by Hamas. Normally, we adopt a liberator, but in their absence, we decided not to give up and to preserve the legacy. With the widows, with the family members, the kids are deeply engaged in this project, and it's unbelievable because they are able to study their past, be engaged, and be committed. They will help us preserve the legacy of these amazing grandfathers who lost their lives. We owe them so much. Even as we speak, these kids are recording their memories, the memories of the families, and scanning everything the families give them. Eventually, everything will be brought back to Ammunition Hill for eternal preservation. ILTV: How can others get involved? Wald: Reach out to Ammunition Hill. Every high school principal can choose one class. We have enough. We have sufficient funds from JNF-USA because they realize that what we do means so much to these kids who study their past. We will give them everything they need to preserve the legacy of a local talent, a local grandfather. ILTV: What is your long-term vision for preserving the site? Wald: We're talking about preserving the legacy. The widest common denominator of core values will stand for bravery, leadership, and courage. These are values that we can share with kids and tell them: you can be brave tomorrow morning without sacrificing your life, without going to any war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjjzcaqtyl	2025-02-12T17:38:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/ByklsR5Y1x/ByklsR5Y1x_0_33_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Delegation of Brazilian officials tours Israel amid rising global...	The diplomats visited locations related to the October 7 attacks, including the Nova Music Festival memorial site, hard-hit kibbutzim in the south, and Yad Vashem In an incredible display of solidarity, a group of Brazilian diplomats and congress members visited Israel as part of a delegation organized by Nechama and Hatzalah. The mission of this delegation was to bolster advocacy against antisemitism and strengthen the bond between Israel and the diaspora. Led by Nechama and Hatzalah’s chairman, Moshiko Moskowitz, and Brazilian philanthropist Mrs. Alessandra Safra, the delegation embarked on a meaningful journey, engaging in discussions on profoundly relevant topics while touring significant sites. The diplomats visited locations related to the October 7 attacks, including the Nova Music Festival memorial site, hard-hit kibbutzim in the south, and Yad Vashem. In addition, the delegation toured Israel’s Knesset and met with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana. Amid growing global concerns about antisemitism, Nechama and Hatzalah took a break from their many charitable activities in Israel—such as caring for evacuees and supporting soldiers on the battlefield—to focus on strengthening ties between Israel and the diaspora. The visit reinforced the delegation’s commitment to promoting tolerance, mutual understanding, and a more secure future for Jewish communities worldwide.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hypgza5tyx	2025-02-12T17:05:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/Bk118XCqF1l/Bk118XCqF1l_370_0_1636_921_0_small.jpg
Hamas will not free all hostages now, calls for world-wide marche...	Senior Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri says Trump's threats mean nothing and do not scare them, and that they are committed to deal as it was agreed Hamas on Wednesday said it would not release all of the Israeli hostages on Saturday and called for three days of solidarity marches around the world in protest of U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to remove Palestinians from Gaza in order to rebuild it. 'We call our masses, our nation, and free people around the world in a global movement against the plans to uproot our Palestinian people, in the coming Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to march against the plan of the occupation and its supporters,' Hamas said in a statement. Senior spokesman for Hamas Sami Abu Zuhri told Al Jazeera the terror group had no intention of releasing all of the hostages on Saturday. 'Trump's announcement created tension and led to Israel avoiding its commitments to the deal,' he said adding that threats of a renewed war in Gaza if the hostages were not freed, made by Defense Minister Israel Katz were silly and banal. 'Trump's threats mean nothing and do not scare us,' he said. 'Egypt and Qatar are making great efforts to push Israel to meet its obligations and we are pleased with the official position of Arab states who reject the plan to uproot Palestinians. The administration of Gaza is a Palestinian affair and we will not be dictated to. We are committed to the deal as it was agreed and will not be releasing all of the prisoners next Saturday.'

Abu Zuhri’s remarks come amid growing optimism from both Hamas and the mediating countries, Qatar and Egypt, which are working to find a compromise to get the deal back on track. Another senior Hamas official said 'positive signals' had been received, while an Egyptian source stated that the parties were 'close to an agreement.' According to the source, Israel has committed to delivering more tents, shelters, and heavy equipment to Gaza.

Message from captivity provides renewed optimism for Eitan Mor's ...	After receiving a sign of life from his son Father Tzvika Mor recounts silence and missed opportunities, as released hostages now provide updates on their loved ones’ conditions A sign of life from an additional captive—not included on the list scheduled for release in the first phase of the hostage deal—has been received from captive Eitan Mor hours after his father told ynet in an interview that he had been given no new information about his son's condition from hostages that were released. 'We should have blown up the deal at the first breach,' Mor said. It seems to me that on Saturday the three hostages will be released; then will Israel break the deal? No. I think Hamas does not want to get too entangled with Trump—they’re driving us crazy, and in the end, they will do what is necessary.' Mor said an opportunity was lost. 'We should have shown Hamas that we are not suckers. Shut off the water, the trucks—everything—and Hamas would have chased after us. But we did not do that. We delayed and waited for the uncle from America to tell us what needed to be done—and in doing so, we lost our authority here.' Earlier on Wednesday evening, Hagai Angerst, the father of the captured soldier Matan Angerst, said that his family received a sign of life from him through hostages who were released in the most recent rounds. Reports that an armored soldier is alive—but is being held injured under harsh conditions—were received half a year after he was seen in a psychological terror video found in Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a Ynet studio broadcast on Wednesday morning, the aunt of hostage Yosef Haim Ohana reported for the first time that a sign of life was also received from him. 'We have clear evidence that he is alive,' said Aunt Hana Mastorov. 'There are signs of life indicating that he is alive.' Since the massacre on October, families of hostages have tended to hide receiving signs of life from their loved ones—mainly due to requests from security officials who believed that revealing such information might endanger those held in captivity. Even the documentation with signs of life published by Hamas, seemingly dictated to the hostages as to what to say, was not always made public at the request of the families. However, since the beginning of the current deal, a little over three weeks ago, several families have received updates with signs of life from hostages still held by Hamas—understanding that only in this way can they hope to bring everyone home. Unlike the Hamas documentation that included signs of life, this time the updates came through hostages released as part of the deal, who shared with their families information about the condition of their loved ones in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ep2uqt1e	2025-02-12T13:04:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/16/SJnMLS5Za/SJnMLS5Za_2_20_319_180_0_small.jpg

Trump says discussed ending Ukraine war with Putin, Zelensky; 'No...	President praises Russian counterpart in social media post says the leaders agreed to work together and conduct visits; Zelensky says conversation with US president 'highly significant' U.S. President Donald Trump and Russin President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone on Wednesday for the first time since Trump took office. The leaders discussed the need to end the war in Ukraine among other topics. Trump upended three years of U.S. policy towardUkraine, saying that he and theRussian President had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the warfollowing a dramatic prisoner swap. Trump said in a social media post that he and Putin had a lengthy phone call during which they committed to 'work together, very closely' to bring the conflict to an end. 'Deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, 'COMMON SENSE.' We both believe very strongly in it. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations,' Trump said in his Truth Social post. He added that he and Putin agreed to work closely together, including reciprocal visits. Trump concluded by noting that millions have already perished in a war that never should have started if a proper leader had been in charge from the beginning—'but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost!' He expressed his gratitude to President Putin for his time and effort during the call and for yesterday securing the release of American prisoner Mark Fogel. 'I believe this initiative will lead to a successful conclusion, and I hope it happens very soon,' he wrote. Trump then called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 'The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace.' Trump said after the call. 'It’s time to end this absurd war, which has caused enormous and entirely unnecessary death and destruction. May God bless the Russians and the Ukrainians!' Zelensky described his conversation with Trump as 'highly significant' and said that the American president updated him on his call with Putin, noting, 'We discussed opportunities for peace and agreed to maintain contact and schedule further meetings.' Trump's conversation with Putin came one day after Moscow unexpectedly released American prisoner Marc Fogel from a Russian jail, allowing him to return to the United States with Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. The surprising deal was reached following secret negotiations conducted by Witkoff on Trump’s behalf and was seen as a signal of Putin’s desire to rebuild trust with the United States and reach agreements. National Security Advisor Mike Wallace said last night that the prisoner swap was 'a demonstration of goodwill on the part of the Russians and a sign that we are moving in the right direction toward ending the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.' Fogel, 63—a history teacher—was arrested in Russia in 2021 on drug charges after entering the country with medical marijuana. In 2023, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Initially, the Biden administration refrained from describing Fogel as having been wrongfully detained, thereby marking him as a candidate for a prisoner exchange like other American detainees; later, he was designated as such, and ultimately, the Trump administration completed the deal. It was also revealed on Wednesday that in exchange for Fogel’s release, the United States freed a Russian citizen named Alexander Vinnik, head of a cybercrime network, who was arrested in Greece in 2017 and subsequently extradited to U.S. authorities. In May last year, Vinnik pleaded guilty and was convicted in connection with money laundering. U.S. authorities claim that Vinik operated cryptocurrency exchange services, allegedly transferring around $4 billion derived from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Reuters also reported on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was involved in discussions regarding Fogel’s release—raising questions as to whether this indicates a broader, multi-layered deal with further developments to be announced later. During his campaign, Trump had promised that if elected he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine 'within 24 hours.' He and many Republicans have criticized the enormous sums Washington pays in military aid to Kyiv as wasteful, suggesting that Ukraine might have to make painful concessions, including relinquishing vast territories captured over the past 11 years by Putin’s forces. In an interview with Fox News earlier this week, Trump even entertained the possibility that Ukraine might one day rejoin Russia, echoing the days of the Soviet Union. In a meeting with senior NATO officials in Brussels on Wednesday, Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared that while the United States aims to see Ukraine continue as an independent state, its accession to NATO—an idea that was among Putin’s justifications for his deep invasion of Ukraine in February 2022—is an 'unrealistic aspiration.' Hegseth further asserted that the goal of Ukraine’s supporters to reclaim all territories lost since 2014 is 'an illusion,' sending a clear signal to Kyiv that the Trump administration would not support Zelensky’s demand that Moscow return all the lands it captured, which comprise roughly one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h12d0000ctje	2025-02-12T11:04:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/S1UteWSmyx/S1UteWSmyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

I wasn’t fired because I was a bad defense minister'	Former defense minister Yoav Gallant breaks his silence, accusing politicians of leaking classified details to derail hostage deal talks with Hamas. He defends his handling of the war in the face of an international arrest warrant against him. 'I am proud to be accused of defending the State of Israel': part two of the full interview Part Three 'I wasn’t fired because I was a bad defense minister' The hostages, Gaza’s future, the destruction of the Strip As defense minister, Gallant maintained constant contact with the families of the hostages. He watches the release of the hostages in the latest deal on television. 'I followed it with deep emotion. It was incredibly moving for me. From the very beginning of the war, I made a tremendous effort to ensure that the female soldiers were first classified as women, and only then as soldiers.' This deal was essentially the same one the security establishment had put forward in the spring of 2024. Its core remained unchanged: there was no commitment to halting the war, only a partial release, and Israel would withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor. 'This formula was presented in April. It was discussed in a War Cabinet meeting where a unanimous decision was made. A mandate was given to shape the negotiations: the deal aimed for the release of 33 hostages but could go as low as 18 as a minimum threshold. There was complete consensus among the security establishment and all the ministers. The prime minister accepted it. This was midday, during Passover, 2023.' Then, something highly unusual happened. 'A few hours later, in the evening, a full Cabinet meeting was held. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich came in and said, ‘If there’s a deal for 18, we will leave the government.’ He wasn’t even supposed to know about it. The ministers had no idea what he was talking about.' Gallant is making a remarkable accusation. The gravity of this moment is crucial. Israel had set a confidential minimum position for negotiations: no deal would proceed without at least 18 hostages being released. This was a state secret—no one was supposed to know it, for obvious reasons, to prevent Hamas from using it as their final demand. Yet within hours of this minimum number being set in a closed forum, it was leaked to the finance minister, who then declared it openly in a full Cabinet meeting. Effectively the equivalent of announcing it on the Knesset floor. 'A few hours later, the number 18 was published in the media. This happened in the middle of negotiations between Shin Bet representatives and the Egyptians. I received reports that, following our decision regarding the Netzarim Corridor and the 33-hostage target, the Egyptians said there was a breakthrough, and progress was possible. A day or two later, we got word that Hamas told the mediators: ‘They’re talking to us about 33, but the Israeli media reported 18—so why agree to 33 when we can get a deal for less?’ And the whole deal fell apart. The next time it was revived was at the end of May, in President Biden’s speech.' But what happened with this leak? 'I don’t know.' Have you spoken to the prime minister about this? 'Yes. I don’t want to elaborate.' Gallant may not want to elaborate, but reports indicate that Netanyahu called him, shaken—whether genuinely or not is debated—and informed him that 'everything was ruined' now that the details had leaked to the media. As a result, Netanyahu claimed, the negotiation team’s mandate would have to be revised. Gallant responded by demanding that Benny Gantz be brought onto the call, making it clear that if Netanyahu was backtracking, the issue would need to be brought back to a vote in the War Cabinet. Netanyahu backed down. The security establishment suspected that Netanyahu’s own people had leaked the minimum threshold to Smotrich to sabotage the deal. Washington believed the same. 'This deal could have been completed even after Biden’s speech. On July 3, Hamas accepted the deal reached. I told the hostage families: ‘The conditions are in place.’ And I believe the conditions were already in place at that point. But we didn’t respond to Hamas. In fact, we didn’t respond at all until July 28. On that day, the issue of the Philadelphi Corridor was added (as an Israeli condition). I told Netanyahu: ‘If Hamas has given us a positive answer, and we’re about to respond with a rejection, at least send the response the next day. Why waste three weeks? Why drag this out? We need to move fast.’ 'In reality, we could have secured the same deal with more hostages at a lower cost. An additional 110 prisoners sentenced to life were later included—who were not even part of the discussions at that time. What you see today is essentially the same as what was on the table in July.' 'Every draft year, a quarter of Jewish 18-year-olds—25%—are ultra-Orthodox. One in four. We cannot afford not to draft them, or at least the vast majority of them. That is what I fought for, because of the war. This is no longer just a social necessity; it has become a national necessity. And on top of that, there was no legislation in place for exempting them. Now, that’s the principle of the matter. As for why I was fired—ask the prime minister. But I can tell you for certain: I wasn’t fired because I was a bad defense minister.' Meanwhile, hostages died. Why didn’t this deal happen? 'It was explicitly stated—by Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. They dragged the Cabinet in their direction. And in my view, that was a mistake. I remind you that in August, there was a vote on the Philadelphi Corridor (making Israel's presence there a condition to any deal, n.e), and I was in the minority. I voted against making it a condition, while everyone else voted in favor. I told them: ‘Either go back to my proposal, or we will lose the hostages.’' What you’re saying is serious. You’re saying that hostages died because of political maneuvering by Smotrich, Ben-Gvir and Netanyahu’s capitulation to them. 'You can draw your own conclusions. I am telling you as clearly as possible: this deal is nearly identical to the one that was on the table before. I have no expectations from Hamas. These are vile murderers who must all be eliminated—that has been my mission in life since 1987 when Hamas was founded. Certainly in the past two years as defense minister. But I do have expectations from the government of Israel. In my view, bringing the hostages home is a supreme national and moral duty. It is part of Israel’s legacy, it is central to the IDF’s code of ethics and it is an explicit war objective.' The question remains—did the Israeli government, which you were part of, do everything it could to bring the hostages home? 'I do not believe that the government of Israel did everything it could to bring the hostages home.' × × × How do you respond to the perception that Hamas emerged victorious from the hostage deal—not just because they survived, but because of the images of thousands of Hamas supporters celebrating in Gaza, even as much of the enclave lay in ruins and many thousands had been killed? 'Hamas lost 20,000 fighters. Its infrastructure was dismantled—its production lines, its tunnels and more. But to replace a regime, you need an alternative. If you keep plowing the land without planting anything, nothing new will grow.' Netanyahu kept saying we were on the verge of 'total victory.' But you yourself said, and I quote: 'Hamas is collapsing from within,' 'Hamas is a dismantled organization,' 'Hamas has lost control, has no way to rearm,' 'Hamas’ Gaza station isn’t answering,' 'There’s a bidding war over who will rule Gaza.' Yet, despite all that, Hamas still controls Gaza—even without the deal, that was the reality. 'You need to understand something. Military achievement is not the same as victory. Military victory is a component of victory, but true victory requires a political process. And that process never happened. I've been dealing with this for over a year. On October 26, 2023, I presented a plan that outlined a second phase in Gaza: continuing military operations while simultaneously building an alternative to Hamas rule. The plan included an implementation framework—forces made up of non-Hamas Palestinians, observers from Arab countries and private companies for security. I personally traveled to meet Arab leaders to discuss this. The government refused. They wouldn’t allow it to move forward. And the result is that we got stuck on the political front. 'Now, if you have 5,000 or 10,000 terrorists who still have uniforms—even if they don’t have rockets—they can put on a good show for the media. I don’t underestimate them. And if we allow them to grow, they will rearm.' Some argue that a non-Hamas government in Gaza was never realistic. The current line from Netanyahu’s camp is that the failure was the military’s fault—IDF leadership chose repeated raids instead of holding and clearing territory, leaving Israel with no choice but to make a deal. 'Netanyahu thought the same way I did—but only in private meetings, where Smotrich and Ben-Gvir weren’t present. He doesn’t want to control Gaza in a military occupation. Anyone who wants military rule in Gaza is actually saying, ‘We will lose hundreds of soldiers, and after that, we’ll withdraw because we’re not staying there forever.’ The truth is, if you don’t want to develop an alternative governance in Gaza, then what you’re really saying is: you prefer Hamas to rule. 'Israel will not rebuild settlements in Gaza, no matter how much Smotrich and Ben-Gvir push for it—they know it won’t happen. Netanyahu understands that. Military rule isn’t freedom of action for the IDF. Freedom of action is being able to kill who needs to be killed and strike who needs to be struck. Military rule means running daily life—and that should be done by Palestinians, not Israelis. IDF soldiers, and certainly Israeli civilians, should not remain there forever. We have no business being there. Gaza isn’t Jerusalem, and it’s not Mount Hermon. Unfortunately, whether this war lasts a short or long time, they—Smotrich and Ben-Gvir—will eventually come around to my position. But I don’t want to lose our best soldiers over it along the way.' If in January 2025, Israel returned to the same hostage deal that was on the table in May 2024, and in the meantime, you—the security establishment —dismantled Iran’s 'axis of resistance,' what does that say about Israeli success in Gaza? 'In order to replace a regime, plowing the ground isn’t enough. You have to allow something new to grow there. But because anything new would involve Palestinians that nobody likes—including me—the result was that we didn’t allow it to happen. That left us with only two choices: Hamas or Israel. And once you make it Hamas vs. Israel, the moment you leave for even 42 days (for the cease-fire), Hamas regrows.' Cabinet ministers have said Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi endured unprecedented humiliation in meetings, long before calls for his resignation intensified. 'The chief of staff is a courageous, composed, calculating and highly decisive leader. And he operated under incredibly difficult conditions. First, because he was fighting around the clock. Second, because—living in this country—you saw the political attacks against him, something that never happened before in Israeli wars. 'From my conversations with him, I knew that the moment the next hostage deal was reached, he would step down. We didn’t know when the deal would happen, but in our discussions, it was clear that was his plan. I believe he chose the right moment.' And what about accusations that the IDF General Staff, and Halevi in particular, were not aggressive enough? 'Where were all these critics on October 11, when we proposed the most aggressive operation of all? Where were they then?' × × × Gallant’s next dismissal came as no surprise, just a week after a stunningly successful Air Force strike in Iran. It was clear that Netanyahu was moving full speed ahead with his plan—especially due to pressure from the ultra-Orthodox parties as to the exemption law they were demanding. 'On a personal level, there were no issues,' Gallant says. 'I can work with the prime minister. Every major decision in this war, we made together. We had disagreements on fundamental issues. I believed that since the hostages' lives were hanging by a thread, we needed to act as quickly as possible. He did not agree with me on that. The second issue was everything related to the endgame in Gaza.' The final straw for Netanyahu, almost without a doubt, was the military draft. The ultra-Orthodox parties had threatened—and continue to threaten—to bring down Netanyahu’s government over the issue, and Gallant refused to sign off on a law that would allow wholesale draft exemptions to continue. He has no regrets. 'Look at reality for a moment. We are at war. Hundreds of soldiers have been killed, thousands wounded—many of whom will never return to service. We’ve lost the equivalent of two infantry brigades in sheer numbers. We need to replenish that. There are three ways to do it. One is extending mandatory service, which I recommended a year ago—to 36 months. The second is extending reserve duty, which is already happening automatically. And the third is drafting additional populations. Now, I want you to understand the situation. Every draft year, a quarter of Jewish 18-year-olds—25%—are ultra-Orthodox. One in four. We cannot afford not to draft them, or at least the vast majority of them. That is what I fought for, because of the war. This is no longer just a social necessity; it has become a national necessity. And on top of that, there was no legislation in place for exempting them. Now, that’s the principle of the matter. As for why I was fired—ask the prime minister. But I can tell you for certain: I wasn’t fired because I was a bad defense minister.' You are constantly attacked from within your own party. Likud MK Nissim Vaturi said about you that 'Gallant and Gantz are kissing.' Minister David Amsalem claimed your conduct 'undermined Israel’s security.' 'I won’t respond to every person who says this or that. I acted according to my priorities: first, the State of Israel. After that, the IDF and the security agencies. And only after that—everything else, including myself. That’s how I have always worked, that’s how I conducted myself in this war. And I was willing to pay the price for it. What mattered to me was winning the war. And for 13 straight months, 24/7, as defense minister—I did just that. I managed this war. All paths led to me.' × × × Since leaving office, Gallant has traveled to the U.S. twice for personal trips, flying on regular commercial flights—flights that, due to a technical issue, could easily be rerouted to Spain or Portugal, where he would face a high risk of arrest under the International Criminal Court’s warrant, issued on allegations of genocide in Gaza. Yet he continues to travel as usual. According to him, military leaders around the world praise Israel’s conduct in the war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I have personal ties with senior officials in democratic governments—defense ministers, leaders, chiefs of staff. What I hear is universal praise—for Israel’s military capabilities, for the IDF’s ethics under the most difficult conditions. General David Petraeus, an authority on modern warfare, gave me a book he wrote about wars from 1945 to today. He told me, ‘I regret writing this book before the war, because this is the most brilliant military campaign since World War II. Nothing like this has ever happened before. What you achieved here is unprecedented. And you fought under the toughest conditions possible—against an enemy embedded underground, among civilians and so on.’' Aren’t you afraid of being arrested abroad because of the Hague warrant? 'I am proud to be accused of defending the State of Israel. In the early days after October 7, I coined the phrase that this was the most devastating day for the Jewish people since World War II. Leaders and officials from around the world came to me, and I told them: 2023 is not 1943. The Jewish people now have the ability to defend themselves, and I was responsible for that—and I did it. That is what I did, and I am proud of it. Thank God, unlike my grandparents and their parents before them, we have a strong army.' You've seen the destruction in Gaza, the images of many dead civilians. There is no doubt that thousands upon thousands were killed. Consider what we know about hostages who were mistakenly killed by the IDF—doesn’t that indicate what might have happened across Gaza? 'In war, mistakes are made—just like in everything else. The difference is that in war, mistakes come with heavy costs. In the end, decisions are in the hands of commanders at different levels, all of whom did their best. And yes, mistakes were made. We don’t need proof of that—we know it happens. I believe our mistakes were smaller than those of other armies, but they exist, and the consequences are always tragic. I deeply regret that. I never wanted to harm a single Palestinian civilian. And I wasn’t alone in that. The chief of staff and many others worked tirelessly to provide humanitarian aid wherever possible.' At the start of the war, you declared: 'I have ordered a complete siege on Gaza—no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.' But then you worked to supply those things. Where do you actually stand, Yoav Gallant—on providing aid or withholding it? 'There were different phases at the beginning of the war. Early on, it became clear that cutting off fuel wouldn’t destroy Hamas' tunnel electricity supply—other things would collapse first. After the initial stage, we shifted to a strategy dictated by necessity. First, we needed humanitarian aid to enable our military operations. And second, there was a practical reality: without allowing humanitarian aid in, there would be no resupply (military ammunition from the U.S.)—not for Gaza, but for us. Everyone understood that—especially the prime minister and me.' × × × He remains optimistic about the future. 'First and foremost, I believe in the eternity of Israel. Secondly, I believe in the resilience of Israeli society—we will always find solutions, even if we veer off course at times. I thought about this even in the darkest hours of October 7. I draw great strength from the Israeli public’s ability to endure and overcome. And I believe that whether it’s our struggle for democracy, our national narrative or any other challenge, we will stabilize things and fix what needs to be fixed.' Do you intend to run for prime minister? 'I am a soldier of the state. The State of Israel is my life’s work—I have dedicated my life to it. As long as I can help, contribute and lead, I will do so. Beyond that, there are no elections right now. It’s not on the agenda.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bj61vb9y1x	2025-02-12T10:23:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/Bycrc9NzYye/Bycrc9NzYye_1_265_852_480_0_small.jpg

Mediators push to save ceasefire, Egypt to unveil plan to rebuild...	Qatar and Egypt step up their diplomatic efforts as Hamas alleges Israeli violations; Cairo source warns Israeli-American pressure may force military action if Hamas does not meet its commitments by Saturday’s deadline Scrambling to rescue the ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, Qatar and Egypt have intensified their diplomatic push, urging Gaza factions—presumably Hamas—to honor their commitments. In a conversation with Egypt’s 'Al-Qahira Al-Akhbariya' on Wednesday, a Cairo source warned that Hamas’ decision on Monday to postpone Saturday’s scheduled phase of hostage releases has thrown the entire agreement into disarray. The source explained that both Qatar and Egypt are working to preserve the accord and avert any resurgence of violence, pointing to mounting Israeli-American pressure to resume military operations should the hostages remain in captivity by the imposed Saturday noon deadline. In an unexpected turn, President Trump called on Israel to scrap the deal entirely, saying 'all hell will break loose' if every hostage was not released by Saturday afternoon. On Wednesday, Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East repeated the president's threats that if hostages were not freed by Saturday at 12, 'there's going to be a big problem.' Prime Minister Netanyahu issued an ambiguous statement that could be seen as contradictory, after the security cabinet meeting on Tuesday. While he affirmed Israel’s support for the deadline, he failed to clarify whether all hostages—or merely the three slated for release in the sixth phase—were to be freed immediately. A political insider later suggested the demand extends to all nine remaining hostages from the first phase, though a compromise might see only three released on Saturday, with the remainder following swiftly thereafter. Expressing personal skepticism last night, Trump remarked during a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan, 'Personally, I don’t think they’ll meet the deadline. I think they want to act tough.' Meanwhile, IDF has raised its level of readiness in the south by mobilizing reserve units in anticipation of any potential escalation. These comments from the Egyptian source came just hours after a Hamas delegation—headed by Gaza leader Khalil al-Hayya, who has not been in Gaza since the conflict began—arrived in Cairo to discuss preserving the fragile agreement. A Hamas official later informed Reuters that diplomatic efforts by Egypt and Qatar are being redoubled, with fewer than three days remaining before Trump’s ultimatum expires. On its Al-Aqsa channel, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem insisted that 'intense discussions are underway with mediating countries to compel Israel to fully implement the Gaza ceasefire agreement.' Despite reaffirming its commitment to the pact, Hamas reiterated its threat to withhold hostage releases on Saturday, warning that any delays would be solely Israel’s responsibility, as it continues to violate the deal’s terms. Hamas has also accused Israel of delaying humanitarian aid and the provision of refugee tents—a charge that Israel strongly denies. The United Nations has confirmed a significant increase in aid since the ceasefire took effect, though it also noted that the support remains insufficient for Gaza’s beleaguered population. Many speculate that Hamas’ dramatic announcement to delay the Saturday phase may be partly driven by President Trump’s insistence on a depopulation strategy for Gaza—a policy reportedly endorsed by Netanyahu—and partly by the stalled negotiations for the deal’s second phase. Although Israel dispatched a delegation to Doha earlier this week, reports indicate its sole role was to observe rather than negotiate. Following Hamas’ announcement on Monday and a subsequent meeting of Israel’s Security Cabinet, Netanyahu declared a suspension of second-phase talks, which had scarcely begun. Egypt's idea for Gaza Cairo unveiled the first details of its alternative strategy for Gaza’s reconstruction. Notably, the King of Jordan himself urged Trump to delay its disclosure during their meeting. In an interview with Qatar’s Al-Arabi channel, an Egyptian source explained Cairo was offering a blueprint to rebuild Gaza over the next three to five years without displacing its residents. The plan included two phases: first, the removal of rubble, followed by the systematic construction of new residential complexes. According to the source, the reconstruction effort will start in Rafah and the southern areas of the Strip before extending northward. He added that the comprehensive strategy for rebuilding Gaza would involve the collaborative efforts of Arab states, the European Union, and the United Nations, with additional details expected to emerge next week in a summit meeting of the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ahead of the Arab summit scheduled to take place in Cairo later this month. Amid these high-stakes maneuvers, pressure was also building internally among Gazans, many of whom were desperate for a path to reconstruction. 'We barely started believing in the ceasefire,' said Rafah resident Lofti Abu Taha to Reuters, emphasizing that 'the people are suffering—they are the true victims.' This deep-seated disillusionment resonates in Israel as well, where some experts remain cautiously optimistic that a resolution might be reached to secure the hostages’ release on Saturday. Notably, Hamas argued that it publicized its threat well in advance precisely to give mediators ample time to find a diplomatic solution. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the Knesset, the debate raged as opposition leader Yair Lapid introduced an urgent proposal concerning the hostage deal. Representing the government, Minister Gila Gamliel offered only nebulous assurances, expressing hope that by 12 PM on Saturday 'all the hostages will return.' She dismissed critics who accused the deal of being sabotaged earlier, asserting bluntly, 'Prime Minister Netanyahu has worked tirelessly for the hostages’ release; the only impediment has been Hamas.' Lapid, in a scathing rebuke of Netanyahu’s handling of the crisis, urged lawmakers to consider the profound emotional trauma inflicted on hostage families—subjected to contradictory messages—and warned that a return to conflict would likely prove fatal for the hostages, as Hamas appears to have no incentive to let them live. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjm1nnqykl	2025-02-12T08:38:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/H19xR4qKyl/H19xR4qKyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Accounts from released hostages report kidnapped IDF soldier wounded, held under difficult condition; 'We have seen the images of horror, and we expect Netanyahu to advance the next phase of the deal as soon as possible,' father says Hagai Angrest, the father of kidnapped soldier Matan Angrest, said Wednesday afternoon that his family had received a sign of life from him through hostages recently released in the latest prisoner exchanges. The accounts confirm that the armored corps soldier is alive but being held wounded under difficult conditions. This news comes six months after he was last seen in a recording from Gaza. 'We heard from the returning hostages that our beloved son Matan is alive. It was deeply moving for us,' said Angrest. 'It’s time to bring him home—along with all the others—without delay. We expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to advance the next phase of the deal as soon as possible. We all saw the harrowing images on Saturday—scenes of horror in 2025, right here in Israel.

'Hamas is responsible for crimes against humanity, but it is up to Netanyahu and the government to put an end to this nightmare,' Angrest continued.

Israel-Lebanon cese-fire to be extended past month of Ramadan, re...	Lebanon official denies Saudi Channel report; IDF want to hold on to 5 key hills , a demand Lebanese President rejects; International mediators and US envoy Morgan Ortagus prepare efforts to resolve the border dispute Israel and Lebanon agreed to extend the cease-fire agreement signed to end the fighting with Hezbollah, until after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at the end of March, Saudi Arabian al-Hadath channel reported on Wednesday. A Lebanese official denied the report. According to the channel, Israel will maitain troops presence in certain areas, mostly in the eastern sector. Sources told the channel that Hezbollah-allie Lebanon's parliamentary speaker Nabih Berry agreed to the entention and Israel agreed to leave South Lebanon gradully in the coming days but did not agree to end targeted strikes against Hezbollah terrorists. Earlier, Lebanese media outlets said Israel wanted to hold on to five strategic points on Lebanese territory until the end of the month. Al-Awida, Al-Hamamas, Al-Aziah, Al-Labuna, and Jabal Balat offer strategic control over the region. According to The Independent in Arabic, holding these positions would enable the IDF to monitor movements and cut off critical roads connecting Lebanese border towns. The reports expresses concern that the ceasefire extension might allow Israel to bolster its hold on these key security points. Reuters quoted a Lebanese source and a foreign diplomat on Wednesday who said the IDF has formally requested permission to remain at the five sites. Lebanese broadcaster LBCI reported this request was submitted to the oversight committee overseeing the ceasefire and Resolution 1701. LBCI further said Lebanon rejected the request, while Al Jazeera quoted President Joseph Aoun demanding, 'Israel must complete its withdrawal from Lebanon by the deadline of February 18.' Lebanese channel Al-Jadeed later reported that Lebanon not only rejects the request to extend the ceasefire in these areas but is also calling for the deployment of international forces—or a combined operation by the Lebanese Army and the oversight committee—at the five points along the border where IDF seeks to remain. Military expert Akram Sarawi, speaking to The Independent in Arabic, described the five locations as commanding vistas over vast areas of Lebanon, effectively serving as military command posts. He argued that Israel’s persistence in these areas is driven by broader political objectives, linking its presence with a push to disarm Hezbollah north of the Litani River. Sarawi noted these hills are seen as forming a strategic defense line for Israeli communities, further justifying, in Israel’s view, continued control to secure their citizens. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another source suggested Israel’s aim is to prevent residents from returning to the southern border, fearing that repopulation could provide a foundation for Hezbollah support. Oversight committee meeting delayed The Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that the oversight committee meeting on the ceasefire agreement—originally scheduled to be held tomorrow in Ras al-Naqoura—has been postponed until Friday. The delay is intended to allow for further consultations regarding the future of the ceasefire. The meeting is expected to deal with a proposal to deploy international forces at the five key points, with one French proposal suggesting a mission led by French troops. However, Lebanon maintains no adjustments can be made to UNIFIL’s mandate without the agreement of both the Lebanese Army and international forces on the deployment mechanism. Sources further explained that introducing American or French military personnel along the Lebanese border would serve Israel’s interests. They added that the oversight committee appears to be leveraging this issue to pressure Lebanon into accepting Israel’s operational demands in return for international support for the country’s reconstruction efforts. U.S. envoy’s upcoming visit These discussions occur as Lebanese reports indicate an imminent visit by Morgan Ortagus, the U.S. Deputy Special Envoy to the Middle East. Lebanon is still reeling from her pointed remarks during a previous visit. According to the Lebanese newspaper Al-Joumhouria, Ortagus is expected to visit again before the weekend, with the goal of ensuring Israel’s withdrawal from South Lebanon by February 18. Persisting border disputes Even before the recent Israeli ground operation, Lebanon has long disputed Israel’s control of points along the 'Blue Line.' Lebanon contends that Israel occupies 13 points along the border—areas it sees as rightfully Lebanese. Stretched from Ras al-Naqoura eastward, these points have been a recurring subject in discussions aimed at reaching a lasting border agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byoln7qtjl	2025-02-12T07:14:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/SylmE6fROkl/SylmE6fROkl_1_145_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Egypt says Al-Sisi will not come to White House if Trump's Gaza p...	Sources say AL-Sisi invited to Washington by Trump in a call earlier this month although no date set; Hamas welcomes the opposition of Egypt, Jordan to Trump's plan to resettle Gazan in neighboring states : 'There is no place for uprooting our people' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi will not attend his planned visit to the White House if the talks to be herld there with U.S. President Donald Trump include his plant to displace residents of the Gaza Strip, two Egyptian security sources told Reuters on Wednesday.Al-Sisi was invited to the White House when the two leaders spoke earlier this month but no date for the visit, was set. Trump stunned the Arab world and sparked outrage when he presented a plan which included the removal of a large part of the Palestinian population from Gaza and the U.S. taking over the territory to rebuild it as a reviera. Trump said that Egypt and Jordan should take in the Palestinians, an idea that was widely rejected by the Arab states. On Tuesday, King Abdullah of Jordan was hosted at the White House. In a statement alongside Abdullah, the American president said that the Palestinians will live safely somewhere other than Gaza. 'This is the unified Arab position,' King Abdullah said, during his meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday. 'Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all. Achieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability. This requires US leadership. President Trump is a man of peace. He was instrumental in securing the Gaza ceasefire. We look to the United States and all stakeholders in ensuring it holds.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last year, the U.S. allocated $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt, and in December it approved the potential sale of more than $5 billion worth of arms. 'There is no supplier that compares to the Americans, which is why for so long Egypt has been happy to maintain this relationship, but it wouldn't be at the expense of their own national interest,' said H.A. Hellyher, senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. Al-Sisi has repeatedly said Egypt would never facilitate the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which Cairo would view as a serious threat to Egypt's own security, including by breeding extremism and providing a pretext for future Israeli attacks, as well as an injustice to the Palestinians. Meanwhile, Hamas welcomed Jordan and Egypt's opposition to Trump's plan. 'The Hamas movement appreciates the positions of our brothers in Jordan and Egypt, who reject the displacement of our people and confirm that there is an Arab plan to rehabilitate Gaza without displacing its people,' the terror group said >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1cgu79yjl	2025-02-12T05:20:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/H17aYb9Ykx/H17aYb9Ykx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Yarden Bibas' sister: 'Ever since the terrorists told him about S...	After 484 days in captivity, Bibas was able to hug his sister Ofri, and his first question was about the fate of his wife and children; She talks about his condition, his consciousness, the hell he experienced and the struggle that will continue as long as Shiri, Ariel and Kfir are still in the Gaza Strip Ofri Bibas Levy was at a meeting when the IDF officer assigned to assist the family called her. It happened on Friday, on the afternoon of January 31, and he cautiously alerted her that an unofficial list was circulating online with the names of the hostages expected to be released the next day, including the name of her younger brother, Yarden Bibas. An hour of rapid heartbeats passed before the phone rang again. It was the officer, and this time he announced to her: 'Yarden is on the list. He’s coming home.' The first thing she did was tell her children. 'I told them that Uncle Dodgey was coming back,' she shares. 'I explained to them that I was going to meet him, and that they would be with Dad during this time. I told them that we were very happy, but that Ariel, Kfir and Shiri still hadn’t returned. I was in a whirlwind, and since I’m a practical person, I immediately thought about logistics. What would I do with the children? How would I leave them? It was Shabbat, and there was no kindergarten and no social settings. There was great excitement and also a lot of concerns, which didn’t go away until the next day, when I saw him leave there and I began to understand what he had been through.' Among the thousands of stories, footage and tragedies of the October 7 massacre, the Bibas family has become a symbol. For more than 70 weeks, millions of Israelis – and who knows how many more around the world, have been following with concern, uncertainty and hope the fate of Yarden and Shiri Bibas, and their children Ariel and Kfir, the youngest in Hamas captivity. This cruel story remains open, since Shiri and the children have not yet returned, but the release of the father Yarden from the hands of Hamas terrorists is the beginning, perhaps, of the healing journey that he and his family so desperately need. Nine days after he returned to Israel from captivity in Gaza, Bibas and his family are trying to complete the puzzle whose pieces have been scattered over the past 16 months. In an interview with Ynet, Ofri Bibas Levy, Yarden's sister, who was released from the hospital on Monday, tries to explain as much as possible about his condition, his consciousness, the hell he experienced and the struggle that will continue as long as Shiri, Ariel and Kfir are still in the Gaza Strip. He's a modest and private man, and it's hard for him to grasp and deal with the fact that he and his family are known to everyone 'For us, nothing is over,' she clarifies. 'We are at the height of the event.' Regarding Hamas' announcement that it is suspending the hostage release deal, she says: 'This is exactly what we feared after the negotiating team did not leave on the 16th day of the first phase as agreed in the outline, and in light of the latest statements.' Ofri is indeed beginning to form a certain picture of what happened to her brother, but the details and gaps that need to be filled in are enormous. 'Every day, Yarden discovers new things, good and bad,' she says. 'There's so much information to fill in, the gap is crazy. There are 16 months that need to be bridged. Every day he finds out about a friend who was kidnapped or murdered. Either he asks, or things come up in conversations. He mentions something and I fill in the details. We do everything slowly, at his own pace. 'It's important for us to give him back his sense of control and independence. Show him that what he wants and what he needs is important. He's the center. We do everything to help him get back to being a person with choices, with desires, with rights. For example, he met some of his friends, and also members of our family and Shiri's, but I try to arrange the times in such a way that it's slow, one by one and not together. I make sure he wants it and is ready. We surround him, protect him, with him all the time. And yes, there are times when he asks to be alone. He's a modest and private man, and it's hard for him to grasp and deal with the fact that he and his family are known to everyone. The photos, the details, the stories. 'For someone who has come out of such a disconnection into all this, it's a lot to absorb.' You are not alone anymore Bibas-Levy left her home in the north for the center that same Friday, after a phone call from the officer who told her that Yarden was returning. Early the next morning, she was already on her way to the meeting place with him in the Re'im camp. 'I traveled with the psychologist who accompanied us on behalf of the army, who managed the psychological integration process,' she recalls. 'The trip passed quickly, mainly in thoughts and conversations about what I would say to Yarden when I saw him for the first time, and what he might say to me. While I was watching the broadcasts and preparing for the ceremony in Gaza. Somehow it calmed me to see that they were creating a relatively sterile area, a large plaza clean of the Gazan crowd.' As soon as she sat down in the family room at the Re'im base, she saw Ofer Calderon on the screen getting out of the terrorists' vehicle to join the Red Cross teams. Two minutes later, Yarden also left. 'It took us a second to realize that it was him. Yarden is a relatively shy guy, and this is not a situation that was comfortable for him in any way. But he walked with his head held high, strong. Before he got on stage, they asked him to stop, take a picture and wave, but he didn't listen to them and kept walking,' she said. According to her, 'It really bothered us that in various places in the media they analyzed his body language and focused a lot on the tragedies in the situation. In general, all kinds of interpretations focus on the tragedy associated with Yarden and the family, and that makes me angry. Be happy that he came back and he's alive, and that he came out strong and upright and proud. Beyond that, we still don't know about the fate of Shiri and the children, and we hold on to hope until the last moment and won't give up on it.' What did you say to each other in the first hug? 'I told him, 'You're not alone anymore.' That's what came out of me. The first thing Yarden said was actually a question, about Shiri and the children. I understood that he understood the situation as we understand it, that there is concern, but that we don't know. He came out in the same place where we are, and that was reassuring because we didn't have to mediate too much for him. We reassured him that there is no certainty, that we hope, and that despite the concerns, we are not giving up. We didn't have any more certain answers, but I could also give him hope. It's clear that, until his family arrives, he is still there, on October 7. He came out while he was still there that day, that is, that's all they had there. That memory.' What else remains with you from the hug? 'It was all so surreal. Since last year we've been seeing pictures of families hugging their loved ones who were released, and it's as if they've caught me there. It still doesn't sink in that he's here. I still can't believe he was there, and that Shiri and the children aren't here. Nothing has been processed,' she says. 'He also remembers in detail the day they told him they were supposedly not alive, before the video was released. Since then he's tried to understand whether it's true or not. Whether it's psychological terrorism or if there's truth to it. Through the terrorists, and the hostages he met, he's tried to understand, and all this time he hasn't stopped hoping. That's what kept him going. We all still hope that it's all lies and that they'll come back to us. It's a very complex struggle.' A week after returning to Israel, Bibas sent a message through the media, in which he directly addressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said: 'Bring back my family, my friends, bring everyone home. As long as my light is still there, everything is dark here.' Ofri emphasizes that 'he formulated it all by himself. It was important to him that they knew he formulated it. It's amazing to see the clarity and memory of those who came out of there. No one imagined they would come out with so much strength.' Which Yarden did you get back? 'Yarden came back and it's him, but it's not him either. Not the same Yarden. We're not who we were either. First of all, he's very thin. I saw it when he got out of the car. He's a big, broad guy, and the clothes kind of covered it up, but he lost a lot of weight. After the first meeting, we laughed at him for asking for a Bamba. 'The truth is that I can sit down and talk to him. After a year and four months I send him a text message on the phone. I am not afraid for him at any given moment. I know that he has eaten and slept and that he is showering. These are basic things that we did not know. There is still a lot of uncertainty ahead of us, and we will still have a lot to deal with, but Yarden is here and he is strong. He is not the same Yarden, but his humor, the same kind of jokes. On the day of the statement I made in Sheba, he laughed at me, 'My vegan and dairy sister – what does your connection to the struggle have to do with it?'. That is him.' Getting along with the kidnappers Throughout the entire period of captivity, Yarden Bibas was held in tunnels and was barely exposed to the media. Yet, his family was amazed by the details he knew and how informed he was. 'He knew that the October 7 event was on a large scale,' she says. 'He knew about the demonstrations that were taking place. He knew about the war in the north and the evacuees. They were constantly mixing up the hostages, so he met others, and through them he learned things. For example, he knew about Trump's involvement. It's amazing. On the Friday before the release, he saw a broadcast on an Arab channel that they were supposed to be released. He tells quite a bit, but there are still a lot of things that we don't know about what happened to him,' according to his sister. Yarden was held at the beginning of the captivity with Ofer Calderon, during the weeks in which the conditions that they were held in was described as extremely terrible, in cages, under unbearable psychological terror. Later, they were separated, and before the release they were held together again. Bibas Levy talks about conditions when they were held in the tunnels. 'They were held underground. He described to us the humidity and the mold and the darkness. They slept on mattresses on the floor. Of course, hunger was a major issue, and they received water rations. Their lives were in the hands of those who were guarding them. One way to deal with this was to try to get closer to them and, indeed, he came out of there speaking fluent Arabic. They spent most of the day sleeping, they simply slept most of the time and only woke up for food, when it was available. Here and there they also played cards. They talked a lot among themselves, the kidnapped. Already at the base in Re'im, Yarden told how much he cared about us. 'He told the kidnapped people who were with him about us. He mentioned that he had told about his nephews, so I told him that he had another nephew who was just born. He looked at me with a surprised look, I showed him pictures and he got excited,' she said. Last May, there was a feeling that the parties were getting closer to signing an agreement. In Gaza, too, preparations were already being made. 'This was before we entered Rafah,' says Ofri. 'Yarden said that according to the feelings, and according to what the terrorists told them, a deal was signed. That was the understanding. They really started to organize themselves physically. As we know, it exploded. How terrible.' After being released from the hospital, Bibas moved to Kfar Maccabiah. He will not be able to return to his home in Nir Oz, at least until the reconstruction of the destroyed kibbutz is complete. 'Kfar Maccabiah is an intermediate stage, short or long, we don't know, but it is of course not the final home. It will allow his parents to be with him and continue his care,' explains Bibas Levy. 'The physical rehabilitation is obvious, but it is also the easier part. The coping that will take them years is for the rehabilitation of the soul. We see them smiling and laughing, but the rehabilitation will take a long time.' Peak of fragility, peak of struggle Bibas Levy, herself a mother of three small children, carries the weight of the struggle to return all the hostages on her shoulders. From her home in northern Israel, she has been everywhere: demonstrations, rallies, meetings with ministers, discussions in Knesset committees, marches, speeches at various events and, of course, numerous interviews with the media. Even now, just a few days after her brother finally returned from hell, for her nothing has stopped: 'The struggle is not over for us, we are at the peak of the event. We will not stop fighting for Shiri and the children, nor for the rest of the hostages. This is what we, the families, promised each other, and this is what will happen.' That is a lot of responsibility. 'I'm trying to find the balance between home and the public campaign and my desire to be with Yarden. It's not easy, it requires a lot of concessions from all kinds of directions, but the struggle is still ongoing. Nothing is over. There's always a feeling that everything could stop at any moment. Everything is fragile, and the risks are very high,' she says. 'This reality is difficult and cruel for the families, the public, and of course the hostages who are waiting. We are starting to see them returning, which is wonderful, but the feelings are mixed. The urgency to get everyone out as quickly as possible is obvious, but instead of speeding their return, we are delaying talks about the second phase. What else needs to happen? Why would three released hostages be released in such a terrible state? So we'll be shocked and realize again that they don't have time? It's like we knew that dozens of hostages had been murdered, and then when the murder of the six came in the summer, we discovered what their nutritional situation was and we were shocked. 'In the first releases in this deal, the hostages seemed fine, but it's clear that they are not okay. The gap between the physical and what they are going through mentally is like an abyss. The decision-makers know very well what is happening there, about the abuse, the starvation, the danger to their lives. They know everything, and they are not doing what is necessary to save them. Semantics are not important. We must get everyone out of there as quickly as possible, both the living and the dead. We must end this nightmare.' In the meantime, the cabinet convened on Tuesday, and the delegation in Doha did not discuss Phase II. 'I wish I could say that I am surprised. This is consistent with all the conduct and the dragging of feet, as if there is time. So we will wait a few more days. We are counting a week as if it is nothing. For people in the government it is nothing, for those who are there, it is life or death.' How do you comment on the various statements, for example by Bezalel Smotrich, who said that 'there will be no pressure to take steps in exchange for the release of the kidnapped?' 'I really have no words anymore. How dare he? One hand on the keyboard welcomes the return of the hostages, with the other hand they oppose Phase II, prevent the return of others and are proud that they torpedoed the previous deal. I do not know by what moral standards they are living. True, the deal is bad. No one thinks it is good. But it saves lives. This is what you, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who are members of this government, have managed to bring. You couldn't have done better than that. I don't know if you tried. 'Let's finish this and bring everyone back, and then we'll deal with whatever comes our way. The war with our enemies will never end. The idea that some deal or other will end it or prevent it is simply lying to us all, and to themselves. It is exploiting the suffering of the hostages for agendas that I no longer understand.

It was and remains with him. To threaten Hamas now, which could delay the next round of returns, when all that needs to be done is the opposite, to promote everyone's release is infuriating. How is it possible that we, as citizens of Israel, are pinning all our hopes on the president of the United States, Donald Trump? We don't need to trust anyone else.' Speaking of the prime minister and ministers, did anyone talk to you after Yarden's return? 'The prime minister didn't talk to us, nor did the president or any of the ministers. Benny Gantz contacted us, but no meeting has taken place yet. Hili Tropper, who is in contact with the family, wrote to me. The rest didn't call to congratulate Yarden on his return or ask how he was doing. They don't want to face him and look us in the face, but they don't have the right not to do it. It won't be pleasant, maybe it's not an image for an election campaign, but they have to deal with the consequences of the decisions they've made over 16 months. Even if we don't agree to talk to them, it's their duty to do it and let us choose. As far as we're concerned, we won't stop. We just won't.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bygekg5kyg	2025-02-12T05:01:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/SyQyfOj00kg/SyQyfOj00kg_0_0_3000_1691_0_small.jpg

Yossi Kuperwasser: 'The idea that people are going to live for 10 years in the rubble of Gaza makes no sense' Gaza cannot be rebuilt unless Hamas gives up control of the coastal enclave, according to Brig.-Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser. 'The idea that people are going to live for 10 years in the rubble of Gaza makes no sense,' Kuperwasser told ILTV. 'So, Trump's proposal makes more sense than the alternative.' However, he noted that Hamas is 'totally against it' and will not allow it to move forward. Therefore, the only way to make it possible is for Israel to take over the Strip.

Conference of Presidents chief: If 40% of Gazans want out, why no...	William Daroff hopes Trump’s unconventional approach will encourage other leaders to propose their own solutions for Gaza U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to encourage Gazans to relocate and place the U.S. in charge of the Gaza Strip is 'a breath of fresh air' and 'a positive thing,' according to William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish American Organizations, an umbrella group representing mainstream American Jewry. Speaking on the ILTV News Podcast, Daroff noted that 'for decades, the policy as it relates to Gaza has been spinning in circles, and no one has come up with a cogent day-after plan – a plan for what Gaza should look like or who's going to be in charge of it.' The podcast featuring Daroff will be published in the coming days. Trump, he said, has at least proposed an idea. Daroff expressed hope that Trump's unconventional thinking will inspire other leaders to propose their own solutions. He criticized the Arab world for failing to improve the lives of Gazans. 'They've been totally AWOL,' Daroff said, pointing out that in other global crises, populations often relocate. Yet, he questioned, 'Why is Egypt somehow able to put up a big wall and say that the Gazans must stay in harm's way?' Citing polling data from before October 7, Daroff noted that more than 40% of Gazans preferred to live elsewhere. Given that, he asked, 'Why not encourage them? Why not incentivize them?' He blamed Hamas for the hostage crisis, calling the group 'suicidal' and 'genocidal.' However, he also noted that U.S. policy under the previous administration at times had a negative impact. 'The Biden administration pressured the Israeli government to relent a bit, to let in far more humanitarian goods, which certainly the people of Gaza deserve, but that Hamas certainly did not deserve. And it did bolster them,' Daroff said. But will Trump's new ultimatum—that 'all hell will break loose' if the hostages are not released by Saturday at noon—be effective? Daroff isn't sure. He does know that Trump has successfully negotiated with Colombia, Canada, and Mexico. Given that, he said, this approach may work. If not, he suggested, it could at least push the parties back to the table and revive the previous version of Phase I of the deal, which allowed some hostages to be released each week. Watch previous ILTV News Podcasts: Why the world can’t ignore Iran’s nuclear ambitions any longer MK Amit Halevi: Hostage deal will rehabilitate Nazi monster Hamas This country is the world's least antisemitic – can you guess where? Daroff is confident that Trump will succeed in securing peace with Saudi Arabia. He pointed to intelligence reports suggesting that one reason Hamas carried out the October 7 attack when it did was that Israel and Saudi Arabia were on the verge of normalization. Achieving peace now, he said, would be 'the icing on the cake' after winning the war—bringing the hostages home and eradicating Hamas. If stopping Saudi normalization was one of Hamas's motives, Daroff argued, then not only would Hamas be destroyed and its leader, Yahya Sinwar, eliminated, but his goal of blocking peace with Saudi Arabia would ultimately be reversed. 'The dividends that could flow from that would be a great part of the epitaph of Sinwar,' Daroff said. Netanyahu to Address Jewish Leaders in Jerusalem Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with delegates from the Conference of Presidents next week at their 50th annual event in Jerusalem. He will also deliver his first open remarks in English to a Jewish delegation since Donald Trump took office. Dozens of top Jewish leaders will be in Israel from February 16 to 20 for the gathering, which includes meetings with high-level officials, panel discussions, and site visits. Netanyahu did not meet with Jewish leaders during his recent visit to Washington. Instead, he spent a morning with Christian leaders in a meeting arranged by incoming U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. Daroff defended the decision, explaining that Netanyahu's office had been working to arrange such a meeting but ultimately ran out of time. 'I wish there had been a meeting, but I don't think it's incredibly indicative of much other than the fact that the prime minister had a very busy schedule,' Daroff said. Daroff acknowledged the strong and diverse opinions about Netanyahu among American Jews. However, he suggested they may view him more favorably than Israelis since they are not exposed to the constant, often critical, coverage of him in Israeli media. A recent poll published by the Hebrew daily Maariv showed a surge in support for Netanyahu's Likud Party. Netanyahu's personal approval ratings remain low despite some gains in the war. Meanwhile, protests over the hostages and dissatisfaction with the government's actions continue to fill the streets, even as a hostage deal begins to move forward. 'He's controversial,' Daroff said. 'He's certainly controversial among Conference of Presidents organizations.' But he said, love or hate Netanyahu, he is glad to see that in the few weeks Trump has been in office, America and the U.S. seem to be in sync. 'I'm very much a supporter of, first, the US and Israel having no daylight between them,' Daroff said. 'I think that it makes Israel stronger and makes America stronger for our adversaries to see that we speak as one. 'But secondly, there inevitably will be disagreements, that those disagreements are aired in private and not in public,' he continued. 'I think that when they are aired in public, it lessens the perception of the bond by America and Israel's adversaries. And that's a problem for America and Israel. And I think that what we've seen over these last three weeks is a change in tone, for sure, as distinct from the previous administration.' Jewish Unity in the Face of Rising Antisemitism The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) recently reported a sharp 340% increase in global antisemitic incidents. Additionally, a staggering 46% of the world's adult population holds deeply rooted antisemitic views. The Conference of Presidents has been at the forefront of combating antisemitism. According to Daroff, Jewish organizations are working together in ways he has 'never seen before.' 'Jewish organizations, post-October 7, are very much engaging together. We're collaborating very much, which indicates where the American Jewish community is in general,' he said. Beyond the 'punch in the gut' of the Hamas attack, Daroff explained that Jewish leaders and organizations were shocked by the silence—or even opposition—of those they had previously considered allies. 'That really brought about a resurgence of Jewish self-awareness and engagement that, among other things, has our Jewish organizations working well together,' he said. He emphasized the importance of working with governments at all levels to combat antisemitism, especially on university campuses, which saw violent anti-Israel and antisemitic protests last year. Daroff noted that the Trump administration had launched an investigation into several universities, conducted proactively by the Department of Education. 'Distinct from other times in our history as a people, we have the government on our side,' he said. 'When we have issues, we can turn to them and work together. And that's something that worked well with the federal government in the last administration and continues today.' He also highlighted a new Department of Justice task force and a key legal measure related to college campuses. Under existing law, individuals on visas who provide material support for terror can have their visas revoked. 'There are a few of these provocateurs who are the problem, and I think by showing them that actions have consequences, we can really change the climate here,' Daroff noted. While he feels safe, he also believes 'it's important to be a little scared' and for the community 'to stay on our toes.' He admitted he will be more hesitant to engage with individuals and organizations that denied what happened on October 7, though this stance may evolve over time to accomplish other goals. 'Our eyes will be very open, and I think there probably will be a much higher price of entry in order for us to engage with them,' he added. Above all, Daroff stressed the importance of Jewish unity. 'We can count on each other, and we are stronger as a people when we are unified.' While he doesn't believe anything good can come from October 7, he acknowledged that it has clarified for many people 'what's important, who's important, and who they can count upon.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknu4aykkx	2025-02-12T04:29:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/S14cWmqYke/S14cWmqYke_0_263_2425_1366_0_small.jpg

Jordanian Bar Association deputy head Walid Al-Adwan actions garner support on social media and no condemnation from government; Israel says incident could harm relations Israel issued a strong condemnation to Jordan on Wednesday after Walid Al-Adwan, deputy head of the Jordanian Bar Association, painted the Israeli flag on the ground at the entrance of the association’s building and declared, 'Everyone who enters must step on it.' A photo of Al-Adwan standing at the entrance with the flag beneath his feet was circulated on social media. Israel's Foreign Ministry called the act an 'incitement that does not align with the spirit of the peace agreement between the countries' and filed an official protest with Jordan’s embassy in Israel. The ministry urged Jordan’s government to 'condemn the incident and take steps to prevent such actions in the future,' warning that 'the lack of condemnation is concerning, as expressions of hatred like this can harm trust and cooperation between the countries and, as recent incidents at the shared border have shown, lead to violence against Israeli citizens.'

Is Iran crumbling?	Crippling sanctions that could collapse Iran’s economy and bring its oil exports down to zero—that is what President Trump’s team aims to achieve in dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran Following the rollout of Trump’s 'Maximum Pressure 2.0' sanctions campaign against the Islamic regime in Iran, hardliners within the regime have doubled down on anti-American rhetoric, reversing their previously dovish willingness to engage in negotiations. Crippling sanctions that could collapse Iran’s economy and bring its oil exports down to zero—that is what President Trump’s team aims to achieve in dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The move has been met with hostility from regime officials, who have already attempted to assassinate the president multiple times before the election. As the Islamic Republic marked 46 years since the 1979 revolution yesterday, Iran’s currency plummeted to record lows. The day’s festivities were dominated by regime-led incitement against both Israel and President Trump, including theatrical mock arrests of Trump in the streets and renewed threats against him from senior officials. This comes as Trump has explicitly stated he prefers a verified nuclear deal over war to halt the regime’s rogue pursuit of nuclear weapons—a move Tehran has dismissed as 'insincere.' In recent days, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly shut down the possibility of negotiations with the U.S., issuing threats and hosting Hamas leadership in a show of solidarity against both the United States and Israel. Earlier this week, an IRGC-affiliated Telegram channel released a video threatening to assassinate Trump, and Iranian MP Mojtaba Zarei explicitly called for the U.S. president’s assassination. However, as the regime marked 46 years of Islamic rule, ordinary Iranians responded by chanting 'Death to the dictator' from their balconies across the country. In southwestern Iran, large protests erupted against the regime, highlighting growing domestic discontent.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1dhagqt1g	2025-02-12T04:11:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/09/14/ByZipxQJbj/ByZipxQJbj_0_43_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Kremlin: Russian citizen released from US prison	The Kremlin said Wednesday that a Russian citizen was freed in the United States in exchange for Moscow's release of American Marc Fogel, but refused to identify them until they arrive in Russia.

Fogel, an American history teacher who was deemed wrongfully detained by Russia, has been released and was returned to the U.S. on Tuesday in what the White House described as a diplomatic thaw that could advance negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Fogel was arrested in August 2021 and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for U.S. President Donald Trump, left Russia with Fogel and brought him to the White House, where Trump greeted him.

Father of American-Israeli hostage says he trusts Trump to bring ...	With his son Itay still held captive by Hamas, Ruby Chen urges leaders to prioritize the safe return of all hostages and stresses that bringing them home must transcend political considerations Ruby Chen, father of American-Israeli hostage Itay Chen, has called for accelerated negotiations to secure the release of all remaining captives. In an interview with Ynetnews, Chen stressed the urgency of concluding the process, especially in light of Hamas' announcement that the next scheduled releases would be postponed due to alleged Israeli violations of the cease-fire. 'This puts us in a very difficult place,' Chen said. 'We have been advocating inside the White House and to the president [Trump] that we would like to see the last hostages come out with a defined date. The president understands how fragile this framework is and that it needs to be expedited. The way to get to the last hostage is by moving negotiations forward and reaching the endgame — ending the war between Hamas and Israel and securing the hostages’ release.' Chen also welcomed the firm stance taken by U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently warned that if Hamas does not release all hostages by noon on Saturday, 'all hell will break out.' 'That's the type of language we've been missing from the previous administration,' Chen shared. 'The majority of the families welcome this policy, as well as Mr. Steve Witkoff’s efforts that enabled us to get to this framework. But we need to get to the endgame, and that means the last hostage. Israel has done a lot — it has released assets and withdrawn from parts of Gaza. But to secure the last hostage, there aren't many cards left, which is why negotiations must be expedited.' As a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen, Chen expressed trust in the American administration’s commitment to the hostages’ release. 'If I needed to put my trust in one person, only one person, I would put it in the hands of the president of the United States,' he said. 'This is difficult to say because I'm also a citizen of Israel, but I’ve looked into his eyes, I’ve talked to his team. They’ve made this a top priority, not out of political calculus, but because it’s the right thing to do. I hope Israel’s prime minister understands that this should supersede any other war objective, including the dismantling of Hamas. First and foremost comes the release of the hostages.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Addressing concerns about linking hostage negotiations to broader political strategies for Gaza, Chen was clear in his stance. 'I'm a simple dad. I don't want to get into politics, but coupling the 'day after' with the release of the hostages is not a good strategy,' he said. 'The state of Israel failed me, my family and many other families by allowing the abduction of over 240 citizens, including my son, who was serving as an IDF soldier protecting civilians. Israel has a legal and moral obligation to bring him back — no matter what it takes.' Chen dismissed concerns that opposition from hardline Israeli ministers, such as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Settlements and National Missions Minister Orit Strock, could delay the hostage agreement’s second phase. 'I think the president has a very direct line to the prime minister,' he said. 'He views those types of ministers as a nuisance. He doesn’t pay that much attention to Smotrich, Strock, or Ben-Gvir—and I say that based on what I’ve seen inside the White House. 'The president does things because it’s the right thing to do, and in this case, he has prioritized the hostages. I hope Israel’s prime minister understands his responsibility—before political considerations, before what Smotrich says or doesn’t say. Eighty percent of the Israeli people want to see the last hostage out, and they want to see it as soon as possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1h8n6yyjx	2025-02-12T01:15:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/r1IAe0tKyx/r1IAe0tKyx_65_0_345_194_0_small.jpg

IDF reports two suspects in southern Gaza struck after they came to collect a drone 'that was being monitored' by Israel; Security sources said one person was killed and another was injured, as reports from Gaza describe 'bombing buildings' in the Tel a-Sultan neighborhood of Rafah; Several attempts to smuggle weapons into Gaza using drones have been identified, IDF says A man was killed Wednesday in an IDF strike in Rafah in southern Gaza. The IDF said shortly after the attack that an IDF aircraft attacked a drone that crossed from Israel back into Gaza, and two suspects who picked it up in the southern Gaza Strip, in what is suspected to be an attempt to smuggle weapons. In Gaza, it was reported that the IDF attacked the Tel a-Sultan neighborhood in the west of Rafah. The Palestinians reported that 'residential buildings were bombed' in the southern Gaza city while according to the IDF 'a drone was identified crossing from Israeli territory into southern Gaza, and was monitored by the IDF during its flight.

The IDF noted that ' several attempts to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip using drones have been identified' recently, including during the cease-fire.

Family of hostage Yosef Haim Ohana learns he is alive	He was abducted into Gaza on October 7 after helping injured at Nova music festival; Family going public about it after seeing condition of hostages in last round of releases Hanna Mastronov, the aunt of hostage Yosef Haim Ohana, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in Kibbutz Re'im, said Wednesday morning in an interview with Ynet that the family received sign of life from him following the last round of hostage releases on Saturday: 'We have a clear indication that he is alive,' she shared. 'There are signs of life that indicate that he is alive.' 'We first chose to deal with a story under the radar. The fact that we are now going to the media is because we understand that there is probably not enough understanding of how serious the situation is,' she said. 'When we saw the people who returned last Saturday, it broke us even more than we were already broken. The feelings are not simple at all.' She referred to the return of hostages Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levi , saying that 'it was a shadow of people, not people. I am happy that they returned, but I think about the others. What will happen to the others? Whoever looks at Sharabi, I don't know if he would have survived a few more weeks in captivity if they hadn't brought him. It's time to wake up. There is no time, absolutely no time - they need to return today.' She added that Yosef Haim is 'a strong man - both in mind and body. But even human strength has limits. We are approaching 500 days. We didn't think it would last this long.' She said that when the family met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, she asked him to bring her nephew back. 'I told him that we are not politicians. To everyone's credit - Gal Hirsch, Shin Bet, everyone - they are available and provide a response. But behind the response there must be a basis of trust. If everyone is a humanitarian case stand behind your words,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'There is no place to stop (the hostage releases under the agreement) but to continue on,' the aunt added. 'We did not disagree as a family about the order of priority - sick people, women. I am happy for everyone who returned, every soul in Israel - we are happy for them. But we cannot count on the young people to survive forever. We are approaching the 500th day.' Yosef Chaim Ohana, 24, from Kiryat Malachi, was kidnapped from Nova by Hamas terrorists. His mother said that Yosef and his friend helped the injured at the Nova festival, them to the paramedics and ambulances. 'When I called his friend, he told me that when the shooting started, they helped the wounded and took them to receive treatment,' his mother said. 'They tried to run toward the main road, but then they saw that they were being fired at by RPGs. Yosef Haim ran to the left, and the friend ran to the right and hid under the car. The friend was hit by the missile, and managed to see Yosef Haim peeking from behind the car behind which he was hiding. After that, he didn't see him again.' 'The last information was about 5 months ago' On the other hand, Zvika Mor is still waiting to receive information about his hostage son, Eitan. When asked in an interview with Ynet whether any of the returned hostages have come forward with information about his son, the father said: 'Not yet. And we are indeed waiting. I hope we too will receive good news.' 'The last information was about 5 months ago, something like that,' he shared. 'We don't even have a list, we don't even have a Red Cross. While we're bringing aid trucks in there.' 'We should have blown the deal at the first violation,' Mor asserted. 'It seems to me that the three hostages will be released on Saturday, and then why would Israel break the deal? No. I think Hamas doesn't want to get too involved with Trump, he's driving us crazy and he'll do what's necessary in the end.' Mor added, in light of U.S. President DonaldTrump's words regarding the ultimatum to Hamas: 'We missed the opportunity. We had to show Hamas that we are not suckers. Shut off the water, the trucks, everything, and have Hamas come after us. But we didn't do that. We postponed and waited for the uncle from America to tell us who was needed for us - so we lost our authority here.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkoggaktyl	2025-02-11T22:59:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/B1LlgRttyl/B1LlgRttyl_0_108_1080_608_0_small.jpg

Musk acknowledges $50 million in condoms weren't meant for Gaza	Head of US government efficiency department addressed for first time President Donald Trump's mistaken statement that contraceptives were sent to Hamas in Gaza, when they were actually procured for Mozambique as part of the fight against HIV; Since 1993, USAID has allocated more than $6 billion to aid Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza In an unusual press briefing in the Oval Office, billionaire Elon Musk, who heads the Office of Government Efficiency (DOGE), admitted that U.S. President Donald Trump was wrong when he said that his department had prevented the transfer of ' $50 million for condoms to the Gaza Strip,' apparently due to confusion between the Strip and the Gaza province in Mozambique, where the contraceptives were transferred as part of the fight against HIV. Musk became the first official in the Trump administration to admit a mistake on the issue, noting: 'We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we'll also fix the mistakes very quickly.' At the same time, Musk said that 'I'm not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms anywhere, frankly.' The billionaire entrepreneur made the remarks at an impromptu press conference in the Oval Office at the White House, to which he was invited at the last minute by Trump. Musk, who regularly posts dozens of posts every day on his X network about his work in the government, some humorous and some serious, was asked about the credibility of his words, saying while his young son sat on his shoulders that 'if the condoms went to Mozambique instead of Gaza, then fine, it's not so bad, but still, why are we doing this? I'm not sure that's something the American people would be happy about. That's an enormous number of condoms.' The embarrassment reached its peak after weeks of strong statements from White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt, who claimed in her first briefing that the department headed by Musk had identified a 'gross waste of public funds' in transferring the $50 million for condoms to Gaza. Trump was quick to echo the words, saying that they had 'turned condoms into bombs.' However, investigations conducted by media outlets in the U.S. and around the world did not support this version. The world's leading media outlets, including Reuters, CNN, the New York Times and the UK Times, found no evidence of funds being transferred to Gaza for contraceptives, and over time it became clear that the amount was actually transferred to the Gaza district of Mozambique, as part of an international effort to combat HIV. Dana Stroll, former assistant secretary of defense for Middle East affairs, noted that the April 2024 report showed that the funding included contraceptives in four regions, but the bulk of the budget was earmarked for Africa, and in particular Mozambique. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The embarrassing error occurred after the Government Efficiency Department headed by Musk began work to effectively close the U.S. aid agency USAID, which the new administration has described as wasteful and a 'bastion of radical liberals.' A Ynet investigation revealed that in October 2024 about $45 million was allocated to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to fund sexual and reproductive health programs among refugees in Gaza, including the distribution of contraceptives. However, there is no evidence that the entire amount was allocated for this purpose alone, and experts in the field believe that the claim that it was only condoms is 'puzzling' at best. 'A complex picture': The storm over USAID At the same time, those who oppose Musk's move to dismantle USAID say that the agency could be run more transparently and efficiently. Since 1993, the agency has allocated more than $6 billion to aid Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Some of it was allocated to Israeli organizations for projects that benefit health, education and economic development in the region - for example, programs at Sheba, Hadassah and Shaare Zedek hospitals that promoted medical services for Jews and Arabs, or to the Hapoel Katamon soccer club in Jerusalem, for a project of joint soccer games for Jewish and Arab girls. At Hadassah, for example, the agency funded a program of 'collaboration between Israeli and Palestinian mental health professionals to better serve children and adolescents suffering from trauma.' On the other hand, there are cases in which USAID funding has been transferred to organizations with a clear anti-Israel agenda, and even indirect ties to elements involved in terrorism. Thus, more than $2 million was transferred between 2013 and 2017 to the organization Juzoor for Health and Social Development, which organized meetings between Palestinian youth and convicted terrorists. Another example is the funding of $1.1 million between 2009 and 2012 to the organization Just Vision, which produced a documentary film called 'Boycott' in 2021, which criticizes American laws against the BDS movement. Since October 7, USAID has invested more than $1.2 billion in humanitarian development programs affecting the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza – nearly 4% of its total budget. 'Our commitment to the Palestinian people remains steadfast,' said Amy Tohill-Stoll, USAID’s mission director for the West Bank and Gaza. However, even Israeli organizations that have benefited from the agency’s generous funding acknowledge that the picture is complex. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkm4s3yf1g	2025-02-11T21:21:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ByRmw30Oke/ByRmw30Oke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Released hostage Eli Sharabi 'went through things the eye and the...	Eli Sharabi's brother, Sharon, reveals that he had no knowledge of the fight for his release and was freed 'at the last possible chance'; He predicts a long road to recovery for his brother but remains hopeful: 'He is a hero. Life is stronger than anything – we will build him a new future' After 491 days in Hamas captivity, Eli Sharabi has returned home. But for his brother, Sharon Sharabi, the fight is far from over. Alongside the overwhelming relief and joy of Eli’s release, Sharon continues his battle to bring back the body of their brother, Yossi Sharabi, who was also abducted alive from Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7 but was later killed in Gaza. His remains are still being held by the Hamas terror group. In an interview with Ynet on Tuesday, Sharon described the first moment he embraced his brother after more than 16 months in captivity. He spoke of Eli’s harrowing ordeal, his difficult road to recovery, and the devastating reality that awaited him: the murders of his wife, Lian, and daughters, Yahel and Noya, in the October 7 massacre. Even before learning that Eli was on the latest list of freed hostages, Sharon traveled to Kfar Maccabiah, where families of hostages have been gathering. 'Just in case,' he said. 'I arrived on Friday, even though there was no certainty Eli would be released in this round.' The confirmation came unexpectedly. 'That evening, I was sitting at the Shabbat table when someone told me, ‘I’m so happy for you.’ I didn’t understand at first. Then she said, ‘Your brother is coming home.’ We jumped for joy – physically jumped. Of course, I didn’t sleep a minute that night.' Eli’s mother and sister, Osnat, were at Re’im military base, where the freed hostages first reunited with their families. They watched as Eli stepped out of a Hamas vehicle in Gaza, joining Red Cross teams alongside fellow hostages Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy. The images of them – thin, pale and struggling to walk – shook the entire nation. 'Eli was freed at the last possible moment,' Sharon said. Their first hug took place at Sheba Medical Center. 'I held him tight, crying with joy and pain. I told him, ‘You’re home now. You’re safe. We’ll never leave you.’ I also whispered the prayer Shema Yisrael and thought of our mother, who could finally hold him again. It was the fulfillment of a life mission.' Surviving the unimaginable During his captivity, Eli was completely cut off from the outside world. 'He had no idea about the efforts to bring him home,' Sharon said. 'No radio, no television, no sunlight – not even fluorescent light. He was deep underground. He endured things the human eye and heart cannot comprehend.' Physically frail and mentally shaken, Eli faces a long recovery. 'He’s in a difficult state, but he will overcome this,' Sharon said. 'We’re mourning, but we will rise. Life is stronger than anything, and we will rebuild a future for him alongside the pain that will always remain. We won’t suppress the sorrow – we’ll learn to live with it.' Despite his suffering, Eli has shown nothing but gratitude. 'He walks around with an Israeli flag, thanking every person he meets. He keeps saying, ‘Thank you for saving my life. Thank you for fighting for me.’ People say I saved a life, but the real hero is Eli. His only wish now is to embrace bereaved families and wounded soldiers. That’s who he is — a true angel.' Eli, 51, was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri alongside his brother, Yossi, who was killed in captivity –likely due to an Israeli airstrike on a nearby building. While Eli was freed in the fifth round of hostage releases in the current hostage deal, Yossi’s body remains in Gaza. Sharon has led a relentless campaign to bring them both home. At the emotional reunion at Sheba Medical Center, he was seen draped in a prayer shawl, tears streaming down his face as he embraced Eli in prayer. A day after Eli’s release, Sharon issued a statement at the hospital, addressing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly. He reminded him of the 76 hostages still in Hamas captivity and urged him to make 'brave decisions.' Quoting the biblical plea, ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’ Sharon emphasized, 'Every passing second could mean saving a life from Hamas tunnels.' He expressed gratitude to Netanyahu for fulfilling his promise to bring Eli home alive but stressed that 'the mission is far from over.' Sharon also called on the Israeli public: 'Keep raising your voices – you are the hope of all the hostages. At this moment, we must remember our soldiers. Eli is overwhelmed with gratitude and wants to hug every single one of you. You are our light. We have no other country, and you defend it with courage. On Eli’s behalf, I say: This struggle has touched every hostage. Eli himself is living proof of the urgent need to bring them all home – immediately.' Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, a senior Health Ministry official, commented on the conditions of Eli and the two other freed hostages, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy. She noted that the signs of starvation, humiliation and harsh captivity are impossible to hide. For Eli Sharabi, his release is just the beginning of a long journey toward healing. For his family, the fight continues —to recover what was lost and to ensure that no hostage is left behind.. marks of prolonged suffering – perhaps even more visibly than those freed in previous rounds. For Eli Sharabi, his release is just the beginning of a long journey toward healing.

Trump to order US agencies to plan for 'large scale' staff cuts	U.S. President Donald Trump plans to direct federal agencies to coordinate with Elon Musk's task force to shrink the workforce and limit hiring with an exception to immigration and other safety positions, a White House official said on Tuesday. The executive order, which is expected to be signed on Tuesday, would set rules allowing government agencies to hire no more than one employee for every four workers who leave the federal workforce, according to the official. Additionally, the order will direct agencies to plan 'for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their functions aren't required by law,' the order will say, the official said. Federal employees whose work is 'critical to national security, public safety, law enforcement and immigration enforcement' would be exempted, the official added.

Hamas senior officials ordered to disconnect phones and hide as c...	Saudi report says the terror group ordered its senior figures to stop using their mobile phones 'to prevent them from being attacked,' and to go into hiding; Unnamed sources told the Arabic-language newspaper that the order, originally set for the end of Phase I of the cease-fire, was brought forward due to fears of an Israeli move as deal collapses Sources in the Hamas terrorist organization claimed Tuesday in an interview with the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, which is published in London in Arabic, that the intelligence service of Hamas' military wing and the senior leadership ordered the organization's political and military leaders to stop using mobile phones and to physically hide, 'to prevent them from being tracked,' according to the report. This dramatic report comes in the shadow of the crisis in the cease-fire and the hostage return deal, in the midst of Phase 1 - and against the backdrop of Hamas' announcement that it will 'delay release steps until further notice,' despite the clarification that this is only a warning message at this stage. According to the sources, these guidelines were supposed to come into effect at the end of Phase I of the cease-fire, but were brought forward due to 'fear of Israeli treachery,' according to the guidelines, apparently referring to the statements from Israel in recent hours about the possibility of a return to fighting if the hostages are not released by Saturday afternoon. According to the report, many of the terrorist organization's senior figures returned to using their phones when the cease-fire began, about three and a half weeks ago. The sources added that some leaders have already begun implementing the new security measures, although at this stage it is only a warning, which came following Hamas' decision to suspend the release of the hostages. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In light of the crisis, the IDF announced additional reinforcements in the Southern Command , including the mobilization of reservists, following Netanyahu's ultimatum to Hamas regarding a possible return to fighting. The scope of the reinforcements is two to three battalions at this stage, despite the firm statements about a 'return to intense fighting.' Two divisions are currently operating in the southern region to defend the region, with the deployment including ground forces, the Air Force and the Navy. Since Monday night, regular forces, including special units, have been transferred to the south, and additional brigades have been deployed as a reserve force. At the same time, additional forces, including regular and reserve divisions, are in the preparation stages. The reinforcements come following the cabinet's decision to halt negotiations on Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, claiming that Hamas had violated the agreement. According to a political source, Israel expects Hamas to release the nine living hostages as part of Phase 1 of the deal 'in the coming days.' As of now, there has been no change in the instructions for the home front, except for the cancellation of a KKL tree-planting event for the families of soldiers who have fallen in the current war that had been planned in the area for Tuesday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj6va7yy1g	2025-02-11T11:22:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/B1ASl2VYkl/B1ASl2VYkl_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The terrorist organization also stated, without committing to releasing the hostages on Saturday after announcing the postponement of the release of the hostages, that 'Hamas is committed to the cease-fire agreement that the occupation committed to.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjh11007yy1e	2025-02-11T10:44:05-08:00	
White House: Russia releases detained American teacher Marc Fogel	Russia has released detained American teacher Marc Fogel, the White House says. Steve Witkoff, special envoy for President Donald Trump, left Russian airspace with Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, and he is expected to be reunited with his family by the end of the day. Fogel was arrested in August 2021, and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. His family and supporters said he was traveling with medically prescribed marijuana. Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, said the U.S. and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to ensure Fogel's release. He did not say what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. Previous negotiations have occasionally involved reciprocal releases of Russians by the U.S. or its allies. Waltz described the development as 'a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.'

Iran alerts UN to Trump threat of force, says it will defend itse...	Pez will have severe consequences.' In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, seen by Reuters, Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani referenced remarks made by Trump in interviews with the New York Post and Fox News, in which he spoke of a preference to do a deal to stop Tehran getting a nuclear weapon over bombing the country. 'These reckless and inflammatory statements flagrantly violate international law and the U.N. Charter,' Iravani wrote to the 15-member council. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran warns that any act of aggression will have severe consequences, for which the U.S. will bear full responsibility,' he said. 'Iran will resolutely defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests against any hostile action.' Trump last week restored his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. He also said he was open to a deal and expressed a willingness to talk to Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian. Iravani urged the U.N. Security Council to condemn Trump's 'brazen rhetoric.' Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it is 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters in December.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjxbextyye	2025-02-11T10:24:34-08:00

US president met king at the White House and reminded him that the US 'contributes a lot of money to Jordan and Egypt'; Trump added that the Palestinians will live safely somewhere other than Gaza; King says he will take in 2,000 sick Gazan children, adding that 'I must do what is best for my country' In the shadow of his plan to evacuate the Gaza Strip, U.S. President Donald Trump met with Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House on Tuesday evening. 'The Palestinians will live safely somewhere other than Gaza,' the U.S. president said in a joint appearance before reporters. 'I think there will be parcels of land in Jordan and Egypt where Palestinians will live,' Trump also said. 'We will reach an agreement, I believe 99% that we can reach an understanding with Egypt as well.' Trump then issued a veiled threat saying that the U.S. 'contributes a lot of money to Jordan and Egypt.' Trump added that the United States 'will run Gaza very well' and that it would not purchase it. 'We're going to take it. We're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East,' Trump said of Gaza, saying his plan would 'bring peace' to the region. Trump added that he will not personally oversee any of his own developments there. 'There will be economic development there that has never been there, and we will make sure that there is peace and there are no problems,' Trump said. The U.S. president noted that the Palestinians want to stay in Gaza only because 'they have no alternative,' adding: 'They are being murdered there. There is no more dangerous place in the world than the Gaza Strip. No one wants to stay there. It is a death trap.' The King of Jordan said that he believes there was a way to 'achieve peace and prosperity in the region,' adding: 'We will support Trump to achieve these goals.' Regarding the absorption of Gazans in his country, he said that it should be in everyone's interest, noting that Jordan would absorb 2,000 sick children, and suggested waiting until the Egyptians come to present their plan to the president. He was later asked if there would be areas in Jordan where Gazans could live, and he replied that he would do 'what is best' for his country. Regarding the hostage deal , which is currently in crisis, Trump was asked if Saturday was still the deadline for Hamas to release Israeli, and he replied: 'Yes.' Trump later said that if Hamas does not release the hostages by Saturday, 'everything is open.' According to him, 'Hamas is trying to play it tough.

According to the U.S. president, 'we will build beautiful, safe communities for the 1.9 million residents of the Gaza Strip.' He added that at that time he would be the 'owner' (of Gaza), saying: 'Think of it as a real estate development project for the future. It will be a beautiful piece of land.' In response to the question of whether the Palestinians will have the right of return, Trump stated that 'they will not, because they will have much better living conditions.

Hell worse than what we have already?': Gazans respond to Trump'...	Palestinians in Gaza reject Donald Trump’s plan to resettle Gaza’s population and redevelop it under US control; Critics call it an attempt to erase Palestinian identity With his Gaza home destroyed in Israel's military offensive, Shaban Shaqaleh had intended to take his family on a break to Egypt once the Hamas-Israel cease-fire was firmly in place. He changed his mind after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to resettle Gaza's Palestinian residents and redevelop the enclave, and said they should not have the right to return. The Tel Al-Hawa neighborhood in Gaza City, where dozens of multi-story buildings once stood, is now largely deserted. There is no running water or electricity and, like most buildings there, Shaqaleh's home is in ruins. 'We are horrified by the destruction, the repeated displacement and the death, and I wanted to leave so I can secure a safe and better future for my children - until Trump said what he said,' Shaqaleh, 47, told Reuters via a chat app. 'After Trump's remarks, I canceled the idea. I fear leaving and never being able to come back. This is my homeland,' he also said. Under Trump's scheme, Gaza's about 2.2 million Palestinians would be resettled and the United States would take control and ownership of the coastal territory, redeveloping it into what Trump has called the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' 'The idea of selling my home or the piece of land I own to foreign companies to leave the homeland and never come back is completely rejected. I am deeply rooted in the soil of my homeland and will always be,' Shaqaleh said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Any suggestion that Palestinians leave Gaza - which they want to be part of an independent state also encompassing the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its capital - has been anathema to the Palestinian leadership for generations. Neighboring Arab states have rejected it since the Gaza war began in 2023. After Hamas said on Monday it was suspending the release of Israeli hostages set out in the cease-fire deal due to alleged Israeli violations, Trump said the Palestinian terror group should release all those it still holds by noon on Saturday or he would propose canceling the truce and 'let hell break out.' 'Hell worse than what we have already? Hell worse than killing?' said Jomaa Abu Kosh, a Palestinian from Rafah in southern Gaza, standing beside devastated homes. One woman, Samira Al-Sabea, accused Israel of blocking aid deliveries, a charge denied by Israel. 'We are humiliated, street dogs are living a better life than us,' she said. 'And Trump wants to make Gaza hell? This will never happen.' Some Gazans said Palestinian leaders must find a solution to their problems. 'We don't want to leave our country but we also need a solution. Our leaders - Hamas, the PA (Palestinian Authority), and other factions - must find a solution,' said a 40-year-old carpenter who gave his name as Jehad. 'Does he own Gaza?' In the West Bank, Palestinians were also aghast at Trump's words. 'Does he own Gaza to ask people to leave it?' said Nader Imam. 'Regarding Trump, I only blame the American people. How can a country like this, a superpower, accept a person like Trump? His statements are savage.' 'What will Trump do? There is no fear, we rely on God,' said another West Bank resident, Mohammed Salah Tamimi. The proposal shattered decades of U.S. peace efforts built around a two-state solution and added pressure on neighboring Egypt and Jordan to take in resettled Palestinians. Both countries, which receive billions in aid from the United States, rejected the plan citing concerns for national security and their commitment to the two-state solution. For Jordan, which borders the West Bank and has absorbed more Palestinians than any other state since Israel's creation, the plan is a nightmare. Trump said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they refused to cooperate. Jordan's King Abdullah is meeting with Trump in Washington on Tuesday and is expected to express his rejection of the plan. 'Jordan can never accept resolving this issue at its expense,' said Suleiman Saud, the chairman of the Palestine Committee in Jordan's House of Representatives. 'Jordan is for Jordanians, and Palestine is for Palestinians.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj7ozwfyye	2025-02-11T08:56:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/SkU6p9dFyx/SkU6p9dFyx_0_209_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Houthi leader threatens to resume attacks on Israel if Gaza cease...	Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Iran-backed militia responsible for more than 300 attacks on Israel, warned that his forces are 'ready to launch strikes on Israel if it resumes operations in Gaza' Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Iran-backed militia in Yemen, warned Tuesday that his group is prepared to launch attacks on Israel if it resumes military operations in Gaza and violates the cease-fire agreement. 'If the occupation escalates, we will stand with the Lebanese people,' al-Houthi said in an interview in Yemen. 'We reaffirm our commitment to supporting the Palestinian people – militarily, politically and in public advocacy. We are ready for military intervention if Israel intensifies its aggression against Gaza.' He added that 'Israelis must understand that no matter how much they rely on the Americans, they will not achieve their goals if they choose escalation. The Israeli enemy is delaying the implementation of the second phase of the agreement. If they escalate, they will be met with determination and resilience from the Palestinian people. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have launched more than 300 attacks on Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault, as well as disrupted maritime traffic in the Red Sea. About a month into the war, they claimed responsibility for hijacking the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship they said was Israeli-linked, seizing its 22 crew members. Three weeks ago, the group announced their release – more than a year after their capture. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Positioning themselves as a frontline force 'defending Gaza,' the Houthis insisted that the ship’s release was contingent on Hamas' approval, relaying this stance to mediators. Following the enforcement of the Gaza cease-fire, the group declared they would 'limit' Red Sea attacks to vessels with Israeli ties. In the lead-up to the cease-fire and hostage deal, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree softened his usual rhetoric. Instead of pledging continued military action until Israel lifts the blockade on Gaza, he vowed that the group 'will not abandon Palestine or its just cause until every inch is liberated and the Israeli enemy is expelled.' US declares Houthis a terrorist organization Three weeks ago, the White House announced that former President Donald Trump had signed an executive order designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. The move reinstated severe U.S. sanctions that had been lifted by President Joe Biden’s administration in 2021. Last year, the Biden administration reclassified the Houthis as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' group after the president condemned their attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea. However, they were not placed back on the formal list of foreign terrorist organizations—until the latest White House decision. The updated designation, which had been under review for months by Biden officials but was ultimately signed by Trump, imposes stricter penalties, including automatic sanctions on anyone providing support to the Houthis. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkevyxfykg	2025-02-11T08:01:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/07/rkWprNk8T/rkWprNk8T_0_50_1000_563_0_small.jpg
UAE proposes Sudan cease-fire; army rejects call	The United Arab Emirates called on Tuesday for a cease-fire in Sudan during the coming holy month of Ramadan, a UAE official said, a call rejected by the Sudanese army, as the country's civil war approaches the two-year mark. The army considers the UAE to be an aggressor of the war, accusing it of arming the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, accusations U.N. experts and U.S. lawmakers have said are credible. The UAE denies these charges. The war in Sudan has created the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe, with more than 12 million people displaced, half the population hungry, and increasing fragmentation of the impoverished country. 'As we approach the holy month of Ramadan, a time of mercy and compassion, the UAE calls on all parties to honor this sacred period with a humanitarian cease-fire,' the UAE official said. 'We do not accept a Ramadan cease-fire until the siege is broken on all cities and areas that are besieged,' a high-level army source told Reuters when asked for comment. The RSF is currently engaged in an assault on the city of al-Fashir, the army's last remaining stronghold in the Darfur region, as it loses ground to the army in the capital Khartoum.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hynfj11yyjg	2025-02-11T07:48:35-08:00

In 1st for Italy, Tuscany approves right-to-die law	Tuscany approved on Tuesday a right-to-die law, becoming the first region in Roman Catholic Italy to regulate assisted suicide in the absence of national legislation on a highly controversial topic. Italy's constitutional court de-facto legalized the procedure in 2019, and urged parliament to pass a law to provide a clear legal framework. But the invitation has gone unheeded, with national politicians ducking the issue. Tuscany's regional law, which passed by a 27-13 majority, spells out how assisted suicide requests should be handled, including an obligation for a medical panel to consider applications within 30 days. If the criteria are met, the regional health service must provide the necessary medication and health care personnel within 10 days, unless the patient wants his own doctor to carry out the procedure. The law allows doctors to refuse to participate on moral or ethical grounds - similar to what is already allowed by national legislation on abortion for so-called conscientious objectors. Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since the 1940s.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjinrefkjl	2025-02-11T07:44:51-08:00

Government ministers met for 4 hours to discuss developments in negotiations on the deal in wake of Hamas announcement it would stop releasing hostages and US president's ultimatum; 'The entire cabinet supports Trump's revolutionary vision' The political-security cabinet met Tuesday for four hours for a discussion following Hamas' announcement that it would 'suspend the release of hostages,' and against the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump's advice to resume fighting if 'all the hostages' are not released by Saturday at noon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to issue a statement later Tuesday evening on the Israeli position following developments in the negotiations on the deal and the fear that the current crisis will lead to its collapse. A political source said after the cabinet meeting that all of its members expressed support for Trump's demand 'for the release of all the hostages by Saturday at noon and for his revolutionary vision for the future of Gaza.' Although Netanyahu landed in Israel from a visit to the U.S. on Sunday, amid fears that the deal would collapse, the cabinet was not scheduled to convene until Tuesday evening. 'The prime minister moved the cabinet meeting to the afternoon, brought forward due to Hamas' decision to violate the agreement,' the source said. 'Last night, the prime minister ordered the reinforcement of forces in and around the Gaza Strip, and to prepare for any scenario if Hamas does not release our hostages this coming Saturday,' the source added. 'The cabinet meeting lasted about four hours and was thorough and in-depth.' Although all the ministers expressed support for Trump's ultimatum, Israel actually decided to continue with the deal and not break the rules. Thus, if Hamas releases the three hostages who are supposed to be released on Saturday as part of the sixth round of releases, Israel will continue implementing the agreement from its perspective - it will release Palestinian prisoners and continue to bring humanitarian aid into Gaza. Prime Minister's spokesman Omer Dostri, meanwhile, addressed all ministers and instructed them: 'On behalf of the Prime Minister, I request that you not be interviewed on the subject of Gaza at this stage.' Even before the directive and shortly after the end of the discussion, Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a member of the cabinet, said that 'we adopt President Trump's words regarding the release of all the hostages and we adhere to them.' In an interview with 'Galei Israel,' Cohen said that 'anyone who thinks he can blackmail the State of Israel with such and such tricks - it will not happen.' According to him, 'we adhere to Trump's words regarding the release of all the hostages (by Saturday) and we adopt them. I see that they are actually saying that they will not abide by the agreement; This is already a violation of the deal.' The cabinet meeting in Jerusalem was delayed Tuesday morning due to the extension of the limited security consultation that Netanyahu had already held. The ministers discussed, among other things, Hamas' announcement to halt the release of the hostages, due to 'Israeli violations.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The New York Times reported Tueday, citing six Israeli sources familiar with the details of the negotiations and another source on behalf of the mediators, that the Israeli delegation, which left for Doha on Sunday and returned early Monday morning, was in fact a 'futile delegation.' According to the sources, the members of the delegation 'listened to the Qatari proposals, and announced that they must return to Israel so that its government can decide how to proceed.' Netanyahu actually delayed the discussions on Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, saying that he sees the talks on the deal he held in the U.S. on the 16th day of the first phase of a cease-fire with Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East, as the start of the talks. Against this backdrop, the cabinet Tuesday also discussed the mandate that will be given to the Israeli delegation that will deal with Phase II, and Netanyahu was supposed to bring the Israeli conditions to approval within this framework. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rvvxytkl	2025-02-11T07:28:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/17/rklMzZTvPJl/rklMzZTvPJl_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg
27 religious groups sue Trump administration to protect houses of...	More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans - ranging from the Episcopal Church and the Union for Reform Judaism to the Mennonites and Unitarian Universalists - filed a federal court lawsuit Tuesday challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services and other valuable church programs. The result, says the suit, infringes on the groups' religious freedom -namely their ability to minister to migrants, including those in the United States illegally. 'We have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,' said the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1zobefy1l	2025-02-11T07:07:39-08:00

Novelist Rushdie takes stand in trial of his accused stabber	The novelist Salman Rushdie showed a jury his blinded right eye on Tuesday as he testified against the man charged with trying to murder him at a talk at a rural New York venue in 2022. Hadi Matar, 26, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault brought by the Chautauqua County district attorney. Rushdie walked into the courtroom dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and gray tie. The right lens of his spectacles was blacked out, masking the eye, which his attacker's knife had pierced through to the optic nerve. Rushdie, who spent most of the 1990s in hiding in the UK after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel 'The Satanic Verses,' was stabbed about 15 times: in the head, neck, torso and left hand, blinding his right eye and damaging his liver and intestines. The trauma doctors who treated him after he was airlifted to a hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, said he lost so much blood he came close to death. 'He struck me a number of times, another half a dozen times,' Rushdie replied. 'At some point I thought I was dying. That was my immediate thought.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjcvnxyy1e	2025-02-11T07:03:36-08:00

The report states that 'the mental health system, which had difficulty functioning even before October 7, collapsed in the first days of the war.' Among other things, it was found that the Ministry of Health was not prepared for the scenario of evacuating residents during wartime and did not properly supervise the training of volunteers who came to help.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b17nn0dtjx	2025-02-11T05:22:04-08:00

Egypt threatens Israel peace deal if U.S. aid stops	U.S. president threatens to halt billions in aid to Egypt and Jordan unless they agree to take in Gaza refugees under his plan; Egyptian president suspends White House meeting amid worse bilateral relations in decades The Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty may be invalid if U.S. President Donald Trump carries out his threats to end American aid to Egypt, diplomatic sources in Cairo said in an article to the Qatari Al Araby al-Jadeen newspaper on Tuesday. The sources said the planned meeting in Washington betwee Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Trump has been suspended indefinately amid the worse crisis in U.S.-Egypt relations in three decades and Cairo's rejection of Trump's plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza while he rebuilds the Strip and settle them in neighboring Arab countires. U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks late Monday threatening to halt American aid to Egypt and Jordan if they refuse to accept Palestinian refugees, mark a turning point in the Palestinian issue, linking it to the longstanding relationships these countries have with the U.S. In January, the Trump administration froze all international U.S. aid for 85 days for 'review,' but exempted Israel and Egypt due to the ongoing war. Other sources told Saudi television network Al-Arabiya that 'Egypt has decided to take precautions against any potential halt of U.S. aid and has prepared emergency plans to deal with U.S. pressure regarding the displacement issue.' Egypt, the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel and Jordan, would be heavily impacted if the aid is cut off. According to Al-Masry Al-Youm, U.S. aid to Egypt is estimated at $2.1 billion, including $815 million in economic aid, with the rest allocated for military aid. The outlet also noted that the U.S. has often used aid as leverage against Egypt. The London-based Arab outlet Asharq Al-Awsat said in an article that Egypt’s exemption from the aid freeze 'was tied to its central role in Middle East security and the peace agreement with Israel.' Experts cited by the paper affirmed that the exemption 'would certainly be appreciated by Egyptian authorities, strengthening regional cooperation.' However, these assumptions are now in question after Trump’s recent remarks. While Egypt and Israel were exempted from the freeze, U.S. aid to Jordan, which heavily relies on foreign aid, was suspended. U.S. assistance to Jordan, valued at $1.4 billion, is crucial for the country’s economy, funding development programs and maintaining stability. Prior to the freeze, Jordan was expected to receive $2.1 billion in U.S. aid by 2025. King Abdullah II of Jordan is scheduled to meet Trump in Washington later on Tuesday. A few days after the announcement of the suspension of aid, King Abdullah visited Brussels, where he signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with the European Union. The agreement focuses on political, security, economic, trade, investment, and refugee issues and includes efforts to combat drug and arms smuggling into Jordan. Jordan and the U.S. share a long-standing relationship based on mutual interests, including cooperation on Islamic terrorism and international security. Jordan is a key U.S. ally, with American troops stationed there and U.S. weapons stored in the country. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Around 3,000 American soldiers are based in Jordan, operating under a secret agreement allowing access to 12 key Jordanian military bases. Jordan, not a NATO member, also conducts joint military training with other countries, including Israel. 'There have been crises in the past, both between Israel and Jordan and between Jordan and the U.S,' Prof. Ronen Yitzhak, head of the Middle East Studies department at the Western Galilee College and researcher at Tel Aviv University, said. 'After 1967, King Hussein claimed the U.S. was pro-Israel and didn’t pressure Israel to withdraw from the West Bank, but relations always remained behind the scenes.' Despite this, he stressed the strong anti-Western sentiment in Jordanian public opinion, which strongly supports Palestinians. A recent Jordanian nationwide poll expressed support for King Abdullah’s stance against 'the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza.' The king has backing from Arab states and popular support against Trump’s plan. 'Jordan sometimes pursues an independent policy, and Abdullah is not an American puppet,' Yitzhak Prof. added. 'The relationship between Jordan and the U.S. is not as it once was. There have been past tensions, such as after the Gulf War. What’s unclear now is Israel’s silence, as it should understand the implications of weakening Jordan’s government.' Yitzhak said he found it hard to believe Trump's threat would lead to aid completly being cut off. Both Egypt and Jordan have expressed opposition to the 'expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza' due to concerns over displaced people crossing into their territories. Egyptian officials said that 'any displacement would end the Palestinian issue,' while both Cairo and Amman have voiced support for a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. These countries view the issue as fundamental and economic threats are unlikely to change their position, but may lead to renewed preparations and alternative funding solutions. If Trump’s threats are carried out, they could lead to new alliances in the region that may not favor Israel. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a recent visit that 'Arab countries support the Palestinians and reject Trump’s plan.' He stressed the importance of rebuilding Gaza while Palestinians remain there. An official from another Arab state told CNN anonymously that 'it’s still unclear' whether the U.S. is actively working on the details of the plan to move Gaza’s residents, noting that Arab officials will discuss Gaza’s future with Trump. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjvoqn00t1l	2025-02-11T04:23:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/SJMn3kMKyg/SJMn3kMKyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF mulls permanent deployment in West Bank refugee camps	Prolonged presence aims to prevent terror cell rebuilding, with significant operational and political implications The IDF was considering deploying troops to refugee camps in and around the West Bank city of Tulkarm on a permanent or long-range basis, Ynet learned on Tuesday. As attention turns to the potential collapse of the ceasefire in Gaza, troops continued their sustained operation targeting terrorism within Palestinian refugee camps in the northern West Bank. The military's Central Command was evaluating the possibility of assigning a dedicated battalion to operate exclusively in the Tulkarm and Nur al-Shams refugee camps for several months. Discussions were also underway on the establishment of rapid deployment outposts in specific locations within the camps. The proposed battalion would focus on activity within the refugee camps with the aim to maintain a continuous and intensified operational presence, utilizing troops who are highly familiar with the geography of the camps and the networks of terror operatives operating there. In the past, IDF activity in the area was primarily intelligence-driven and dependent on the availability of battalions within the regional brigade. Such operations required varying levels of preparation and coordination at the brigade level. Should it be established, it would allow for a faster and more consistent response to emerging intelligence or terror threats within the camps. A sustained presence throughout most of the day would disrupt terror organizations' ability to regroup and rebuild their infrastructure. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A security official explained recently that after about a month of reduced IDF activity in Jenin—due to the involvement of Palestinian security forces—terror organizations managed to rebuild certain capabilities that had been dismantled during earlier operations. To prevent the rehabilitation of these networks, IDF is working on solutions to maintain a long-term presence in the camps. During the current operation, IDF troops have established barriers and checkpoints on the outskirts of the refugee camps, prompting residents to leave the camps. Most of the population has been evacuated, causing large traffic jams across the West Bank due to checkpoints at the entrances and exits of villages. If the 'Tulkarm Model' is implemented, IDF troops would be expected to remain stationed in the two adjacent refugee camps on a permanent basis at least in the coming months. Such a decision would carry significant operational, political, and civilian implications. 'IDF troops have been conducting operations in the northern West Bank as part of this sustained effort for several weeks. The activity will continue as long as required,' the IDF said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjs6p2ok1e	2025-02-11T04:06:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/H1lb925Pt1x/H1lb925Pt1x_1_60_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Government tells Supreme Court It's 'too soon' for October 7 inqu...	After families of fallen, captive ask court to compell Netanyahu to establish a National commission of Inquiry, ministers decides to postpone decision on probe into failings leading to October 7 massacre, for three months The government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it was too soon to launch an inquiry into the failings that led to the October 7 massacre by Hamas. Adv. Michael Ravilo acting as the private lawyer for the government informed the court that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed the cabinet to re-evaluate the decision to establish a National Commission of Inquiry in three months time. 'A significant majority of members of the government believe the time is not yet appropriate to form such a commission,' Ravilio said in response to a petition demanding the immediate establishment of the commission, by the families of murdered and abducted victims of the attack. In his statement Ravilo said that the ministers and Netanyahu spend three and a half hours discussing the matter on Sunday. 'According to the Cabinet Secretary, a majority of ministers agreed that the ongoing state of war makes this the wrong time to form a commission.' He said different proposals were considered on how to investigate the events that led to the massacre when the war ends, during the meeting. 'The prime minister, however, instructed the Cabinet to reconvene in 90 days to revisit the issue.' The discussion comes after the Supreme Court imposed a deadline two months ago requiring the government to act. During the recent session, tempers flared as several ministers criticized Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. Netanyahu voiced his strong opposition to the immediate formation of a National Commision of Inquiry. 'We cannot claim the war is over. We cannot afford to divert critical personnel from their responsibilities to focus on legal proceedings while Israel faces immense challenges,' he said. Concerns over personal accountability have fueled Netanyahu’s resistance, with fears that commission would place the blame for failures squarely on his shoulders. Most ministers sided with Netanyahu. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Attorney General questioned why the opinion of Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar had not been shared with ministers after he sent a letter outlining his insistance the the establishment of the commision is urgently needed and after he was barred from participating in the cabinet meeting.

What authority does he have to offer an opinion without being asked, and when it isn’t even related to him?' Bereaved families demand accountability Liad Baram, father of Staff Sergeant Itay Baram, who was killed in battle on October 7, expressed frustration in an interview with Ynet: 'I don’t understand why the state won’t commit to its people, to itself, to the bereaved families, to the hostages, to everyone. Why won’t they promise to establish this? It’s for us—not for external purposes. To this day, we haven’t received answers about what happened. Everything we know comes from our own investigation—conversations with Itay’s friends and commanders. The state hasn’t provided any answers. As a citizen and a bereaved father, I deserve an explanation for what led to this tragedy.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1uoosdtkx	2025-02-11T03:41:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/SymgqaoGkl/SymgqaoGkl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Sweden says arrested Islamist extrimist preparig terror attack	Suspect also suspected of aggravated participation in a terrorist organisation, preparation for attempted murder and preparing to violate legislation on the use of explosives, police says; Stokholm court convicts Swedish IS member of genocide, war crimes Swedish police said on Tuesday they had apprehended one person in the Stockholm area on suspicion of preparing terrorist crimes in a case concerning violent Islamist extremism. The person was suspected of preparation for a terrorist offence, aggravated participation in a terrorist organisation, preparation for attempted murder and preparing to violate legislation on the use of explosives, police said. The investigation was not linked to any previously ongoing cases, police said in a statement. Police conducted the operation in the capital area on Tuesday morning and the arrest unfolded calmly, they added, without identifying the suspect or giving detail on the potential target. In 2023, Sweden raised its terrorism alert to the second-highest level and warned of threats against Swedes at home and abroad after public burnings of the Muslim holy book, the Koran, outraged Muslims and triggered threats from jihadists. Also on Tuesday a court in Stockholm convicted a Swedish woman of genocide, crimes against humanity and gross war crimes committed in Syria in 2015 against women and children of the Yazidi religious minority, sentencing her to 12 years in prison. The woman, identified as 52-year-old Iraqi born, Lina Ishaq, returned to Sweden in 2020 and is currently serving time for other offences committed in Syria. 'The crimes constitute an exceptionally serious violation, not only of the life and integrity of specific individuals but also of fundamental human values and humanity,' Stockholm's district court said in its verdict on Tuesday. 'The woman kept them imprisoned and treated them as her property by holding them as slaves for a period of, in most cases, five months,' the court said.

Cease-fire faces collapse, what Hamas claims and Israel's respons...	Hamas military spokesperson accuses Israel of delaying the return of displaced Gazans, continuing operations in the Strip and blocking humanitarian aid; Israeli officials dismissed claims as baseless Hamas on Monday announced it would delay the release of hostages 'until further notice,' citing Israeli violations of the cease-fire agreement. The move threatens the cease-fire and the release of 17 remaining hostages in the first phase of the deal. The terror group demanded Israel 'compensate' it for recent events and said the delay would remain in effect until Israel recommits to the agreement. Hamas military spokesman Abu Obaida outlined the alleged violations: 'Delays in allowing displaced persons to return to northern Gaza, gunfire and shelling in various areas and failure to deliver agreed-upon aid, while we have upheld all our commitments.' Israeli officials rejected the claims, saying, 'They were reviewed and found baseless.' Hamas accused Israel of preventing northern Gaza residents from returning home on the agreement’s seventh day. According to the deal, the IDF was to withdraw from the coastal road and dismantle military installations, but the retreat was delayed by two days. Israeli forces had postponed their withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor after Hamas failed to release civilian hostage Arbel Yehud in the second hostage release round. Instead, Hamas freed four female IDF lookouts, prompting a temporary hold on civilian movement. After the issue was resolved, Gaza residents were seen crossing the road and returning north. Hamas later declared, 'The return of the displaced is a victory for our people and proof of the failure of Israel’s plans.' Hamas also accused Israel of continuing military operations throughout Gaza, despite the cease-fire agreement mandating a 'temporary pause in military activity' and an IDF pullback from populated areas along the border. The terror group claimed Israeli forces continued to engage, sometimes firing at civilians or terrorists. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF responded that its actions were in line with the agreement. 'Troops fired warning shots to deter individuals approaching forces operating in various areas,' a military statement read. 'The IDF remains committed to the deal to secure the return of hostages and will take necessary measures against immediate threats.' Hamas repeatedly claimed Israel violated the humanitarian provisions of the deal. The group terror argued that too few aid trucks had entered Gaza, citing a shortfall of 3,500 trucks from the agreed-upon 12,000. Hamas-affiliated media also reported shortages of 35 fuel trucks per day and 180,000 tents. Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) rejected Hamas's allegations, saying, 'All agreed-upon aid trucks have entered Gaza. Over 600 aid trucks crossed through Kerem Shalom, Erez and the 147 crossing near Kissufim.' Regarding caravans that have not yet been delivered, Israeli officials clarified that their supply is the responsibility of mediators. 'There are no trucks waiting for our approval at the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings or in Egypt,' a statement read. 'The mediators have yet to send them, so this does not stand as an Israeli violation.' Ynet’s military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai reported that Hamas leadership was unfazed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to 'let all hell break out' should the hostages not be released, as any repercussions would primarily affect mediators like Egypt, Qatar and Jordan. If Trump follows through on his warnings and lets ‘all hell break out,' as he put it, the mediators will bear the cost. While Hamas was unlikely to be directly impacted, the humanitarian aid flow — largely funded by Arab nations — could be affected. Pressure on Hamas’s leadership abroad could lead to renewed hostage releases if Israel agrees to certain aid concessions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syh0hsofje	2025-02-11T02:37:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/Byb18ziwFkl/Byb18ziwFkl_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Security Cabinet meets amid Hamas threat, Trump’s ultimatum	Ministers convene as Hamas halts hostage releases, citing alleged Israeli violations; families of hostages protest, demanding swift negotiations; Netanyahu faces increasing criticism from hostage families for delays, while Hamas dismisses Trump's ultimatum The security cabinet convened on Tuesday morning in Jerusalem to discuss Israel's position ahead of negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to present his conditions for the deal to continue. Earlier on Tuesday, the IDF announced that Shlomo Mansour who was 85-years old, the oldest among those abducted during the Hamas massacre was murdered on Oct. 7 and his body was being held in Gaza. The meeting came afte Hamas said in a statement that it would halt the release of hostages due to alleged Israeli violations. After U.S. President Donald Trump said Israel should resume its war in Gaza if all the hostages were not freed by mid-day Saturday, a Hamas official told Reuters that all parties to the cease-fire deal must respect their commitments. 'That is the only way to return the ‘prisoners’ (hostages).' He daid adding that threats would not help and would only 'complicate matters.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said ahead of the meeting that he intends to call on the cabinet to issue an ultimatum to Hamas in response to Trump’s remarks. He suggested measures such as cutting off the supply of water and electricity while 'opening the gates of hell' on the organization. 'We need to re-arrest released terrorists and announce that if anything happens to our hostages, we will impose sovereignty on an additional 5% of Gaza. We have international backing for this,' Smotrich said Speaking at a conference on integrating ultra-Othodox men into the military, Smotrich said. 'They care only about land. We must issue an ultimatum, gather Gaza’s residents in one place, maintain minimal control, and relocate them elsewhere. Trump’s plan is not just a slogan—that’s what I’ll tell the cabinet. No Hamas in Gaza means no enemies, no threats to Israel. The territory will once again become part of Israel, because it is ours and because it ensures the nation’s security.' Protests and families’ demands Ahead of the cabinet meeting, families of hostages and activists advocating for the full implementation of the agreement blocked Route 1 Israel's main highway from the coast to Jerusalem and later continued to demonstrate inside the capital. Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan was held captive in Gaza called on the prime minister to 'stop sabotaging the agreement and send a delegation to Doha with a full mandate to negotiate the next phase, which must lead to the simultaneous release of all remaining hostages.' 'Netanyahu dragged this agreement out for months. It’s now clear he is acting out of political considerations, dragging his feet, refusing to send a delegation to the negotiations, boasting, and doing everything to sabotage the agreement,' the protesters said. 'We’ve heard the latest testimonies—our loved ones are enduring hell in captivity and won’t survive there much longer. We demand that Netanyahu grant full authority to the negotiation team, commit to fully implementing the agreement, shorten the timeline, and bring everyone back at once. Get them out of hell.' Hostage families’ frustration Danny Algert, brother of hostage Itzik Algert, who was released in the first phase of the deal, addressed Trump’s ultimatum in an interview with Ynet. 'Terror organizations are the ones issuing ultimatums. Hamas has a strategic weapon—it’s called hostages—and they will exploit this card to the very end.' He said he knew that Netanyahu would not fully committ to the deal and would sabotage it. 'The announcement came from Hamas, but it was Netanyahu who dismantled the negotiation team, letting politicians interfere. He doesn’t want to proceed to the second phase.' Algert further criticized Netanyahu: 'He returned from the U.S. arrogant and out of touch, after enjoying luxury hotels with Elon Musk. He doesn’t understand the atmosphere here in the country. In the Knesset, he cynically announced that he wouldn’t continue the deal. This culture of power, money, and honor—now amplified with Trump—will ultimately lead to the death of these hostages.' A father’s perspective Rubi Chen, father of Staff Sgt. Itay Chen, who was killed in combat on October 7 and whose body is held in Gaza, also commented on Trump’s remarks. In an interview with Ynet, he said: 'Trump has been using phrases like ‘hell will break loose’ for a while. Last week, during my visit to the U.S., his team tried to clarify this, but it remains vague. I think part of what Trump is saying reflects an understanding that negotiations for the release of the last hostage must be accelerated.' Chen believes that Hamas will not release all the hostages without an end to the war. 'There’s only one alternative—a deal. The Israeli government had 16 months to reach a better agreement, but this is what we have. We’ve seen the condition of the released hostages, and as for the fallen, we may not even find them anymore.' He added: 'The main leverage we have right now is ending the war. Families of the fallen are also under immense pressure. The leverage being explained to us by the negotiation team is essentially Gaza’s reconstruction, and that’s already happening. It reminds me of what was said to the Goldin and Shaul families a decade ago—and we saw how that turned out.' The humanitarian toll Carmit Yitzhaki, aunt of Eden Yerushalmi, who was killed in captivity, responded to comments made during a Knesset debate between Netanyahu and opposition leader Yair Lapid regarding Eden’s physical condition at the time of her death. In an interview with Ynet, she said: 'Hearing about Eden’s weight again—when she was 5'5' and weighed only 80 lbs.—it’s horrifying. Every time, it shocks me anew.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I can’t believe no one knew about the inhumane conditions they endured. It’s hard to believe no one knew they were being starved. Everyone knows they aren’t in hotels—they’re in the hands of the cruelest enemy. I saw the last release and was appalled, but not surprised—skin and bones.' She continued: 'I believe the prime minister was shocked. No human being wouldn’t be. They looked terrible. If we had missed them by just a few days or weeks, they wouldn’t still be with us. We need to act quickly. We’re dealing with a cruel enemy, and I hope those responsible find a solution. It’s time to move to the second phase and bring everyone home. I hope Eden and the five hostages who were with her are the last to be murdered by Hamas.' Gaza: The Singapore\Haiti fulcrum Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador-designate to Israel, said in an interview with Fox News: 'Gaza could have been Singapore, but Hamas turned it into Haiti. Hamas will not be able to continue existing in Gaza in the future. It’s a done deal.' He reminded viewers that 'Gaza was once a place where both Jews and Palestinians lived until 2005, when Ariel Sharon decided to give everything to the Palestinians. Israel evacuated 10,000 Jews from Gaza, turning it into a fully Palestinian state. The result was what we saw on October 7.' Huckabee concluded: 'We don’t know exactly what will happen in Gaza, but we know what could have happened: Gaza could have been Singapore. Instead, Hamas turned it into Haiti—or worse. The only time we had real peace in this region was during the four years Donald Trump was president. With his bold and innovative leadership, I’m optimistic we’ll see something transformative—perhaps of biblical proportions—in the Middle East.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkl0ucuy1e	2025-02-11T02:02:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/ByerB6FOtJg/ByerB6FOtJg_0_252_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israel police arrests 28 pedophiles after undercover sting	Men suspected of sexual offenses against minors on Instagram and WhatsApp; 200 officers conduct raids, confiscating computers, mobile phones; 'I cannot stop thinking about you in every possible way,' one writes to cope posing as 13-year-old girl Israel Police said on Tuesday arrested 28 suspected pedophiles in a coordinated operation that included 200 officers in various locations around the country. The men were detained after a 2-month long undercover investigation of suspected sexual offenses against minors on Instagram and WhatsApp. Two female officers who identified online as 13-year-old girls corresponded with the suspects and received sexual content from them. The men allegedly initiated contact with the two agents and sent them photos and videos of a sexual nature, among other things. According to the police, they attempted to convince the agents to film themselves and send pictures, some even suggested a meeting with the '13-year old' girls. 'I fell in love with a cleaver 13-year-old with a pure soul. I cannot stop thinking about you in every possible way,' one of the suspects wrote. 'You have to stay in touch with me,' another wrote. 'You are important to me and I miss you.' On Tuesday, officers raided the homes of the suspects and collected evidence connecting them to the suspected offenses including computers and mobile phones. They were taken for questioning and my appear before court to be remanded, the police said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkzdui00f1l	2025-02-11T01:46:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/06/11/9300812/9300812_1_136_2000_1125_0_small.jpg
A group that needs to be eradicated': Rubio shocked at state of ...	U.S. Secretary of State calls terror group 'pure evil' in radio interview and reiterates Trump's promises to release all hostages and secure peace in Gaza U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Hamas in a radio interview on Monday, calling them 'monstrous' and 'pure evil' while discussing the condition of three recently released Israeli hostages — Ohad Ben Ami, Eliyahu Sharabi and Or Levy. 'I don’t think there’s any coincidence in the schedule that they’re being released where they obviously released the ones they thought were in the best condition first, then over time you’re starting to see the impact of this,' Rubio said. 'It’s incredibly revealing about what we’re dealing with. This is an evil organization. Hamas is evil. It’s pure evil. These are monsters. These are savages. That’s a group that needs to be eradicated,' he added. Referring to the treatment of the hostages, Rubio said, 'You look at these images of what they – first of all, the humiliation that they have to go through. Just put aside for a moment the horrifying conditions they were kept and the horrifying things that happened to some of those hostages, on top of the fact that these were innocent civilians. 'I mean, none of these were soldiers. These are not combatants. These are just people that were abducted for purposes of being used as leverage. And they’re getting, what, 200 certified killers in exchange for one innocent hostage.' Rubio also pointed out the disparity between Hamas terrorists and the suffering in Gaza. 'Do any of those Hamas fighters look like they’ve been skipping meals? Do any of those Hamas fighters that you see look like they’ve been suffering over the last year and a half? Clearly, these people are – the ones suffering are the people from Gaza, but not them,' he said. 'If they still are the dominant power in Gaza when all this is done, there is not going to peace in the Middle East.' Call for regional involvement in Gaza's reconstruction Rubio addressed U.S. plans for post-war Gaza and urged regional countries to participate. ' Gaza is a place that, in addition to all the damage it suffered in the war – Hamas hides in the tunnels. It’s the civilians who they hide behind and underneath that have suffered the consequences of this,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'But that’s a place where there’s all kinds of unexploded munitions and bombs that Hamas has, that’s been used in the conflict. Someone’s got to go in – for anybody to be able to live there, someone’s got to – you’ve got to clean it up. You’ve got to clean all that out of there even before you begin the process of removing rubble and debris and rebuilding housing, like permanent structures. Who’s going to do that?' He noted that U.S. President Donald Trump is the only leader so far who has committed to assisting in the endeavor. 'All these other leaders, they’re going to have to step up. If they’ve got a better idea, then now is the time. Now is the time for the other governments and other powers in the region, some of these very rich countries, to basically say, okay, we’ll do it. But we’re still waiting for more countries to step forward and say here’s what we’re willing to do. And right now, they’ve not been willing to do anything and – or at least anything concrete.' Opposition to a Palestinian state under Hamas or Hezbollah Speaking on the two-state solution, Rubio stressed that the issue is not Israel, but governance in Gaza. 'The big challenge for this whole two-state solution has not been Israel. It’s been: Who’s going to govern that second state? Who’s going to be in charge of it? If the people in charge of it are Hamas or Hizballah or anybody like that, these are groups that – whose goal is the destruction of the Jewish state.' he said. 'Why would any country in the world agree to create a second state on their border that is governed by armed elements who kidnap babies and murder babies and rape teenage girls and abduct innocents and whose stated goal and purpose for existing is your destruction?' Rubio reiterated Trump's vision for expanding peace agreements in the Middle East: ' Imagine a region where Israel now feels secure because of what’s happened in Lebanon and in Syria that they can enter into a peace deal with Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf kingdoms; a Sunni-Israeli peace deal akin to the Camp David Accords with Egypt and the peace with Jordan. President Trump has made very clear that part of his agenda is promoting peace in the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by5xxqofyg	2025-02-11T01:14:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/Bk8IE11rYJe/Bk8IE11rYJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Improvement noted, reforms required: Israel ranks 30th in Global ...	Israel still lags behind most Western nations; Transparency International warns corruption undermines efforts to combat climate change and democratic oversight mechanisms Slight, non-indicative improvement for Israel in the Global Corruption Index for 2024, ranking 30th in the world, (1st being the least corrupt, 180th the most corrupt) with a score of 64 on the 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), published this on Tuesday morning. This represents an improvement of three places compared to 2023, when Israel scored 62. The situation marks progress compared to 2021, when Israel was ranked 36th with a score of 59, approaching the 'red line' score of 50, below which countries are considered corrupt. Over the past decade, Israel's score has fluctuated between 59 and 64, with the same score of 64 recorded in 2016. The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), created by Transparency International, has been published annually since 1995 and ranks 180 countries. Its goal is to help businesses assess the level of corruption in countries where they consider conducting business. In Israel, the index is published by Transparency International Israel (Shvil), one of the organization’s 100 global branches. According to Transparency International Israel, the country’s score, which lags behind other Western nations, reflects, among other things, its failure to meet goals set to address the climate crisis. These include the anticipated failure to achieve the global target of carbon neutrality (Net Zero Emissions) by 2050, delays in implementing renewable energy targets, and general trends of corruption and weakening of democratic institutions and oversight mechanisms in the country. Transparency International Israel emphasized that the 2-point improvement in Israel's score on the 2024 index does not indicate a significant trend change and does not diminish the need to avoid harm to the judicial system and oversight mechanisms. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The least corrupt country in the world is Denmark, with a score of 90. It is followed by Finland (88), Singapore (84), New Zealand (83), Luxembourg (81), Norway (81), Switzerland (81), and Sweden (80). Other high-scoring countries include the Netherlands, Australia, Iceland, Ireland, Estonia, Uruguay, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Bhutan, Seychelles, Japan, and the United Kingdom. As noted, Israel is ranked 30th on the index, six places behind the United Arab Emirates and one place behind the United States. Countries ranked just below Israel include South Korea, Chile, and Lithuania. Slightly lower, with a score of 59, are Saudi Arabia and Qatar. At the bottom of the list is South Sudan, with a score of just 8, followed by Somalia, Venezuela, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Nicaragua, Sudan, and North Korea. Iran is near the bottom with a score of 23, slightly above Lebanon, which scored 22. Turkey is also in the lower part of the table with a score of 34, just ahead of Egypt, which scored 30. Transparency International (TI) warns: 'Addressing the climate crisis is one of the most significant global challenges for humanity. The world is at a critical juncture in its fight against climate change. Corruption exacerbates this struggle, and the international community must tackle the link between corruption and the climate crisis.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b100owddy1e	2025-02-10T23:22:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/ByZkFUKOye/ByZkFUKOye_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Trump to meet Jordan's King Abdullah II as he escalates pressure ...	Visit comes at a perilous moment for the ongoing cease-fire in Gaza as Hamas accuses Israel of violating the truce says it is pausing future release of hostages U.S. President Donald Trump will host Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday as he escalates pressure on the Arab nation to take in refugees from Gaza — perhaps permanently — as part of his audacious plan to remake the Middle East. The visit is happening at a perilous moment for the ongoing cease-fire in Gaza as Hamas, accusing Israel of violating the truce, has said it is pausing future releases of hostages and as Trump has called for Israel to resume fighting if all those remaining in captivity are not freed by this weekend. Trump has proposed the U.S. take control of Gaza and turn it into 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' with Palestinians in the war-torn territory pushed into neighboring nations with no right of return. He suggested on Monday that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt, longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid, as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza. 'Yeah, maybe. Sure, why not?' Trump told reporters. 'If they don’t, I would conceivably withhold aid, yes.' Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Trump’s plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country’s opposition to Trump’s idea was 'firm and unwavering.' In addition to concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked how he’d persuade Abdullah to take in Palestinians, Trump told reporters, 'I do think he’ll take, and I think other countries will take also. They have good hearts.' The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Trump since his January 20 inauguration. Trump announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump initially didn’t rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan. After Trump’s initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza 'temporarily' and sought an 'interim' period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction. But asked in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier that aired Monday if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory under his plan, he replied, 'No, they wouldn’t.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sypged00kye	2025-02-10T22:53:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/H1VSH0000YJg/H1VSH0000YJg_540_26_1912_1076_0_small.jpg

Kibbutz Kissufim and Mansour family informed by the military that based on intelligence gathered, they can confirm Shlomo was murdered during the massacre Shlomo Mansour, the oldest hostage held in Gaza was murdered during the Hamas massacre and his body was taken to Gaza by the terrorists, the IDF said on Tuesday. 'This is one of the hardest days in the history of our Kibbutz. Shlomo was for us more than a member of our community,' the kibbutz said in a statement. ' Mansour was a father, grandfather, true friend and the beating heart of our Kibbutz. His smile, humility and warmth were an inspiration to all of us. Our heats are broken over our failure to bring him back to us alive. The entire community is grieving our loss.' Hamas terrorists abducted Sholomo and his wife Mazal during the Oct. 7 massacre. Mazal managed to break away. Shlomo who was 85, weighing only 57 kilograms and without his hearing aids, was then kidnapped into Gaza in his own car. Mansour, who survived the pogrom against Iraqi Jews – the Farhoud, as a young boy was among the founders of Kibbutz Kissufim.

This is the number 1 struggle for new immigrants	New olah Miriam Aviva Ross shares her Aliyah struggles and how one organization proved 'essential to my success' When Miriam Aviva Ross arrived in Israel a month and a half ago, she didn’t know a word of Hebrew. Navigating the country’s bureaucracy proved to be a real challenge, she told ILTV. Fortunately, she found support through Belong, an organization dedicated to helping new immigrants. 'Belong was hugely helpful in getting me in contact with the immigration authorities, translating documents so that I knew what I needed to fill out, what to bring, and even the staff offering to come to my appointments with me to translate in real time,' Ross said. She first heard about Belong from her brother, who had moved to Israel from the United States a few years earlier. When he learned that she was interested in making aliyah, he immediately connected her with the organization for support. 'You know you’re not just going to need help with one thing. It’s going to be a whole range of things,' Ross recalled her brother telling her. 'You’ll only really realize when you get here you’re not able to do everything.' Though thrilled to be in Israel, Ross acknowledged that the process of moving to a new country is challenging. 'So, Belong has honestly been essential to my success in establishing myself here,' she said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyp0apof1l	2025-02-10T21:33:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/Bk11Wk00dYJl/Bk11Wk00dYJl_0_9_537_303_0_small.jpg
Restoring trust in the IDF': Soldiers helping reconstruct Kibbut...	Troops from three units under the military's Technological and Logistics Directorate say they feel obligated to restore life to the kibbutz ravaged by Hamas on October 7 Following the release of hostages Ohad Ben Ami and Eliyahu (Eli) Sharabi from captivity in Gaza on Saturday, Kibbutz Be’eri has begun a long process of rebuilding after Hamas’ October 7 attack. Amid bullet-riddled walls and markings left by ZAKA emergency teams, three IDF units are working not only to restore structures but also to rebuild trust between the kibbutz and the army, which failed to protect it on October 7 — the day 101 Be’eri residents were killed, 31 kidnapped and entire neighborhoods burned to the ground. Initially met with skepticism, the teams from the IDF’s Technological and Logistics Directorate have since repaired over 40 buildings and kindergartens, becoming an integral part of the community. The effort began with a simple social media post by a member of Be’eri’s alert squad, seeking volunteers to help prepare temporary housing for displaced families in Kibbutz Hatzerim. The IDF division took notice and joined the initiative. 'The repairs aren’t just physical; they’re also about restoring trust in the IDF,' says Col. (res.) Kobi Dostkam, who oversees the project. 'For us, fixing the homes — some of which were damaged by IDF operations — is about taking responsibility. We treat this like a military mission, with morning and evening briefings.' When asked how the kibbutz members have responded to the troops’ aid, he says, 'they’ve welcomed us with open arms.

Cartoons drawn by IDF officer turn into Gaza war diary	After his brigade commander recognized his talents, Col. A.'s daily cartoons in Gaza turned into depictions of bravery, resolve and memories of the fallen Col. A. vividly recalls the first cartoon he drew at the start of the IDF’s ground operation in Gaza — his brigade commander as a lion, standing on the ruins of a destroyed building in the north of the Strip. 'I left the brigade commander a keepsake so he'd know I was there,' he says. Pleased, the commander asked him to draw a daily cartoon, which became a tradition. Some of his cartoons depicted combat, while others provided updates on events in Israel and abroad. 'We were completely cut off from phones and radio,' he explains. 'People looked forward to it every day, asked when I'd draw and even suggested ideas.' After three rounds of fighting in the south and north, A. completed his service with the brigade and took command of the 185th 'Galil-Golan' Brigade. 'Our motto, 'Anytime, anywhere, for any mission,' isn't just words,' he says. 'Reservists call each other 'brother' because they don’t always remember names — but they'd die for one another. We're all in this together.' A., a lawyer with a background in high-tech, lives in Mitzpe Ilan with his wife and five children. He describes his drawing skills as 'just a hobby.' His collection of cartoons became a wartime journal offering a unique perspective. His most memorable drawings include: a commander always seen with a book, even before battle; a battalion commander lifting a stuck vehicle with one hand; humanitarian aid drifting in the wind toward the brigade’s combat zone; soldiers making do with canned food in what they dubbed 'Jabaliya Restaurant' and fitness training where troops replaced weights with water bottles. The brigade lost 21 soldiers during the war in Gaza. A. honored them through his cartoons. One, dedicated to Capt. (res.) Yuval Halivni, Master Sgt. (res.) Avihay Amsalem and Maj. (res.) Eitan Menachem Neeman — killed in the October 9 battle for Sderot — depicts the three arches at the Shaar HaNegev junction, now wrapped in yellow ribbons for the hostage-release campaign. 'They connected in my mind with commemorating the three fallen soldiers,' he says. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another cartoon commemorates Sgt. Maj. (res.) David Schwartz from Alon Shvut and Sgt. 1st Class (res.) Yakir Hexter from Jerusalem, who studied together at the Har Etzion Yeshiva. 'At the funeral in Gush Etzion, I was shown a photo of them studying together,' A. recalls. 'I depicted them in uniform with their gear, symbolizing both their bond as students and their fate as soldiers.' One illustration shows Master Sgt. (res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot and Master Sgt. (res.) Eyal Meir Berkowitz holding the biblical Tablets of the Law. 'It represents the victory achieved in battle thanks to them,' says A. Another, depicting angel wings, portrays a mass-casualty incident where he oversaw the evacuation of 13 wounded soldiers in a dense urban area. 'The relief I felt when the rescue jeep arrived is indescribable,' he says. One of his most significant drawings is inspired by The Last Supper, painted on the ruins of a destroyed building where troops had gathered before leaving Gaza. 'On the table, instead of food, there are explosives, mines and bombs,' he says.

Seeking legitimacy: Abbas moves to end stipends for terrorists, f...	In a controversial move, Palestinian Authority President cancels laws providing financial support to families of terrorists and prisoners; Hamas and Islamic Jihad call move a 'blatant surrender to US and Zionist pressure' Has the final curtain fallen on payments to terrorists and their families? Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas issued a presidential decree on Monday canceling laws that allowed financial payments to families of prisoners in Israeli jails or to families of terrorists killed during attacks. This decision quickly drew condemnation from terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. According to the previous Palestinian policy, anyone imprisoned or harmed due to their involvement in terrorism was entitled to a salary and a stipend for their family. Additionally, families of terrorists killed in attacks received monthly support. Under this system, the severity of the punishment imposed on the terrorist determined the amount of the salary—the harsher the punishment, the higher the payment. Abbas’ presidential decree cancels provisions within the laws and regulations that governed these financial payments to the families of prisoners, deceased, and injured terrorists. According to the decree, 'all families receiving payments under the previous legislation will now fall under the same guidelines as families benefiting from social welfare programs. The authorities for the social welfare programs in the Palestinian Authority have been transferred to the Palestinian Economic Empowerment Fund, which will take responsibility for providing social care to all Palestinian families without discrimination.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Palestinian Economic Empowerment Fund is an independent legal entity managed by a board of trustees appointed by Abbas. It operates in accordance with the law, with clearly defined tasks and transparent mechanisms, and is subject to administrative and financial oversight, including monitoring by international institutions to ensure transparency, proper procedures, and fair distribution of resources. Under the new decree, the fund will strive to collect all necessary funds, grants, and allocations for its various distribution categories, particularly in light of the significant increase in families requiring social care, support, and empowerment following the recent war in Gaza and the West Bank. The goal, as stated, is to strengthen the resilience of the Palestinian people and support the adoption of diverse social systems. Officials in Ramallah noted that this move was made as part of efforts to bolster the Palestinian Authority’s standing and legal position at the United Nations and other international bodies, with the aim of achieving international recognition and full membership for the State of Palestine. This initiative is also part of broader efforts to protect key national interests. According to the Palestinian Authority, 'We must implement development and economic recovery plans, support reconstruction efforts, and work toward lifting the financial blockade and halting the illegal deductions imposed by Israeli occupation authorities on Palestinian taxpayers’ money, which amount to billions.' Predictably, terror organizations are less than thrilled Hamas condemned the move. 'We denounce Abbas’ decision to cancel the financial stipends for the families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded, abandoning their national cause at a time when the people and resistance forces are working to protect the rights of released prisoners and to support their livelihoods,' the terrorist organization said. 'This behavior is unpatriotic and represents a betrayal of one of the core national principles. We call for an immediate reversal of this decision and for resistance to Israeli and U.S. pressure.' Islamic Jihad also criticized the Palestinian Authority’s decision. 'We condemn the decision by the Ramallah Authority to cancel financial stipends for the families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded. This decision is a clear abandonment of the prisoner issue and a blatant surrender to U.S. and Zionist pressure. Halting stipends for prisoners, especially at a time when resistance forces have achieved victories over the enemy through prisoner exchanges, is an attempt to weaken our people’s morale and a betrayal of those who have sacrificed years of their lives behind bars.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj25dgofje	2025-02-10T20:00:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/24/B19009FBz6/B19009FBz6_0_83_1300_732_0_small.jpg

State Department says in a statement that it reiterates the 'importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza and stressed Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again' Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday that Arab states rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's widely condemned plan to displace Palestinians in Gaza and take control of the enclave. Egypt's foreign ministry said Abdelatty, in a meeting in Washington, stressed the importance of expediting Gaza's reconstruction while Palestinians remained there. A statement by the U.S. State Department after the meeting did not explicitly mention Trump's plan but added that Rubio 'reiterated the importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza and stressed Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again.' Abdelatty said he was looking forward to working with the new U.S. administration to achieve 'comprehensive and just peace and stability' in the region, according to the Egyptian foreign ministry statement. He also met with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in a separate meeting, where he echoed similar statements, the foreign ministry said.

Israel denies ICJ commitment to investigate October 7 attack desp...	Senior officials deny Gali Baharav-Miara’s claim Israel told World Court it would establish state inquiry with Netanyahu’s approval; 'The prime minister never approved such a thing,' they say Israeli officials on Monday denied Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara’s claim that Israel had informed the International Court of Justice (ICJ) of plans to establish a state commission of inquiry into the failures surrounding the October 7 Hamas attack. Senior officials said Baharav-Miara’s statement, made during a heated government meeting a day earlier, was incorrect. 'Israel never committed to establishing a commission of inquiry in The Hague, and the prime minister never approved such a thing,' the officials said. The meeting, during which several ministers criticized Baharav-Miara, was held in response to a High Court of Justice-mandated discussion on forming a state commission to investigate the attack. When the attorney general questioned why Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar’s opinion had not been shared with ministers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted angrily. 'He’s a clerk; how is he relevant to this matter?' Netanyahu reportedly said, later questioning Bar’s authority to express an opinion on the issue. Baharav-Miara defended her stance, saying Israel had conveyed to the ICJ that it intended to establish a state commission of inquiry. Netanyahu responded, 'Who authorized this?' to which she replied, 'You did, sir.' However, officials pushed back on her assertion, saying Israel had merely stated that its legal system allows for investigative bodies capable of probing decision-makers but had never committed to forming one. 'The prime minister never approved such a thing,' the officials said, adding that the ICJ prosecutor is demanding an investigation into Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant's conduct over the course of the war, whereas the proposed commission would focus solely on the failures leading to October 7. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'This was not promised to the prosecutor, it is unrelated, and even if it had been, it would not be relevant, as the prosecutor is seeking a criminal investigation,' they said. Baharav-Miara’s office declined to comment on the officials’ claims. Knesset debate over inquiry commission intensifies The issue of establishing a state commission of inquiry was also at the center of faction meetings in the Knesset. National Unity Party leader Benny Gantz criticized the government’s hesitation, calling it 'complete detachment' from reality. 'The idea of not establishing a state commission of inquiry into the greatest disaster to befall the Jewish people since the Holocaust is unacceptable,' he said. Gantz dismissed claims that the High Court bore responsibility for the attack, calling such arguments 'pathetic spin.' He emphasized that a state commission would have full authority to subpoena key figures but warned that political and security officials must take responsibility. 'The October 7 disaster is a defining event in Israel’s history. It must be thoroughly investigated, and the only way to do so is through a state commission of inquiry,' he said. Opposition leader Yair Lapid announced a nationwide signature campaign demanding the establishment of an inquiry. 'The government is doing everything to bury the state commission of inquiry,' he said. 'They postponed it by another three months because they don’t want us to know the truth—why the prime minister ignored intelligence, why they strengthened Hamas and why the hostages are still not home.' Lapid accused the government of trying to avoid accountability. 'This was the greatest disaster in our nation’s history, and they are doing everything to avoid responsibility,' he said. Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Liberman echoed the criticism, arguing that the failure to establish a commission showed the government prioritized political survival over security concerns. 'A leader who refuses to investigate is a leader unwilling to take responsibility,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1x3eyufkx	2025-02-10T12:54:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/02/02/H1HoGst3o/H1HoGst3o_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

As Trump weighs Iran strategy, Israeli expert says 'deal better f...	As Iran rapidly approaches nuclear armament, the US president is aiming to corner the Islamic Republic into accepting a new deal, one that he hopes would have better terms for the US and Israel than the 2015 JCPOA agreement U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent statements on the possibility of reviving a nuclear agreement with Iran have reignited debates over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and regional security in the Middle East. Iran is inching closer to nuclear capability, with enrichment infrastructure decentralized across fortified underground sites, and the stakes for international security have never been higher. President Trump aims to position himself as a master dealmaker, capable of extracting significant concessions from Iran, but experts remain skeptical as to whether his strategy can yield tangible results. President Trump’s approach to Iran has oscillated between economic pressure and the promise of negotiation. Meir Litvak, director of the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies at Tel Aviv University, told The Media Line that the president sees himself as 'the ultimate dealmaker' and remains convinced that he can secure a better agreement than the one negotiated under President Barack Obama. In 2015, President Obama signed a deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under that plan, Iran agreed to put limits on its nuclear program and to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor its nuclear facilities. In return, it received relief from international sanctions. In 2018, President Trump withdrew from the agreement, which he called 'a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.' Litvak explained that the president aimed to apply pressure on Iran to force the country to agree to a better deal. That attempt failed, he said, 'and now we’re facing a situation where Iran is much closer to nuclear capability.' International watchdogs estimate that Iran has enriched uranium to levels rapidly approaching weapons-grade, with the country poised to start producing nuclear weapons within weeks. 'By lifting Iran’s sanctions, Washington may push Tehran further away from China in the process.' Nima Baheli, an Iranian political analyst, said that President Trump’s strategy may be focused on reducing China’s influence in the Middle East. 'By lifting Iran’s sanctions, Washington may push Tehran further away from China in the process,' Baheli told The Media Line. That strategy would fit into President Trump’s tendency to prioritize economic pragmatism over long-term political stability. But since China is Iran’s major oil consumer, a diplomatic break between the two countries is unlikely, Litvak said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of reentering into negotiations with the U.S. 'Negotiating with such a government should not be done; it is neither wise, intelligent, nor honorable,' Khamenei said. Litvak described Khamenei’s recent statement as 'a major disappointment.' 'Until a week ago, there were signs that Khamenei was willing to make negotiations with the U.S.,' he said. 'The JCPOA was a bad deal, but it was better than the alternative. We are in a worse situation today than we were in 2015.' The supreme leader’s refusal to negotiate is a sign of his deep-seated distrust of American diplomacy, fueled by President Trump’s abrupt withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018. According to Baheli, his refusal is not representative of the will of the entire Iranian regime. 'We also see how more and more representatives, both politicians and military figures, seem to be asking the supreme leadership to review the Iranian nuclear doctrine,' he said. Alongside talk of the U.S. reentering into negotiations with Iran, President Trump has also suggested that Israel or the U.S. might strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. But Baheli noted that the strategic positioning of Iran’s nuclear sites would make doing so difficult. 'There are many structures scattered on the territory, and above all, they are screened from the mountains, from the rocks,' he said. Iran adopted its policy of nuclear site decentralization following Israel’s 1981 strike on Iraq’s Osirak reactor. Many Israelis prefer a military response to Iran over a diplomatic solution, but Litvak is an advocate for renewed negotiations. 'I am one of those Israelis who believe that a deal is better for Israel,' he said. 'The JCPOA was a bad deal, but it was better than the alternative. We are in a worse situation today than we were in 2015.' On Friday, President Trump told the New York Post that he would rather make a deal with Iran than end up 'bombing the hell out of it.' 'If we made the deal, Israel wouldn’t bomb them,' he said. For Litvak, the ambiguity of that statement is concerning. 'There is a problem in the statement in which he said that if he will reach a deal, Israel will not have to bomb Iran. That can mean either a veiled threat against Iran or that he is willing to give Israel a green light in case there is no deal,' he said. As President Trump continues to push for a new Iran deal, the reality remains that the Islamic Republic is unlikely to embrace major concessions without ironclad guarantees. 'As long as Khamenei is alive, he would not allow any serious rapprochement with the U.S.,' Litvak said. Facing an obstinate Khamenei and an Islamic Republic rapidly approaching nuclear armament, the president’s skills as dealmaker-in-chief are being put to the test, with international security hanging in the balance.

Hamas: Hostage release delay is a warning to Israel	Egypt says hostage deal talks on hold, awaiting US signal on next steps; Israel sees group's move as psychological pressure to gain leverage in negotiations, not collapse of deal; Hamas says warning allows mediators time to act Hamas said Monday that its decision to halt the release of hostages 'until further notice' is meant as a warning to Israel and an attempt to pressure it into fully adhering to the terms of the cease-fire agreement. 'The delay in releasing prisoners is a message of warning to Israel and a means to pressure it to strictly comply with the agreement,' Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida said in a statement. Hamas added that it intentionally announced the delay five days in advance to give mediators sufficient time to push Israel to meet its commitments while keeping the door open for the exchange to proceed on schedule. An Israeli official called Hamas’ announcement 'concerning' but noted there was still time to resolve the crisis before Saturday. Israeli negotiators believe Hamas’ move is a pressure tactic rather than a collapse of the deal. 'Mediators, including the U.S., have a vested interest in ensuring the upcoming releases proceed,' the official said. Jerusalem sees Hamas’ actions as part of an effort to maximize its leverage in negotiations and apply psychological pressure, rather than an outright rejection of the deal. Israeli officials believe Hamas’ delay is primarily aimed at securing increased humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza and bolstering its position ahead of further talks. The decision also reflects internal power struggles between Hamas leaders in Gaza and those abroad, Israeli sources said. Meanwhile, two Egyptian security sources told Reuters that mediators fear a breakdown of the cease-fire agreement after Hamas' announcement. Hamas negotiators said U.S. guarantees for the cease-fire were no longer in place given a plan by President Donald Trump to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, and mediators postponed talks until a clear indication of Washington's intent to continue the phased deal was received. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas claims Israel has failed to meet key commitments under the agreement, including allowing displaced Gazans to return to northern Gaza, halting military strikes and facilitating humanitarian aid deliveries. Hamas spokesman Abd al-Latif al-Qanou accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being responsible for the delay. 'We call on mediators to pressure Israel to fully implement the cease-fire agreement,' he told Qatar’s Al-Araby TV. Hamas officials also cited recent statements from Netanyahu and other Israeli ministers regarding a potential return to fighting, as well as Israel’s conditions for the second phase of negotiations, which reportedly include the expulsion of Hamas leaders and the dismantling of its military wing. Israeli officials say U.S. and regional mediators are now working to bring Hamas back in line with the agreement. They believe Hamas is not seeking to collapse the deal but rather to extract additional concessions, particularly on aid shipments. The hostage deal, now in its first phase, was set to include the release of 33 hostages. So far, 16 have been freed, with 17 more expected in the coming days. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjzrw0vyje	2025-02-10T10:59:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/r1gyNt1K1x/r1gyNt1K1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hamas: Hostage release delay is a warning to Israel	Hamas said Monday that its decision to halt the release of hostages 'until further notice' is meant as a warning to Israel and an attempt to pressure it into fully adhering to the terms of the cease-fire agreement. 'The delay in releasing prisoners is a message of warning to Israel and a means to pressure it to strictly comply with the agreement,' the terrorist group said in a statement. Hamas added that it intentionally announced the delay five days in advance to give mediators sufficient time to push Israel to meet its commitments while keeping the door open for the exchange to proceed on schedule.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1q24adyye	2025-02-10T10:35:17-08:00

Reports by international outlets spark backlash against security forces in Jerusalem after arrest of bookstore owners accused of selling terror-inciting materials International media outlets, including CNN and The New York Times, criticized Israel after police detained Palestinian booksellers in East Jerusalem on suspicion of selling books containing incitement and support for terrorism. 'Last night, detectives conducted searches at two bookstores suspected of selling materials with inciting content,' Israel Police said in a statement. 'The suspects were arrested and investigators uncovered numerous books with Palestinian incitement on nationalistic background, including a children’s coloring book titled 'From the River to the Sea.'' The suspects, in their 30s, were arrested, questioned and brought in for a remand in their detention.

Mediators fear a breakdown of the Gaza cease-fire agreement, two Egyptian security sources said on Monday, after Hamas said Israel was not serious about executing the deal and announced it would stop releasing hostages until further notice.

Netanyahu, Trump effigies paraded in cages in Tehran	Marking 46th anniversary of Islamic Revolution, Iranian regime supporters parade effigies of US, Israeli leaders in cages through capital; amid 'Death to Israel' and 'Death to America' chants, officials denounce Western sanctions and vow resistance Tens of thousands of Iranians took to the streets Monday to mark the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, with celebrations featuring anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric, military displays and effigies of U.S. and Israeli leaders in cages. The annual event, commemorating the 1979 overthrow of Iran’s pro-Western monarchy, took place amid heightened tensions over threats from Israel and the U.S. regarding Iran’s nuclear program. In Tehran, a central display featured a person dressed as U.S. President Donald Trump 'under arrest,' alongside effigies of Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depicted as prisoners in a cage. Thousands of demonstrators, waving Iranian flags and banners, marched through the capital’s streets chanting 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel' despite freezing temperatures. Military displays in Tehran’s Azadi Square included mock-ups of Iranian missiles, while participants posed for photos in front of anti-Western exhibits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I know there are many economic problems in the country, but I’m here to say we will support our country no matter how much Trump and the Israelis threaten us,' said Mohsen Amini, a 48-year-old teacher attending the event. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, marking his first revolution anniversary since taking office last year, delivered a speech blaming Israel for regional instability and accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy in its dealings with Tehran. 'If Washington is sincere about wanting to negotiate with us, why did it impose new sanctions?' he asked, vowing that Iran would not succumb to foreign pressure. He also accused Trump of trying to bring Iran 'to its knees.' The celebrations come as Iran faces economic turmoil from years of sanctions imposed over its nuclear program, its support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and human rights abuses. Last week, Trump announced he would reinstate the 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran, imposing additional sanctions unless Tehran agrees to new terms on its nuclear program. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei rejected the idea of talks, calling negotiations with the U.S. 'neither wise nor dignified.' State television broadcast celebrations across Iran, urging citizens to participate. The revolution’s anniversary is a public holiday, with schools and government offices closed. A delegation from Hamas, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, also attended the events in Tehran. Al-Hayya condemned Western proposals for Gaza’s future, declaring, 'We will bring them down as we brought down the projects before them.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1zercpy1l	2025-02-10T08:53:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BJcRB4DFye/BJcRB4DFye_18_36_1073_604_0_small.jpg

Accused killer of American journalist Marie Colvin is free in Syr...	Activists and human rights groups are demanding the prosecution of Khaled al-Fares, who is accused of aiding Syrian forces in tracking down and killing American journalist Marie Colvin in 2012 Protests have erupted in Damascus and other parts of Syria over the return of Khaled al-Fares, a man accused of war crimes under the rule of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Activists and human rights groups are calling for his prosecution, citing his alleged involvement in tracking American journalist Marie Colvin, leading to her assassination in 2012. Al-Fares, who fled Syria after the fall of the Assad regime, arrived in Damascus from Dubai last week. His reappearance, along with the reopening of his car dealership on the Hama-Homs road, has fueled widespread anger. According to sources speaking to The Media Line, he now moves freely between Homs and Damascus, despite the accusations against him. Documents obtained by The Media Line suggest that al-Fares was a leading operative in a spy network for the former regime and a member of the pro-Assad National Defense Forces in Homs. Testimonies from defected regime members reportedly link him to Colvin’s death. Colvin, a renowned foreign correspondent for The Sunday Times, was covering the Syrian conflict from Baba Amr in Homs when she was killed in an artillery strike on February 22, 2012. French photojournalist Rémi Ochlik was also killed in the attack. U.S. court documents from a 2019 lawsuit against the Assad government confirm that Syrian forces deliberately targeted Colvin’s position after receiving intelligence from regime informants, one of whom was allegedly al-Fares. Al-Fares is also accused of drug trafficking and leading the so-called 'death squad,' which carried out massacres against civilians, including the April 18, 2011, Homs Clock Tower massacre and a brutal attack on Baba Amr in 2012. 'A notorious criminal is being reintroduced in Syria. … It seems many criminals are working to settle their status with the new regime, under public applause and media silence.' The Syrian Committee for Human Rights has urged the new government to prosecute al-Fares rather than allow him to live freely. Syrian activist Najm al-Din al-Najm criticized the lack of accountability, telling The Media Line, 'A notorious criminal is being reintroduced in Syria. … It seems many criminals are working to settle their status with the new regime, under public applause and media silence.' He added, 'Al-Fares returned to Damascus after fleeing to the UAE for a month. Now he moves freely between Homs and Damascus and has opened a car showroom. He was a thug tasked with monitoring journalists in Homs and provided Marie Colvin’s coordinates to the regime, leading to her precise targeting and killing by artillery shelling. He was personally rewarded by Maher al-Assad for this.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After al-Fares allegedly provided intelligence leading to Colvin’s death, Maher al-Assad, commander of the Fourth Division and brother of the Syrian president, reportedly gifted him a Hyundai Genesis as a reward. Tamer Turkmani, a human rights activist, confirmed to The Media Line that al-Fares’ involvement in war crimes is well-documented. Similarly, Syrian politician Maher Sharaf al-Din accused al-Fares of drug trafficking for the Assad regime and playing a direct role in Colvin’s assassination. Al-Fares’ return has raised broader concerns about the lack of accountability for war crimes in Syria. Since protests demanding his prosecution began, the Syrian government has remained silent. Many Syrians continue to call for transitional justice, hoping that those responsible for atrocities will eventually face trial. Marie Colvin was one of the most respected war correspondents of her time, known for reporting from the front lines of conflicts in Kosovo, Chechnya, and Sri Lanka. In her final dispatch, she provided firsthand accounts of the suffering of civilians in Homs under relentless bombardment by Assad’s forces. In 2013, Stony Brook University in New York established the Marie Colvin Center for International Reporting in her memory. Her family also founded the Marie Colvin Memorial Fund, which is supported by the Long Island Community Foundation and raises donations in her name to honor her humanitarian legacy. Colvin’s family filed a civil lawsuit against the Syrian government in 2016, arguing that senior officials had orchestrated her assassination. In 2019, a U.S. court found the Assad regime responsible and awarded $302 million in damages to her family. The ruling confirmed that Colvin’s death was not accidental but a targeted killing meant to silence her reporting on the Syrian conflict. Despite these international legal actions, al-Fares has not been held accountable for his alleged role in her killing. His ability to return to Syria and resume business activities has only intensified calls for justice. The broader implications of al-Fares’ return Al-Fares’ case is a stark reminder of the broader issue of impunity in Syria. The Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the displacement of millions. While some former regime figures have been prosecuted in European courts under universal jurisdiction, many alleged war criminals continue to live freely within Syria. The ongoing protests against al-Fares’ return reflect a deep frustration among Syrians seeking justice for war crimes committed during the conflict. Activists argue that without legal consequences for figures like al-Fares, true reconciliation and stability in Syria will remain elusive. For now, al-Fares’ presence in Syria continues to stoke outrage, with calls growing louder for his prosecution. Whether the Syrian government will respond remains uncertain, but the demand for accountability is unlikely to fade.

Israeli officials emphasized that Israel has upheld its commitments, including withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor, opening the Rafah crossing and repositioning its forces as required under the deal. Discussions in Doha focused on various aspects of implementing the first phase of the agreement, which is now at risk.

Former hostage completes medical evaluations as wife Shiri and sons Ariel and Kfir remain in captivity; family says Yarden committed to fighting for return of his loved ones and feels a deep duty to ensure no one is left behind Yarden Bibas was discharged Monday from Sheba Medical Center after completing all necessary medical evaluations, roughly a week and a half after being freed from Hamas captivity. His family emphasized that while his release is a step forward, the journey to recovery remains incomplete. 'The road to healing is still long, and it won’t truly be whole until Shiri, Ariel, Kfir and all the hostages are back home,' the family said in a statement, referring to Yarden's wife and two young sons who were abducted separately on October 7 and remain in Gaza.

They also thanked the Israeli public for 'the overwhelming support and warm embrace during these difficult days' and requested that both the public and the media respect their privacy to allow Yarden time and space to heal.

The statement did not specify if any arrests were made or provide details on the identities of the suspects. Lebanon’s army has been conducting security operations across the country as it seeks to curb the proliferation of illegal weapons, particularly in areas where armed groups and smuggling networks are active. The raid was unrelated to Lebanon’s cease-fire agreement with Israel, which mandates that the army prevent non-state groups, namely Hezbollah, from maintaining weapons in the country’s south along the Israeli border.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sycreuvykx	2025-02-10T03:46:21-08:00

He noted that many young men had fled Syria to avoid the compulsory conscription imposed by the previous government, which had become a significant concern for Syrians after the country’s war erupted in 2011. During the interview, Sharaa renewed his call for the lifting of Western sanctions on Syria, arguing that there is growing consensus among visitors to Damascus that the restrictions should be removed. He said Syria faces significant security challenges and stressed that economic development is essential for achieving stability. Without growth, he warned, the country could face further chaos and insecurity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqgw00ptyl	2025-02-10T03:30:51-08:00	
Israeli delegation returns from Doha; Palestinian official says I...	The delegation dealt only with Phase I of the cease-fire and hostage return deal; Netanyahu will convene the cabinet Tuesday, which will be asked to approve the Israeli conditions to move forward to the second phase; Hamas is expected to refuse and a senior Palestinian official told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen channel: 'Israeli statements indicate that it does not want a permanent cease-fire' A senior Palestinian official in one of the Gaza terrorist organizations told the Al-Mayadeen channel, affiliated with the Shiite axis and Hezbollah, on Monday afternoon that 'Hamas believes that Israel is planning to scuttle the cease-fire agreement.' According to the official, Hamas believes that Israel is relying on the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump and, according to him, the statements coming from Israel regarding the second phase of the agreement indicate its intention not to reach a permanent cease-fire and complete the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, the Israeli negotiating delegation that went to Qatar for discussions on the first phase of the agreement has returned to Israel. On Tuesday, the political-security cabinet will convene to discuss the second phase, and in the discussion Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to approve the Israeli conditions for progressing to Phase II: the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza; the disarmament of the terrorist organization's military wing; and the release of all the hostages. All of these, if accepted, are supposed to bring an end to the war on Israel's part but, according to estimates, Hamas is expected to refuse this. The Israeli delegation that traveled to Doha dealt with phase one issues only, and continued its talks and the implementation of the first phase's steps, with the aim of ensuring that there would be no further violations. Netanyahu reached agreements on the principles of the second phase with U.S. President Donald Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff - however, Hamas is not expected to accept them - and therefore an effort will be made by the Israeli side to extend the first phase as much as possible to allow for the release of additional hostages and an extension of the cease-fire. The Arabic-language Sky News network quoted Musa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, as saying at noon that 'the negotiations on the second phase of the agreement have not begun, Netanyahu missed the deadline due to his visit to the United States. We expect the negotiations to continue and take their natural course.' Phase II of the deal, which includes ending the war, effectively marks the beginning of 'the day after' in the Gaza Strip - and therefore the list of demands that Hamas has presented in the past regarding it has repeatedly crossed all of Israel's red lines. The terrorist organization's main demand, in order to agree to the release of the 65 Israeli and foreign hostages who are not included in the first phase and are considered a final bargaining chip for it, is to end the war. This is a complete end, a 'sustainable peace' without reservations, within the framework of which Israel will fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip and allow billions of dollars from other countries to be poured in for its reconstruction. If Hamas does not agree to an extension of Phase I and if it ends with the return of the 33 hostages, Israel may face the question of whether to return to fighting while 65 hostages, some still alive, remain in Hamas captivity, in harsh conditions and while being tortured, according to testimonies published last night from the hostages who returned on Saturday. An Israeli move to Phase II while accepting Hamas' demands may put Netanyahu in a political limbo, as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and his Religious Zionist party have already announced that at the end of the first phase they will demand a return to fighting and the destruction of Hamas. On Sunday night, Smotrich said that the terrorist organization's demands, including its remaining in power, will set a dangerous precedent for the future. 'What will be the next stage? The terrorist organizations are kidnapping more Israelis and demanding an Israeli withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, evacuation of settlements, and the establishment of a Palestinian state in exchange for their release? This is a red line that must not be crossed,' Smotrich said. 'There will be those who will say that we have already crossed this line at the current stage of the deal by agreeing to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor and allow the return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip. This is true, and this is one of the reasons we opposed the deal. But this is a temporary and reversible step, it must not be turned into a slippery and dangerous slope.' Smotrich concluded his remarks by saying, 'This bright red line must not be crossed. We will not be forced to take political steps as part of a deal to release hostages. There is no responsible leader who would make policy decisions and submit to political dictates as part of a hostage deal. Anyone who would do this does not deserve to be a leader. Our government will not succumb to this madness.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rju0dvdkjg	2025-02-10T03:30:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/By110WPXHKyx/By110WPXHKyx_0_182_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Elbit to provide digital fire command system to European country ...	The system enables real-time, coordinated command of all firepower units — artillery, rockets, and more — rather than operating them individually; It was first tested by the IDF across all fronts during the Gaza war Elbit Systems has secured contracts worth approximately $100 million over the next two years to supply a national digital fire command center to an undisclosed European country. The system will integrate and connect the country's strategic and tactical firepower platforms. The new command center will enhance the country's ability to efficiently manage its firepower, including artillery, rockets, mortars, precision-guided and loitering munitions, as well as drones, UAVs and various sensors such as radars and observation systems. By fully digitizing the fire control and targeting processes, the system will integrate real-time intelligence, significantly improving response times from target identification to engagement. Notably, Israel’s recent war marked the first time the IDF deployed a fully digital command-and-control system, enabling seamless synchronization across all firepower units. According to Elbit, the system includes advanced, integrated capabilities such as Torch-X Fires digital command-and-control technology, E-LynX software-defined radios, and GRX-8000 secure microwave communication systems for high-speed data transmission. Currently, many artillery systems operate as independent units with voice-based communication rather than digital integration. This new system will digitize the entire firepower network, from target detection to engagement.

Trump’s plans for Gaza ‘doomed,’ senior Hamas official says	Hamas' Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya vows to resist US president's post-war plans for enclave; 'We will bring them down as we brought down the projects before them,' he says Hamas' Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya said on Monday that the plans of the West, the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump for the Gaza Strip were 'doomed' and vowed to resist them. 'We will bring them down as we brought down the projects before them,' he said during a commemoration of the 46th anniversary of Iran's Islamic Revolution. Trump said on Sunday he was committed to buying and owning Gaza, but could allow sections of the war-ravaged land to be rebuilt by other states in the Middle East. Last week, in a joint press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump proposed turning the war-torn territory into what he called the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' He also floated the idea of relocating Gaza’s Palestinian population to other countries, particularly Egypt and Jordan, as it is being rebuilt. The proposal has been met with widespread criticism, especially in the Arab world, where officials have condemned any forced displacement of Palestinians. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkcmjdwkjx	2025-02-10T03:21:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/rJnzHo8uJx/rJnzHo8uJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The Kremlin said on Monday it was waiting for more details on U.S president Donald Trump's plan to buy the Gaza Strip, an idea which has sparked condemnation from many countries. Asked whether Trump's plan was acceptable for Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that 1.2 million people lived in Gaza. 'It's worth waiting for some details here if we're talking about a coherent plan of action. We are talking about almost 1.2 million Palestinians who live there, and this is probably the main issue,' Peskov told a conference call. 'These are the people who were promised a two-state solution to the Middle East problem by the relevant Security Council resolutions, and so on and so forth. There are a lot of questions like that.

Eliya Cohen and Alon Ohel were kidnapped to Gaza from protected space along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Or Levi, who was released; Their families describe inhumane conditions, and the horrors they experience in the tunnels: 'They are treated like animals'; Eliya's girlfriend: 'He doesn't know I'm alive' Four people were kidnapped from the 'shelter of death' on October 7: Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy, Alon Ohel and Eliya Cohen. Hersh was murdered in a Hamas tunnel under Gaza, Or was released on Saturday after 491 days in captivity - but Alon and Eliya remain in hell in Gaza, in inhumane conditions. Elia's partner, Ziv Abud, revealed Monday that testimonies from someone who was with him in captivity indicated that he does not know she is alive. Ziv miraculously survived the horrors in the shelter, but Eliya was abducted into Gaza by the terrorists. Meanwhile, Eliya's mother, Sigi, expressed shock in an interview on Monday morning at the harsh conditions in which her son and Alon Ohel are being held. After the release of the hostages in the last round on Saturday, the family received its first sign of life from him - and his family revealed the terrible conditions in which the two young men are being held, including being restrained in chains. 'We know that they have been chained from the day they were kidnapped until today, which is unimaginable. A person has been chained for a year and four months, and guards are standing over them with drawn weapons, and they haven't moved for a second,' Eliya's mother told Ynet. 'They are treated like animals. They hardly receive food, they don't see daylight, they were in the tunnels from the day they were kidnapped until today. And I'm not talking about the abuse, I don't know what they went through there.' In a social media post Sunday night, Eliya's partner, Ziv, wrote: 'Now I know that you don't know that I'm alive. From the testimonies of people who were with you in captivity, I know that you don't know what we went through here and what we are doing, not even a little bit, because you are completely cut off. You also don't know how I wait for you, how every day that passes without you or without an update becomes harder and harder.' She added: 'I can't explain how much it hurts to know that you are suffering, that you are hungry, that it is difficult for you - but that you are also strong. I want you to know that during this entire period you were not only shackled by your feet, but also in the hearts of everyone who loves you. I know that what happened and is happening to you in captivity is unimaginable, that you are going through one of the hardest things. And it is so hard to be here, without an option to make things easier for you, without being able to hug you.' 'Sometimes all I want is just the little moments – our conversations, our laughter, all our moments, the little things that made our lives so beautiful. I endure every moment in silence, because I know your pain is greater than mine. I know you don't know I'm here waiting, but I don't stop hoping and waiting. Every day. Every moment. For you to know that your pain is mine too. I love you, and all this time only increases my desire to bring you home, until we can hug each other again, that we can heal and feel alive again.'

'My stomach is turning and I'm in a crazy state. If we thought we knew something, then we didn't understand anything. The punch in the stomach that we had on Saturday night, with all the joy of the sign of life we ​​received, I couldn't imagine how bad the situation they were in was.' Is the government suppressing the difficult situation of the hostages? 'I really don't know. What interests me now is that my son returns and that everyone returns. The hostages who returned on Shabbat are proof that everyone, everyone who remained there, needs to return home today. If up until now they seemed to know and covered it up, now they can't cover it up. Look, people who look like Holocaust survivors have arrived here, and went through the Holocaust there. They all need to return home. That's more important than anything else.' What information did you receive about Eliya? 'We know that, thank God, Eliya is alive, we know that they have been chained from the day they were kidnapped until today, which is unimaginable. A person has been chained for a year and 4 months, and guards are standing over him with drawn weapons, and they haven't moved from him for a single second. They are treated like animals. They hardly receive food, don't see daylight, have been in tunnels from the day they were kidnapped until today. And I'm not talking about the abuse, I don't know what they went through there.' Regarding Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, which currently is being negotiated, she says: 'I am very, very worried. I was worried even before this deal was implemented, and I keep saying that until I look Elia in the eye and hug him, I won't believe anything. It's sad to hear that the second phase of the deal is also getting further away, because after what we saw on Saturday, the first thing that needs to be done is to bring them home.' What do you say to the ministers in the government who think that the photos actually strengthen their opposition to continuing the deal? 'I say to those people: You don't want to make a deal, no problem, don't do it. Put your child in there instead of my child and then say you don't want a deal. As long as your child is not there, you have no right, you have no right to keep these children there, you don't have this right and privilege.' What message did he want to convey? ' He said he misses us very, very much and he's really looking forward to going home.' First sign of life from Alon Yesterday, the family of the other hostage from the shelter near Kibbutz Be'eri, Alon Ohel, after 494 days received their first sign of life. The family was informed that Alon was alive as of Saturday, but emphasized that he has an eye injury which has not been treated, and has been held in chains for the entire period of captivity. The family received the testimony that he is alive from the hostages who were released on Saturday, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who had been held with him in the tunnels since the day of his abduction. Alon's family said he is being held in harsh conditions in tunnels inder Gaza, without daylight and without access to basic human necessities, and that he has an eye injury. His mother, Idit, told Ynet that 'the feelings are very complex and difficult; it is very shocking and on the other hand it is also very exciting that we know that Alon is alive.' She said that it is 'very shocking to understand what condition he is probably in, according to the hostages who have returned now. In fact, since the kidnapping, he has been in the tunnels all the time, he is being held captive in difficult conditions in terms of nutrition. He has an eye injury that we didn't know about: shrapnel in the eye and shrapnel in the shoulder. He was held throughout the entire period of captivity, chained, with almost no food, just one pita a day.' Alon's family said: 'We are devastated and shocked by the difficult physical and mental state he is in and the abuse he and the other hostages are still going through. Alon has survived the inferno so far, but he doesn't have time! The release of the hostages must not be postponed. They are all humanitarian.' Idit added in a conversation with Ynet that 'we must do everything and now to return them. They must all leave now, urgently. The men's condition is not good - it is not normal. It is humanitarian. We do not accept the selection that was made - and this injustice needs to be corrected.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1zq7sptyx	2025-02-10T01:04:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/Syr8BQvFyg/Syr8BQvFyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

South Korea's spy agency has accused Chinese AI app DeepSeek of 'excessively' collecting personal data and using all input data to train itself, and questioned the app's responses to questions relating to issues of national pride. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it sent an official notice to government agencies last week urging them to take security precautions over the artificial intelligence app. 'Unlike other generative AI services, it has been confirmed that chat records are transferable as it includes a function to collect keyboard input patterns that can identify individuals and communicate with Chinese companies' servers such as volceapplog.com,' the NIS said in a statement issued on Sunday. Some government ministries in South Korea have blocked access to the app, citing security concerns, joining Australia and Taiwan in warning about or placing restrictions on DeepSeek. The NIS said DeepSeek gives advertisers unlimited access to user data and stores South Korean users' data in Chinese servers. Under Chinese law, the Chinese government would be able to access such information when requested, the agency added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj2nkbwfjl	2025-02-09T23:56:50-08:00

End of the penny: Trump orders production of the copper coins sto...	Trump directs Treasury Department to stop production of the currency due to its high cost: 'This is so wasteful! Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time' President Donald Trump says he has directed the Treasury Department and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and to stop minting new pennies, citing the rising cost of producing the one-cent coin. 'For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!' Trump wrote in a post on Sunday on is Truth Social site. 'I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time.' The move by Trump is the latest in what has been a rapid-fire effort by his new administration to enact sweeping change through executive order and proclamation on issues ranging from immigration, to gender and diversity, to the name of the Gulf of Mexico. Trump had not discussed his desire to eliminate the penny during his campaign. But Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency raised the prospect in a post on X last month highlighting the penny’s cost. The U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million in the 2024 fiscal year that ended in September on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced. Every penny cost nearly $0.037 — up from $0.031 the year before. It is unclear whether Trump has the power to unilaterally eliminate the lowly one-cent coin. Currency specifications - including the size and metal content of coins - are dictated by Congress. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: But Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, has argued that there might be wiggle room. 'The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,' he said last month. Members of Congress have repeatedly introduced legislation taking aim at the zinc coin with copper plating. Proposals over the years have attempted to temporarily suspend the penny’s production, eliminate it from circulation, or require that prices be rounded to the nearest five cents, according to the Congressional Research Service. Proponents of eliminating the coin have cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers, and the fact that a number of countries have already eliminated their one-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012. It wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. eliminated its least valuable coin. The half-cent coin was discontinued by Congress in 1857. Trump’s new administration has been sharply focused on cutting costs, with Musk, who has been brought on to lead the task, targeting entire agencies and large swaths of the federal workforce as he tries to identify a goal of $2 trillion in savings. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by0iwedfyx	2025-02-09T23:38:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BkyGoMvKke/BkyGoMvKke_0_243_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Romi Gonen's father writes ' Trump is reason my daughter is free ...	Eitan Gonen, whose daughter was released in current deal, thanked the U.S. president in a column in the New York Post: He 'applied the necessary pressure ... Only he can make the next stages of the deal possible' Gonen claimed; To the families whose loved ones were left behind, he said: 'Don’t lose hope. Keep fighting' 'The person who made seeing my daughter possible, after so many months of despair and failed negotiations, was President Donald Trump,' wrote Eitan Gonen, the father of former Hamas hostage Romi Gonen, who was released from captivity after 471 days , as part of the first phase of the current cease-fire and hostage release deal. In a column in the New York Post, he wrote that 'When he (Trump) set a Jan. 20 deadline for the deal, it applied the necessary pressure, setting in motion the events that would bring Romi home. I would be honored to shake his hand one day and express my gratitude for his role in reuniting our family.' Eitan Gonen opened the column by describing Romi's kidnapping: 'The morning of Oct. 7, 2023, is tattooed in our memory. For nearly five hours, I — along with Romi’s mother, Meirav, and our daughter, Yarden — spoke to Romi on the phone as chaos unfolded at the Nova music festival. With the roads blocked by abandoned and burned cars, the last we heard was that Romi was shot and that terrorists were near her. Then came the agonizing silence. 'Her friends who were with her had been murdered. For almost two months, we had no idea if she was even alive, until other hostages released in the first deal confirmed she had survived. For 470 days, I ended every interview I gave with the same message: 'Romi is coming home alive.' I didn’t know if she would hear me, but I kept saying it, hoping somehow my words would reach her. 'This mantra gave me no choice but to get up every day and fight. I had to be ready for her return every waking moment. Staying in bed and giving up was not an option,' he wrote. Gonen's column was written on Friday, before the fifth round of hostage releases the following day. But even then he understood the grave condition that the remaining hostages are in. 'President Trump is their only hope,' he wrote. 'Only he could help other families experience the reunion I had. Only he can make the next stages of the deal possible. After his intervention, the moment we had been fighting for arrived: When I got to speak with Romi in the hospital after her release on Jan. 19, her first words to me were: 'Dad, I came home alive!' Those words, which made everything worthwhile, confirmed what I had always believed — that our voices could reach across the void and give strength to those we love.' He added: 'My daughter’s strength continues to amaze me. She learned Arabic to communicate with her captors — it was her only way to survive. She found a crucial ally in Emily Damari, another hostage who had been taken from her home in Kfar Aza. God somehow brought them together, and their bond helped them both endure. 'The hardest lesson I learned was that hopelessness consumes energy you can’t afford to waste. I channeled every resource efficiently; every ounce of energy had to be directed toward bringing Romi home. I refused to stay in bed and cry. I knew Romi wouldn’t want to hear that her father had collapsed in her absence. Instead, I had to reinvent myself daily. My wife Meital and I spoke with more than 50,000 people across Israel, telling the story of Romi and the family. We printed t-shirts and distributed stickers — anything to keep Romi’s presence alive in the world.'

With fragile cease-fires in place, Israel's economy shows signs o...	Despite not yet approving a national budget for 2025, a labor crisis, and a cease-fire that could collapse at any moment, Israel launched its postwar reconstruction efforts and there is economic optimism Following the cease-fires with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in the north, Israel swiftly launched its postwar reconstruction efforts. Thousands of civilian structures in war-affected areas require urgent rebuilding, but despite a general sense of optimism, the process is fraught with challenges. Multiple projects are already in place, such as the Tekuma (Revival) Administration, which has a five-year mandate and an initial allocation of 19 billion shekels ($5.3 billion) to rebuild devastated communities. Still, as of January 2025, Israel's state budget, totaling approximately 607.4 billion shekels ($170.9 billion), has yet to be approved and doesn’t have a precise slice dedicated to rebuilding war-torn regions. The country is at an impasse because it can’t know if military expenditures will become a priority again, considering the frail cease-fire. Despite the uncertainty, Israeli infrastructure companies have experienced a significant value surge. Danya Cebus’ market capitalization reached 3.71 billion shekels, an increase of 13.02% over the past year. Similarly, Shikun & Binui’s market capitalization of 6.78 billion shekels marks a 34.52% increase over the past year. According to Natanel Haiman, head of the Economics Division at the Manufacturers Association of Israel, recent economic trends show signs of recovery. 'Consumption is rising. Between September and November 2024, there was a 10.6% increase in industrial product purchases and a 4.6% rise in total credit card transactions. This reflects renewed consumer and business confidence.' Similarly, Eliran, a community leader from Ma’alot, said that there is a lot to do, but that progress is being made. 'The municipality is supporting the reconstruction of the damaged buildings, but it’s still taking time to see results on the ground,' he said. 'Roads and damaged infrastructure have already been repaired, but it’s more complicated in the community. Many people have been financially impacted and still haven’t managed to recover. We have an economic aid fund through which we have helped several people, but it’s not enough.' Unfortunately for Israel’s reconstruction plans, the postwar stability depends on a fragile ceasefire, which also impacts the economic revival. Dr. Roby Nathanson, CEO of the Macro Center for Political Economy, explains that the reconstruction process isn’t just rebuilding the destroyed physical structures but also economic revival. 'Reconstruction cannot succeed without revitalizing the business sector. People will not return to places without employment or income opportunities. In my view, that is the greatest challenge,' he said. Chen Herzog, chief economist at BDO, emphasizes that while security stabilization offers a pathway for economic recovery, challenges remain. '2024 was a tough year economically, with a per capita growth decline of 1.5%, meaning Israelis became poorer in real terms,' Herzog explains. He adds that economic measures, including a hike in value-added tax from 17% to 18%, higher income taxes, and reduced welfare payments, are weighing on the Israeli public. 'We need an effective budget allocation for reconstruction to ensure economic rebound. But as of now, Israel is still operating under last year’s budget framework.' Nathanson also agrees with the urgency of the national budget for 2025. 'The government must pass the budget by the end of March; otherwise, the government could fall. This budget primarily addresses defense and urgent needs but includes very little for recovery programs, economic growth, productivity or business reactivation,' he said. However, even when Israel has a new budget for 2025 if the cease-fire collapses, the economy will take another severe hit, Haiman warns. 'If war resumes, businesses will be thrown back into crisis. The key is maintaining a stable cease-fire to allow for sustainable economic recovery.' 'In 2024, Israel saw 65,000 businesses close, while only 35,000 new businesses were established. In normal years, we see about 50,000 openings to 40,000 closures. This is a major issue,' Nathanson added. The north of Israel, which was heavily hit by Hezbollah missile attacks, remains the most economically devastated region. According to Nathanson, of the 150,000 businesses in the north, about 80,000 are in the Upper Galilee, the hardest-hit region. 'For businesses in the north, this is a matter of survival. Around 50% of businesses in the restaurant and service industries had to close, and 25% will never reopen. Reconstruction cannot succeed without revitalizing the business sector.' This economic instability is not just regional – it is reshaping national recovery efforts. As Nathanson highlights: 'If schools don’t reopen, teachers don’t return. If businesses stay shut, families won’t come back. The entire system is interdependent.' Alongside the complexities of economic revival, Israel has to deal with its ongoing labor shortage, which existed even before the war and worsened significantly since October 7. The country’s previous reliance on Palestinian workers left an 80,000-worker shortfall, stalling reconstruction efforts nationwide. While the government has attempted to fill the gap with foreign labor from Sri Lanka, India and other countries, Nathanson warns that 'reinstating some level of Palestinian employment may be inevitable. This labor crisis is also fueling soaring housing prices – before the war, a young couple needed around 80 times their annual income to buy an apartment; now, that figure has climbed to 150-160 times.' Herzog further highlights the strain on the real estate sector, noting that housing starts have dropped dramatically, with 'only 20,000 to 30,000 units being built annually, while 60,000 new families enter the housing market each year – a gap that will continue to drive prices even higher.' Eliran from Ma’alot confirmed the expert’s concerns as he believes 'there is a labor shortage. There are structures like shelters that need thorough repairs but have not yet been taken care of due to a lack of manpower and resources.' New building regulations have been implemented in affected areas to make things easier and faster and to handle the workforce shortage. Eliran from Ma’alot said they 'have several community members who have recently built reinforced security rooms (mamads) with less bureaucracy. With the approval of the Home Front Command, the planning committee immediately granted building permits. I assume these have been approved by an engineer.' Along with other measures that could facilitate the rebuilding and revival, Nathanson believes Israel has a very high interest rate (4.5%) and should consider lowering it. 'If the interest rate is reduced, it could provide a significant boost to economic recovery, investment and business activity. Debt servicing will increase, but reducing interest rates now could provide a crucial economic stimulus, especially for construction and business recovery,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Similarly, Herzog believes that lowering interest rates could help, but for that to happen, 'Israel needs confidence that inflation and the government deficit are under control. Right now, that’s not the case. The Bank of Israel cannot reduce interest rates because of uncertainty about the government budget and national debt targets. Israel’s risk premium needs to come down, and the rating agencies need to have confidence in Israel’s financial stability before we can expect lower interest rates.' That said, 'a continued cease-fire is already strengthening the shekel. A stronger shekel makes imported goods cheaper, which in turn helps lower inflation. If this trend continues, we might see the Bank of Israel considering interest rate reductions in 2025’s second half,' he added. Israel’s strong macroeconomic sectors, such as high-tech, military industries, energy and communications, have 'remained stable, and the stock exchange even rose during the war, and the shekel, while weakened, has been recovering,' Nathanson added. As Israel’s reconstruction process begins, its conditions remain uncertain. From an ice-thin ceasefire to an unclear national budget and a lack of workforce, Israel faces a crossroads that could redefine the country for decades to come, for the better or the worse. As Haiman said: 'While the current conditions foster optimism and growth, the Israeli business community must be prepared to navigate uncertainty regardless of the circumstances.'

IDF attacks tunnel that crossed from Syria to Lebanon, used by He...	Fighter jets attacked the underground tunnel in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley used by the terrorist organization, which has been targeted in the past; IDF says it is 'determined to prevent its restoration and use'; Report on injuries in Lebanon says 'Israel is coordinating its attacks with al-Julani's men' Israeli Air Force fighter conducted a precise intelligence-based strike on an underground tunnel crossing from Syrian territory into Lebanese territory that was used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons in the Beqaa area and has been struck in the past, the IDF spokesman reported late Sunday night. 'The IDF is determined to prevent the restoration and use of this tunnel,' the IDF spokesman said. Additionally, the IAF struck several Hezbollah sites containing munitions and rocket launchers that posed an imminent threat in Lebanese territory. The targets struck were a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, according to the IDF. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel, in accordance with the ceasefire understandings. The IDF remains committed to the understandings and will operate to prevent any attempt of rearmament or rebuild of force by the Hezbollah terrorist organization,' the IDF spokesman said. At the same time, in Lebanon, the Al-Jadeed channel reported fighter jets in the skies over Beirut and Dahieh. The Lebanese NBN network also reported Israeli attacks between the villages of Harbata and Sabona in the northern Bekaa region. According to a Lebanese report, one of the attacks in Lebanon targeted the Khalid al-Saba crossing area in Al-Hermel, which was described as 'an area that witnessed a failed attempt two days ago by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to control it.' The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that in addition to the Khalid al-Sabah crossing, the Zaqba crossing was also attacked - two crossings between Syria and Lebanon in the Al-Hermel area in the north and deep of the country. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another report, by the Sabereen News agency affiliated with the pro-Iranian militias, stated that several people were injured in attacks in the border area and were taken to the hospital for treatment. According to the report, this is an area where there have been clashes in recent days between Syrian regime forces and elements supported by Hezbollah. The report said that in its attacks, Israel 'is coordinating with the people of al-Julani,' referring to Syrian rebel leader and interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa. The attacks deep inside Lebanon come hours after Ynet reported that the IDF decided that from March 1 residents of the north will not be prevented from returning to return to their homes. Ynet learned that the IDF delivered the professional opinion today, after an updated situation assessment. In addition, the attack comes nine days before the IDF is scheduled to evacuate and completely withdraw from southern Lebanon on February 18, in accordance with the cease-fire agreement. Army forces are scheduled to completely withdraw from all points Israel has captured in southern Lebanon, including those with important strategic-security significance for the lives of residents of the north. In light of the residents' concerns, the IDF promises that it will ensure that the villages that will be built will no longer serve as a shelter for terrorism, and that it will act to stop any attempt to restore the security threat by occupying and firing at Lebanese border settlements. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1i1ugdkkg	2025-02-09T21:27:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/Hy3bnKLF1l/Hy3bnKLF1l_0_0_441_248_0_small.jpg

Robert Kraft’s Super Bowl ad shines a light on hate for a second ...	The NFL experienced extremely high viewership compared to previous years for several reasons Yesterday was Super Bowl Sunday, and millions of Americans prepared for the epic game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs in what marked the 59th annual NFL championship. The NFL experienced extremely high viewership compared to previous years for several reasons. The first was the rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, which ended dramatically with a last-second touchdown. This year’s showdown promised to be just as thrilling. In the end, the Philadelphia Eagles took out the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 40 to 22. Another major draw was the halftime show, featuring iconic rapper Kendrick Lamar. Fresh off a successful Grammy campaign with his hit song Not Like Us—a diss track in his viral feud with Canadian rapper Drake—Lamar’s performance attracted even non-football fans. It had the potential to be one of the most-watched halftime shows in NFL history. With millions of American eyes on the event, Robert Kraft, a longtime supporter of Israel, secured an incredibly expensive Super Bowl ad slot. His foundation, the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, aired an ad for the second consecutive year. While last year’s ad focused primarily on antisemitism with stark imagery, this year’s campaign highlighted all forms of hate without directly mentioning antisemitism. Seven-time NFL champion Tom Brady appeared alongside legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, engaging in a heated conversation about the dangers of hate. Dan Kraft, son of Robert Kraft, told ILTV that his goal was to introduce the issue of antisemitism to people who might not be aware of it.

Media bias and moral failure: How CNN, BBC, and the UN enable Ham...	Comment: Hamas's PR stunt backfired. The world was shocked to see the three male hostages emaciated, shells of their former selves. Complete with a new banner, a stage, rows of pickup trucks, and terrorists in full Hamas gear—all carefully orchestrated and choreographed by none other than Qatar’s Al Jazeera. But the PR stunt backfired as the three Israeli hostages—Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami—exited the Hamas vehicle and were paraded on stage. The world was shocked to see the three men—emaciated, shells of their former selves. It was a stark reminder of the cruelty, savagery, and evil that is Hamas—images reminiscent of the darkest days in human history. And while the world had pledged 'Never Again,' these images, these men, prove it has utterly failed to uphold that promise. And while most of the world was truly shocked, there were those who sought to downplay these crimes against humanity. CNN and the BBC—once respectable news organizations—the BBC actually referred to 'both sides' hostages,' and CNN stated that Palestinian prisoners sometimes look emaciated too. Really? First of all—let’s be clear. Palestinian prisoners are convicted criminals. They have had trials. They have had due process. They regularly receive visits from the Red Cross. They have access to medical care and full, nutritious meals every single day. It is deeply concerning that a news outlet cannot tell the difference between good and evil, between terrorists and convicted felons who have raped and murdered, and the innocent civilians who were literally dragged out of their beds in their underwear on a Saturday morning, a holiday, their families murdered. These headlines, and any attempts to draw a moral equivalence between terrorists and Israeli civilians, only play into Hamas’s PR stunts and enable scenes like the one on Saturday to unfold. It props up a terrorist group that carried out one of the most barbaric massacres in modern history. So, good job to the CNN and BBC editors who thought these were balanced headlines. And they are not alone. In fact, they’re in good company. How can we not mention the International Red Cross, the United Nations, and so many so-called human rights organizations that have not said a single word about the hostages? The Red Cross—other than transporting the hostages from point A to point B and fully participating in Hamas’s PR show—has not visited a single hostage in nearly 16 months. The United Nations—the international organization that was supposed to ensure 'Never Again'—has yet to condemn Hamas. Instead, it continually tries to draw some sort of moral equivalence between innocent Israeli hostages and a brutal terrorist organization. The UN, perhaps more than any agency, supports and enables Hamas and scenes like the one on Saturday. So the fact that all these organizations are still trying to 'both sides' it is outrageous and extremely dangerous. All they are doing is empowering Hamas and allowing their evil ideology to spread unchecked throughout the world. And everyone with a basic sense of morality and a basic sense of right vs. wrong should speak up. It’s time to put a stop to this ridiculous show and bring home all the hostages now—before it is too late. Never Again is now.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk7rpbwyje	2025-02-09T20:30:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/yk14252784/yk14252784_0_51_1438_810_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu, Trump aligned on Israel’s Phase II hostage deal terms,...	Israeli delegation in Doha working to facilitate hostage releases and prevent violations; Phase II talks to begin after upcoming Cabinet meeting, with demands including Hamas’ expulsion, disarmament and full hostage release Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to bring Israel’s demands for the second phase of the hostage deal to the decision-making Security Cabinet for approval on Tuesday. According to Israeli assessments, Hamas is unlikely to accept the conditions, which include the exile of its leadership from Gaza, the disarmament of its military wing and the release of all remaining hostages. If met, these terms would mark the end of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Negotiations on the second phase will only begin after the Cabinet convenes. Meanwhile, the Israeli delegation currently in Doha, Qatar, is focused solely on implementing the first phase of the agreement. The delegation, which includes Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch and a senior Shin Bet official, is working to ensure the continuation of the first-phase releases while preventing further violations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel expects three more male hostages to be released in the next exchange, though there is growing concern that, as seen on Saturday, some may return in severely deteriorated physical condition. Netanyahu has already reached understandings on the second-phase principles with U.S. President Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff. However, given Hamas’ expected refusal, Israel will likely push to extend the first phase as long as possible to secure additional hostage releases and maintain the temporary cease-fire. An Israeli official said that in response to Hamas’ strategy of starving the hostages, Israel has been taking countermeasures, primarily by delaying the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. However, the official emphasized that Netanyahu would not abandon the deal, though Hamas would 'face consequences later.' 'We may be swallowing some bitter pills now, but Hamas will pay for this,' the official said. He added that Israel remains committed to freeing all hostages, whether through negotiations or by resuming military action. 'The war is not the goal—it is a means to bring our hostages home, one way or another,' he said. Post-war plan As negotiations for the second phase of the hostage deal progress, it is increasingly seen as the start of the 'day after' in Gaza. Hamas’ demands for this phase have repeatedly crossed Israel’s red lines. The terror group’s primary condition for releasing the remaining 65 Israeli and foreign hostages—considered its last bargaining chip—is a complete and unconditional end to the war. Hamas is demanding a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the unrestricted transfer of billions of dollars from international donors for reconstruction. If Hamas refuses to extend the current phase, and it concludes with the release of 33 hostages, Israel may face a difficult choice: resume military operations while 65 hostages remain in captivity under dire conditions, or move to the second phase under Hamas’ terms. Recent testimonies from released hostages have detailed severe mistreatment and torture in captivity, adding pressure on the Israeli government. Accepting Hamas' demands would also create political turmoil for Prime Minister Netanyahu. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and his far-right Religious Zionist Party have already warned that once the first phase ends, they will push for a full resumption of military operations and Hamas’ destruction. Smotrich reiterated his opposition Sunday, calling Hamas’ conditions a dangerous precedent. 'What happens next? Terror groups will kidnap more Israelis and demand a withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, the evacuation of settlements and a Palestinian state in return? This is a red line that must not be crossed,' he said. He also criticized Israel’s previous concessions, including withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor and allowing Gazans to return to northern Gaza, calling them 'temporary and reversible.' However, he warned against further compromises. 'This bright red line must not be crossed. We will not be forced into political concessions as part of a hostage deal,' Smotrich said. 'No responsible leader surrenders to political dictates in such a deal. Anyone who does so is unfit to lead. Our government will not submit to this madness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h111bjoitjg	2025-02-09T13:36:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/SJ00TBNgY1g/SJ00TBNgY1g_1_50_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Trump to announce 25% steel and aluminum tariffs in latest trade ...	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday to take effect almost immediately. Trump during his first term imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has dropped in recent years. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum. On Friday, Trump announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs—raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners—in many countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties would be imposed 'so that we're treated evenly with other countries.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byj11cilyke	2025-02-09T13:21:29-08:00

Jewish convert and the Star of David ring that sparked controvers...	In 2016, US deputy Mideast envoy to criticized Trump’s foreign policy but later became supporter; announcing her appointment, Trump remarked, 'I hope she learned her lesson'; Ortagus has strong ties to top Trump allies, including Kushner and Rubio Morgan Ortagus, the newly appointed deputy to U.S. presidential envoy to the Middle East, Steven Witkoff, arrived in Israel on Sunday following high-level meetings in Lebanon. Her visit comes as tensions rise over Hezbollah’s role in the newly formed Lebanese government and the fragile cease-fire with Israel. Ortagus, who previously served as the State Department’s spokesperson during Donald Trump's first term, was given responsibility for Lebanese affairs, replacing Amos Hochstein. In Israel, she met with Defense Minister Israel Katz and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, whose office is overseeing her visit. She also toured an IDF post in Lebanon alongside Katz. She is expected to leave the region on Monday. Her appointment by Trump in early January was notable for the president’s lukewarm endorsement, writing in his announcement that Ortagus 'fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson.' While he did not specify the disagreements, reports suggest they stemmed from Ortagus' early criticism of Trump's isolationist foreign policy during the 2016 campaign. However, she later became a vocal supporter after he secured the Republican nomination. In her first public mission since taking office, Ortagus met with newly elected Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and top government officials. She pressed them to prevent Hezbollah from holding ministerial positions, warning that the cease-fire with Israel remains 'fragile' and that any flare-up could end it entirely. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Speaking at a press conference in Beirut, Ortagus said the U.S. has set 'clear red lines' for Lebanon’s new government, insisting Hezbollah must have no role. 'Lebanon’s leaders are committed to ensuring Hezbollah is not part of the government in any way. That era is over. Israel has succeeded in defeating Hezbollah, and we commend them for it,' she said. Despite her remarks, Lebanon's new government was announced on Saturday, with Hezbollah and its Shiite ally, the Amal Movement, securing five ministerial posts. Her visit also sparked controversy in Lebanon due to a ring she wore prominently during meetings—a Star of David. Lebanese social media users took notice, with one commenting on X (formerly Twitter), 'This envoy is even more Zionist than her predecessors.' Hezbollah-aligned MP Hassan Ezzedine condemned her comments on Hezbollah, accusing her of 'endorsing enemy crimes.' Small protests erupted outside Beirut’s airport upon her departure. Ortagus, 42, has a diverse background in diplomacy, intelligence and media. She was born in Florida to a cleaning business owner and an office manager and once placed third in the Miss Florida pageant. She holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of South Florida and a master’s degree in business administration and international relations from Johns Hopkins University. Ironically, she began her career as a public affairs officer for USAID, the same agency Trump later sought to dismantle. During her diplomatic service in the Middle East, she developed an interest in Judaism, ultimately converting. She married businessman Jonathan Weinberger in 2013 in a ceremony officiated by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime neighbor. The couple has a five-year-old daughter, Adina. Ortagus later worked as an intelligence analyst and deputy attaché at the Treasury Department, as well as a commentator for Fox News. Before becoming State Department spokesperson under then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo, she served as a Navy Reserve officer in Saudi Arabia. As spokesperson, she was known for her tough stance on Iran and China, particularly in countering Beijing’s attempts to shift blame for the COVID-19 pandemic onto the U.S. Trump’s decision to appoint her as Witkoff’s deputy despite past tensions appears to have been influenced by her strong ties to key Republican figures, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Senator Lindsey Graham and incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. She also worked closely with Jared Kushner during the Abraham Accords negotiations, and the two remain on good terms. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syepxouyke	2025-02-09T13:08:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/BJgH11ZYmtkl/BJgH11ZYmtkl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, calling it unrealistic. 'There is no need to take this plan seriously. No one has the power to uproot the Palestinians from their land,' Erdogan said. He also accused Israel of violating the cease-fire agreement in Gaza.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhstcik1g	2025-02-09T12:26:16-08:00	
Israel strikes Hezbollah weapons tunnel on Syria-Lebanon border	Israeli warplanes struck an underground tunnel in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley that crosses from Syria and was used by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons, the IDF said Sunday. 'The tunnel was previously targeted, and the IDF is determined to prevent its restoration and use,' the military said. The airstrikes also hit Hezbollah sites containing weapon stockpiles and rocket launchers posing an immediate threat in Lebanon. The targets violated understandings between Israel and Lebanon, the military said. Lebanon’s Hezbollah-affiliated Al Manar TV reported strikes near the village of Rumin in the Nabatieh province of southern Lebanon. Lebanese media also reported airstrikes across the country, including areas north of the Litani River, with fighter jets spotted over Beirut and the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahieh. The pro-Iranian Sabereen News agency reported several injuries in the al-Hermel region near the Syria-Lebanon border, with casualties taken to hospitals. The area has recently seen clashes between Syrian regime forces and Hezbollah-backed factions in Lebanon. According to the report, the Israeli strikes were 'coordinated with the Syrian regime.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk2fp9ifjg	2025-02-09T12:25:22-08:00

Hamas has ordered systematic starvation of male hostages, freed c...	Brother of released hostage Or Levy says 'for 16 months, he was barefoot, hungry and in constant fear that each day might be his last'; another brother rejects claims leadership unaware of intentional starvation policy Tal Levy, the brother of Or Levy, who was freed from Hamas captivity, described the harsh conditions and starvation his brother endured during his 491-day captivity. 'There was intentional starvation, a policy from Yahya Sinwar,' he said. 'It’s impossible that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t know because officials from the Hostages Bureau at the Prime Minister's Office told us about it,' Tal added that, in his estimation, Or wouldn't have survived much longer if he had remained in captivity for another two to three weeks or a month. Meanwhile, Or's other brother, Michael, issued a statement at Sheba Medical Center, also placing the blame on decision-makers. 'Yesterday, after 491 days of hell, Or came back to us,' Michael said. 'He was imprisoned in Hamas tunnels, cut off from the world, from his life, from his family. For 491 days, every minute was a battle—physical, mental, emotional.' Michael went on to describe Or's physical state, saying, 'After a year and four months, I saw my brother again. I hugged him, but he wasn’t the same Or who left home on October 7, 2023. Or returned in a weakened condition. For 16 months, he was barefoot, hungry, and in constant fear that each day would be his last.' Michael continued, 'His greatest fear was confirmed when he was freed. For 491 days, he waited to hear about his wife, Einav. He learned only yesterday that she was murdered. Yesterday, he finally met Almog, and Almog asked, 'Why did it take so long for you to come back?' For 491 days, my brother and others were there, but nothing prepared them for what they found here. While Or was in the dark, decision-makers knew about his condition but didn’t do everything they should have.' Michael stressed the urgency of continuing the fight to bring more hostages home. 'Every moment and every second there was critical. Our struggle isn't over. Or’s return is a miracle, but the people of Israel deserve this miracle. My brother is here, but I still have other brothers and sisters in hell. I beg, don’t forget them. Don’t stop fighting.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier, Tal Levy spoke to Keshet News about Or's gradual recovery. 'Or is recovering slowly,' he said. 'Yesterday was a bit harder and confusing for him, but he didn’t sleep much. He sat with my mom and my brother and shared experiences from captivity. He fell asleep only at 7 a.m. Yesterday was confusing, but he’s going through a process. Today is a better day, he’s starting to stabilize.' Tal further revealed, 'The stories he shares are incredibly difficult to hear. I can’t even describe them. If I could share everything he told us and if the public knew what they went through and the slim chances they had to survive in those conditions... the Or I saw yesterday wouldn't have survived another two or three weeks, or a month in captivity.' Tal also confirmed that Or had been aware of the intentional starvation policy imposed by Yahya Sinwar, a policy the family had been briefed on. 'This is not the first time we’ve heard about this,' Tal said. 'Yesterday, there were briefings from the Prime Minister’s Office where they claimed they didn’t know about the intentional starvation. But I can say unequivocally that they did know. The prime minister knew. A few months ago, official sources from the Defense Ministry and the military came to us and told us about this top-down policy, with Sinwar ordering the starvation of male hostages. It’s impossible that the families and we were exposed to this, and the Prime Minister wasn’t.' Tal added that Or had initially refused to be freed and suggested another hostage be released instead. 'He felt very bad about being freed while others were still in captivity. We told him that he was a humanitarian case, especially because of Almog, who lost his mother, and Or was the family’s only hope.' Or also mentioned Elkana Bochbot, another hostage, who had a 4-year-old daughter, saying, 'Why wasn’t he released?' Or didn’t know for certain until yesterday that his wife, Einav, had been killed. Tal said that, at his request, a psychologist broke the news to him. 'He guessed she was dead because he was in the shelter when it happened. He suspected she was gone, but he didn’t know. The first question he asked the psychologist, after transitioning to the IDF, was whether Einav was alive or dead. She confirmed she was dead,' Tal explained. Tal also described the emotional meeting between Or and Almog. 'Almog recognized him immediately. The fear wasn’t just ours—it was Or’s too. He was really afraid Almog wouldn’t recognize him. He said the one thing that kept him going every day in captivity was dreaming of meeting Almog. As time went on, he started to think that Almog might not recognize him, and the reunion he had been dreaming about would be very cold and hard. But Almog remembered him completely. He had been longing to meet him, and the reunion was incredible. It was truly the most emotional moment of my life. It was as if they hadn’t been apart.' Or also got the chance to tuck Almog in for the first time. 'It was the first time he went to bed with his father. This was a dream his father had every night during captivity. He dreamed of putting Almog to bed, and today I’m helping him do it,' Tal said. 'We’ll all lie down together in bed and read a story, and they’ll sleep hugging.' Or, along with Eli Sharabi, who lost his entire family in the terror attack, and Ohad Ben Ami, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri in his pajamas, was freed from the heart of the Gaza Strip. The three had been held underground for most of their captivity, without daylight. Some were exposed to limited media, mostly Al Jazeera. When Michael Levy addressed the UN Security Council, Hamas terrorists informed Or that the Israeli official was working on his behalf. About a week before their release, the hostages began receiving more food and water, likely due to supplies entering the area and the terrorists wanting to present them as healthier. Or was kidnapped on October 7 from the 'shelter of death' where he had fled with his wife Einav and many others during the Hamas surprise attack at the Nova party. His wife was killed in that shelter, along with 15 other victims. Yesterday, Or finally returned home and reunited with his 3-year-old son, Almog, but also received the devastating news of his wife's death in the shelter. 'He was held in a tunnel without communication and only guessed that his wife, Einav, had been murdered. He asked, and they told him,' his mother, Geula, said yesterday. Or's mother added that he thought Almog Sarusi, who was killed alongside five other hostages in a tunnel, had been freed. 'He was convinced that Almog and Hirsh had returned,' she said. Tonight, it was revealed that Alon Ahal, who had been kidnapped with Or from the shelter, is also alive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkvvqtuk1l	2025-02-09T11:53:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/HyBwakgHKyl/HyBwakgHKyl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Iranian schools and offices shut as cold snap bites	Tehran orders widespread closures due to severe snowstorm and energy conservation efforts, affecting schools and government offices in 10 provinces State media reported that authorities in Iran ordered schools and offices in at least 10 provinces to close on Sunday to conserve energy during a severe cold snap and heavy snowfall. Freezing temperatures have gripped the northern half of the country over the past few days, causing a spike in energy consumption. 'All government offices and schools are closed on Sunday, and remote learning has been arranged for students,' the state news agency IRNA announced. Among the provinces affected are Lorestan in the west, Semnan in the east and Gilan in the north. Some parts of Gilan, around 130 kilometres (80 miles) north of Tehran, saw snowfall to a depth of 220 centimetres (87 inches), meteorologist Mohammad Dadras told the Fars news agency. The shutdown decision followed a similar measure on Saturday, when authorities ordered closures in more than 20 of the country's 31 provinces because of the extreme weather. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The capital also saw closures on Saturday but those affected reopened on Sunday -- a working day -- despite the wintry conditions. IRNA said on Sunday some areas of Tehran received up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) of snow overnight. The snowfall caused widespread traffic disruption, and some residents cleared snow as others enjoyed snowball fights in city parks. Snow is not unusual for Tehran in February, but the combination of heavy snow and sudden temperature drops caught many people off guard. Heavy snow and rain across most of the country on Sunday also led to road closures. IRNA reported travel disruptions in 25 provinces, with the heaviest impacts in the north and west where authorities advised people to stay at home for the next 24 hours. Temperatures in at least 19 provinces fell to zero degrees Celsius or lower on Sunday, IRNA said. Iran often orders educational institutions and offices to close during winter, citing extreme weather and fuel shortages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rykzmtifkg	2025-02-09T11:26:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/S1AEgEIt1x/S1AEgEIt1x_0_218_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Israel to allow northern residents to return home amid security c...	Nearly 18 months after evacuations, military approves residents' return in under 3 weeks; Metula Council head slams move; 'This is total destruction for victory image, there is nothing to return to' The IDF decided on Sunday to lift restrictions on residents returning to their homes in northern Israel starting March 1, nearly a year and a half after they were evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks. The decision, revealed by the military following an updated situation assessment, has sparked strong opposition from local leaders. 'This is a double abandonment,' said David Azulay, head of the Metula Regional Council. 'For a year, Metula was nearly destroyed without any real response from Northern Command. Now, deciding to bring residents back in three weeks is ensuring its complete destruction—just for the sake of a so-called ‘victory photo’ that the government and military want to present. There is nothing to return to—neither militarily nor in terms of civilian infrastructure. And there is certainly no ‘victory photo.’ What we have are tragic images of the abandonment we endured before the ground maneuver even began.' Azulay urged that residents remain in temporary housing until at least June 1, citing extensive damage to homes. His concerns are shared by other northern leaders, especially as the military prepares to pull back its forces to the international border next week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The move comes amid reported U.S. pressure on Israel to adhere to the withdrawal timeline. On Saturday, Israeli forces evacuated additional positions in the eastern sector, allowing the Lebanese army to enter areas near the border with the kibbutzim of Manara and Misgav Am—a development that has unsettled local residents. Azulay has urged them not to return. It remains unclear whether the government will enforce the return by cutting off financial support for displaced families. The situation highlights a broader challenge in the northern theater. Unlike in Gaza, where the military has struggled to secure a decisive victory over Hamas, Israel’s confrontation with Hezbollah ended in a military success. However, it has yet to yield a political agreement that ensures long-term security. Unlike the Gaza cease-fire deal, no exclusion zone has been established in southern Lebanon to prevent Hezbollah or Lebanese civilians from entering the border area. While Northern Command has observed increased Lebanese army action against Hezbollah compared to pre-war levels, officials say more time is needed to solidify deterrence. Meanwhile, Hezbollah and its allies, including the Shiite Amal movement, have gained political influence, securing five ministerial positions in Lebanon’s newly formed government. The terrorist group is also working to rebuild its military capabilities, prompting continued Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets. It remains uncertain whether these strikes will continue—and at what frequency—once the IDF completes its withdrawal under the cease-fire agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkthmyuyyx	2025-02-09T11:23:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/ry4f00suNVyx/ry4f00suNVyx_1_55_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu backs Trump’s plan for Gaza, calls it 'revolutionary’	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, calling it a 'revolutionary and creative vision' that aligns with Israel’s interests. 'For a year, we’ve been told that the Palestinian Authority must govern Gaza after the war. Now, the president has presented a completely different vision—one that is far better for Israel,' Netanyahu said during a Cabinet meeting. He added that discussions on the plan are ongoing and emphasized Trump’s determination to implement it.

Jerusalem court freezes billions in Palestinian Authority funds f...	Victims claim in lawsuits PA encourages terrorism against Israel; District Court rules each entitled to millions in compensation The Jerusalem District Court issued on Sunday a temporary freeze on approximately NIS 2.8 billion ($760 million) in funds for the Palestinian Authority (PA), following a lawsuit filed by hundreds of victims of the October 7 Hamas attack and the subsequent war. The court ruled that the plaintiffs, who include survivors and relatives of victims, have a legal basis to claim compensation under Israel’s Compensation for Terror Victims Law. The ruling determined that each plaintiff is entitled, at this stage, to at least NIS 5 million ($1.35 million) in damages. As a result, the freeze on PA assets was increased by an additional NIS 2.72 billion ($740 million), in line with previous decisions on similar cases against the PA and Hamas. The lawsuit, led by attorney David Simana, represents individuals who suffered physical or psychological harm in the October 7 terror attack. Many of the plaintiffs reside in communities near Gaza and argue that the PA has long encouraged terrorism against Israel. The frozen funds are held by the Israeli government. Court rejects Palestinian Authority’s appeal The ruling follows a recent Israeli Supreme Court decision rejecting a PA petition to overturn a law allowing terror victims to sue those who finance attacks. Yitzhak Amit, who presided over the case, stated that the PA provides financial support to terrorists and their families in direct connection to their acts of violence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The PA claims a violation of its rights, but this alleged harm stems from its own decision to financially reward murderers whose hands are stained with the blood of innocent Israelis,' Amit wrote. 'The PA has the option to choose a different path and end its policy of incentivizing terrorism.' In its appeal, the PA had argued that it faced nearly 180 lawsuits from Israeli victims, with potential damages amounting to billions of shekels. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal, ruling that even if the law had political motivations, it did not justify its annulment. Attorney Simana welcomed the district court’s decision, calling it a significant step for victims of terror. 'This is the largest asset freeze ever granted in a terror victims’ lawsuit,' Simana said. 'We will continue to stand with bereaved families and survivors in this fight against terrorism.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj7wmd8tkl	2025-02-09T10:15:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/05/rkZr11uRD11kl/rkZr11uRD11kl_1_206_1970_1108_0_small.jpg
Hisham's family awaits his return after a decade in captivity: 'W...	Nothing is certain until he’s home,' says father of Hisham al-Sayed, set for release after decade in Gaza; 'We’ll hope only when we reunite'; His family last saw proof of life in 2022; now, he is included in the first phase of the hostage deal Sha’aban al-Sayed is approaching his 65th birthday, but for nearly a decade, he has not seen his son, Hisham, who is being held captive in Gaza. 'We haven’t prepared anything for his return,' al-Sayed told Ynet on Sunday. 'After 10 years, we’ve learned that nothing is certain until it happens.' The last time he saw Hisham was the day he disappeared. 'We talked like usual—just small talk,' al-Sayed recalled. 'I went to work, and he stayed home. He had no set routine; he would wander and then come back.' Hisham, a Bedouin from southern Israel, was born on Feb. 15, 1988. His father hopes he will return in time for his upcoming birthday. He crossed into Gaza in 2015 and was captured by Hamas. Now, he is expected to be released in the first phase of a hostage deal. 'We just want to see him first—then we’ll think about what comes next,' al-Sayed said. 'We’re not getting our hopes up. I’ll start allowing myself to feel when I see him. Until then, I’ve locked those emotions away.' His wife, he added, has taken a similar approach. 'She’s struggling emotionally. She doesn’t know what to feel.' The last sign of life from Hisham came in 2022 when Hamas released footage of him in Gaza, connected to an oxygen tank. 'Seeing that video didn’t give us hope—it just confirmed he was alive,' al-Sayed said. 'Hamas claimed he was very ill, but at least we got proof of life.' The Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum has been in contact with the family, al-Sayed said, and they find some comfort in staying connected with other hostage families. 'We don’t need the government—we’re just waiting for this deal to go through,' he said. 'The uncertainty is a nightmare.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Al-Sayed said he has watched previous hostage releases but remains cautious. 'The worry has always been there. It doesn’t change anything for me because we still have no information about him,' he said. 'Before Oct. 7, the country was different. After the attack, anything is possible.' He described his son as strong but said his mental illness had complicated his situation. Al-Sayed also praised Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for captives and missing persons. 'He’s one of the best coordinators we’ve had. He tries to stay emotionally connected to the families, and I feel he’s doing his best,' he said. 'Whenever I ask him something, he answers honestly, without political spin.' According to al-Sayed, Hirsch told him Hamas had repeatedly sabotaged negotiations before the latest deal was finalized. 'There was information about this deal six months ago,' he said. 'Hirsch was upfront about what was happening. He explained that Hamas had derailed talks multiple times before the final agreement.' Alongside Israeli media, al-Sayed follows both pro- and anti-Hamas Arabic news sources. 'I cross-check information,' he said. 'Our government has been trying to make a deal all along. Hamas blocked it and then blamed the government. Their goal is to create chaos.' He noted that Hamas dictated the order of hostage releases—prioritizing women, the elderly, the sick, and the deceased. 'I don’t care if Hisham is number two or number five,' he said. 'Avraham Mengistu is in the same category as my son—both are civilians with health conditions. There’s a difference between soldiers and sick civilians.' Since the Oct. 7 terror attack, al-Sayed has connected with many other hostage families who are now experiencing what his family has endured for a decade. 'We met Ethiopian families and families of soldiers. We didn’t feel any difference between us,' he said. 'The sheer number of hostages was shocking. It took me two weeks to process what had happened.' When the Hostage and Missing Persons Families first reached out, he hesitated to join. 'I didn’t know what to do,' he admitted. 'After so many disappointments, it took me time to connect. I can’t attend every event, but we try to stay in touch with all families—regardless of politics. The world has changed, and we’re focused on people, not political agendas.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by8dj00iyyx	2025-02-09T10:09:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/06/28/HJo2AoO59/HJo2AoO59_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Smotrich argued that Israel has never made policy decisions in response to abductions and should not start now. 'If we cross this red line and sign the second phase of the deal, what’s next?

Family confirms hostage Alon Ohel is alive but injured in Hamas c...	After 492 days, freed hostages confirm Ohel alive and held in inhumane conditions in Hamas tunnels; gifted musician, abducted from Nova festival, not set for release in first phase of hostage deal After 492 days in captivity, the family of Israeli hostage Alon Ohel received on Sunday confirmation that he is alive. The family was informed that Ohel, who was abducted from what has been called the 'shelter of death' at the Nova music festival massacre, is being held in Gaza. However, they also learned that he has an eye injury and is not receiving medical treatment. The confirmation came from recently released hostages who had been held with Ohel in Hamas' underground tunnel network since the day of his abduction. Ohel, who will turn 24 on Monday, is a gifted pianist and musician from Lavon, a community in northern Israel. He began playing at the age of nine and had planned to continue his musical studies at the Rimon School of Music, focusing on jazz. He had also intended to move to Tel Aviv to pursue his musical dreams. Those plans were shattered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists stormed the Nova festival in Kibbutz Re’im, killing hundreds and abducting scores of revelers. Ohel was among those taken to Gaza. Another hostage abducted from the same bunker, Elia Cohen, is reportedly among those set to be released in the first phase of the current hostage deal. In June 2024, video footage surfaced showing Ohel being taken hostage along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was later killed in captivity, Or Levy, who was freed on Saturday, and Cohen. Ohel’s family said he is being held in harsh conditions underground, without daylight or access to basic human necessities, and that he remains injured. His mother, Idit, told Ynet that the news was both overwhelming and emotional. 'The feelings are very complex and difficult. It’s very unsettling, but at the same time, we are also deeply moved to know that Alon is alive,' she said. 'It’s very distressing to hear about his condition from those who were recently released. He has been in the tunnels this entire time, suffering from severe captivity conditions, including poor nutrition. He has an eye injury we were not aware of.' Ohel’s family expressed outrage over his continued captivity and the suffering he and other hostages endure. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We are devastated and horrified by his dire physical and mental state and the abuse he and the other hostages are still enduring,' the family said in a statement. 'Alon has survived hell until now, but time is running out. The release of the hostages cannot be delayed. Every single one of them must be considered a humanitarian case.' His mother added, 'We must do everything—right now—to bring them home. All of them need to be released urgently. The condition of the men in captivity is deteriorating. We do not accept the selection process that was imposed. It must be corrected. There must be a meaningful push to release them week after week without pause.' The family has not yet spoken with Or Levy, who was abducted alongside Ohel. 'I would like to meet him, and I am waiting for any additional information,' Idit said. 'When Or is ready. He needs to be with his family now. He just found out that his wife was murdered. I want him to heal, and when the time comes for him to speak about Alon, we will be grateful to hear from him and visit him.' On Monday, Ohel will mark his 24th birthday in captivity. His family is organizing an event at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv at 7 p.m. to honor him. 'I have only one wish for Alon’s birthday—that he comes home now,' his mother said. 'Hold on, I know you are strong. Think of us, think of all the things you still want to accomplish. Think about music, about the things you love. Strength doesn’t only come from food—it comes from thoughts, from dreams, even from water… even from air, if he has it. Hold on—this will be over soon. We love him. An entire nation stands behind him, thinking of him and praying for him. He is strong, and he will get through this. Our family has endured hardships before, including hunger during the Holocaust. They survived. And Alon will survive. It is in his blood. He is strong—I know he is strong. He is amazing. When he returns, he will have so much to tell us, and an entire life to live with pride and to fulfill many dreams.' Through tears, she said she imagines the moment she will embrace her son again. 'I imagine his hands—his delicate pianist’s hands. Just to hold them, to see that they are okay, that he is okay,' she said. She urged the public to attend the gathering at Hostage Square. 'As many people as possible should come. Pray for him. I will lead a meditation for prayer, to strengthen and help bring about the release of the hostages.

Outrageous and preposterous': Herzog slams BBC for equating Hama...	President rejects interviewer’s claim of abuse against Palestinian prisoners, calling on network to change its approach and stressing October 7 constituted 'attack on the free world' President Isaac Herzog criticized the BBC on Sunday for equating Palestinian prisoners with Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, calling the comparison 'outrageous and preposterous.' Speaking on BBC’s Sunday Morning News, Herzog rejected interviewer Laura Kuenssberg’s claim that Palestinian prisoners face abuse and harsh conditions in Israeli jails, stressing that Israel abides by the rule of law and judicial oversight. Herzog emphasized that some Palestinian inmates even preferred to stay in Israeli prisons rather than return to Gaza. He urged the BBC to change its approach, calling the October 7 Hamas attack 'an attack on the entire free world' and defending Israel’s efforts to prevent further terrorism. 'What we are doing when we are catching terrorists who carried out these atrocities, we are simply preventing them from taking on further attacks against humanity,' Herzog also said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The president also described the dire conditions faced by the hostages, referencing the release of Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy, who returned emaciated and injured on Saturday after 491 days in captivity. 'They were held in tunnels throughout the entire period,' Herzog said. 'They had no contact with the outside world. They hardly ate. They returned completely emaciated, and they suffered from a huge amount of bruises, pain and wounds, and of course, we haven't even talked about their mental state yet. The level of suffering they endured is shocking, and we remain extremely concerned about the fate of the 76 hostages still in Gaza.' The BBC has faced ongoing criticism for its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. A recent Telegraph report accused the network of over 1,500 violations of its own editorial guidelines and a pattern of bias against Israel in its reporting. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rythob8yke	2025-02-09T07:42:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/Hk7Uq48t1l/Hk7Uq48t1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israeli airstrike targets Syrian military air base, report says	IDF reportedly carries out airstrike on Khalkhalah military airport in Syria’s Sweida province, day after Israeli Air Force jets targeted Hamas weapons depot in Damasucs countryside Israeli forces carried out an airstrike Sunday afternoon on the Khalkhalah Air Base in southern Syria’s Sweida province, according to Syrian media. The strike came just a day after the IDF struck a Hamas weapons depot in the country. Local reports said explosions were heard at the airport, accompanied by the sound of fighter jets. The pro-Iranian Iraqi news agency Sabereen News also reported blasts at the site, attributing the attack to Israel. On Saturday, the IDF confirmed it had struck a Hamas weapons warehouse in Syria, claiming that the arms stored there were intended 'for use in terrorist operations against Israeli forces.' According to the military, the attack took place in the Deir Ali area of southern Syria, guided by intelligence from the IDF’s Northern Command.

Enforcing buffer zone, IDF opens fire on Gazans near border, kill...	After IDF withdrawal from Netzarim Corridor, footage shows dozens of Gazans in buffer zone near Nahal Oz, hundreds of meters from border; Gaza border residents warn lack 'real security' and demand tougher measures Hours after the IDF withdrew from the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza, several dozen Palestinian residents were seen advancing hundreds of meters from the border fence near Nahal Oz on Sunday morning. The IDF, tasked with maintaining a 700-meter-wide security buffer along the border as part of the cease-fire and hostage release agreement, responded with drone strikes and gunfire, killing three people and wounding at least six others. According to reports from Gaza, the casualties were taken to Al-Ma’amdani Hospital in Gaza City. The IDF reported that the individuals were unarmed and had entered the Netzarim Corridor, but moved away after the gunfire. The Otef Israel Forum, representing hundreds of residents in Israeli communities near Gaza, expressed outrage and concern, demanding stricter enforcement of security measures. 'Is this what real security looks like? We warned about this two weeks ago,' the group said in a statement, referencing a letter sent to Defense Minister Israel Katz. The forum criticized what it described as weak open-fire policies and called for a more aggressive approach, urging the government to declare the buffer zone a 'dead zone' with a zero-tolerance policy toward any infiltration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF responded by reaffirming its commitment to securing Israeli communities. 'IDF soldiers operating in northern Gaza identified suspicious figures moving near them and fired toward them. Several hits were confirmed, and the individuals fled. The IDF remains determined to protect Israeli residents and will continue to act against any violations while adhering to the cease-fire agreement,' the military said in a statement, urging Gaza residents to stay away from Israeli forces. The IDF’s withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor, mandated by the cease-fire agreement, was completed overnight Saturday. The evacuated positions were located east of Salah al-Din Road, a major north-south route through Gaza. With this withdrawal, Israeli forces are no longer stationed in northern Gaza, except for 162nd Division units deployed within the buffer zone near the border. Israeli forces remain stationed along the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza. The withdrawal process began last month, initially allowing over half a million displaced Palestinians to move northward from southern Gaza. Images of this movement circulated widely, with Hamas operatives, some armed, reportedly directing civilians back toward Gaza City. In parallel with the IDF's withdrawal, an American security company was deployed to conduct inspections of people and vehicles entering the area. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjt11unufkx	2025-02-09T07:24:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/HksL178KJe/HksL178KJe_1_125_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF expands Iron Wall op in West Bank, targets Nur al-Shams terro...	IDF expands its operation in the northern section of the West Bank, targeting Nur al-Shams refugee camp, a hub for terror activity; Troops dismantle explosives and arrest terrorists as defense minister vows to eliminate terror infrastructure and prevent its resurgence Hundreds of terrorists, some with blood on their hands, have been released so far as part of the cease-fire hostage return deal with Hamas, many of whom have returned to the West Bank. In response, the IDF is expanding its operations in the region. On the 20th day of Operation Iron Wall, the IDF spokesperson announced on Sunday morning that IDF troops, alongside Border Police and Shin Bet forces, began operating overnight in Nur al-Shams, a so-called refugee camp near Tulkarm that has become a stronghold for terror activity. During the opening strike of the operation, troops fired at several armed terrorists. According to security sources, hits were confirmed, with several terrorists killed and others arrested. Palestinians claimed that a 23-year-old woman, who was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, was killed, and her husband critically injured by IDF gunfire after the troops entered the camp. Under the command of Ephraim Brigade Commander Col. Netanel Shamaka, troops are stationed in various parts of the camp, working to clear paths and dismantle explosive devices planted underground – a known tactic used by the terrorists. Progress within the camp is very slow due to the dense population and crowded conditions. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated this morning that 'IDF troops are expanding the operation in the northern section of the West Bank to include the Nur al-Shams refugee camp. We are dismantling the terror infrastructure in the camps and preventing its resurgence. We will not allow the Iranian axis of evil to establish an eastern terror front that threatens the communities of the West Bank, the Seam Zone, and major population centers in Israel.' This marks the fourth target in the expansion of Operation Iron Wall, following operations in Jenin, Tulkarm, and the villages of Tamun and Tubas in the northern Jordan Valley. Nur al-Shams is considered one of the refugee camps where local terror infrastructure has grown significantly. The phenomenon of armed brigades, which began with the Lion’s Den group in Nablus that was dismantled and moved to Jenin, has advanced further in Nur al-Shams. This includes an organization of dozens of terrorists responsible for numerous shooting attacks on IDF troops and residents of communities along the Seam Zone between Israeli territory and the West Bank. Currently, Central Command forces are deployed in three brigade combat teams with special units: in Jenin the Menashe Brigade team is operating; in Tulkarm and Nur al-Shams, the Ephraim Brigade team is active; and in the villages of Tamun, Tayasir, Tubas, and Fara’a, the combat team from the Basic Training Base for Field Units is working. Altogether, hundreds of soldiers are deployed in the northern section of the West Bank with special units, focusing on seizing command centers, operations rooms and explosives labs in the heart of the camps, as well as pursuing terrorists who flee the camps. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Shin Bet is operating alongside IDF troops in the operation, directing forces to arrest and neutralize targets, while also working to thwart terror attacks in the West Bank and within Israel. Since the beginning of the year, the Shin Bet has engaged in intensive activity, successfully preventing about 150 major attacks, including 45 bombing attempts that were thwarted through arrests of terrorists and terror cells in the West Bank that were manufacturing explosives and planning attacks. During the operation, Shin Bet and Border Police have foiled no fewer than eight significant attacks, some through airstrikes and others through arrests or the elimination of terrorists. Some countermeasures involved closing intelligence loops, such as the elimination of two terrorists responsible for the shooting attack in the Palestinian village of Funduq, which killed Police Officer Elad Winkelstein, 35; Rachel Cohen, 70; and Aliza Reiss, 73. Additionally, two terrorists involved in the bombing in the village of Tamun, which killed Staff Sergeant (Res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda, were eliminated. According to security sources, the IDF is expected to remain in the northern section of the West Bank for an extended period, possibly staying through the Ramadan period, which begins at the end of the month. One reason for remaining in the area is to neutralize the terror brigades, but also to prevent celebrations and armed parades in honor of terrorists released weekly to the West Bank in exchange for hostages. Moreover, the Shin Bet and IDF are monitoring those released prisoners. Just last week, a senior security official stated that, based on intelligence data, most released terrorists return to engaging in various forms of terror activity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkjamwukyl	2025-02-09T04:39:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/S1eJHSbUt1e/S1eJHSbUt1e_483_617_2238_1260_0_small.jpg

Zangauker and Cohen families ask for court to issue injunction compelling government to implement the deal to the end after it was approved by the cabinet, saying lives of hostages are at stake The families of Matan Zangauker and Nimrod Cohen, both held hostage in Gaza, on Sunday filed an urgent motion to the Supreme Court demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the government reveal the terms of the Gaza cease-fire agreement signed on January 15. The families and especially those of hostages that were not included in the first phase of the deal 'have a right to know the details of the agreement who directly effect their loved ones,' the motion read. Einav Zangauker, Matan's mother and Vicky and Yehuda Cohen, Nimrod's parents along with his siblings, claimed that the government must implement the phases of the cease-fire deal without delay after they were approved by the cabinet. 'The time passing, endangers the lives of the hostages,' they wrote, naming at least 26 hostages murdered in captivity. The families also seek an injunction that would compel the government to divulge the instructions given to the negotiating team meeting with the mediators, out of concern that there would be an attempt to foil the completion of the deal.

Thai nationals held captive by Hamas for 15 months return home	Five Thai nationals held captive by Hamas for over a year returned to Thailand on Sunday, reuniting with their tearful families at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport. The returnees, dressed in winter jackets, were met with emotional embraces from their families. According to Israeli authorities, Hamas terrorists abducted at least 240 people, including Israelis and foreign nationals, in an October 2023 attack on the Israeli border. During the attack, Hamas gunmen killed 41 Thais and kidnapped 30 Thai laborers. Later that year, the first group of Thai hostages was returned. Before the conflict, approximately 30,000 Thai laborers worked in Israel's agriculture sector, making them one of the largest migrant worker groups in the country. Nearly 9,000 Thais were repatriated following the attack. Thailand's foreign ministry said a Thai national is still believed to be held captive by Hamas, as well as two bodies of killed Thais.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkpyvmuykx	2025-02-09T04:05:15-08:00

Ella Ben Ami shared moments from the first day with her father, who returned after 70 weeks in captivity in Gaza, on Instagram; 'A night in the hospital for the best reasons' she wrote. Ella Ben Ami, the daughter of Ohad, who returned to Israel on Saturday as part of the fifth hostage return of the current deal, shared her fight for her father's return throughout the process. Now she's also making sure to document every moment after his return and isn't hiding her excitement at Ichilov Medical Center in Tel Aviv. Following the footage of the meeting between Ohad and his three daughters after his 70 weeks in captivity, Ella shared the first hours together at night in the special room prepared for him in the hospital. 'A night in the hospital for the best reasons possible,' she shared. 'Dad came back to us, smiles, laughs at us and hugs us for a long time. Hearing his voice again is an exciting that I have no way of explaining.' However, she also shared her concerns for the 76 hostages still in captivity and wrote that 'along with all the happiness, the images of him getting out of the Hamas car will never be erased from my mind. After everything that happened this day, the only thing that goes through my mind is how we must get everyone out of there, get everyone out of this hell, and quickly.' Hours later, she shared that they were eating breakfast together for the first time in 492 days. 'It wasn't a dream, Dad is here eating breakfast and I'm sitting next to him and I can't take my eyes off him. I'm afraid he'll disappear if I close them for a moment,' she wrote. Ayelet Hakim, Ohad's sister-in-law, shared in an interview with Ynet that even now 'the roller coaster never stops for a moment. Even when we saw him leave, the pictures were horrific, but Ohadi is back and we can see him up close, which is very moving. Ohad always used his sense of humor in both happy and sad situations. I was happy to see that he kept it and used it a few hours after he left the horrors of Gaza.' She noted that she had yet to see him in person, but that she had spoken to her relatives who did. 'He is mentally and emotionally strong and you can see it in him. We are a big family and I am waiting in line to see him; hopefully it will happen tonight or tomorrow morning,' she said. When asked what the first thing he ate was, she shared that first of all she was encouraged by the fact that he was eating: 'They tell me that he is eating, for Ohad, food takes up a big part of life. He eats and undergoes tests. He is thin, but he is the same Ohad. He ate burekas and treats. That's what he wanted. It sounds like a return to life.' Ayelet also addressed his request to know what happened since he was kidnapped - and in particular about October 7. 'I think he knows more than we think,' she said. 'He has a lot of gaps to fill - and a lot of tragedies to hear. He has no home to return to in Be'eri. He has the mental capacity to deal with the news he will receive. The fact that Natalie enlisted in the army and Ohad wrapped himself in the Israeli flag means that it is a good sign for the State of Israel that we continue like this. He said that he knows that there are a lot of difficult things that he needs to hear.'

According to her, 'He hasn't lost his sense of humor, his sharpness and his practical thinking. You can see that he is slowly returning to himself. He came back very weak and lost a lot of weight, but apart from the physical weakness - in terms of the mind he is strong. We are all surrounding us and he will be completely fine.' She said that he doesn't share too much about his period in captivity, but he told them that every day he thought about everyone and prayed for everyone's health. 'We were shocked,' she shared. 'He did kiddush and havdalah there, and prayed for everyone. He grew very strong in captivity. Occasionally they watched television there, but nothing more.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj0bqbikyx	2025-02-09T03:58:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/rketriMHF1x/rketriMHF1x_0_0_1600_1067_0_small.jpg

If US makes nuclear deal with Iran, Israel will not bomb it, Trum...	After discussing the issue with Netanyahu, the American president told the New York Post he would like to make a deal with Iran on the nuclear issue, thus saving it from an Israeli airstrike; 'They don't want to die' U.S. President Donald Trump reiterates his messages to Iran regarding its nuclear program. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it,' he tells the New York Post. 'They don’t want to die. Nobody wants to die.' He emphasized Israel would not strike Iran if a nuclear deal is completed. About two weeks ago, Trump said it would 'be nice' if the Iranian issue was to be solved without Israel attacking military facilities on its territory. The American president did not rule out the possibility of an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities at the time, but repeatedly signaled that he intended to promote a new agreement on the issue. Trump later said that he intended to speak with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Shortly before meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday, the American president signed a renewal of the 'maximum pressure' policy, which is intended to impose heavy sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump said that Iran is too close to a nuclear weapon, and warned that if Tehran decided to assassinate him in response, Iran would be 'obliterated.' He said that he left 'instructions' to do so in the event that Tehran did assassinate him. Later, in a meeting with Netanyahu in front of the cameras, the American president claimed that Iran is not weak, but strong. He added that Iran was in big trouble when he left office, having no money to pay Hamas and Hezbollah. 'They sold huge amounts of oil to China. They became rich very quickly,' Trump explained. He also claims that October 7 would not have happened under his leadership as well as the Russia-Ukraine war. After the meeting, at a joint press conference with Netanyahu in which he announced his proposal to take over the Gaza Strip and displace its residents, Trump said: 'During my term, I have brought peace and stability to the Middle East that they have not seen in decades. We withdrew from the nuclear agreement and imposed very harsh sanctions on the Iranian regime. We stopped Iran's proxies and deprived them of resources.' The American president added that he hopes that Iran will be a peaceful country. 'I want Iran to be peaceful and successful. I hated doing it. I did it once before. And we brought them down to a level where they were unable to give any money. They had to survive themselves. And they had no money. They were essentially broke,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump stressed his objection to Iran's nuclear efforts. 'They cannot have a nuclear weapon. It’s very simple. I’m not putting restrictions. I’m not. They cannot have one thing. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. And if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, despite what I just said, I think that’s going to be very unfortunate for them,' he said. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said on Friday, referring to the pressure on Iran through the imposition of sanctions: 'This is an illegitimate and illegal action. As far as Iran is concerned, the United States is responsible for the consequences of such unilateral and bullying actions.' Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, even responded to Trump with a strong message. 'If they threaten our security, we threaten theirs. If they harm the security of the Iranian people, we will undoubtedly harm their security,' Khamenei said in a speech in Tehran on Friday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryn500liyje	2025-02-09T02:20:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

IDF burns equipment, leaves Netzarim Corridor: 'Hamas is regroupi...	In line with the hostage deal, the IDF began withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor, its last northern Gaza foothold; Hamas called the move a 'victory' while IDF troops pledged to return, burning outpost equipment to prevent its use by Hamas In accordance with the framework of the hostage deal and directives from the political leadership, the IDF began a gradual withdrawal on Saturday night from the last outposts along the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts the Gaza Strip in half. A video circulated on social media showed an officer addressing his troops over the radio, stating that this is only a temporary retreat: 'We will return here, don’t worry. Hamas is regrouping, and so are we.' 'We will bring back all the hostages, the Trump Plan will be implemented, and we will return to settle all the communities here,' the officer added. At the same time, footage emerged showing IDF troops burning the contents of the last evacuated outposts to prevent the equipment from falling into the hands of Hamas. The IDF has not yet responded to the footage being circulated. The head of Hamas’ governmental media office told the Qatari channel Al-Araby that the IDF’s withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor 'will restore movement between the districts of the Gaza Strip.' He added that 'the withdrawal is one of the most important achievements of our people. International organizations have begun gradually returning to northern Gaza. We have renovated the UNRWA headquarters in the north to resume aid work there, and we expect the agency’s workers to return now.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the withdrawal from Netzarim as 'humiliating' and claimed it represents 'a declaration of Netanyahu’s defeat and failure to achieve his goals or maintain his hold on Gaza’s territory.' He added that 'in 2005, (then-Prime Minister Ariel )Sharon withdrew from Gaza even though he used to say, ‘Netzarim is like Tel Aviv.’ These invasions have repeated themselves, but the result is the same – Gaza remains resilient against invaders.' Netzarim Corridor, controlled by the 36th Division, served as the last barrier between the southern and northern parts of the Gaza Strip. After the full withdrawal, no IDF troops will remain in the northern Gaza Strip, except for the 162nd Division, which is deployed in the buffer zone area. Around two weeks ago, the process of evacuating the Netzarim Corridor began, with IDF troops initially withdrawing from the western side of the corridor. This allowed more than half a million Palestinians to return from the southern Gaza Strip to Gaza City in the north. Alongside the withdrawal, an American security company was deployed to the area to conduct inspections of those arriving by vehicle or on foot. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy0093gutkg	2025-02-09T01:47:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/r1c6jaHtkg/r1c6jaHtkg_0_206_288_163_0_small.jpg
Outrage grows over cabinet inaction on locking down next phase of...	The Israeli government delays crucial Security Cabinet discussions on Phase B of the cease-fire and hostage return deal despite growing public outrage; Families demand urgent action after released hostages appeared gaunt and frail, highlighting the dire conditions of the 76 remaining captives The Security Cabinet meeting on Phase B of the hostage deal has yet to be scheduled, despite a promise made Saturday night by a 'political source' to convene it after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's return to Israel from Washington. On Sunday morning, as Netanyahu boarded the official state Wing of Zion plane, it was revealed that the Cabinet ministers would meet only on Tuesday, or possibly even Thursday. On Sunday evening, upon Netanyahu’s return to Israel, a government meeting will take place, but it will focus on 'how to investigate the events of October 7,' following a deadline set by the High Court of Justice for the government to hold a discussion on this topic. Last night, after the briefing by the political source, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed outrage and demanded the Cabinet convene immediately in light of the horrifying images of Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy, and Eli Sharabi upon their release on Saturday morning during the fifth hostage release of the deal. The three hostages were released from Hamas captivity appearing gaunt, emaciated and pale. 'How, after the horrifying images of Eli, Ohad and Or this morning, is the Cabinet not convening immediately?' the Forum asked in a statement. 'What more proof is needed for decision-makers to understand the critical urgency of bringing back the remaining 76 hostages?' Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation departed for Doha, this time joined by Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch and a senior Shin Bet official. However, the Forum expressed dissatisfaction, noting that this delegation is not authorized to discuss Phase II of the deal, but only to continue Phase I, which is still ongoing. The Forum called on Netanyahu to 'send a negotiation delegation to Qatar with a clear and full mandate to finalize the agreement urgently, ensuring the return of the last hostage, with a clear timeline and terms.' Fifth round of hostage releases According to the agreement, discussions on Phase II of the deal were supposed to begin on the 16th day of the agreement, which was a week ago. Netanyahu, who has so far refrained from sending a delegation to discuss the continuation of the deal, considered the meetings he held during his visit to the U.S. with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, on the 16th day, as the initiation of the discussions stipulated in the agreement. After the fifth round of releases, 76 hostages remain in captivity. Of the 33 hostages slated for release in Phase I, 16 have been released so far, alongside five Thai citizens who were freed outside the framework of the agreement. Three more rounds of releases remain in Phase I. Of the 17 hostages expected to be released in these rounds, eight are no longer alive. The next two phases will see the release of three hostages each, and in the final week, 11 additional hostages will be freed, including, as per the agreement, Hisham al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu, who have been held in captivity for over a decade. Among the hostages yet to be released in Phase I are Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, whose fate is of grave concern to the IDF. Additionally, five men categorized as elderly are expected to be released: Itzik Algert, Shlomo Mansour, Ohad Yahalomi, Oded Lifshitz, and Tsahi Idan. Nine hostages classified as ill or injured are also expected to be released: Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Alexander Trupanov, Elia Cohen, Tal Shem, Omer Shem Tov, as well as Mengistu and al-Sayed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Alongside the deep shock felt by the public, politicians also expressed anger on Saturday night over Hamas' gruesome display and the condition of the hostages upon their release. Netanyahu, still in Washington at the time, issued his first statement – half a day after the horrifying images were revealed: 'Once again, we have seen the monstrosity of Hamas. These are the same monsters who massacred our citizens and tortured our captives. And I say to them again: Their blood is on their hands. We will do everything to bring back all our hostages. We will ensure their security. This is the directive I have given to the delegation – to convey this message to the mediators and demand it.' However, senior Israeli officials said on Saturday that the country’s leadership was not truly surprised by the horrifying images of the hostages, which reminded many of Holocaust survivors. 'The shocking impact of the images is on the public,' the officials said. 'The political echelon was fully aware of the hostages’ condition, including those released today. Those familiar with the facts were not surprised at all,' they added. Following the officials’ statements and the apparent 'shock' of politicians, hostage families themselves testified that they had been informed of the dire conditions in which their loved ones were being held. Tal Levy, Or Levy’s brother, said in an interview on Sunday morning with Reshet Bet radio that official sources had told him and his family months ago, before Yahya Sinwar was targeted, that men were being starved under his orders. 'I don’t think he [Or] would have survived another month,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxidj8tjg	2025-02-09T00:42:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/rJMIVi4tyx/rJMIVi4tyx_0_75_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Despite US, Hezbollah joins new Lebanon government	Tasked with rebuilding the war-torn nation, tackling economic crises, and restoring stability, the 24-member cabinet must secure parliamentary approval to address Lebanon’s pressing challenges Lebanon’s presidential office announced the formation of a new government led by Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salamon Saturday, consisting of 24 ministers, including from Hezbollah, despite the 'red line' drawn by the U.S. that insisted that the Iran backed group not be included. The Lebanese network LBCI reported that Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri from the Shi'ite Amal Party which is an ally of Hezbollah, had met with Morgan Ortagus, the U.S. Deputy Envoy to the Middle East, over the weekend and assured her that the government would be formed 'today or tomorrow.' During her visit to Lebanon, Ortagus emphasized that the United States opposes Hezbollah's involvement in the new government. 'Israel has succeeded in defeating Hezbollah, and we commend it for this. The United States is committed to a partnership and friendship with Lebanon’s new government, and we are all dedicated to curbing Hezbollah’s influence,' Ortagus said. 'Hezbollah cannot be part of the Lebanese government. Their era is over. We are holding discussions with Lebanon and Israel regarding the redeployment of Lebanese forces in the south and remain committed to the February 18 deadline. We are not afraid of Hezbollah because they have been militarily defeated.' The announcement of the government’s formation follows weeks of consultations. As recently as last Thursday, reports indicated that the formation had 'failed at the last minute,' with the final hurdles stemming from the need to appoint the fifth Shia minister. The Shia duo (the Amal Movement, led by Speaker Berri, and Hezbollah) secured five portfolios in the new government. The government also includes five female ministers overseeing the education, welfare, tourism, youth and sports, and environmental portfolios. President Joseph Aoun expressed satisfaction with the formation of the new government, saying that its members are 'non-partisan and will serve all Lebanese citizens, as their goal is Lebanon’s national interest.' 'Reform is the only way to save the country. Rebuilding the south is not a promise; it is a commitment. We will continue with economic reforms and establish an independent judiciary. The government will be dedicated to constructive work, not conflict,' Prime Minister Salam said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The new government must now draft a policy statement outlining its approach and priorities, which will require a vote of confidence from parliament to fully assume its powers. The first meeting of the new ministers is scheduled for this coming Tuesday at 11 a.m. The government faces numerous challenges, including rebuilding Lebanon in the aftermath of the war, addressing the severe economic crisis, and advancing the state, which has operated without a president for the past two years. The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon welcomed the formation of the new government. 'The Lebanese people deserve a government that will rebuild state institutions, fight corruption, and implement necessary reforms,' the embassy said in a post on X. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry also issued a statement congratulating Lebanon on forming its new government: 'The establishment of the new government in Lebanon is an important step toward a new phase of fulfilling the aspirations of the Lebanese people and preserving Lebanon’s sovereignty, unity, security, and stability. Egypt will continue to provide all forms of support to Lebanon.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b100yw0hkke	2025-02-09T00:36:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/BJ31WYXKkl/BJ31WYXKkl_0_87_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Or Levy learns of wife's murder upon release from captivity	After being held hostage for 491 days, Levy reunites with young son but confronted with the devastating truths that Einav, his wife did not survive the massacre at the Nova festival; Also learns fellow captives Hersh, Almog, executed by Hamas in Gaza Or Levy was abducted by terrorists from the 'death shelter,' where he had sought refuge with his wife Einav and many others during the Nova music festival amid the Hamas' carnage on October 7. What was meant to protect their lives turned into a death trap—Einav was murdered in the shelter alongside 15 other victims. On Saturday, Or finally returned home, reuniting with his 3-year-old son, Almog, but also received the devastating news of his wife’s murder. The heroism displayed in that shelter has already been widely recounted. Among those who fought back against the grenades thrown inside by the terrorists was Aner Shapira, a fallen soldier from the Nahal Brigade’s elite unit who had been on leave that day and was attending the Nova festival. With extraordinary courage, Aner stood at the shelter’s entrance, repeatedly catching and throwing back the grenades. The eighth grenade exploded in his hands, killing him. Or’s mother, Geula, shared on Saturday with Army Radio that after his release, Or said he knew Aner’s story and expressed a strong desire to meet his parents. 'He’s a hero, and we all know he’s a hero. Thanks to him, my son is alive,' she said. She added that Or recounted how he himself threw the last grenade tossed by the terrorists before he was abducted. 'He said he didn’t even have a chance to turn around and see his wife.' From that same shelter, Hersh Goldberg-Polin was also abducted, and was murdered in captivity at the end of August. 'Or knows what happened in the shelter; he knows about Polin’s injury. He thought Polin had been released. He asked me if we had heard the name,' Geula said. She also revealed that Or mistakenly believed Almog Sarusi, who was murdered alongside Hersh and four other hostages in a tunnel, had been freed. 'He was convinced that Hersh and Almog had returned,' she said. She noted that Or 'was held in a tunnel without communication and could only guess that his wife Einav had been murdered. On Saturday, he asked, and they told him.' Moshe Shapira, the father of Aner, expressed great joy about the release of the man his son had helped save in the shelter, saying he hopes to meet Or soon. 'Blessed is He who has kept us alive, sustained us, and brought us to this moment. It’s incredibly moving and incredibly joyous. What Aner started has now come full circle. Or was saved and can now embrace his family and his son, and we pray for the release of all the others. There’s nothing greater than this.' Moshe added, 'From the shelter, four people were abducted to Gaza; two of them remain in captivity: Elia Cohen and Alon Ehal. We are praying for their release, and may there be a complete group of survivors thanks to Aner,' referring to the fact that seven people from the shelter survived the attack. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He continued, 'The shelter brought us a heavy blow when Hersh was killed, and we had hoped he would return. He is forever connected to Aner in our hearts. I’m glad we have a little light now. Whenever Or is ready, we’ll be very happy to embrace him and his entire family. We were moved by the return of every hostage, of course, but the hostages from the shelter especially touch our hearts. The state’s mission is to bring all the hostages home as quickly as possible and return to being a unified nation without divisions. This is a matter of saving lives—there is no debate here.' Rachel Goldberg-Polin, Hersh’s mother, whose son was abducted from the same shelter along with Or, said: 'We received the wonderful news that Eli, Or, and Ohad were released today. We feel a deep connection to Or and his family because he and Hersh were abducted together from the same shelter, on the same truck, on October 7. In fact, Or's brother reached out to us immediately after the Sabbath to let us know that one of the first questions Or asked his brother that morning was how Hersh was doing. He assumed Hersh had been released long ago, and his brother had to explain to him that Hersh was murdered five months ago.' Hersh’s father, John, added: 'Seeing the condition of the three hostages, hearing that Or had no idea what happened to Hersh, that Eli wasn’t aware of the fate of his wife and daughters—it’s just a gut punch for all of us, and it reminds us that we need to do more. I’m speaking directly to President Trump and Steve Witkoff—you’ve shown that you’re the only ones who managed to move this situation forward. Let’s not think in terms of Phase A, Phase B, and Phase C over many months. Let’s think bigger and faster. Release all 76 hostages this week. End the war. Let’s get this done now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjeu36bkjx	2025-02-08T22:53:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/H1ikQ7SFyg/H1ikQ7SFyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu: Saudi normalization after Iran, Hamas defeated	Prime minister tells Fox when Israel completes transforming the Middle East, it would set the stage for peace through strength; praises Trump Gaza plan, blames Egypt for preventing Palestinians from leaving the Strip Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said normalization with Saudi Arabia would come after Hamas is defeated and the Iranian axis cut. His comments came after Riyadh denied claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump that that there was no Saudi demand for an establishment of a Palestinian state before normalization with Israel could take place. 'When we complete the changeover in the Middle East, when we cut the Iranian axis down even further that we've already cut it, when we make sure Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons, when we destroy Hamas, that will set the stage for an additional agreement with the Saudis and with others,' Netanyahu said. 'I believe also in the Muslim world because it's peace through strength.' Netnayahu said there was no longer any belief that there could be a Palestinian State after the Oct. 7 massacre, 'They had one, it's called Gaza,' he said. 'We got the Abraham Accord because we went around the Palestinians,' he said claiming the Palestinian Authority, like Hamas seeks the destruction of Israel. Israel is small he said, praising Trump for cutting to the chase. 'We can't be any smaller, we're not going to have an organization that is committed to our destruction, nine miles from the sea.' Netanyahu again expressed his enthusiasm for Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza while the Strip was rebuilt. He said Israel would destroy Hamas, that was its job so no American forces would be needed or tax payer dollars used. I think the proposal is the first fresh idea. 'Gaza is basically a small area 25 miles from Tel Aviv which Hamas has used as a springboard for continuous terrorists attacks against Israel,' he said. 'Then comes president Trump and says hey, let them leave, and I'll find a place for a temporary relocation,' he said. 'Not forceful eviction, not ethnic cleansing, getting people out of what these do-gooders' say is an open-air prison.'

Saudi Arabia rejects Netanyahu's remarks on displacing Palestinia...	Saudi statement mentions Netanyahu's name but does not directly refer to the prime minister's comments about establishing a Palestinian state in Saudi territory Saudi Arabia affirmed its categorical rejection of remarks by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about displacing Palestinians from their land, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. In an interview on a friendly channel 14 last Thursday, Netanyahu was asked how he would bridge the gap between U.S. President Donald Trump's claim the Saudi Arabi did not demand the establishement of a Palestinian State and Riyadh's denial. The interviewer mistakenly said 'Saudi state' instead of 'Palestinian state.' The prime minister corrected him but added in jest that perhaps Saudi Arabia could allow a Palestinian state in its own vast territory. While the Saudi statement mentioned Netanyahu's name, it did not directly refer to the comments about establishing a Palestinian state in Saudi territory. Egypt and Jordan also condemned the Israeli suggestions, with Cairo deeming the idea as a 'direct infringement of Saudi sovereignty'. The kingdom said it valued 'brotherly' states' rejection of Netanyahu's remarks. 'This occupying extremist mindset does not comprehend what the Palestinian territory means for the brotherly people of Palestine and its conscientious, historical and legal association with that land,' it said. Discussions of the fate of Palestinians in Gaza has been upended by Tuesday's shock proposal from President Donald Trump that the U.S. would 'take over the Gaza Strip' from Israel and create a 'Riviera of the Middle East' after resettling Palestinians elsewhere. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab states have roundly condemned Trump's comments. Trump has said Saudi Arabia was not demanding a Palestinian state as a condition for normalising ties with Israel. But Riyadh rebuffed his statements, saying it would not establish ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state.

Phase I nears end: 17 hostages await release as Israel signals to...	Israeli officials voice outrage over frail condition of freed hostages, as Netanyahu’s camp signals tougher stance for Phase II talks; some officials call reaction performative, saying, 'Everyone knew they were starved'; Israeli delegation heads to Qatar with no clear mandate 17 hostages still in Gaza to be released under Phase I of hostage agreement and Israel’s toughens position Three Israeli hostages—Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy and Eli Sharabi—were freed on Saturday in the latest phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal with Hamas, returning home after 491 days in captivity in Gaza. However, their release was marred by disturbing images, as the three appeared severely emaciated and weak, forced to participate in a Hamas-led display in central Gaza before being handed over to the Red Cross. While their reunions with families in Israel were emotional, they were also accompanied by heartbreaking revelations. Eli Sharabi was informed that his wife Lianne and daughters Noiya and Yahel were murdered in the October 7 attack, along with his brother Yossi, who was also taken hostage but later killed in captivity. Or Levy, who reunited with his three-year-old son Almog, learned that his wife Einav was also murdered that day. Remaining hostages and next phases of the deal With the completion of this round, 76 hostages remain in Gaza. Under Phase I of the agreement, a total of 33 hostages were set to be released, of whom 16 have now returned, alongside five Thai nationals freed separately. The final three rounds of releases in Phase I are expected to free 17 more hostages, including eight who are deceased. The next two rounds will see three hostages freed in each, followed by a final release of 11 hostages, including Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held by Hamas for a decade. Among those still unaccounted for are Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, with growing concerns over their fate. Other hostages expected to be released include five older male captives and nine who are sick or wounded. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dispatched an Israeli delegation to Qatar on Saturday night to continue negotiations on Phase I, but without authorization to discuss Phase II, which would involve the release of all remaining living hostages. Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza as part of that phase. Although formal talks on Phase II were originally expected to begin Monday, discussions have so far been limited to behind-the-scenes contacts, with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff playing a key role. The Israeli delegation to Doha is officially tasked with handling technical aspects of Phase I, amid Israeli accusations that Hamas has already violated parts of the agreement. Netanyahu upgraded the delegation’s status, adding Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch to the team. However, sources familiar with the negotiations questioned the move, noting that Hirsch had not been directly involved in talks until now and was primarily responsible for liaison with hostage families. The delegation also includes a former deputy head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, though it remains focused on technical negotiations rather than broader hostage-release terms. Delegation to Qatar with no mandate The delegation was dispatched to Doha to continue negotiations on the remaining hostage releases under Phase I of the cease-fire agreement with Hamas. However, diplomatic sources indicate the mission is largely symbolic, as formal talks on Phase II—intended to secure the release of all remaining hostages—were supposed to begin last Monday. Witkoff urged Netanyahu to send negotiators to advance discussions on the next stage of the deal. From the perspective of the U.S. and mediating nations, this marks the beginning of Phase II. However, Israeli officials insist that talks on Phase II will not take place until after a Security Cabinet meeting, which is yet to be scheduled. It remains unclear whether the Cabinet will convene on Monday or Tuesday, but until then, Israeli negotiators will limit discussions to Phase I. 'With the completion of the latest hostage release, Prime Minister Netanyahu has instructed the delegation to focus on technical aspects of the agreement,' a senior Israeli official. 'Upon his return to Israel, he will convene the security cabinet to determine Israel’s stance on Phase II.' The delegation arrives in Doha amid Israeli outrage over Hamas' treatment of the three freed hostages, who appeared severely emaciated and were forced to participate in a Hamas-led public display before their release. Netanyahu, who remains in Washington, condemned the hostage release as a 'horrific spectacle,' vowing to eliminate Hamas while ensuring the safe return of all hostages. 'We will do everything to bring our hostages home, but Hamas will not be there,' Netanyahu said. 'Trump fully agrees with me on this. We will destroy Hamas and bring our people back.' He added: 'Sara and I embrace Ohad, Eli and Or, along with their families. We have once again witnessed the barbarity of Hamas—the same monsters who massacred our people and tormented our hostages. Their blood is on their own hands. Our delegation has clear instructions to convey this to mediators and demand action.' While the public was deeply shaken by images of the hostages—reminiscent of Holocaust survivors—senior Israeli officials said the government was fully aware of their deteriorating state long before their release. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The shocking impact of these images is on the public,' one official said. 'The political leadership was well-informed about the hostages' condition, including those released today. Anyone familiar with the facts was not surprised.' Israel faces limited options in responding to Hamas' violations of the cease-fire agreement, as any action could be interpreted as a breach of the deal. While Israel is unlikely to derail the agreement before all 33 hostages under Phase I are freed, officials are considering interim measures, such as: Delaying humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, though this could be seen as a clear violation of the agreement. Reducing the number of wounded Gazans allowed to exit via the Rafah crossing for medical treatment. Delaying IDF withdrawals within Gaza, including the planned overnight retreat from Netzarim Corridor, a key corridor established by Israeli forces during the ground operation. Clock is ticking Israel's anger over Hamas' treatment of freed hostages has so far remained within the framework of ongoing negotiations on Phase I of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. However, officials suggest that the shocking images of emaciated hostages may strengthen Israel’s demands for Phase II, making an agreement even less likely. Israeli officials are expected to insist on strict conditions for a second-phase deal, including the exile of Hamas leaders, the dismantling of its military wing, the disarmament of Gaza and the release of all remaining hostages. However, there is little chance Hamas will accept these terms, raising doubts about whether Phase II will ever materialize. While a full-fledged agreement seems unlikely, some officials do not rule out an extension of Phase I, which could involve the incremental release of additional hostages and a prolonged cease-fire. Israel is also expected to complete its withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor—the buffer zone along Gaza’s border with Egypt—by the 50th day of the cease-fire. However, following global outrage over Hamas' treatment of the hostages, there is widespread skepticism that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would authorize such a withdrawal. Faced with the dilemma of resuming military operations or proceeding with hostage negotiations, momentum appears to be shifting toward renewed fighting. This sentiment is echoed by Netanyahu’s inner circle, with his spokesperson, Omer Dostri, posting on social media: 'Reminder: Hamas' neo-Nazi regime will not remain in Gaza. The clock is ticking.' Senior Israeli officials warned late Saturday: 'Phase II of the deal will depend entirely on the conditions Israel sets. If Israel insists on the exile of Hamas leadership and the dismantling of its military wing, there will be no Phase II.' Sources familiar with the discussions do not believe Netanyahu is preparing for Phase II at all, pointing to his recent appointment of Gal Hirsch to the negotiating team—despite his lack of prior involvement in the talks—as evidence that there is no real infrastructure being built for continued negotiations. One senior source described the public outrage over the hostage release images as a serious political blow to Netanyahu, saying: 'Two weeks ago, after the third hostage release, Netanyahu’s approval ratings collapsed in the polls. We all knew the hostages were severely malnourished—doctors warned they could die in captivity. What was the point of this public display? Is there anyone who didn’t know they were starving?' Netanyahu, who remained in Washington while the fifth hostage release took place, is expected to return to Israel overnight Sunday. He has faced sharp criticism for choosing to stay at the luxury Willard Hotel rather than returning before the Sabbath, as some of his advisers—including National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Hostage Coordinator Gal Hirsch—did. Netanyahu justified his extended stay by citing 'an overwhelming number of meeting requests' from U.S. officials. His office stated that he watched the hostage release footage from what was described as 'the control center of the Israeli delegation in the U.S.' and was 'continuously updated by the hostages and missing persons coordinator, who returned to Israel ahead of him.' What’s next? With diplomatic tensions rising and no clear path forward for Phase II, Israel is likely to increase pressure on Hamas while weighing its military options. The next few days will be critical in determining whether negotiations continue or if hostilities resume in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skes11vbtkx	2025-02-08T14:33:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/HJlaZrrt1g/HJlaZrrt1g_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg

Following the release of Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy, Danon sent a formal letter to Guterres, arguing that the frail and malnourished condition of the freed hostages is clear evidence of Hamas’ war crimes and blatant violations of international law. 'It is not the people of Gaza or Hamas operatives who are suffering from malnutrition—our hostages are,' Danon wrote, highlighting what he called the cruel and systematic abuse of Israeli captives. Israel has repeatedly urged the international community to put greater pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages, accusing the terror group of using them as bargaining chips while violating their basic human rights. The UN has yet to issue an official response to Danon’s demand.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bygoqbbtjl	2025-02-08T11:50:20-08:00	
Teddy bear helps hostage's British family come to terms with grie...	As Gillian and Pete Brisley watched their son-in-law Eli Sharabi freed from Hamas captivity, Gillian clutched a teddy bear once belonging to their slain daughter Lianne; while relieved, they were shocked by Eli’s frail state, their grief for Lianne and their granddaughters resurfacing As Gillian Brisley and her husband, Pete, watched their son-in-law's release from captivity on Saturday morning, she clutched a teddy bear to her chest. It was a reminder of everything the family has suffered since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing their daughter, Lianne Sharabi, and teenage granddaughters, Noiya and Yahel, while taking son-in-law Eli Sharabi hostage. Eli's brother Yossi was also killed. The stuffed toy, which once belonged to Lianne, was a tangible link between the Brisleys and events in the Middle East as they watched the hostage handover unfold on TV at their home in South Wales. 'While Gill was crying, she was holding on to the teddy bear, which was Lianne's from the age of about 10 years old and which we were lucky enough to find on Kibbutz Be'eri when we went to the house,' Pete Brisley said. 'When we went to the house, it was filthy, bullet holes everywhere. So we tidied up the house, tidied up the garden, so if Eli wanted to come home to it, then it looks reasonable because it was an absolute shambles.' Even that simple cleanup was an act of faith because the family had received no word on Sharabi at all since the terrorists took him back to Gaza with more than 200 other hostages. Out of nowhere, the Brisleys were told Friday that Sharabi, 52, was to be one of three hostages released the next day. So they got up early Saturday morning to see their son-in-law walk free. The moment was bittersweet. They were thrilled that he was finally free but horrified by the pale, emaciated figure they saw on TV. This wasn't the swarthy, robust man they last saw 18 months ago. The spark that always glinted in his eyes was gone. 'He looks as though he's been to Belsen,' Pete Brisley said, referring to the World War II concentration camp. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharabi's release also triggered other emotions for family members, who had suppressed their grief by focusing their energies on securing his freedom. When asked how she felt, Gillian Brisley said she was relieved he was free. But there was more to say. 'The emotion of seeing him also then brought the grief of losing our girls right up to our throats,' she said. 'We just sat here and we cried. We cried for our loss. We cried with relief that Eli was on his way home. We cried for Yossi. Just, you know, mixed emotions.' Then there's the continuing concern for Sharabi. Sharabi was told only after his return that his wife and two daughters were killed on Oct. 7. The family had hoped that he was told beforehand so that he wouldn't have to process that grief after surviving 490 days in captivity, said Stephen Brisley, Lianne's brother. Lianne met Eli Sharabi on a three-month work experience assignment at Kibbutz Be'eri, married and then made her home in Israel. Naturally, the bear came along. Growing up in Wales, the bear was part of the family. When they were being naughty, her brothers would hide the bear from her, or stick it in a drawer with only its toes dangling out, Stephen remembered. It also participated in tea parties on the bedroom floor and sat in the audience as the kids pretended to hold rock concerts with tennis rackets for guitars and broomsticks for microphones. For a family that isn't religious and doesn't find strength in prayer, the bear now provides a link to lost loved ones. 'Mom has found it a great comfort to speak to Lianne's bear, and she says basically she speaks to the bear every morning, every evening and she speaks to the bear as though she's talking to Lianne,' Stephen said. 'I think it's been a cathartic experience for her. It's a tangible sort of physical connection to somebody that you can't have that real hug with.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj2wcnhkje	2025-02-08T11:45:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/BJG1WSBKkl/BJG1WSBKkl_0_105_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
With hostage deal advancing, IDF to fully withdraw from Gaza's Ne...	As part of hostage deal, Israel to complete pullback from strategic corridor—symbol of both IDF operations and settler aspirations; troops to remain only in buffer zone and Philadelphi Corridor As part of the latest phase of the hostage release agreement, the IDF is set to complete its withdrawal from its last positions along the Netzarim Corridor overnight into Sunday, marking the full military pullback from northern Gaza. This strategic corridor, seized by the 36th Division during the initial incursion into Gaza, had served as a key operational route, linking Israeli forces advancing from the coastal axis with those pushing inland. The withdrawal comes despite Israeli threats of retaliation over Hamas' exploitation of freed hostages in propaganda videos and the shocking images of their frail condition after months in captivity. Neither the IDF nor Israeli political leadership has commented on the planned pullback, which will leave only IDF forces in the buffer zone near the border and along the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza. Netzarim Corridor had become a symbol of Israel’s military presence in Gaza, with right-wing settler activists viewing it as a potential foothold for re-establishing Jewish settlements in northern Gaza. Groups such as Nachala, a movement advocating for Israeli resettlement in the Gaza Strip, held mass gatherings at the corridor's entrance, treating it as a symbolic gateway to territories they aim to reclaim. The withdrawal from Netzarim began last month, allowing over half a million displaced Palestinians to return north from southern Gaza. Images of masses moving northward, widely circulated across global media, showed armed Hamas operatives directing civilians along the corridor.

Alongside the IDF withdrawal, IDF officials have raised alert levels in the West Bank, anticipating celebrations over the upcoming release of additional Palestinian prisoners. In recent days, the IDF and Shin Bet have held meetings with the families of prisoners due to be freed, while conducting preemptive operations to remove Hamas flags and terrorist symbols from public areas. The Etzion Regional Brigade has also prepared for large-scale celebrations in refugee camps such as Dheisheh, near Bethlehem, making clear that public displays of support for terrorism will not be tolerated. Meanwhile, the Israeli Civil Administration has issued warnings through its military coordination offices, saying that parades and public gatherings celebrating the release of convicted terrorists are strictly prohibited. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqvz4ry1l	2025-02-08T10:46:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/Byso6sNdke/Byso6sNdke_0_0_2778_1564_0_small.jpg
Held in Hamas tunnels, clueless about October 7—freed hostages on...	Starvation and humiliation can’t be hidden': Despite Hamas’ attempts to improve conditions before release, frail, starved hostages tell different story; Or Levy and Eli Sharabi unaware families murdered, while Ohad Ben Ami spent most of his captivity underground After 491 days underground in Hamas captivity, Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy returned to Israel, frail and emaciated, with little knowledge of the devastation of October 7 or the fate of their families. The three men, abducted in the early hours of the Hamas attack, spent most of their captivity underground, deprived of sunlight, communication and reliable information. Some were occasionally exposed to Al Jazeera broadcasts, but many details remained unknown. Or Levy only learned after his release that his wife, Einav, had been murdered, while Eli Sharabi was informed by his siblings that his wife and daughters were also killed in the massacre, and his brother Yossi died in captivity. In the week leading up to their release, the hostages were given more food and water, likely due to increased humanitarian aid shipments and Hamas' effort to present them in better condition. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, a senior Health Ministry official, described the long-term damage inflicted on the hostages. 'Hamas prepares the hostages for their staged release, trying to make them appear healthier,' she said. 'But starvation, humiliation and inhumane conditions leave lasting damage. Even those who appear physically well have suffered immensely and face severe long-term consequences from such prolonged captivity.' \Levy, who had no way of confirming his wife’s fate, was at one point told by his captors that his brother Michael had spoken on his behalf at the UN Security Council, a rare acknowledgment from his jailers that his family was fighting for him. On October 7, Levy and his wife Einav were attending the Nova music festival. As Hamas launched its attack, the couple fled into a roadside shelter along with dozens of others, seeking safety. The shelter became a site of mass slaughter, with Einav and 26 others killed, while Or was taken hostage. After his release from Hamas captivity, he finally reunited with his 3-year-old son Almog. But alongside the relief of freedom came the devastating news that Einav was murdered in the same shelter where they had taken refuge. Held in a Hamas tunnel for over a year, without communication or knowledge of the outside world, Levy had only suspected his wife had been killed. It was only after his release that his family confirmed the truth. Geula Levy, Or’s mother, described her son’s first accounts from captivity, saying he had asked about other victims from the shelter. 'He knows what happened there,' she said. 'He knew Hersh Goldberg-Polin was injured, and he thought he had been freed. He asked if we had heard his name.' Goldberg-Polin, a dual Israeli-American citizen, was executed in Hamas captivity in late August. Levy had also assumed that Almog Sarusi, another hostage later murdered in a Hamas tunnel alongside Goldberg-Polin, had survived. 'He was convinced that Hersh and Almog had both returned home,' his mother said. Geula shared one of the haunting details Or recalled about his time underground—the complete disconnection from the outside world. 'I asked him if he was cold in the tunnel,' she said. 'He told me, ‘You don’t feel temperature down there. We couldn’t tell if it was summer or winter.’' 'His face tells the world the hell he endured' 'Our hearts tremble, and our minds refuse to believe the sight of Or, who has returned to us in such dire condition,' his family said in a statement. 'His face tells the world the hell he endured for 491 days at the hands of Hamas monsters. 'After 491 painful days of waiting and longing, our Or has finally come home. After an unbearable period of darkness, we can finally hold him again and begin healing his body and spirit. Words cannot capture the depth of emotions we feel at this moment—overwhelming pain, relief, tears of joy alongside deep sorrow for the time stolen from us. We embraced him tightly, tighter than ever before, and yet it is still hard to believe he is truly here. We eagerly await the moment when little Almog and Or will finally reunite, a hug we have been waiting for with every breath. 'Amid all this emotion, our thoughts turn to Einav, of blessed memory, Almog’s mother, who was murdered on that cursed day. Her loss has left an immeasurable void in our hearts. We believe she is watching from above, finding comfort in seeing Almog finally receive his father’s embrace. Her memory and legacy will always be with us.' The family also expressed their deep gratitude to the people of Israel: 'Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the warm embrace, the unwavering support and the companionship throughout this difficult journey. Every person who stood by us, every word, every gesture, every prayer meant the world to us.' 'This period has left deep scars, and our hearts are still learning to believe that the nightmare is over,' the family added. 'These moments are overwhelming and filled with intense emotions of every kind. We need this time as a family—to gather, to breathe, to process and to begin the healing and recovery process.' They thanked the public for its interest and support but asked for privacy. 'Please respect our space and allow us the quiet we need at this time.' Meanwhile, families of previously released hostages expressed frustration over comparisons between the condition of Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi and those freed in earlier rounds. Many called to avoid comparing one captivity experience to another, emphasizing that each hostage suffered in different ways. At the same time, nearly all hostages released in previous deals watched the latest release closely, and their families joined public calls urging the government to bring the remaining hostages home as soon as possible. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj2awqskkg	2025-02-08T10:21:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/BJPZPn4Y1x/BJPZPn4Y1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Freed hostage Eli Sharabi learns of family’s tragic fate after 49...	‘His condition is extremely difficult’: In heart-wrenching moment, Sharabi embraces his brother Sharon, who fought tirelessly for his release, as he learns wife and daughters murdered on October 7 and brother Yossi died in captivity Eli Sharabi, frail and pale after 491 days in Hamas captivity, was reunited with his family on Saturday, only to be confronted with devastating news—his wife Lian and daughters, Noya, 16, and Yahel, 13, were murdered in the October 7 massacre, and his brother Yossi died in captivity. In an emotional scene at Sheba Medical Center, Sharabi, wrapped in an Israeli flag, embraced his brother Sharon, who had fought tirelessly for his release. 'Eli’s condition is extremely difficult,' a family member said. 'Beyond the physical toll and severe malnutrition, he has now learned the most painful truth imaginable. He is trying to process it. Right now, we’re giving him time with his mother and siblings. Tomorrow, he will likely meet with the extended family, who will stand by him as he begins his recovery.' Despite the overwhelming grief, friends and relatives emphasized Sharabi’s determination to rebuild his life. 'Even with all the pain and loss, Eli is strong and determined to survive and heal,' they said. Sharabi, 51, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, along with his brother Yossi, who died in Hamas captivity early last year. Israeli intelligence believes he was killed when the IDF struck a building near where he was being held. His body remains in Gaza.

Since his brothers were taken hostage, Sharon Sharabi had led a relentless campaign for their return. In a moving moment at the hospital, Sharon, draped in a prayer shawl, embraced Eli with tears in his eyes, whispering prayers. Ahead of Eli’s release, Sharon reflected on the family’s painful journey. 'When we learned that Yossi did not survive captivity, I said, ‘We failed,’' he recalled. 'But when Eli returns, I will say, ‘We have won.’ Not just me—an entire nation.' The conflicting emotions of relief and sorrow were evident in his words. 'Our hearts are bursting with emotion, but there is also immense pain,' he said. 'Pain for October 7, for the 16 months of suffering, for the brother Eli lost, for his wife and daughters who are gone. After everything he endured, he is coming back to a completely different reality—a nightmare. No wife, no daughters, no home. All we can do is embrace him, show him we are here and never leave his side.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syqfg7ryyg	2025-02-08T09:46:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/BySpK00ZHFJg/BySpK00ZHFJg_0_35_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Hostages’ condition worse than previous releases, hospital says	Dr. Yael Frenkel-Nir, Director of Sheba General Hospital and head of the medical response team for returning hostages, said that the effects of 491 days in Hamas captivity were clearly visible on the two released hostages brought to the hospital. 'Their medical condition is poor, and this time it is even worse,' she said in a press briefing from the hospital. 'Such inhumane conditions have severe health consequences. Based on our experience, prolonged captivity has resulted in a significant deterioration in their state, and we are deeply and gravely concerned for those who remain in Hamas hands.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryeulxrfyl	2025-02-08T09:19:12-08:00

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his first statement following the release of Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy from captivity on Saturday, vowing that Israel will do everything to bring back all hostages and eradicate Hamas. 'Once again, we have seen the true nature of Hamas—the monsters who massacred our citizens and abused our hostages,' Netanyahu said. 'And I say to them again: their blood is on their own heads.' Netanyahu said he had instructed Israel’s negotiating delegation to convey a clear message to mediators that securing the return of all hostages is Israel’s top priority. 'Beyond that, President Trump fully agreed with me: we will do everything to bring our hostages home—but Hamas will not be there. We will eliminate Hamas and bring our people back.

I need to know what happened that day': Ohad Ben Ami seeks answe...	After 491 days in captivity, freed hostage reunites with his wife Raz and daughters, joking about his drastic weight loss: 'I left XXL and came back a medium'; stunned by his daughter Natalie’s enlistment in the IDF, he also reflects on his ordeal After 491 days in Hamas captivity, Ohad Ben Ami was reunited Saturday evening with his three daughters at Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv, following an earlier meeting with his wife, Raz Ben Ami, herself a former hostage. As his daughters embraced him, one of them cried out, 'There you are! Dad!' to which Ben Ami responded, 'I’m here. My lionesses. You are amazing.' His daughter Natalie, who had enlisted in the IDF after her father was taken hostage, revealed the news to him for the first time, leaving him visibly stunned. 'Dad, I’m a commander in a military welfare course,' she told him. 'Did Mom even allow you to enlist?' he asked, as one of his other daughters admitted, 'It took a long time and a lot of convincing.' Eventually, Ben Ami smiled and told Natalie, 'I’m proud of you. Proud that you didn’t listen to your mother.' She immediately shouted back, 'I knew it!' During the meeting, Ben Ami joked about his drastic weight loss, quipping, 'I left extra-extra-large and came back a medium,' hinting at the horrors he and his fellow hostages endured in Gaza. Following the reunion, Ben Ami’s other daughter, Ella, shared her thoughts in a social media post, writing: 'All this time, I couldn’t express how proud I was of my sister for her brave decision to enlist. We weren’t allowed to talk about it. Now we finally can! Dad is proud of you too.' In another post, Ella described a powerful moment before her father was airlifted to the hospital. She said he asked for her advice on whether he should exit the helicopter discreetly through the medical corridor or be filmed wrapped in the Israeli flag. 'There was no question—he stepped out proudly, draped in his country’s flag, showing that he is a hero.' Reflecting on the time lost during captivity, Ben Ami acknowledged he had many unanswered questions—especially about the October 7 attack that led to his abduction. 'Time moves forward. It has been a year and four months, and I have a million loose ends,' he said. 'I know I’m going to receive some very painful answers, but I need to know what happened that day.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ben Ami also revealed that he was held in Hamas’ tunnel network, describing the cramped and harsh conditions. 'In the tunnel I was in, we constantly had to crouch,' he recalled. 'At one point, I hit my head hard.' Ben Ami, 56, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. Footage of him being forced away by Hamas terrorists, dressed only in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, became one of the defining images of the massacre. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Health Ministry’s Medical Division, provided an update on the condition of Ben Ami and fellow freed hostages Eli Sharabi and Or Levy. 'This morning, upon their release, we saw clear signs of severe malnutrition—stark evidence of the hell they endured,' she said. 'We saw significant weight loss. These are difficult images to process, yet their resilience offers hope for recovery.' Speaking to Ynet, Dr. Mizrahi emphasized that the hostages had been held in different locations under varying conditions, but all suffered physical and psychological harm. 'They are returning with long-term damage—you cannot erase starvation, humiliation and extreme hardship,' she explained. 'However, those who have come back are walking, talking and fully aware of their situation.' Still, she cautioned against judging their condition by outward appearances. 'Even if a released hostage looks relatively well, that does not mean they did not endure unimaginable suffering or that they are not facing severe long-term consequences from their time in captivity.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rymtvmbyjl	2025-02-08T09:03:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/S1eJQbbHYye/S1eJQbbHYye_0_12_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Freed hostage Or Levy reunites with son, 3, learns wife murdered ...	After 491 days in Hamas captivity, Levy reunites with his 3-year-old son, Almog, who told him, 'Daddy, it took you too long to come back'; only after his release did Levy learn for certain that his wife, Einav, was murdered Or Levy, who was held hostage by Hamas for 491 days, was finally reunited with his 3-year-old son, Almog, on Saturday after being freed as part of a hostage exchange deal. However, it was only upon his return to Israel that Levy learned with certainty that his wife, Einav, had been murdered in the October 7 attack. Levy and Einav had been together in a shelter at the Nova music festival when Hamas terrorists stormed the site. While Or was taken hostage, Einav was killed alongside hundreds of others. Also with them in the shelter was Hersh Goldberg-Polin, another hostage later executed in captivity. Levy, frail and visibly weak, was airlifted to a hospital, where he embraced his family and met Almog for the first time since his abduction. 'Daddy, it took you too long to come back,' Almog told him in a heartbreaking moment. Michael Levy, Or's brother, had waited for hours at the Re’im reception center, near the Gaza border, anticipating his return. 'I can't breathe. I'm here with our parents, waiting,' he told Ynet. 'I brought a drawing from Almog and left it on the bed in Or’s hospital room. I also packed some of his clothes so he’d have something from home. I can’t process any of this yet.' After finally hugging his brother, Michael described the moment as overwhelming. 'There are no words to describe this joy. This is the most emotional thing I’ve ever experienced,' he said. 'The first thing Or told me was that he missed me. He thanked me and apologized for the time we lost. I told him we have plenty of time ahead to make up for it.' Their mother, Geula Levy, revealed in a radio interview that Or had been held in a tunnel with no communication and could only guess what had happened to Einav. 'Today, he asked, and we told him the truth,' she said. While in captivity, Or had no way of knowing the fate of others in the shelter, including Goldberg-Polin and Almog Sarusi, both of whom were murdered in Hamas tunnels. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Or knows what happened in the shelter,' Geula said. 'He knew Hersh had been injured but assumed he had been freed. He asked me if we had heard his name. He also believed Almog Sarusi had survived.' She recounted a chilling detail from Or’s account of the attack: 'He told us he threw the last grenade.' Before their emotional reunion, Michael said the family was preparing to ensure the meeting between Or and Almog would be as smooth as possible. 'Or was thrilled when he saw Almog’s drawings. I’ve never seen him like this before,' Michael said. 'He kept asking about him, and we showed him videos and photos. He was in awe of his incredible little boy.' When they finally met, Almog’s first words to his father were, 'Daddy, it took you too long to come back.' Levy was transferred to the Red Cross by Hamas terrorists, appearing pale, frail and visibly weak. Michael remained optimistic despite the harrowing images of Or’s condition. 'He’s back. He will recover. He will be okay,' he said. 'Almog kept asking, ‘When will Daddy get here?’' Michael added that Or was aware of everything happening around him but remained mentally strong. 'He’s lost weight and will need time to recover physically, but he’s resilient. He even joked with us about the situation,' he said. Levy’s friends and coworkers eagerly awaited his return, gathering together to watch the moment unfold. 'We can’t wait to hug him and be with him,' said Eden Ben Shimon, a close friend. 'We didn’t sleep all night. We’re like family, and this is overwhelming. We don’t know what to expect, but we’ll be here for him no matter what.' Danny Geishis, another friend, shared a bittersweet reflection: 'We lost Einav on October 7, but at least today, we are getting something back. Or is coming home, and it’s a celebration.' Levy, a resident of Givatayim near Tel Aviv, was abducted from the Nova music festival, where he had gone with Einav while leaving Almog, then just two years old, with his grandparents. Their love for music, festivals and travel had defined them as a couple. Before his release, Geula Levy spoke of her anticipation, expressing the relief and heartbreak of waiting for her son for over a year. 'My heart is racing. For a year and four months, this little boy—our Almog—has been without his mother or father. Finally, Or is coming home. I can’t believe it,' she said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bys9zfhy1l	2025-02-08T08:36:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/Sk9VwC4tkg/Sk9VwC4tkg_0_38_1223_689_0_small.jpg
Israel weighs response to Hamas’ handling of freed hostages as ne...	Israel faces limited response options after frail condition of freed hostages sparks outrage, as officials focus on securing more releases; delegation heads to Doha for talks on Phase I of deal, while Hamas warns of collapse The disturbing images of Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi—frail and visibly malnourished after 491 days in Hamas captivity—have sparked outrage in Israel. However, officials acknowledge that Israel’s options for an immediate response are limited as the hostage release process continues. While reducing humanitarian aid to Gaza or delaying the release of Palestinian prisoners have been raised as possible responses, both would constitute a violation of the cease-fire deal. Another option—terminating the agreement altogether—is seen as unlikely, as Israel remains committed to securing the release of more hostages beyond the 33 scheduled in Phase I. The anger toward Hamas is growing, but officials say that rather than breaking the deal, it is likely to pave the way for a return to fighting once the current phase ends, unless an extension is reached. A senior Israeli official confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered a negotiation team to travel to Doha to discuss the technical aspects of the agreement. Upon his return from the United States, Netanyahu is expected to convene a Security Cabinet meeting to discuss the next phase of the hostage deal. Following reports that the cabinet meeting will only take place next week, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum issued a sharp response, questioning why Israel’s leaders were not convening immediately. 'How, after the shocking images of Eli, Ohad and Or, is the Cabinet not meeting right away?' the group said in a statement. 'What more proof is needed for decision-makers to grasp the critical urgency of rescuing the remaining 76 hostages? The prime minister must send the negotiating team to Qatar with a clear and full mandate—to finalize the deal swiftly and secure the return of every last hostage with a defined plan and timeline.' As part of Netanyahu’s new approach to negotiations, Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Brig. Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch will travel to Doha for the first time. He will be joined by M., the former deputy head of the Shin Bet, whose participation was strongly advocated by Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar. Another senior official from the Shin Bet director’s office, who was involved in previous negotiation rounds, will also be part of the team. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The talks in Doha will focus solely on finalizing Phase I of the deal, with negotiations on Phase II set to begin only after Israel’s position is approved by the Cabinet. Meanwhile, a senior Hamas official warned in an interview with AFP that the agreement is at risk of collapse, saying that Hamas 'does not want to resume the war' and is 'ready' to continue negotiations. He also called on Arab nations to refrain from normalizing ties with Israel. Meanwhile, National Unity Party MK Gadi Eisenkot suggested an alternative approach—'compressing' the deal timeline to secure hostage releases more quickly. 'The horrific images of Or, Eli and Ohad returning to Israel are yet another painful reminder of the unbearable cost of waiting and delays,' Eisenkot said. He criticized the government for approving Netanyahu’s proposed three-phase deal only after months of delay and called for immediate action.

'This morning, we witnessed signs of extreme malnutrition—a stark illustration of the hell they endured,' she said. Despite their physical condition, Mizrahi noted the resilience of the former captives, saying: 'We were moved to see them walk upright, with heads held high, even as they passed through a crowd of armed Hamas terrorists.'

We love Israel': Freed Thai hostages return home after release f...	After 482 days in captivity and 10 days of rehabilitation tailored to their culture, former captives depart for their native Thailand with heartwarming send-offs After 482 days in Hamas captivity and 10 days of rehabilitation in Israel, five Thai nationals freed from Gaza departed Saturday morning for their return home to Thailand. The men—Sathian Suwannakham, 34, Pongsak Thenna, 35, Bannawat Seathao, 27, Watchara Sriaoun, 32, and Surasak Lamnau, 30—were released earlier this month as part of the ongoing cease-fire and hostage exchange deal. The five former hostages bid farewell to Israeli and Thai medical staff who had cared for them at Shamir Medical Center (Assaf Harofeh) in a departure ceremony featuring flags, banners and warm send-offs. As they embraced hospital staff and bowed in a traditional Thai gesture of gratitude, they expressed their appreciation, calling out 'We love you, thank you very much.' Hospital staff and Thai Foreign Ministry representatives, who had assisted in their recovery, waved Israeli and Thai flags and held up signs in Thai script, reading 'Safe travels home.' Four of the men's family members, who had flown in from Thailand, accompanied them on their journey back to Bangkok, alongside a rescue team representative from Thailand. During their stay at the Israeli hospital, efforts were made to tailor their care to Thai cultural preferences. Meals included rice at every serving, supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables. Bilingual signage was posted throughout the facility, and medical staff wore name tags in both Thai and Hebrew. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Psychological and medical care was provided by professionals from both countries, including Thai military personnel, a trauma doctor and a psychiatrist from Thailand, as well as a Thai-speaking Israeli psychologist and representatives from the Thai embassy. Hospital director Dr. Osnat Levtzion-Korach said that continued treatment plans had been developed for them in Thailand, funded by Israel. She noted that while their physical and mental conditions had improved significantly, they still suffered from lasting injuries. One required a hearing aid, others had lost teeth and some had sustained gunshot wounds that still required further medical care. On Friday evening, ahead of their departure, the five men visited a shopping mall, where they were given a budget to buy gifts for their families and later dined at a Thai restaurant. Before leaving the rehabilitation center, they left messages on a farewell board in both Thai and Hebrew, writing: 'Everyone here is kind. We love you and we love Israel.' When asked if they would ever return to Israel, Seathao responded 'Maybe', while Sriaoun simply said, 'I love you. Thank you.' Meanwhile, Thai officials continue efforts to locate and secure the release of one remaining Thai hostage, Pinta Nattapong, 35, whose whereabouts and condition remain unknown. Additionally, two Thai nationals—Sonthaya Oakkharasri, 30, and Sudthisak Rinthalak, 43—were murdered on October 7 while working in kibbutz orchards near Be’eri. Their bodies are still held in Gaza, with ongoing diplomatic efforts to secure their return. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjkvuxbyjx	2025-02-08T06:38:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/B1vpfioEYJg/B1vpfioEYJg_0_31_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Officials pledge to hold Hamas accountable after 3 freed hostages, who appeared frail, paraded in public ceremony before their release and warn of consequences for repeated cease-fire violations Israeli officials condemned the harsh conditions and treatment of three hostages released by Hamas on Friday, after footage showed them appearing frail and pale, being led onto a stage by armed terrorists in a public ceremony in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza before being handed over to the Red Cross. Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy were freed as part of the ongoing cease-fire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. Brig. Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for missing and captive persons, said the 'disturbing images' from their release will not go unanswered. 'Israel takes Hamas' repeated violations of the agreement very seriously, and appropriate actions will be taken,' Hirsch said, adding that the message had been conveyed to mediators. 'The shocking sights we witnessed today touch us all and add to the painful memory of October 7, 2023,' Hirsch said. 'Israel views these repeated violations by Hamas with the utmost severity, particularly the condition of the three hostages released today. Together with their families, we embrace Ohad, Eli and Or. We have prepared for their return and will assist in their recovery and rehabilitation after their prolonged and painful captivity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel estimates that 76 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, including both living individuals and those killed in captivity. Hirsch said the Israeli government remains fully committed to securing their return and is working relentlessly with all security agencies to bring them home. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who remained in Washington for the weekend, monitored the hostages’ release from afar. His office issued a statement reaffirming the government’s commitment to securing the return of all hostages, adding: 'The shocking images from today will not be ignored. The government, together with all security agencies, will support the freed hostages and their families.' Former defense minister Yoav Gallant also condemned the poor health of the freed hostages, saying the images highlight their deteriorating condition, which Israel had long been aware of. 'This is yet another signal that we must act decisively to bring the hostages home,' Gallant said. 'Hostage rescue is a Jewish, human and moral imperative.' Gallant reiterated that Israel remains committed to defeating Hamas and punishing its leaders. 'This is a declared war objective, a value that generations of Israeli fighters have been raised on—we do not leave the wounded behind,' he said. 'We will continue striking Hamas, and those responsible for these crimes will face justice. I hope for the swift return of all hostages and stand with their families as they wait to reunite with their loved ones.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rycdk1rfye	2025-02-08T05:35:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/Hk56asVKkl/Hk56asVKkl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Blood on your hands!': Pro-Palestinians shout at Yoav Gallant in...	Visiting New York for the first time since being fired from his position as Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant ran into pro-Palestinian protesters who called for his arrest; 'War criminal! Why should he be able to walk the streets of New York?', they yelled Pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouted at former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in New York, accusing him of being a 'war criminal' who 'should be arrested.' Gallant, against whom, along with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, international arrest warrants have been issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, was filmed leaving a business in the city when several passersby began shouting at him as he made his way to his car. 'You have the blood of 61,000 Palestinians on your hands,' they shouted. 'Why should he be able to walk the streets of New York?' After a few minutes, Gallant entered his car accompanied by his security guards. Footage of the incident was published on the social media account of a local left-wing organization on the platform X (formerly Twitter). Alongside the footage, the organization wrote: 'War criminal Yoav Gallant confronted on the streets of New York by pro-Palestinians! The former Israeli Defense Minister, who has an arrest warrant for his war crimes against humanity issued by the ICC, will not live peacefully for a single day! People around the world stand with Palestine and against Israel's violent apartheid regime. We will continue to fight every day until the full liberation of the Palestinian people. There will be no rest for the wicked.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier, more than 500 pro-Palestinian protesters, many wrapped in keffiyehs, gathered in Chicago outside the 'Anshe Emet' synagogue to protest Gallant's participation in an event organized by Friends of the IDF (FIDF). While Gallant was inside the synagogue, one of the protest organizers said, 'Palestinians and our Jewish allies who oppose the war will continue to protest, disrupt, and demand the arrest of Gallant and anyone else who supports genocide, across the United States.' Other protesters chanted 'From the river to the sea,' while some submitted a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice's Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, demanding a criminal investigation be opened against the former Defense Minister. In his first interview since becoming Defense Minister, a position from which he was dismissed about three months ago, Gallant told Nadav Eyal that he is not afraid of the arrest warrants issued against him. 'I am proud to be accused of defending the State of Israel. When leaders and others from around the world came to me, I told them, ‘2023 is not 1943. Jews now have the ability to defend themselves independently, and I am responsible for that, and I will do it. That’s what I did, and I am proud of what I did,’' he emphasized. He acknowledged that mistakes may have been made during the war that led to 'heavy costs,' but he clarified: 'I think our mistakes are smaller than those of other armies. The results are always harsh, and I regret that. I also did not want to harm any Palestinian civilian. And I am not the only one. The Chief of Staff and others as well – we worked tirelessly to provide humanitarian aid wherever possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1k8sneykl	2025-02-08T02:36:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/16/Sy8yeA119h/Sy8yeA119h_0_0_1024_576_0_small.jpg

As part of the fifth phase of the deal, Israel will release 183 prisoners, including 18 serving life sentences; Among those freed are Hamas operatives convicted of terror attacks, including bombings in the southern city of Be’er Sheva and other deadly assaults As part of the fifth phase of Stage A of the deal, during which hostages Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy, and Eli Sharabi will be released, Israel will on Saturday release 183 prisoners, including 18 serving life sentences. Among them are 54 prisoners who have served long sentences and 111 detainees from Gaza who were arrested during the war. Among the prominent prisoners being released is Shadi Barghouti, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for his involvement in attacks against Israel. His father, Fakhri Barghouti, was a participant in the murder of Mordechai Yakuel, and his brother, Hadi Barghouti, was convicted in 2004 of terrorist activities and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Another prisoner being released is Ali Haroub, a resident of Dura, who has been serving a sentence for membership in a terror cell that planned attacks and for his involvement in the production of explosives and Molotov cocktails. In December 2013, Shin Bet, with the assistance of Israel Prison Service (IPS), thwarted an attempt to establish a kidnapping cell that Haroub was part of, under the guidance of prisoners in Israel. The attempted attack, which was in its early planning stages, was prevented. Senior Hamas figure Jamal Tawil, who was arrested in Ramallah in June 2021, will also be released. At the time of his arrest, IDF stated that Tawil was detained following a joint operation by the Duvdevan Unit and Shin Bet. It was noted that he was one of the key figures responsible for rebuilding Hamas’ infrastructure in the West Bank region. According to IDF, Tawil 'actively participated in organizing riots, incitement to violence, and the re-establishment of Hamas' headquarters in Ramallah.' Among those being released is Eyad Abu Shahidam, who was behind the double suicide bombing in the southern city of Be'er Sheva carried out by two Palestinian terrorists in 2004. The attack killed 16 Israelis and injured over 100. Abu Shahidam was convicted of preparing the explosives and planning the detonation of two bombs on buses near the city hall on Reger Street. He was also convicted of preparing an explosive belt for a terrorist who was intercepted in July 2004 on his way to detonate the bomb at 'Café Kafeit' in Jerusalem. The terrorist was armed with an explosive belt and a pistol and planned to first shoot the security guard before entering the café to carry out the attack. A few days earlier, Shin Bet, IDF, and the Gideonim Unit of the Jerusalem Police arrested several Hamas operatives from Hebron and nearby villages. These operatives admitted to facilitating the terrorist's entry into the capital to carry out the attack. According to their statements, the terrorist had second thoughts and returned. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another prominent released prisoner is Hatem al-Jayousi, one of the founders of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which continues to operate as a terror organization with dozens of members in the West Bank and Gaza. He is serving six life sentences for the murder of six Israelis during the Second Intifada. Also being released is Yosef al-Mabhouh from Jabaliya, who is serving 15 years in prison for launching rockets, planting explosives, and engaging in tunnel-related activities. In December 2021, while imprisoned in the Hamas wing of Nafha Prison, he carried out a stabbing attack within the prison. He attacked a prison guard with a sharp improvised weapon, causing minor injuries. Footage from the incident shows al-Mabhouh sneaking up behind the guard and assaulting him with the weapon. IPS has operationally prepared for the prisoner release process in accordance with the agreed deal after receiving the list of security prisoners scheduled for release. Once the necessary procedures are completed in the prisons, fighters from the Nachshon Unit, IPS's central escort unit, will transport the prisoners to central reception points at Ofer and Ktzi’ot prisons. Upon arrival, prisoners will be identified by representatives of the Red Cross and will wait until the hostages arrive in Israel. Once approval is granted by state authorities, the prisoners will be transported by the Red Cross from Ofer Prison to release points in the West Bank, and by Nachshon Unit fighters to the Kerem Shalom crossing. Earlier, it was revealed by Ynet that prior to their release, the prisoners will be shown footage of the extensive destruction in Gaza. IDF’s Operations Division, in collaboration with IPS, produced a video showcasing the significant destruction in Gaza, which will be shown to the Palestinian prisoners being released as part of the fifth phase of the deal. The video, approximately three minutes long, will be screened for the prisoners on television screens in the prisons during their release process. Last week, IPS printed the message 'The Eternal Nation Does Not Forget' on the identification bracelets of the prisoners, along with the IPS logo and the Israeli flag. Many of the security prisoners, particularly those serving life sentences, are unaware of the reality outside the prison walls. The video will reflect the new reality in Gaza for them. So far, 583 prisoners have been released as part of the deal. Prior to Saturday’s release, IPS’s prison population, which includes both security and criminal prisoners, actually increased by 298. As of now, there are 23,741 prisoners in Israeli prisons—10,197 of them are security prisoners, and 13,544 are criminal offenders. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjh7h5vkyg	2025-02-08T00:42:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/SJxQ2v00su1g/SJxQ2v00su1g_0_198_2457_1384_0_small.jpg

The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced on Friday that it had submitted the required authorization to Congress for the agreements, which are 'intended to preserve Israel's ability to defend itself.' This effectively confirms the move initiated by the administration of former President Joe Biden, who informed Congress of an $8 billion arms deal in January, shortly before Donald Trump assumed office. As part of these agreements, Israel will purchase, using American aid funds, 3,000 Hellfire missiles at an estimated cost of $660 million, along with 2,166 AGM-114 Hellfire bombs, also valued at approximately $660 million. Additionally, Israel will acquire 2,166 GBU-39 bombs, around 13,000 JDAM guidance kits for bombs of various weights, and 17,475 FMU-152A/B fuse bombs under a separate deal valued at $6.75 billion. The supply of Hellfire missiles is expected to begin in 2028, while the additional munitions will be delivered starting from 2025. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the Pentagon, the equipment will be sourced from existing U.S. stockpiles and from American companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and L3Harris. The official statement noted that 'the deal will not alter the regional balance of power and will assist Israel in defending its borders, critical infrastructure, and population.' The State Department stated that the agreements align with U.S. policy to maintain Israel's security and defensive capabilities. The report indicates Israel will be able to integrate the new equipment into its military system with ease and that the deals will not negatively impact U.S. military readiness. Weapons sales are subject to approval by the House and Senate committees, but they are typically approved swiftly when it comes to sales to Israel. According to estimates, the supply will be conducted gradually over the coming years, with initial deliveries starting in 2025. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met this week with evangelical leaders during his visit to Washington. During the meeting, Netanyahu addressed delays in the shipment of munitions during the Biden administration and, for the first time, explicitly acknowledged that this was a 'weapons embargo.' A statement from Netanyahu's office said that he 'thanked the evangelical leaders, who represent millions of believers, for their longstanding and consistent support of the State of Israel.' The meeting was attended by the incoming U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said: 'We have a responsibility to the Jewish people in Israel and worldwide. You will never stand alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqzak4y1g	2025-02-07T23:30:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/03/07/H1iOCRLaa/H1iOCRLaa_0_0_1000_633_0_small.jpg

Here’s why it’s legal for the U.S. to take over Gaza and relocate...	Human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky argues that those preventing Gazans from leaving are the ones truly violating international law U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to offer Gazans the opportunity to relocate while the U.S., alongside international partners, rebuilds Gaza is 'absolutely legal,' according to international human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky. Speaking to ILTV News, he said, 'Einstein's famous definition is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And for many, many years, including since October 7, the international community at large has had the same failing strategy with respect to Gaza that essentially allows Hamas to remain in power, and that we know is simply unacceptable.' Ostrovsky emphasized that this would not constitute forcible transfer, which is prohibited under international law. 'What President Trump has spoken about is the intention to create, essentially, a set of circumstances and conditions to allow Gazans to voluntarily choose to move to conditions that are better elsewhere,' Ostrovsky explained. He went a step further, arguing that those insisting Gazans must stay in Gaza—despite Hamas remaining in power—could be the ones violating international law. 'I would actually go one step further and suggest that those that are perhaps in fact guilty here of violating international law are the ones that are insisting that the Gazans stay there. Because by doing so, including whilst Hamas is still in power, they're essentially calling for the Gazans to stay in an active war zone and essentially be continued to be used as human shields by Hamas,' Ostrovsky said. Trump unveiled his plan earlier this week during a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Israelis have largely welcomed the proposal, the Arab world has outright rejected it. The plan would involve working with neighboring and moderate Arab states to take in Gazan refugees while the United States rebuilds Gaza, a process that could take upwards of a decade.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1u00yvvkyl	2025-02-07T20:24:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/r1lP4ecmFJl/r1lP4ecmFJl_1_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Eliyahu Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami are set to be released after 491 days in captivity on Saturday during the morning hours; IDF and Israeli hospitals making ready to receive captives, release prisoners The fifth hostage handover in the first phase of the deal between Israel and Hamas in which Eliyahu Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami are set to be released after 491 days in captivity, is expected to take place on Saturday. Like previous handovers, the three, who were kidnapped from the Nova music festival and Kibbutz Be'eri, will likely be released in the morning from two locations in central Gaza. Israeli officials are uncertain about the exact timing and whether the release will occur from one or two points. The IDF is preparing for an early morning operation. Unlike last week, when Hamas announced the names of those to be freed in the morning, this time, the terror group provided the list to mediators in the evening, again blaming Israel for delays in aid deliveries and cease-fire breaches. Before the names were released, Israel pressured mediators to secure the return of Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, whom Hamas claims were killed but has provided no proof. The father, Yarden, who was released in the previous handover, said: 'My light is still there, and as long as they are, everything is dark here.' However, Israel’s efforts have so far been unsuccessful.

After necessary procedures at the prisons, forces will transport them to central holding facilities at Ofer and Ktzi'ot prisons. The prisoners will be identified by the International Red Cross representatives and held until the hostages arrive in Israel.

IDF spokesperson in Arabic reveals terror group field commander Abbas Haidar was killed after a charge detonated in his home; Lebanon claims IDF negligence caused explosion IDF spokesperson in Arabic Col. Avichay Adraee announced Friday that Hezbollah field commander Abbas Haidar was killed along with his family when an explosive device accidentally detonated at his home in Tayr Harfa, near Tyre in southern Lebanon. Lebanese reports earlier in the day attributed the blast to 'leftover Israeli munitions.' 'I remind the Lebanese people that Hezbollah’s weapons are a double-edged sword, endangering Lebanon’s residents and even Hezbollah’s own surroundings. Stay away from Hezbollah’s weapons,' Adraee wrote on his X account. The initial Lebanese report did not name Haidar, saying only that 'a man and his three daughters were killed in an explosion at a home in Tayr Harfa, caused by leftover Israeli munitions.'

Ezzeddine added, 'This is part of the attacks yesterday and today in Lebanon.

Gazans tell Trump they will rebuild their own restaurants and hot...	Locals say they are determined to rebuild their own seafront restaurants and hotels, dismissing Trump's vision of creating a 'Riviera of the Middle East' Palestinians in Gaza say they are determined to rebuild their own seafront restaurants and hotels, dismissing U.S. President Donald Trump's vision of creating a 'Riviera of the Middle East' emptied of its population and under U.S. control. Before Israel's 15-month offensive left buildings across Gaza in ruins, the densely inhabited Palestinian territory had developed a local tourism scene on its Mediterranean shore. 'There is nothing that cannot be repaired,' said Gaza resident Assad Abu Haseira, pledging to start serving food from the restaurant he owns even before it is rebuilt. 'Trump says he wants to change the restaurants, and he wants to change Gaza and wants to create a new history for Gaza. We remain Arab and the history of Arabs will not be replaced with the history of foreigners.' Other Palestinians share his defiance. Mohammed Abu Haseira, another restaurant owner, said his eatery would become operational again 'and much better than before'. 'Trump has come up with a decision that he wants to establish restaurants, but the restaurants are here and the hotels are here. Why did you destroy them to establish other ones?' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gaza was once a popular destination for Israeli tourists and even after the takeover of the territory by the Islamist terror group Hamas in 2007, beachside restaurants and cafes lined its seafront. Trump's vision of a Gaza Strip cleared of its Palestinian inhabitants and redeveloped into an international resort revived an idea previously floated by his son-in-law Jared Kushner. It triggered condemnation from around the world, with critics saying it would be tantamount to ethnic cleansing and illegal under international law. Gazans were also quick to denounce the scheme, vowing never to leave the ruins of their homes. For Palestinians, such talk recalls the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe' after the 1948 war around the creation of the state of Israel, when 700,000 fled or were forced from their homes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy5ozknt1l	2025-02-07T11:12:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/BJc8dhlF1g/BJc8dhlF1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

After being abducted from the Nova party where his wife was murdered, Levy is set to reunite with his son on Saturday for the first time in 491 days Hostage Or Levy, a 33-year-old from Givatayim, is set to be freed from captivity on Saturday in the hostage deal's fifth handover after 491 days in Gaza. Levy was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7, where his wife, Einav, was murdered. His mother, Geula, reacted emotionally to the news, saying, 'My heart is leaping from my chest. For a year and four months, the little one [their 3-year-old son, Almog] has been alone without his father and mother. Finally, Or is coming back to us — I can’t believe it.' Gaula added: 'Our military liaison officer updated us — she couldn’t even speak. She’s been with us since the first day. We’re one family. I don’t even know what to say, I’m so excited. I’m not sure if I’ll make it to [the reunion at] Re’im due to some physical limitations. 'I’m just thinking about the hug. How do I hug him after so long? This is a child I talk to every day. We told little Almog, and he screamed, ‘Dad is coming back!’ while he jumped on the bed.' Or and Einav met in high school, became close friends and later married, welcoming their first son, Almog.

IDF equips troops facing snow in Syria, Lebanon	Logistics Corps forces deliver weapons, warm food and winter gear to troops stationed across the Israeli border facing harsh weather Under constant threat, IDF Logistics Corps forces delivered weapons, food, fuel and other supplies to maneuvering troops beyond the border Thursday overnight in freezing snow. Despite harsh winter conditions, long convoys continue crossing the border to supply the necessary equipment. 'Winter readiness is an integral part of the IDF's operational preparedness,' said IDF Northern Command deputy logistics officer Lt. Col. Fares Nazem. 'We ensure that vehicles, equipment and logistical systems are adapted to extreme weather, providing immediate solutions as needed. Our goal is to enable continuous, safe and effective operations regardless of environmental conditions,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although the year’s winter has been dry, temperatures in the northern mountains remain frigid. In recent weeks, logistics forces have supplied over 885,000 winter items, including insulated sleeping bags, snow gear and cold-weather clothing, supplementing existing stock distributed throughout the past year of combat. More than 1,900 mobile shelters and containerized living quarters have been deployed at permanent and temporary IDF outposts in Syria and Lebanon. These are equipped with heating, air conditioning, electrical panels and fixed or mobile power infrastructure, ensuring adequate facilities for troops, including showers and heating. Ahead of the weekend, which will remain cold in high-altitude areas beyond the border, troops received hot, fresh meals delivered directly to combat zones.

Why don't we know which hostages will be freed on Saturday?	It remains unclear which hostages will be released on Saturday, but Russia has been actively pressuring Hamas to release one of its citizens taken captive during the October 7 attacks. Hamas has stated that it plans to release Russian-Israeli citizen Alexander Sasha Trufanov 'in the near future,' specifically as part of the first phase of the ongoing ceasefire hostage deal. Trufanov is listed among the 33 hostages set to be released in this initial stage. Russia has maintained working relations with Hamas and has strengthened its ties with the group since the October 7 massacre. The 29-year-old Trufanov was kidnapped alongside three family members from Kibbutz Nir Oz, while his father was murdered that day. His relatives were freed in November 2023. In the same month, Palestinian Islamic Jihad published a propaganda video featuring Trufanov. So far, 18 hostages and five Thai nationals have been freed. Fifteen more hostages remain in captivity, including eight bodies that have yet to be recovered. U.S. Policy Could Impact Phase Two of Hostage Deal There are growing concerns that former U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent comments about the U.S. potentially taking control of Gaza could undermine phase two of the hostage deal. This next phase, which aims to secure the release of the remaining hostages— all men— was already expected to be a difficult transition. Officials now warn that these remarks could further complicate negotiations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1pyqcxf1g	2025-02-07T05:38:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/yk14251874/yk14251874_0_21_1201_677_0_small.jpg
Israeli Hamas victims will continue to work with ICC after US san...	Decision comes amid Trump's decision to sanction the UN court which is also investigating the terror group's October 7 attacks across Israel Israeli victims of the Hamas attack that triggered the Gaza war will still work with the International Criminal Court even after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the tribunal, a lawyer for victims and victims' families said on Friday. The sanctions are in retaliation for the court's issuing of arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense chief Yoav Gallant, who are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The ICC's prosecutor is also investigating the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks that killed 1,200 people. Prosecutors sought arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders for the crimes, but they were all killed in the past 16 months of war in Gaza, according to Israel and Hamas. While sanctions will complicate dealings with the ICC, the Israeli families want to continue engaging with it as part of efforts to seek justice, said Yael Vias Gvirsman, a lawyer who represents over 350 victims and families of victims. 'Sanctions could complicate the communications channels between Israeli citizens and the court, but victims are ever more committed to have direct contact with the court and to pursue the justice they deserve,' Gvirsman said in an interview. The U.S. sanctions, which focus on punishing the court for investigating Israeli officials, can also affect the prosecution's probe into crimes committed by Hamas, says Vias Gvirsman. 'It will be a dilemma for the court how to engage with Israeli citizens and assess if contact with the court endangers them,' she said.

It is to be screened to them as they leave their cells in preparation for the release and transfer to the hands of the Red Cross. The three-minute clip prepared by the IDF and Prison Authorities, documents the level of devastation in the Strip as the result of the war that began after the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7. Many of the terrorists who were serving life or years-long sentences had little information about the events outside. The images are intended to portray to them the reality in Gaza. The Israeli Prison Service completed its preparation for the release of the next group of convicted Palestinian terrorists, in accordance with the agreement with Hamas and after three more Israeli hostages are to be freed in Gaza.

Trump's Groundhog Day? Same speech, 8 years later	US President Trump has promised a bold new vision for the Middle East, but his press conference with the Israeli prime minister bore striking similarities to the same event eight years earlier Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood side by side at the White House, addressing reporters in a highly anticipated press conference. Their speeches touched on security, diplomacy, and the future of U.S.-Israel relations—echoing a similar scene from 2017, during President Trump’s first term. At first glance, the two press conferences, held eight years apart, might seem worlds away. The Middle East has undergone seismic shifts, most notably with the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Yet despite these dramatic changes, striking similarities emerged between the speeches given then and now. An analysis of both transcripts reveals that key themes—Israeli resilience, the need for peace with the Palestinians, and U.S. support for Israel—remained essentially unchanged. While some see this consistency as a sign of enduring commitment, others argue that it underscores a deeper problem: the status quo is stuck. Analysts warn that without a shift in strategy, which is what Trump is recommending, we may hear the same speeches in another eight years—offering the same promises and addressing the same conflicts but failing to break the cycle. Israel has long been a bipartisan issue in the U.S., with strong support for the country from both Democrats and Republicans. President Trump took office in 2017, following President Barack Obama, whose relationship with Netanyahu has often been described as strained. In his speech that May, Trump emphasized the 'unbreakable bond' between the U.S. and Israel, praising the Jewish state as a 'symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression.' Netanyahu, in turn, stressed the need to 'dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field.' He also reminded the new president that while Israel has no better ally than America, 'I want to assure you, the United States has no better ally than Israel.' President Trump’s strong stance on Israel has been key in attracting Jewish support. 'The more Jews in America care about Israel, the closer it brings them to Trump,' political media consultant Steve Rabinowitz told The Media Line. Eight years after 2017, the same themes are being repeated once again. This time, Trump came into office replacing President Joe Biden, whose administration has been accused of harming Israel’s war efforts by withholding weapons and ammunition and of prioritizing humanitarian aid to Gaza—even when it risks falling into Hamas’ hands—over ensuring the defeat of the terror group. Following October 7, 2023, tensions flared between Israel and the U.S. In February 2025, for example, President Joe Biden told reporters that Israel’s actions in Gaza were 'over the top,' signaling a rift. On Tuesday, President Trump sought to reaffirm the relationship again, telling the world that 'the bonds of friendship and affection' between the U.S. and Israel are 'absolutely unbreakable.' So, which other issues remain on the table—or have resurfaced—from 2017? Iranian nuclear threat President Trump first took office shortly after the Obama administration signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known as 'the Iran deal,' aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program. Netanyahu vehemently opposed that deal, urging the U.S. not to sign it. When Trump entered the White House, he immediately reimposed sanctions on Iran, calling the agreement 'one of the worst' he had ever seen in his 2017 speech. For nearly four years, President Trump’s policies financially squeezed Iran. But when President Biden took office, he lifted many of those sanctions. Over four years, the Biden administration enriched Iran by more than $50 billion. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Now, President Trump has vowed to reverse course once again. 'I also took action to restore a maximum pressure policy on the Iranian regime, and we will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions, drive Iranian oil exports to zero, and diminish the regime’s capacity to fund terror throughout the region and throughout the world,' Trump said. With the situation now more volatile than ever, sanctions alone may not be enough. Some experts warn that military action could become necessary. While President Trump has signaled that the U.S. is unlikely to take direct military action, his administration has signed agreements for weapons purchases that could give Israel the firepower to act if needed. If such an attack occurs, one thing is clear—it would only happen in full coordination with the United States. United Nations vs. Israel In December 2016, just weeks before Trump took office, the UN Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and calling for all Israeli settlement construction to stop. It also pushed for stricter labeling of products made in Israel versus those produced in settlements. The Obama administration, in a parting move, chose not to veto the resolution—an act many saw as a final rebuke to Israel. Six months later, President Trump made his stance clear. 'I reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations—just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly—or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel,' he said. Today, the situation is no different. Now, after more than 15 anti-Israel resolutions passed at the UN in 2024, President Trump faces the same challenges. On Tuesday, he announced his response: 'The United States withdrew from the antisemitic UN Human Rights Council and ended all support for the UN Relief and Works Agency, which funneled money to Hamas and was very disloyal to humanity.' U.S. military aid to Israel When Trump took office in 2017, he declared that U.S. security assistance to Israel was at 'an all-time high.' This came after the U.S. finalized a $38 billion military aid package in September 2016—the largest of its kind under the Obama administration. But after 16 months of war, Israel’s needs have only grown. In August 2024, the U.S. State Department confirmed that an additional $3.5 billion had been sent to Israel for American-made weapons and military equipment. This announcement, however, was followed by delays and what many criticized as a 'de facto arms embargo' on Israel. Now, just days into his return to office, President Trump has taken action. He lifted the previous administration’s embargo on over $1 billion in military aid, signaling a renewed commitment to Israel’s defense. West Bank annexation The fate of settlements in the West Bank, also known as Judea and Samaria, has been a challenge for every U.S. administration since 1967. That year, Israel won the territory in the Six-Day War. Israel annexed East Jerusalem and imposed control over the rest of the West Bank without formally annexing the area. Since 1967, Israel has maintained a military presence and established civilian settlements in the West Bank while managing aspects of security and administration. Under Obama, Israel agreed to a partial West Bank settlement freeze in 2009 and 2010, though construction continued to expand during his presidency. In his official remarks in 2017 and 2025, President Trump avoided the topic of settlements. However, when asked by a reporter about the topic in 2017, he responded, 'We’ll work something out. I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made. I know that every president would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasn’t possible because they didn’t do it.' Normalization agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in 2020 temporarily halted Israel’s annexation plans. As part of the agreements, known as the Abraham Accords, Israel agreed to delay annexation efforts, despite pressure from Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. Now, annexation may be back on the table. Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, has hinted at this possibility. While he acknowledged that he was not in charge of policy, he stated that the West Bank annexation was 'of course' a possibility during Trump’s second term. When pressed on Tuesday, Trump refused to confirm whether he supported a two-state solution, a one-state solution, or any other framework. Instead, he stated that his priority is to 'give people a chance at life.' He added that his administration has yet to take a position on annexation but promised an announcement within the next month. Trump’s peace vision When Trump first took office, he believed he could bring peace to the Middle East—and he still does. In 2017, he declared, 'The United States will encourage peace and, really, a great peace deal. We’ll be working on it very, very diligently. Very important to me also—something we want to do.' The Abraham Accords were signed three years later, normalizing ties between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain. Morocco and Sudan later joined the agreement. Now, peace with Saudi Arabia is within reach, and Trump is determined to make it happen. Saudi leaders have insisted that a pathway to a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for any deal. But analysts say there may be flexibility in how that 'pathway' is defined. Israel, for its part, has formally ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state. Over the past year, the Knesset passed two laws reinforcing this stance. Still, there is speculation that Israel’s position could shift—depending on who governs a potential Palestinian state and how much involvement the U.S. and moderate Arab nations have in its establishment. On Tuesday, Trump highlighted his record on Middle East diplomacy. 'We achieved the most significant Middle East peace agreements in half a century,' he said. 'But the Abraham Accords in particular, and I really believe that many countries will soon be joining this amazing peace and economic development transaction. It really is a big economic development transaction. I think we’re going to have a lot of people signing up very quickly.' He added, 'We will restore calm and stability to the region and expand prosperity, opportunity, and hope to our nations and for all people in the Middle East, including the Arab and Muslim nations.' Former Jewish Telegraphic Agency Washington bureau chief Ron Kampeas told The Media Line that Trump has remained committed to his 'grand vision' for the Middle East and is now 'trying to get it back on track.' However, he pointed to a key difference between 2017 and 2025: the absence of the Palestinians from the conversation. 'In 2017, he still envisioned a Palestinian state,' Kampeas said. 'Now it seems this is off the agenda completely, and he is even talking about encouraging Palestinians in Gaza to leave. He has dismantled any kind of Palestinian sovereignty.' Despite this shift, those in Netanyahu’s camp see hope in Trump’s approach. On Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister praised Trump’s leadership, saying, 'Your willingness to puncture conventional thinking—thinking that has failed time and time again—your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas will help us achieve all these goals.' Trump cannot run for another term after this one. By 2029, the results of his Middle East vision will be clear. Will Netanyahu be proven right—or will history repeat itself?

Hamas fails to deliver names of hostages to be freed	Israeli officials warn that if Hamas does not deliver the names to mediators, it would be perceived as a grave violation of the cease-fire agreement Hamas has thus far failed to deliver a list of the names of the hostages that are to be released on Saturday, according to the cease-fire agreement. An Israeli official warned that if Hamas does not transfer the names to the mediators, it would be considered a grave violation of the agreement but did not specify what steps may be taken. Israel has pressured the mediators to urge Hamas to release Shiri Bibas and her two little boys in addition to the three men that are expected to be freed, according to the deal. The mother and her baby sons were abducted during the Hamas massacre and the terror group claimed that they were killed in November 2023, although no evidence was provided. In Israel, concern for their safety grew after the IDF said they too have been increasingly concerned. Women and children who were taken captive by the terrorists, were to be released earliest in the first phase of the deal. Meanwhile an Israeli delegation was expected to leave for Qatar over the weekend, for low level talks on the continued implementation of the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Negotiations on the second phase were to begin last week but according to the Prime Minister's Office, they began in Washington, with American officials and not in Doha with the other mediating countries. After U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan to relocate Gaza's Palestinian residents to neighboring countries while the Strip was being rebuilt, Hamas strongly rejected the idea, prompting concerns among some officials that the next hostage release could be delayed at least – in response and as the vast obstacles that could emerge from the Trump plan, become evident ahead of any negotiations for the second phase that would include the release of all live hostages,a withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza and an end to the war.

US has set 'red line' that Hezbollah not join Lebanese govt, envo...	Deputy envoy on first visit by an official of the Trump administration says the United States would not be able to recognize the government in Beirut if the Shi'ite group joins, while parliament speaker Berri, a Hezbollah allie insists on their participation The United States has set a 'red line' that Shi'ite terror group Hezbollah should not be a member of Lebanon's next government after its military defeat by Israel last year, U.S deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus said in Lebanon on Friday. Ortagus is the first senior U.S. official to visit Lebanon since U.S. President Donald Trump took office and since Joseph Aoun was elected president in Lebanon. Her visit comes amid a stalled cabinet formation process in Lebanon, where government posts are apportioned on sectarian lines. Hezbollah's ally Amal has insisted on approving all Shi'ite Muslim ministers, keeping the process in deadlock. Speaking to reporters after meeting President Aoun, Ortagus said she was 'not afraid' of Iran-backed Hezbollah 'because they've been defeated militarily,' referring to last year's war between the group and Israel. 'And we have set clear red lines from the United States that they won't be able to terrorize the Lebanese people, and that includes by being a part of the government,' she said. Ortagus had been widely expected to deliver a tough message to Lebanese officials about Hezbollah, which was battered by months of Israeli air strikes and ground operations in southern Lebanon last year. Fighting ended in late November with a ceasefire brokered by the United States and France that set a deadline of 60 days for Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon, Hezbollah to pull out its fighters and arms and Lebanese troops to deploy to the area. That deadline was extended to Feb. 18. Ortagus referred to the new date on Friday but did not explicitly say the Israeli army (IDF) would withdraw from Lebanese territory. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'February 18 will be the date for redeployment, when the IDF troops will finish their redeployment, and of course, the (Lebanese) troops will come in behind them, so we are very committed to that firm date,' she said.

Armed terrorist in show of force in Marwan Issa funeral	The senior member of Hamas was killed in an airstrike last year with Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif; Funeral attended by mass crowds in the El Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza Armed Hamas terrorists participated on Friday in a funeral service for Marwan Issa, a senior member of the Hamas military wing, that was held in the El Bureij refugee camp in the center of the Strip. A massive crowd of Gazans attended the event. Issa was killed in an airstrike on Gaza last march along with the head of the Hamas military wing Mohammed Deif. The funeral was a show of force by Hamas ahead of another release of hostages scheduled for Saturday and after U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan to remove and relocate Palestinians from Gaza while it is rebuilt, an idea that was widely rejected by Palestinians and Arabs across the Middle East. Issa who was the third among Hamas leaders and considered a deputy of Deif was the victim of one of Israel's most significant achievements during the war, eliminating Deif who was the mastermind of the Hamas massacre and had evaded assassination by Israel, over years. The IDF said that the senior terrorist who was 59 when he was killed, was among the terror group's founders, an architect of the military operations of Hamas and involved in the planning of the October massacre. He was also complicit in the planning and executing of the abduction of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, who was held as a hostage in Gaza until 2011 when he was released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including Yahya Sinwar who soon became the Hamas leader. Issa who had been jailed for his terror activity in the past, was among the Hamas members most wanted by Israel. He, like Dief escaped previous assassination attempts, including when his home was bombed in 2021, killing his brother. His face was unfamiliar to the public before 2011, when he was photographed during a reception for the prisoners released in the Shalit deal. He played a central role in the development of military systems in Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades and became a wanted figure in Israel. His name featured prominently among the most wanted in Hamas and was targeted by Israel in 2006 during a meeting he held with Deif and other leaders, as well as in 2014 and 2021 when his house was bombed and his brother killed. His face was not publicly known before 2011, and he was photographed during the reception of prisoners released in the Gilad Shalit deal. Unlike many Hamas leaders, Issa remained in the Gaza Strip. His son was killed in an airstrike in December, and his oldest son died about a year ago due to illness; at that time Issa failed to get him out of the Gaza Strip for medical treatment. Issa was one of the planners of the Hamas attack on October 7, and his elimination is a severe blow for Hamas.'He was a multifaceted figure who simultaneously held three roles. He was the 'Defense Minister' of Hamas, a member of the Hamas government; additionally, he was the 'Deputy Chief of Staff,' serving as the deputy head of the military wing. Perhaps most importantly, he was the strategic mind of Hamas,' Managing Director of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) and former head of the Military Intelligence Maj. Gen. (Res.) Tamir Hayman said. Under the guise of his role as 'labor minister,' he played a central role in the Hamas movement, in a broader sense than just the military aspect. Beyond that, he was a close confidant of (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar. He was his balance and managed to largely control Sinwar's psychological volatility. As a very close friend of Deif, he was the one who connected Sinwar to Deif. So, yes, the public may not know him, but sometimes the connecting factor is almost as important as the leader himself.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjg0x007y1l	2025-02-07T03:29:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/BJ115QnwXt1e/BJ115QnwXt1e_0_112_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Convicted Palestinian terrorist is a guest at Georgetown law scho...	Ribhi Karajah sentenced to jail for involvment in the murder of Rina Shnerb in a 2019 West Bank attack is invited by pro-Palestinian group to speak about detention and torture by Israel Students at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. will host a convicted terrorist involved in the murder of 16-year-old Rina Shnerb in an attack in the West bank in 2019, and the wounding of her father and brother. Ribhi Karajah, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) who was sentenced to three years in prison after the terror attack, is to be a guest of the university’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter to speak about 'arrest, detention, and torture in the Israeli military system.' Dinner would be provided said the invitation posted on Instagram. Karajah pleaded guilty to knowing in advance about the attack on Shnerb and her family and failing to stop it. According to the indictment he was told by his friend, also a member of the PFLP that they planned to carry out a terror attack including a photograph of the location, a natural spring often visited by settlers. Students for Justice in Palestine has been behind many of the anti-Israel protests on American university campuses and has even been barred from some for antisemitism. Jewish and Israeli students at Georgetown complained to the school administration claiming that a visit by a convicted terrorist was putting their own safety at risk.

War crimes court condemns Trump's sanctions against its staff	Court says order would undermine its judicial work and urged its 125 member states 'to stand united' for justice and human rights, pledges to continue 'providing justice and hope' The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday said it condemned the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on its staff.

Inside the IDF’s strategy to avert a West Bank disaster	Military assigns Home Front Command units to protect border communities and prevent October 7-style attack; officials criticize government roadblocks, warning heavy traffic fueling Palestinian unrest more than Trump’s remarks The Shin Bet announced Thursday that it had recently arrested a Hamas and Fatah terror cell from Ramallah that was planning to carry out a bombing attack on a bus in Jerusalem. According to the investigation, the cell intended to remotely detonate an explosive device smuggled into Israel as part of the attack. The plot was reportedly motivated by a desire for revenge over the ongoing war in Gaza. While Israeli security forces have thwarted nearly 1,000 terrorist plots over the past year, senior military officials are increasingly concerned about the security situation in the West Bank. Some officials describe the threat level there as even greater than in Gaza, fearing a potential large-scale attack similar to the events of October 7, 2023, targeting Israeli settlements and communities near the security barrier. In response to these concerns, the IDF has established a special command to address potential threats in the West Bank. The newly designated force, which includes multiple reserve brigades from the Home Front Command, will be tasked with defending border communities stretching from the northernmost tip of the West Bank, through the Sharon area and down to Hebron. The brigades, formed in the wake of lessons learned from May 2021’s Operation Guardian of the Walls, are trained to secure key transportation routes, similar to those blocked by Israeli Arab rioters during previous unrest. Additionally, a specialized reserve mobilization unit will be responsible for swiftly deploying forces to security breaches along the border fence. Last month, reserve soldiers from the elite Duvdevan Unit thwarted a Hamas-inspired infiltration attack just three kilometers from Highway 6, an event that could have had significant consequences. Meanwhile, the IDF’s Central Command has conducted complex large-scale drills simulating extreme attack scenarios, including the defense of border communities, challenges in intelligence gathering and aerial response coordination. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Nearly three million Palestinians live in the West Bank, many in close proximity to more than half a million Israelis. For years, Iran and its proxies—particularly Hamas—have sought to establish a stronger foothold in the area. From Hamas’ perspective, Gaza has already served its purpose by carrying out the deadliest terror attack in Israel’s history and is now embroiled in a prolonged war. Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq have rallied in support of Gaza, and some within Hamas are questioning why West Bank Palestinians have not followed suit. In recent months, Israeli security agencies have observed a surge in terrorist activity, the use of advanced weaponry and the emergence of new local terrorist cells in Tulkarm, Jenin and Tubas. In response, Israeli forces have launched a nearly unprecedented counterterror operation in the northern West Bank, focusing on Jenin, Tulkarm and the surrounding villages. The head of the IDF’s Menashe Brigade has led efforts to separate the Jenin refugee camp from the city itself, working alongside Shin Bet officers and Civil Administration officials to dismantle terror infrastructure. Some of these operations have intercepted imminent threats moments before attacks on civilians and security forces. While the Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps remain terrorist strongholds, their adjacent cities have largely resumed normal life, with trade and education continuing despite ongoing military activity nearby. Meanwhile, restrictions imposed on Palestinian movement in the West Bank have sparked growing unrest. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds the portfolio of a minister in the Defense Ministry, pushed for roadblocks, which were approved by the government and security officials, but military leaders have questioned their effectiveness. Some IDF officials argue that the deployment of combat forces to maintain checkpoints diverts resources from offensive operations, straining an already stretched military force. Recent intelligence suggests that Palestinian frustration is mounting—not over Trump’s proposal to relocate Gazans to a third country or his vague remarks on potential annexation, but over the daily traffic congestion caused by roadblocks, which have led to hours-long delays. While the IDF and Shin Bet remain focused on preventing terror attacks and safeguarding Israeli citizens on both sides of the Green Line, officials warn that political decisions that disrupt daily life could further destabilize the region. In response to the developments, the IDF said: 'The IDF is working to strengthen readiness for various scenarios across all sectors. We do not comment on operational preparations.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wigb7yje	2025-02-06T23:28:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/Hker9v4ztyg/Hker9v4ztyg_0_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg

Rubio will travel to the Munich Security Conference and to Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia from February 13-18, the senior State Department official said late on Thursday. Rights groups have condemned Trump's suggestion that Palestinians in Gaza should be permanently displaced as part of a U.S. takeover of the enclave. Rubio said on Wednesday that Palestinians in the enclave will have to relocate in the 'interim' while it is rebuilt following the Israel-Gaza war. The U.S. official said Rubio would discuss Gaza and the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas on Israel during the trip, and would pursue Trump's approach of trying to disrupt the status quo in the region. 'The status quo can't continue. It's like wash, rinse and repeat. It becomes familiar and you begin to think this is just what life is and what we have to expect. President Trump and Marco Rubio believe that that's not the case, that things can change,' the official said.

When Israel moved 10,000 Gazans to Sinai—and terror attacks plumm...	In 1971, Israel relocated over 10,000 Gazans to northern Sinai under Ariel Sharon to curb terror attacks, which dropped sharply afterward; while some evacuees reported better housing, others struggled to adapt, and UNRWA protested the move as forced displacement In the summer of 1971, amid a surge in terror attacks in Gaza, Israel relocated more than 10,000 residents from the Jabaliya and Al-Shati refugee camps to northern Sinai. The move, carried out under the command of then-IDF Southern Command chief Ariel Sharon, was aimed at curbing terrorism. The number of attacks in Gaza fell from 445 in 1971 to just a few dozen the following year and remained low until the outbreak of the First Intifada in 1987. The relocation followed a series of deadly attacks, including the murder of Mark, 7, and Abigail, 5, Aroyo who were murdered when terrorists threw a grenade into their family’s car near Gaza City. Their parents were injured. In response, Sharon launched an extensive counterterrorism operation, with support from Meir Dagan, then commander of an IDF counterterror force. In July 1971, IDF forces entered the northern Gaza refugee camps, relocating about 10,500 residents to El-Arish in northern Sinai, with a few sent to the West Bank. Reports suggested the actual numbers were higher. At the time, Sinai was under Israeli control. According to Ynet's sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, some residents fled rather than accept housing in El-Arish, leaving behind their belongings. UNRWA employees protested the move and launched a strike. However, other reports indicated that many of those relocated were satisfied with their new homes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Then-defense minister Moshe Dayan visited El-Arish in late July, where, according to a published report, evacuees 'expressed satisfaction with the housing provided and the treatment they received from the military administration.' Some also said that they were able to continue working. The military administration offered jobs to those in need and attempted to help them resume their previous employment. The IDF supplied food and expressed hope that UNRWA would step in to assist. Meanwhile, Dayan visited Jabaliya, where homes had been demolished to clear space for a planned security road. Israeli officials noted that there were no security incidents in the ten days following the relocations. However, evacuees voiced complaints about unfair housing distribution, with smaller families receiving larger apartments than larger ones. Many also lamented being separated from relatives and struggling to integrate into El-Arish. Others reported water shortages in upper floors and difficulties adjusting to apartment living. Months later, journalist Tzvia Cohen visited El-Arish. Her report said that evacuees had been given three options — relocation to the West Bank, another area in Gaza or El-Arish. Compensation was provided for lost property. 'Every tree in the yard was included in the compensation,' said Lt. Col. Shmuel Liran, then-IDF spokesman for Gaza and northern Sinai. Mohammed Mustafa, a former photographer from Gaza, noted that his profession was not in demand in El-Arish, forcing him to seek work in Israel. 'I now earn 17 liras a day working in a dairy, compared to 5–6 liras before,' he said, adding that despite an improved standard of living, he still struggled to afford food and clothing. One woman brought her two sick children to a clinic where treatment was free. The local medical team included 6–8 nurses, a lab technician, an administrator and a technician, while Israeli doctors worked in rotations. Another evacuee, Wataha Hassan, lived in a two-room apartment with a balcony, kitchen and toilet. One room was empty except for a kerosene lamp and a light bulb. The other had mattresses stacked against the wall, a colorful tapestry, a family photo and a desk with books and notebooks. 'We have no stove or refrigerator,' one woman said. 'Or a washing machine,' added 12-year-old Fatma, who did not recognize the camera held by photographer Micha Bar-Am. When the journalist asked about their black headscarves, the women responded in unison: 'We wear black to mourn Palestine. When we win, we’ll wear white.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk4oo9gk1e	2025-02-06T13:10:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/rJmvH11fFyx/rJmvH11fFyx_50_215_654_369_0_small.jpg

Iran mulls policy shift as Trump sanctions stifle economy	With local currency plummeting on black market and growing public distrust, Iranians hoard $70 billion worth of gold and foreign reserves as inflation soars as Trump's 'maximum pressure' policy back in force U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a return to a 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran's economy via sanctions is taking a toll on Tehran’s markets. The Iranian rial hit an all-time low on the black market, trading at 858,000 rials per U.S. dollar. On Tuesday, shortly before meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump signed an executive order reimposing sanctions on Iran, particularly targeting its leading source of foreign reserves — oil exports. The Iranian government's official exchange rate doesn't reflect the real market value. The demand for U.S. dollars, seen in Iran as a safe haven, has surged since Trump was re-elected in early November, causing the rial to lose 25% against the dollar. Since his return to the White House last month, the rial has lost another 5.5%. Over the past year, which saw the Islamic Republic exchanging direct blows with Israel, setbacks in the Middle East (including the toppling of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria and Hezbollah's heavy losses in its war against Israel) and Trump's return, the rial has lost 55% of its value. The currency's collapse is fueling inflation. Iran does not regularly publish updated inflation figures, but its last reported rate stood at 40% — a number widely disputed by independent economists and the public amid frequent price hikes for food and other essentials. With expectations that the rial will continue to weaken under Trump's pressure campaign, inflation is expected to rise further. The currency's rapid depreciation is eroding Iranians' purchasing power, even among the middle class, increasing frustration over the regime's economic mismanagement. Corruption, negligence and the government's misplaced priorities have led many Iranians to lose faith in state institutions, particularly the banking system. Instead, they seek to safeguard their assets outside official financial channels.

'The state is seeking $5 billion in loans from international bodies, while $70 billion remains outside the economic system in private hands,' he said at a financial conference in Tehran. Iran's dilemma: negotiation or nuclear escalation? Tehran's leadership was already debating its response to the U.S. before Trump signed the latest sanctions order. Officials close to President Masoud Pezeshkian, considered a pragmatist, have expressed willingness to negotiate with the U.S. to avoid severe economic fallout. They argue that an agreement and sanctions relief are essential to rebuilding Iran’s economy. The country’s powerful ruling ultraconservative faction, however, sees the increased U.S. pressure as a reason to accelerate Iran's nuclear program as a deterrent. The final decision—whether to pursue negotiations or escalate nuclear activities—rests with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwdktmf1l	2025-02-06T10:49:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2014/11/30/5728297/5728297_0_16_1800_1013_0_small.jpg
Katz weighs allowing Gazans to leave via Israel amid Trump plan	Defense minister, in talks with top security officials, including IDF chief Herzi Halevi and successor Eyal Zamir, discusses allowing Gazans to leave via Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport—pending voluntary requests and strict security checks Defense Minister Israel Katz held high-level security talks Thursday on the feasibility of allowing Gaza residents to emigrate via Israel, through Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport, amid growing international scrutiny over the issue, officials said. The meeting, attended by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Defense Ministry Director-General and incoming IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, focused on voluntary emigration options for Gazans. Katz had earlier instructed the military to draft a plan facilitating departures by land, sea and air. While Israel has yet to formally adopt any such policy, Katz praised U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal for large-scale emigration from Gaza, saying it could offer 'thousands of Gazans a chance to relocate worldwide.' He accused Hamas of using residents as human shields, exploiting humanitarian aid and holding them hostage to its rule, asserting that 'every Gazan who wishes to leave should be able to.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, Katz’s remarks drew sharp condemnation from Egypt, which warned of 'catastrophic consequences' and accused Israel of violating international law and humanitarian norms. Cairo said the proposal could undermine cease-fire negotiations and destabilize the region. Katz also claimed that European nations critical of Israel’s military actions—such as Spain, Ireland and Norway—were obligated to accept Gazan migrants but said their 'hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse.' He suggested that countries like Canada, which has formal immigration programs, had previously shown willingness to take in Gazans and should now facilitate their relocation. Despite the controversy, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) is expected to oversee aspects of the plan, though the military is currently leading its initial formulation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1u2jfzy1x	2025-02-06T10:28:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/rJIqODfKke/rJIqODfKke_0_105_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Hamas can ‘foil Trump’s plan,’ spokesperson says	Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told Qatari outlet Al Jazeera on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent statement of taking over the Gaza Strip and relocating Palestinians could be 'foiled' by the terror group.

October 6 mindset': New West Bank resorts near Israeli border wo...	Security officials warn construction near security barrier poses significant risk; activists call for stricter enforcement to prevent violations reminiscent of those that preceded the October 7 attack Three large Palestinian resort complexes, featuring pools and high-end guest rooms, have been built in recent years in the West Bank's Area C—under full Israeli control—raising concerns among local Jewish residents. The resorts are located on the outskirts of the Palestinian village of Al-Mudawwar near the West Bank barrier and close to several Israeli towns in the area. Security officials described the construction as a security threat. 'This is illegal construction very close to the border,' they said. 'Violations that led to the October 6 mindset in Israel must not be repeated. Illegal structures must be demolished, especially in Area C near the border.' The resorts are owned by Abdallah Odeh from Qalqilya and have gained popularity on social media, with thousands of followers on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Videos promoting the resorts to Palestinian visitors are widely shared. Pro-settler Israeli NGO Regavim sent an urgent letter to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, IDF Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox, and IDF Civil Administration head Brig. Gen. Hisham Ibrahim, demanding enforcement action. 'This illegal complex is yet another example of lawlessness. The offenders show no fear of legal consequences — not only do they operate the illegal resort, but they openly advertise it on social media,' the letter said. The security threat along the border is a major concern for nearby Jewish and Palestinian residents, fearing scenarios similar to the October 7 attack. According to Regavim, which monitors Palestinian construction inside and outside the Green Line, at least 19,000 illegal structures have been built within a kilometer of the border fence in recent years, despite much of the area being designated as military zones or state land. Shomron Regional Council head Yossi Dagan warned, 'This isn’t just a blatant legal violation — it’s a severe security risk that Israel cannot afford to ignore. We've been warning for years that illegal Palestinian construction in Area C, especially near the barrier, is not just about governance — it’s a direct threat to residents’ safety.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'If decisive action isn’t taken, we’ll face a dangerous reality that threatens not just Jewish communities but all Israelis,' he added. 'I expect security forces to immediately demolish these structures, investigate how illegal construction in such a strategic location was allowed to progress and prevent similar cases in the future.' Regavim's policy director Avraham Binyamin claimed the construction is part of a broader Palestinian effort to 'establish facts on the ground, seize land and encroach on state property — right next to Israeli communities and major highways. 'The border cannot be a no-man’s land. The state must restore deterrence and act decisively against this massive, violent takeover, which could quickly become an immediate and tangible threat to Israeli citizens.' 'For the past two years, Minister Smotrich has worked to change enforcement policy against illegal construction and Palestinian land grabs in Judea and Samaria. This includes staffing key positions, increasing enforcement resources and optimizing their use,' Smotrich's office said in a statement. 'During his tenure, illegal construction has decreased by about 50%, while demolitions have increased by 30% — and efforts continue. The minister thanks Regavim for aiding in identifying illegal construction and pressuring for stronger enforcement. The specific case will be referred to enforcement authorities for action according to priorities and professional discretion.' Oranit Council head Or Piron Zomer added, 'We take Palestinian illegal construction very seriously. The lack of enforcement leads to more and more buildings encroaching on state land near the fence, posing a real danger to our residents. These structures, along with illegal event halls in the area, regularly disrupt our residents' quality of life. 'We demand immediate enforcement and a continuous crackdown on these violations, which could enable further threats in the future. Over the past year, we’ve conducted site visits with all relevant authorities, from the IDF Civil Administration’s inspection unit to the Central Command chief. We trust our security forces but we insist on immediate and uncompromising enforcement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skfg2wgkyx	2025-02-06T09:43:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/Bkc7ugzt1g/Bkc7ugzt1g_0_114_640_361_0_small.jpg
Israel weighs allowing Gazans to leave via Ashdod Port, Ramon Air...	Defense Minister Israel Katz has discussed the possibility of allowing Gaza residents to emigrate via Israel, using Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport, amid U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal for Gaza’s population, Israeli officials said Thursday. The plan, which is still in early discussions, would apply only to residents who voluntarily seek to leave and would require strict security vetting, sources told Ynet. The talks were held with senior Israeli defense officials as part of broader deliberations on Gaza's future following the ongoing war. Israel has long restricted Palestinian movement from Gaza, but the Trump administration’s endorsement of large-scale emigration has renewed debate on potential exit routes for those seeking to leave. Officials have not yet confirmed if or when such a plan might be implemented.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b100owygy1l	2025-02-06T09:37:07-08:00

Trump to impose sanctions on International Criminal Court	US president to sign executive order imposing financial and visa sanctions on individuals involved in ICC investigations targeting US and its allies, including Israel; court reportedly braces for US sanctions that could cripple its operations U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday to sanction the International Criminal Court (ICC) for targeting the United States and its allies, such as Israel, a White House official said. The order will place financial and visa sanctions on individuals and their family members who assist in ICC investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies, said the official. The move by Trump comes after U.S. Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to sanction the ICC in protest at its arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense chief Yoav Gallant over Israel's campaign in Gaza. Netanyahu is currently visiting Washington. The ICC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The court has taken measures to shield staff from possible U.S. sanctions, paying salaries three months in advance, as it braced for financial restrictions that could cripple the war crimes tribunal, sources told Reuters last month. In December, the court's president, Judge Tomoko Akane, warned that sanctions would 'rapidly undermine the Court's operations in all situations and cases, and jeopardise its very existence.' This is the second time the court has faced U.S. retaliation as a result of its work. During the first Trump administration in 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her top aides over the ICC's investigation into alleged war crimes by American troops in Afghanistan. The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals. The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpxwogk1l	2025-02-06T08:36:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/rkGVS11BXkx/rkGVS11BXkx_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israeli Navy successfully tests Gabriel 5 sea-to-sea missile, striking simulated enemy vessel with precision; officials say advanced naval strike system enhances Israel’s maritime superiority, providing crucial operational edge in combat scenarios The Israeli Navy, the Directorate of Defense Research & Development (DDR&D) in the Defense Ministry and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) successfully conducted an operational test of the Gabriel 5 sea-to-sea missile, the military reported on Thursday. As part of the drill, the missile was launched at a target vessel simulating an enemy warship, successfully completing detection, tracking and engagement processes under combat-like conditions. Defense officials called the test a key milestone in bolstering Israel’s maritime offensive capabilities. 'The successful launch provides the Israeli Navy with greater operational freedom and strengthens our maritime superiority,' said Brig. Gen. Yehuda Elmakias, head of the Research and Development Unit at DDR&D. He emphasized that the missile system enhances Israel’s ability to protect strategic assets, infrastructure and civilian security. The Gabriel 5 is one of the Israeli Navy’s most advanced naval strike systems, allowing for precise targeting of enemy vessels. Capt. A., head of the Israeli Navy’s Weapons Department, said the missile’s capabilities are already being applied in combat, providing a 'substantial operational advantage across all arenas.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The test marks a significant advancement in the Israeli Navy's offensive capabilities, he added.

He noted that the missile followed its intended trajectory and struck the target with pinpoint accuracy, reinforcing IAI’s role in developing cutting-edge combat technology. The Gabriel 5 missile system is considered a critical component of Israel’s maritime defense strategy, ensuring the navy’s ability to counter evolving threats and maintain regional security. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syjl6dzt1g	2025-02-06T08:21:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/HJatRvGFkl/HJatRvGFkl_12_0_993_559_0_small.jpg

Smotrich: Israel has quietly discussed Gaza emigration plan for m...	Treasurer says kept discussions under wraps due to concerns about opposition from Biden administration, reaffirms plans to resume Gaza military operations after hostage deal and rejects any Palestinian recognition as part of Saudi normalization Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Thursday that Israel has been quietly discussing plans for the voluntary emigration of Gaza’s population for months, but refrained from openly addressing the issue due to concerns over the Biden administration’s opposition. In an interview on Ynet's Hebrew-language political podcast '120 and One,' Smotrich said discussions on Palestinian emigration were taking place under the radar before U.S. President Donald Trump publicly embraced the idea. He also reaffirmed that Israel will resume full-scale military operations after the initial phase of the hostage deal, rejected any national recognition of Palestinian sovereignty as part of a potential normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia and hinted at possible tensions with far-right leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has expressed interest in rejoining the government. Smotrich praised Trump’s backing of the Gaza resettlement proposal, saying it reflects an understanding of Gaza’s severe overpopulation and economic limitations. 'Before the war, every poll in Gaza showed overwhelming numbers of people wanting to emigrate but were blocked from leaving,' Smotrich claimed. 'Trump understands that the only way to ensure better lives for Gazans is outside of Gaza.' He confirmed reports that Israel had been examining emigration plans for months but avoided openly discussing them during President Joe Biden’s administration to prevent a diplomatic backlash. 'If we had gone public with this under Biden, it could have led to a UN Security Council resolution without an American veto, making it harder to implement,' Smotrich said. 'We have been preparing various options behind the scenes, and now that Trump has weighed in, his support carries enormous weight.' Smotrich suggested that with the U.S. president's backing, it would be feasible to relocate two million Gazans to other countries, calling it 'the only solution that would bring peace and security to Israel while improving economic conditions for Gazans.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Smotrich reiterated his strong opposition to any Palestinian political recognition as part of a potential Israel-Saudi normalization deal. 'There will be no national, sovereign or collective recognition of any entity other than the State of Israel,' he said. He dismissed speculation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was considering such a concession, claiming, 'I've had dozens of conversations with him on this. He is not going in that direction.' Smotrich insisted that Israel must resume military operations in Gaza after the first phase of the hostage deal, calling the agreement a dangerous precedent that incentivizes hostage-taking. 'The only way to fix this is by ensuring Hamas is destroyed—militarily, politically and as a governing entity,' he said. 'We must go back to war if Hamas does not surrender.' He also criticized the handling of humanitarian aid to Gaza, arguing that allowing Hamas to control aid distribution had strengthened the terrorist group financially. 'Hamas has received $1.3 billion during this war—it’s a failure,' he said, adding that Netanyahu should have forced the military to find alternative distribution mechanisms. Smotrich implicitly criticized Ben-Gvir, who recently left the government and has hinted at wanting to return. 'I think he made a mistake by leaving,' Smotrich said. 'You can’t just walk away to save face over a hostage deal and then try to return. If he wants back in, he must do so with responsibility, not as part of a perpetual campaign.' When asked about his future political alignment with Ben-Gvir, Smotrich said, 'I’m not comfortable discussing politics in the middle of a war.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byqbr8mt1e	2025-02-06T07:34:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/S1PSaH4GFkl/S1PSaH4GFkl_0_204_853_481_0_small.jpg

The United States has announced economic sanctions targeting an 'international network' facilitating the transfer of Iranian oil to China, allegedly funding Tehran’s military operations, the Treasury Department said Thursday. The move marks the first round of sanctions imposed under the new administration of President Donald Trump. In the statement, the Treasury Department said it was 'sanctioning an international network for facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).'

Was the fatal Gaza crane collapse preventable?	After 2 Golani soldiers killed, 8 others injured, probe focuses on why military crane wasn’t retracted despite storm warnings; one of victims rushed to fight on Oct. 7; another overcame health issues to serve in combat role Two IDF soldiers were killed and eight others injured when a military crane collapsed in the northern section of the newly established buffer zone inside Gaza overnight Thursday, the IDF said. The incident occurred during a cease-fire and is being investigated as a possible severe operational failure. The victims were identified as Sergeant First Class (res.) Nadav Cohen, 21, from Beit Hanan, and Staff Sgt. Nachman Refael Ben Ami, 20, from Eilat—both members of the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion. The collapse occurred as strong winds and stormy weather swept through the region, with one soldier remaining in critical condition. The soldiers were inside a tent when the operational crane, commonly used by the IDF to mount surveillance cameras and communication antennas, collapsed due to high winds. Despite advance warnings of severe weather, the military only halted the use of cranes in Gaza and nearby Israeli bases after the fatal accident. According to initial reports, the crane had been deployed at a temporary outpost in the buffer zone, several hundred yards from the Gaza-Israel border near Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Witnesses reported no prior signs of instability before a sudden gust of wind caused it to topple onto the soldiers’ tent. Unlike other outposts in the area, the soldiers were not housed in reinforced structures. The accident occurred around midnight, with winds recorded at approximately 60 km/h (37 mph) along the southern coastal plain, according to Israel’s meteorological service. While the IDF had taken weather precautions for its troops, the decision not to retract the cranes despite the risk of collapse is now a key focus of the investigation, along with how the equipment was secured. Military cranes play a crucial role in providing surveillance coverage for forces operating beyond the ridgeline in the buffer zone. A first responder at the scene described the effort to extract one of the fallen soldiers. 'We arrived at 12:10 a.m. after receiving reports of a soldier trapped under an overturned crane platform. When we got there, we realized he was likely already dead. The crane, which was extremely heavy, had crushed the soldiers’ tent. A military engineering vehicle was called in to lift it, and it took about five minutes to recover the body,' the rescuer told Ynet. 'We truly thought it was behind us' Nadav Cohen was laid to rest Thursday in the cemetery of Beit Hanan, the small moshav near Ness Ziona where he grew up. He is survived by his parents, Shai and Osnat, and his younger sisters, Roni and Maya. Cohen, who initially enlisted in the Egoz special forces unit before transferring to the Golani Brigade, completed his mandatory service just months ago and immediately volunteered for reserve duty. 'He had just finished his service with Golani, the brigade he loved so much,' his family said. 'Without hesitation, out of a deep sense of duty and values, he volunteered to continue serving in the reserves alongside his friends.' Family friend Zafrir Negbi recounted how Cohen had fought throughout the war, including during Hamas’ October 7 attack on southern Israel. That morning, Cohen was at home on leave but quickly mobilized with his battalion to Kibbutz Kisufim near the Gaza border. 'He was at home when he started getting messages about what was happening in the south,' Negbi said. Cohen joined his battalion commander, Lt. Col. Meir Ohayon, and together they drove to Kisufim. 'He fought there for hours and was hit by two bullets that stopped in his vest—he survived by a miracle.' Cohen later served on the Lebanese front before returning to Gaza in recent weeks. 'We thought things had calmed down with the cease-fire, and then came the devastating news—Nadav was killed by a falling crane,' Negbi said. 'He survived everything in this war. He thought it was finally over, that he could rest. And then, this tragic accident happened.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Cohen’s uncle, Amit Cohen, expressed the family’s grief in an interview with Ynet: 'This shouldn’t have happened. We thought we were past the worst. On October 7, we were with him in Gaza, then in Lebanon, then back in Gaza. We truly thought it was behind us. And then this happened. It’s unbearable. Our firstborn, the eldest of our family in Beit Hanan, the first child born here—and now we’ve lost him. There is no way to fill this void. We are shattered.' Family and friends described Cohen as a 'brave, deeply rooted young man, full of life, with a big heart and a unique sense of humor.' His friends called him 'the heart and soul of the group.' Cohen studied at Gan Raveh Elementary School in Ayanot and later attended the regional high school in Givat Brenner. He is the 13th fallen soldier from his high school since the war began. 'We lost an incredible young man, full of life, smart and kind-hearted,' said Negbi. Mira Ben Ari, head of the Gan Raveh Regional Council, also mourned his passing: 'The Beit Hanan community and the entire nation of Israel have lost one of their best sons today. Nadav was among our finest.' 'An angel, a symbol of heroism and devotion' Ben Ami was laid to rest Thursday in the military section of the Eilat cemetery. He is survived by his parents, Asaf and Orit, and four siblings, Asher, Yaakov, Adele and Sarah. Ben Ami was born in Safed and studied at the Belevav Shalem Yeshiva in Yeruham. His religious Zionist family moved to Eilat three years ago, after previously living in Arad for nearly a decade. Determined to join the Golani Brigade, Ben Ami concealed pre-existing medical conditions that could have disqualified him from combat service. He also chose not to request an exemption based on his mother's battle with cancer, insisting on serving in a meaningful frontline role. His family described him as a devoted son and brother, deeply committed to his faith and values. 'Nachman Refael was a pure soul with a warm and loving heart and kind eyes,' his sisters said. 'He never complained or sought to ease his own burden, but always did everything to make life easier for others.' The family had moved to Eilat to fulfill their dream of living by the sea, which Nachman Refael loved. 'Even in winter, he would go swimming,' they recalled. His sister Adele emphasized his deep dedication to family, saying, 'He wouldn’t want us to cry—he always ensured there was joy and positivity around him. He lived and walked like an angel.' Eilat Mayor Eli Lankri, who visited the family, praised Ben Ami as one of the city's finest sons. 'He grew up with Torah values alongside a love for his people and his land. He fought bravely for our right to live in security. A whole nation mourns with you, sharing in the immense grief over your son, brother and grandson—a symbol of heroism and devotion.' The Belevav Shalem Yeshiva in Yeruham, where Ben Ami studied before enlisting, also paid tribute to him. Yeshiva dean Rabbi Yair Yaakobi said Ben Ami had 'graduated with big dreams of living a meaningful life. He was loved by all, full of kindness, warmth and an enormous heart.' His former teacher, Rabbi Yoni Damest, described him as 'a pure soul with exceptional talent.' He added, 'His humility and kindness made space for everyone around him. He never pretended—his sincerity and deep inner peace radiated outward, along with his genuine joy for life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfsqlztkl	2025-02-06T06:49:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/HklkptZMt1x/HklkptZMt1x_0_92_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks about resettling the Palestinians from Gaza and establishing U.S. ownership of the enclave were shocking and would ramp up tensions in the Middle East. Trump said on Thursday that Israel would hand over Gaza to the United States after fighting was over and the enclave's population was already resettled elsewhere, which he said meant no U.S. troops would be needed on the ground. Earlier this week, Trump said he wanted to resettle Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan, demolish remaining buildings to make way for a Riviera-style development project and place the occupied territory under U.S. 'ownership'. 'The main thing now is to provide the necessary humanitarian assistance to all those in need,' Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters. 'We believe that the main task today is to ensure the implementation of agreements between Israel and Hamas.' 'Any populist, frivolous or shocking arguments about any other palliative measures at the present stage are counterproductive and do not contribute to solving the problem, but only fuel tension in the region and to all the already extremely aggravated problems,' Zakharova said of Trump's remarks.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ag11umfkl	2025-02-06T06:12:42-08:00

There was no immediate comment from Lebanese officials.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjfjahzyye	2025-02-06T05:57:03-08:00	
What has the IDF accomplished in Jenin so far?	Jenin operation echoes Ariel Sharon’s 1971 Gaza strategy, which included controversial but effective displacement—an approach that may interest figures like Trump; yet with the campaign ongoing, how can Israel prevent terror groups from regrouping? As we drive into the Jenin refugee camp, we pass a large public building. 'That’s the camp’s hospital,' says Col. A, the commander of the Menashe Territorial Brigade. With relative indifference, he adds, 'We know there are still terrorists hiding there, and we’ll find a way to get them out. It’s not urgent for now.' Unlike previous IDF operations in the Jenin refugee camp, this mission has no time constraints and no set end date. Unlike past operations in Jenin, Tulkarem, and the surrounding villages, this is not a swift counterterrorism raid where forces enter, neutralize a target, and withdraw. The current mission, or rather, Operation Iron Wall, is aimed at systematically dismantling terrorist strongholds in the northern West Bank. This requires manpower and time. Since the war began in October 2023, Col. A has led 45 counterterrorism operations inside the Jenin refugee camp, referred to in military shorthand as 'M.P.' (mahane plitim, Hebrew for refugee camp) These past operations, including Operation Home and Garden in the summer of 2023, lasted only a few days. Now, forces have been in the camp for more than two weeks, systematically targeting both human and physical terrorist infrastructure. Walking through the narrow alleys of the Jenin refugee camp, it becomes clear why it is considered the terrorism capital of the northern West Bank. One key reason is its strategic location in Area A, under full Palestinian Authority control, near Israeli and Arab towns such as Afula and Megiddo, and close to the Jordan Valley. Before the war, Jenin enjoyed economic prosperity while also benefiting from massive arms smuggling across the porous Jordanian border, just a few dozen kilometers away. However, the historical legacy embedded in the camp is just as crucial. The walls are covered in graffiti depicting terrorist narratives, indoctrinating residents from birth. 'Look at this depiction of the ‘key narrative,’' Col. A says, pointing to a mural. It features familiar symbols such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque and a map of Palestine, with a child carrying a massive key like a rifle. 'The key represents the claim of camp residents—even those of the third or fourth generation—to return to their ancestors' homes in Haifa and its surroundings,' he explains. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The camp's 12,000 residents are mostly descendants of Haifa-area refugees who fled in 1948, settling on the hills above Jenin. Only the lower section of the camp extends into the city’s outskirts. Most buildings cling to steep slopes, making the alleys difficult to navigate on foot and nearly impossible for vehicles. As part of Operation Iron Wall, one of the first things the Israeli military did was carve out wide roads to facilitate rapid troop movement, including tanks, armored personnel carriers, and bulldozers. The D9 bulldozers, crucial in urban warfare, played a decisive role in breaking through. The use of bulldozers to open combat routes is not new. In 1971, then-Southern Command head Ariel Sharon employed a similar tactic to suppress the first wave of Gaza terrorism, demolishing buildings and clearing roads in the Jabalia and Shati refugee camps. As part of that campaign, Sharon relocated 1,600 Palestinian families whose homes had been destroyed, offering them resettlement options in Gaza and El-Arish. The aim was to dilute both the refugee camp population and its terrorist elements—a move that proved successful. A Network of bombs and surveillance Currently, a brigade combat team under Col. A’s command is focused on dismantling Jenin’s terrorist infrastructure, specifically targeting the network of roadside bombs and command centers established by the Jenin Battalion to attack Israeli forces and launch terror strikes into Israel. These explosives, despite being mostly homemade, have grown increasingly sophisticated. Like in Gaza, these IEDs remain the deadliest threat to Israeli forces. But the bombs are just the tip of the iceberg. Behind them lies a well-coordinated command-and-control system operated from multiple war rooms, using surveillance cameras positioned throughout the camp. These cameras allow terrorists to track Israeli troops, detonate explosives remotely, and issue alerts in real time. As we walk through the camp, we see remnants of these cameras, neutralized by the IDF, as well as large tarps terrorists had stretched over the streets to block Israeli drones from spotting their bomb placements. Some of these roadside bombs contain hundreds of kilograms of explosives, requiring significant time and effort to bury beneath roadways and repave the surface. Several such devices have already detonated beneath Panther armored vehicles, causing casualties. In fact, IEDs have been the primary cause of Israeli troop casualties in Jenin. Given the camp's extensive fortifications, previous pinpoint operations based on precise intelligence allowed the IDF to eliminate terrorists and thwart attacks before they were carried out. However, the Jenin Battalion remained intact, continuing its operations alongside terrorist cells in Tulkarem and surrounding villages. Jenin remains the epicenter of Palestinian terrorism, home to a coalition of terrorist factions under the Jenin Battalion, primarily led by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Even the secular, Marxist-Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) follows PIJ’s command. They call themselves 'Abnaa al-Mukhayyam'—the Sons of the Camp. The reign of extremism The camp's walls are filled with graffiti mocking Yasser Arafat for signing the Oslo Accords, depicting him as a woman. One mural shows a woman holding a map of Palestine, telling Arafat, 'Palestine will be great, and you are small.' This extreme ideology has allowed Palestinian Islamic Jihad to organize an actual military unit with a structured chain of command. Years of limited IDF presence and a complete absence of Palestinian Authority security forces enabled the battalion to build a sophisticated command system, controlling the camp with an iron grip. Hezbollah recognized the battalion’s potential early on, securing Iranian funding and weapons for the group. These 'investments' have paid off, creating a well-equipped terrorist force that the IDF is now working to dismantle. 'We are targeting both the personnel and the infrastructure they built,' Col. A says. 'We don’t demolish buildings at random. Where there’s doubt, we hold back. But weapons labs and terrorist positions will not remain standing.' As we drive, we spot a team of four wearing red uniforms with Red Crescent emblems, riding all-terrain vehicles. These are Palestinian search-and-rescue workers, permitted by the IDF to look for survivors in buildings that were destroyed. 'They won’t find anyone,' Col. A says, 'because we thoroughly check buildings before demolishing them.' Memories of the fierce 2002 Battle of Jenin, the bloodiest fight of Operation Defensive Shield, flash through my mind. Back then, D9 bulldozers played a decisive role in breaking terrorist resistance. 'This is what they call ‘Death Alley,’' Col. A says as we arrive at a narrow passage. 'Here, 13 of our soldiers were killed in an ambush. The terrorists rebuilt the area exactly as it was, both to preserve their legacy and to hinder our movements.' Despite ongoing efforts, Col. A knows the mission will take time. The key to long-term stability, he says, is not just eliminating terrorists but blocking the weapons and funding that sustain them. Until then, the battle continues. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1extxmt1l	2025-02-06T05:49:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/r14WU8VMFyl/r14WU8VMFyl_0_127_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Arab American Trump supporters back away after his Gaza plan	Group changes name from Arab Americans for Trump to Arab Americans for Peace; reject the idea promoted by the US president to 'take control of Gaza' and say opposed to any transfer of Palestinians Arab Americans for Trump, a group that supported the election of U.S. President Donald Trump's race for the White House in 2024 and were instrumental in bringing him votes has begun distancing from the president in the wake of his plan to turn Gaza into a so-called Middle East Riviera, in part by removing Gazans from the coastal strip. The group has changed its name from Arab Americans for Trump and now goes by Arab Americans for Peace. It says it still believes the in the president's commitment to peace in the Middle East but it does take issue with his intention to 'take control of Gaza' and encourage Palestinians to leave the Strip. Trump repeated his plan on his social media platform on Thursday after he outlined the idea for the U.S. to 'take over' Gaza during a White House press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday and floated a proposal to relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries and redevelop the war-torn territory into a 'Riviera of the Middle East,' while not ruling out the deployment of U.S. troops. Although they were not an official part of the Trump presidential campaign, the group played a central role in communicating his messages among the American Arab community, especially in the swing states of Michigan and Arizona. Members of the group also arrange meetings with allies of the then-candidate including Richard Grenell, Trump's envoy for special missions, and Massad Boulos, Trump's in-law and a senior member of the campaign for Middle-East and the Arab world. Yahya Basha who founded Arab Americans for Trump, said he was not surprised by Trump's comments, given earlier statements by the president's Jewish son-in-law Jared Kushner about Gaza being a good site for a future resort, but remained skeptical that the U.S. would execute those plans. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We believe that his ideas, as well-intentioned as they might be, rubbed a lot of people the wrong way,' he told Reuters. 'We're opposed to any transfer of Palestinians, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, out of their homeland. He said he did not regret anything he did to get Trump elected. 'I hope we see positive signs in the future,' he said adding that he believed Trump's comments were often provocative rather than the basis of policy, citing his comments on buying Greenland or to make Canada the 51st state of the U.S.' Leaders in Michigan's Muslim community were outraged, some calling Trump crazy and his announcement 'total chaos.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjym57ftye	2025-02-06T04:50:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/HJUnZoix1x/HJUnZoix1x_0_302_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Israeli spyware Paragon scandal grows: Italian journalists, activ...	A new report reveals that Paragon, the Israeli firm behind the surveillance tool, has decided to cut ties with Italy while Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government denies any involvement in the espionage scandal The espionage scandal involving Israeli spyware firm Paragon is deepening as new details emerge about its use to surveil journalists and activists. In recent days, three individuals critical of Italy’s government –including its handling of antisemitism within the ruling party – were identified as targets. The revelation has sent shockwaves across Italy and Europe. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government has denied using spyware to monitor journalists and activists. Meanwhile, The Guardian reported Thursday that Paragon has decided to sever ties with the Italian government. Last week, Meta alleged that Paragon’s spyware, Graphite, was implanted in the smartphones of about 90 people across 20 countries – mostly journalists and human rights activists—via WhatsApp. The tech giant has issued a legal warning to Paragon, demanding it halt surveillance of its users. Sources told Ynet that Paragon is assessing its next steps and is prepared to challenge Meta in court if necessary. Reports by Reuters and The Guardian have identified three targets of the surveillance: Francesco Cancellato, editor-in-chief of investigative news site Fanpage; Libyan-born Swedish activist Husam El Gomati; and Luca Casarini, head of Mediterranea Saving Humans, an organization assisting migrants from Libya. Casarini is known for his outspoken criticism of Italy’s immigration policies. 'They spied on me just because I'm a journalist' In an exclusive interview with Ynet, Cancellato expressed deep concern over the surveillance. 'I was really worried. Being targeted by spyware is a big problem for me. I believe they spied on me just because I'm a journalist,' he said. Cancellato revealed that his phone is now undergoing forensic analysis by Citizen Lab, a Canadian research group specializing in spyware investigations, and that the findings will be published by his newspaper. He first learned of the breach when WhatsApp’s security team sent him a warning message, alerting him that spyware had been detected on his device. 'At first, I thought it was a scam or a joke,' he recalled. 'Then, Citizen Lab contacted me and confirmed that this was real. They told me that my phone was hacked using Paragon’s spyware and that I was one of 90 journalists and activists who were targeted. I felt very uneasy; it was a strange and unsettling realization.' Why do you think that out of 90 people, only your name and that of two others were exposed? 'My name was published because I’m a journalist. My work is public, and even if the story is about me, it will be reported. But I don't know why others haven’t come forward — maybe they’re afraid, or maybe their cases are still being verified.' A power struggle over press freedom Cancellato also noted that, in the months leading up to the revelation, his WhatsApp app frequently crashed without explanation. At the time, he dismissed it as a technical issue. 'I never suspected it was linked to spyware. Looking back, I can’t say for sure if those crashes were related, but now it certainly makes me wonder,' he said. As editor-in-chief of an investigative outlet, Cancellato is particularly concerned about the potential breach of sensitive information. 'This isn’t just about my phone, it’s about my entire newsroom. They didn’t just hack me; they hacked my newspaper,' he said. 'Paragon claims its spyware isn’t as invasive as Pegasus [the infamous spyware from Israeli firm NSO], but they could still extract any data they wanted from my device.' He emphasized the broader implications: 'The real issue here is that a government agency spied on a European journalist. Paragon says it only sells to democratic nations, but why would a democracy spy on a journalist?' Was his reporting on Meloni’s party the reason? Cancellato acknowledged that his investigative team had published a major exposé on Meloni’s party, Brothers of Italy, revealing antisemitic content shared by young party members. The report sparked controversy, particularly because Brothers of Italy positions itself as a pro-Israel party. 'Our investigation had a significant impact on the government, so maybe that’s why they targeted me,' he said. Still, he remains uncertain about who was behind the surveillance. 'I don’t know who spied on me or why,' he said. 'But I doubt they were interested in my vacation plans or dinner dates. They wanted information about my work, our investigations; that’s the only thing I’m certain about.' Paragon was founded in 2019 by Ehud Schneorson, a former commander of Israel’s elite cyber intelligence unit 8200, along with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and several other ex-8200 operatives. Last year, the company was acquired by U.S. private equity firm Eurazeo Equity in a deal valued at up to $900 million. While Italy has neither confirmed nor denied using Paragon’s spyware, the firm claims it only sells to 37 democratic countries—making it highly likely that Italy was one of them. Sources familiar with the matter told Ynet that if it is proven that Paragon’s tools were misused to spy on journalists with no links to criminal activity, the license of the offending entity will be revoked. Following the uproar, Paragon has now reportedly decided to terminate its contract with the Italian government. Cancellato: 'I expected more from my government' Cancellato expressed disappointment in how the Italian government has handled the scandal. 'If Italy is involved, I expected someone in the government to step forward and say, ‘Yes, we use Paragon’s tools, but only to catch criminals, not journalists. We will investigate whether anyone overstepped their authority.’ Or at least say, ‘It’s serious that a foreign government is spying on our journalists, and we will support you in finding out what happened.’ 'But none of that happened,' he said. Should spyware be banned in democracies? Cancellato says he believes spyware can have legitimate uses in law enforcement but warns that its power must be handled responsibly. 'When used against criminals, terrorists, and drug traffickers, these tools can be valuable. Criminal organizations have hacking capabilities too, so law enforcement needs the ability to counter them,' he said. 'But governments must be held accountable. It’s like in Spider-Man: with great power comes great responsibility. If you use these tools, you must do so ethically and in accordance with democratic principles.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkznzmtjl	2025-02-06T04:37:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/SyNrxjLuye/SyNrxjLuye_1_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Shin Bet says foiled terror plot to blow up a Jerusalem bus	Terrorist cell made up of Fatah and Hamas operatives from the Ramallah area indicted; interrogations reveal their plot to detonate an explosive device, complicity in shooting attacks The Shin Bet said on Thursday that it had foiled a plot to detonate a bomb in a bus in Jerusalem devised late last year by a terror cell made up of Hamas and Fatah operatives from the West Bank area of Ramallah. The Shin Bet said the members of the cell, Ahmed Jasser Ali, Mander Sheikh Kassem, Bashir Awad, Ammar Subah and Ali Shwiki, were arrested in November and December of 2024. Their interrogation revealed that they had planned to denote an explosive device that they would bring across the border into Israel. Some of the members were also involved in shooting attacks targeting troops on the West Bank in the past year. Ahmed Jasser Ali produced an explosive device to be used in a suicide attack on a Jerusalem bus. The device was recovered, and investigators learned that the terrorists planned to test it to see if it could be activated remotely. The forces also found a Carlo rifle.

Trump's Gaza plan was born after envoy Witkoff visit to Netzarim ...	The Mideast envoy's description reportedly was turning point leading U.S. president to float his plan during news conference; some administration officials hope this will die off slowly, say no discussions was held in advance of the announcement President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff's impressions of Gaza were what prompted Trump's dramatic plan for the Strip, which includes the United States removing its residents and turning it into a Middle Eastern Riviera, CNN reported Thursday. Witkoff visited the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer last week and returned with a bleak description of what he saw. 'It is the buildings that could tip over at any moment. There’s no utilities there whatsoever, no working water, electric, gas, nothing. God knows what kind of disease might be festering there,' Witkoff told reporters on Tuesday. 'So, when the president talks about cleaning it out, he talks about making it habitable. And this is a long-range plan.' Trump's envoy said that the president intends to make Gaza a livable place and, like him, estimated it would take 10 to 15 years to rebuild. According to CNN, Witkoff's accounts of what he had seen left a strong impression on the president, constituting a turning-point after Trump made it the central point in his agenda for the region. Other sources in the know said the that the idea to remove Gazans from the Strip was the president's and proof that, while traditional 'experts' develop their ideas slowly, Trump comes up with them quickly in his own mind. The New York Times cited two administration officials who said Trump discussed the idea of U.S. control of the Strip for a number of weeks and, after Witkoff's description of the reality on the ground, his plan picked up pace. They said that although the matter had been considered by him for a while, there had been no meetings on the subject with the State Department or Pentagon, or any preparations made. 'It was just an idea in the president's mind,' they said. There are some who wonder whether Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and another real estate investor who worked the Middle East portfolio in his first term, would play a part in the rebuilding of Gaza. He had previously spoken about the incredible development opportunities presented by the Gaza waterfront. The president also spoke publicly about that potential in a speech last month. While there has been wall to wall condemnation of the idea in the Arab world, officials told CNN that Trump complained that there were no alternatives being suggested by regional actors. 'He’s not seeing any realistic solutions on how those miles and miles and miles of debris are going to be cleared,' U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said. 'The fact that nobody has a realistic solution, and he puts some bold, fresh, new ideas on the table, I don’t think should be criticized in any way. I think it’s going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions if they don’t like Mr. Trump’s solutions.' But there are those in the administration who understand that there is little chance for the plan to proceed and that the White House has already begun backing away from central parts of the plan. Some officials told the New York Times that advisors to the president hope the plan dies out slowly and that he would understand in time, that it is unrealistic. Trump's announcement of the plan was kept secret from nay of the senior officials in Washington, but he did discuss it with close advisors ahead of his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Times said Witkoff and Walz spoke to Netanyahu about it on the Monday before the meeting, but the prime minister did not expect Trump's announcement in their press conference.

The hostage, who was held captive in Gaza for 482 days and was released in the third round of the first phase of the deal, left Ichilov Hospital Thursday, accompanied by his family. As he said immediately after his release from the hell of Gaza, he again stated that he 'hopes to return soon to work the fields and contribute to the rebuilding of Nir Oz.' In his first public statement since his release, Gadi Mozes said: 'I thank my family; the IDF soldiers and security forces, everyone who assisted in my release; Ichilov Hospital, which treated me with dedication over the past week; and the entire people of Israel; The path to the rehabilitation and rebirth of all of us requires the return of all the hostages, down to the last one' Mozes and his family members thanked the IDF soldiers and security forces 'who work day and night for the security of the country and the recovery of the hostages, wishing a full recovery to the soldiers who were injured in body and mind, and embracing the bereaved families whose loved ones will be in our hearts forever. We are full of appreciation for those who gave their lives in the war that was forced upon us.' 'I am moved and amazed by the immense solidarity and warm embrace of the citizens of the country,' Mozes added.

Only in this way can we close the circle, heal the wounds and rebuild, as individuals and as a society.'

Turkey's priority in Syria is achieving stability and security, and ridding the country of militants, but it is too early to talk about a pact that would see Ankara establish military bases there, a Turkish Defense Ministry source said on Thursday. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Turkey and the new Syrian administration were to discuss a joint defence pact during talks between their presidents this week, including establishing two Turkish airbases in Syria and training for its new army. Asked about the report, the source said a defense ministry delegation had travelled to Syria last week for talks and that both countries were in agreement about Syria's territorial integrity, stability, and the need to clear it of all militants. The pact could see Turkey establish new air bases in Syria, use Syrian airspace for military purposes, and take a lead role in training troops in Syria's new army, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a senior regional intelligence official, a Syrian security official and two Damascus-based foreign security sources.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk8rbfzt1g	2025-02-06T01:59:23-08:00

Iran launches 1st drone carrier for IRGC navy	Shahid Beheshti, a former container vessel, is equipped with a 180-metre (590-ft) runway and is able to operate without refuelling for up to one year, Iran's news agency Tasnim says Iran launched a new drone carrier vessel on Thursday, that will be added to its Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) naval force. This is the first of its kind in Iran and second to Turkey's navy. The new carrier is meant to help Iran launch drones from a relatively close distance toward its enemies and reduce the chances detection of the launch. The Shahid Beheshti, a former container vessel, is equipped with a 180-metre (590-ft) runway and is able to operate without refuelling for up to one year, Iran's news agency Tasnim said. The ship is different from previous Revolutionary Guards warships because it can launch and retrieve larger drones such as the Qaher, a miniaturised drone version of a local fighter jet as well as helicopters. Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had revealed in the past that Iran intended to transform merchant vessels for military use, which he said would be 'floating bases of terror.' In a speech he gave in May 2023, Gallant presented a photograph of the Shahid Beheshti. 'these vessels are of considerable size, ranging from tens to sometimes hundreds of thousands of tons,' he warned. 'They are intended to carry various types of combat capabilities, including aircraft, missiles, offensive systems and advanced intelligence, in order to serve as forward terror bases in areas located far from the Iranian border.' Iran's chief of military staff Mohammad Bagheri and the commander of the IRGC Hossein Salami participated in the launch. 'We do not threaten any nation but do not bend in the face of threats,' Salami said. 'Our achievements are an answer to any threat against Iran and the Muslim nations.' According to a report in Al Jazeera, the new IRGC vessel would be a possible answer for Iran to approach its enemies' territory including Israel.

Court orders seizure of 20 million shekels from PA over terror mu...	Jerusalem court grants request by parents of Rina Shnerb, who was murdered in a terrorist attack at a spring in the Binyamin region which seriously injured her father and brother; 'We will take the money that was meant for terror and use it to spread goodness in the world' family says The Jerusalem District Court has granted a request by the parents of Rina Shnerb, who was murdered in a terrorist attack at the age of 16, issuing a temporary order to seize 20 million shekels ($5.4 million) from Palestinian Authority funds held by the Israeli government. The attack occurred in August 2019 while the Shnerb family was on a hike near the Ein Bubin spring in the Binyamin region. According to the court petition, filed by Rina’s parents, Shira and Rabbi Eitan Shnerb, their eldest son, Dvir — who is also one of the plaintiffs — was seriously wounded in the attack, as was the father. Both sustained permanent disabilities as a result. The family's attorney, Asher Stub, stated in the petition to the court that the father and his two children arrived at the spring late Friday morning when a terrorist detonated an explosive device that had been planted along the access trail. The attacker, who had been watching them approach, set off the bomb as they stepped onto the path. Rina was killed instantly, while her father and brother were seriously injured. The lawsuit is based on the Victims of Terror Compensation Law, which took effect in June 2024. The law grants exemplary damages of 10 million shekels ($2.7 million) to the heirs of an individual killed in a terrorist attack and 5 million shekels ($1.35 million) to a victim who suffers permanent disability. The plaintiffs are seeking 20 million shekels in total from the Palestinian Authority, alleging it funds and legitimizes terrorism. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'This lawsuit was filed under the Victims of Terror Compensation Law, which we initiated last year,' said attorney Stub, founder of the organization Justice for Terror Victims, which represents the Shnerb family. 'It is part of a series of lawsuits we have filed to halt the flow of money to terrorists and instead direct those funds to those who truly need them—the victims of terror.' Rina’s parents, Eitan and Shira Shnerb, emphasized in a statement their commitment to turning tragedy into positive action. 'They came to kill and destroy. We will take the money that was meant for terror and use it for the exact opposite — to spread goodness, to do endless acts of kindness,' they said. 'We always choose to focus on the good and to uplift the spirit of the people of Israel. The legal process forces us to confront the darkness, but the support of the Justice for Terror Victims legal team allows us to entrust them with this fight while we focus on bringing light to the world. We want other families and survivors to know they, too, can take legal action and join the fight against funding terror,' they added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjb0fjgkyg	2025-02-06T00:13:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/08/23/9439465/9439465_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg

IDF ordered to prepare plan to allow Gazans to leave voluntarily	After Netanyahu expressed enthusiastic support for the Trump initiative, Defense Minister Israel Katz called it 'bold' and ordered the IDF to prepare a plan for Gazan's departure via sea and air; He said countries such as Spain, Ireland and Norway are obligated to allow Gazans to immigrate to them after their accusations against Israel: 'If they refuse, their hypocrisy will be exposed' After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed enthusiastic support for U.S. President Donald Trump's Gaza initiative, Defense Minister Israeli Katz on Thursday morning instructed the IDF 'to prepare a plan to allow voluntary departure for Gaza residents, including special arrangements for exit by sea and air,' although Israel has not yet officially adopted any such plan. 'I welcome U.S. President Trump's bold plan, which could allow a large population in Gaza to leave for various places in the world,' said Katz. 'Hamas used Gaza residents as human shields and built terror infrastructure in the heart of the population, and is now holding them hostage, extorting money from them by use of humanitarian aid, and preventing them from leaving Gaza.' 'I have instructed the IDF to prepare a plan that will allow any resident of Gaza who is interested to leave to any place in the world that agrees to accept them.' The Defense Ministry's Counter-Terrorism Unit is supposed to be responsible for this, but Katz turned his attention to the IDF and said that the plan he wanted to prepare should include 'exit options at land crossings as well as special arrangements for exit by sea and air.' Katz even detailed a list of countries that he claims are obligated to allow Gazans to immigrate to them: 'Countries like Spain, Ireland, Norway and others, which have made false accusations and plots against Israel due to its activities in Gaza, are obligated by law to allow every Gazan resident to enter their territory - and their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse to do so. There are countries like Canada, which has a regulated immigration program, that have expressed a desire in the past to absorb residents from Gaza. Gazans should be allowed to enjoy freedom of exit and immigration as is customary everywhere in the world.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Katz, 'U.S. President Trump's bold plan can create extensive possibilities for the departure of a population from Gaza who is interested in doing so, and also help them be optimally absorbed in the target countries, as well as enable the advancement of reconstruction plans in a demilitarized and threat-free Gaza in the post-Hamas era, which will last for many years.' During the press conference that Trump held with Netanyahu a little over a day ago, the U.S. president said: 'We'll take over Gaza, flatten it. We'll clear out bombs and destroyed houses, that's a great idea.' During the statement, Trump also reiterated his intention to complete the entire hostage deal, and threatened Hamas: 'If all the hostages are not released, we will be more violent.' Trump added that 'the Gaza Strip has been a source of destruction and so bad for the people, the lives of the residents there are miserable. They need to go to other places. There are many of them who want to go from there. 1.8 million Gazans need to leave. The rich countries in the region need to finance it. They can go to one area, or seven or 12. We will ensure that something amazing is done. We will have peace and they will not shoot, kill and destroy.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjk0fc11fyg	2025-02-05T22:06:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/H1Y8A8CI1e/H1Y8A8CI1e_0_132_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Bill includes minimum jail sentences between 12 months for less serious hate crimes, such as giving a Nazi salute in public, and six years for those found guilty of terrorism offences Australia passed tough anti-hate crime laws on Thursday, including mandatory minimum sentences for terror offences and displaying hate symbols, in a bid to tackle a recent surge in antisemitism. The laws will impose minimum jail sentences between 12 months for less serious hate crimes, such as giving a Nazi salute in public, and six years for those found guilty of terrorism offences. 'I want people who are engaged in antisemitism to be held to account, to be charged, to be incarcerated,' Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who had initially opposed mandatory minimum sentences for hate crimes, told Sky News. The government’s hate crimes bill was first introduced to parliament last year, creating new offences for threatening force or violence against people based on their race, religion, nationality, national or ethnic origin, political opinion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. Recent months have seen an escalation of attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars of Jewish community members across the country, including the discovery of a caravan laden with explosives with a list of Jewish targets in Sydney. Albanese has been criticised by the centre-right opposition party for being weak on crime and failing to address the rise in antisemitism.

Here's how heritage sites play a role in October 7 recovery	Shahar Hermelin, spokesperson for SPIHS, joined ILTV in the studio on Wednesday to discuss the organization's work to ensure that Israel’s rich history remains accessible As Israel continues to face the impact of ongoing conflict, it’s critical to support not only the immediate needs of its people but also the deep-rooted connection to the history and pioneering spirit that have shaped the nation. Two organizations at the forefront of this effort are Jewish National Fund-USA and the Society for Preservation of Israel Heritage Sites (SPIHS), whose work is more essential now than ever. In addition to providing vital mental wellness programs for displaced families, they are also ensuring that Israel’s rich history remains accessible through engaging activities that strengthen resilience and the Zionist spirit. Shahar Hermelin, spokesperson for SPIHS, joined ILTV in the studio on Wednesday. ILTV: Can you tell us more about the 'We Come to You' program and how these heritage-based activities are helping displaced families? Hermelin: It started a few days into the war. We were forced to shut down all 200+ heritage sites we oversee. And in addition, we knew we had to do something to help hundreds of thousands of displaced brothers and sisters. So, because we couldn’t bring them to heritage sites at that point, we started sending our education teams and volunteers from closed sites to conduct activities at more than 50 evacuation centers across the country. The first organization that stepped up to help us was Jewish National Fund-USA. We've been working together for over 25 years, and we brought all kinds of lectures, games, and activities to the evacuation centers—engaging both kids and adults. It gave them a chance to take their minds off their situation while also learning about our heritage and history. ILTV: SPIHS is offering free guided tours at over 200 heritage sites to those most affected by the war. How do these tours go beyond simply teaching history, and what role do they play in bolstering national resilience? Hermelin: We are bringing many groups to heritage sites, and now, it's not just a history lesson. Ever since October 7, we’ve seen a much stronger connection to our history and heritage. People want to understand what their parents and grandparents went through to bring us to where we are today. We hear it from many visitors—after the tour, they come up to us and say, 'We get it now. We understand.' There is a powerful connection between the hardships endured during the War of Independence and what so many people—especially in the south—experienced on October 7. ILTV: How are you planning to renovate and preserve the heritage sites damaged in the war and update the displays to include a chapter about the heroics of October 7? Hermelin: Quite a few heritage sites, both in the south and north, were physically damaged during the war—either due to direct rocket hits or other destruction. First, we need to renovate or rebuild those buildings, and again, we’re doing it together with Jewish National Fund-USA as part of their 'Build Together' master plan. In addition, a new chapter needs to be told. The connection between the War of Independence and the events of October 7 is undeniable. Sites that once told only the story of the War of Independence must now also share the story of how communities once again had to defend themselves and their families. We will achieve this through modern exhibitions, photos, videos, and any available materials to accurately tell this new chapter in Israel’s history.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skjfd0wkyg	2025-02-05T21:36:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/BkDVd011Yye/BkDVd011Yye_0_2_455_257_0_small.jpg

Israelis react to Trump's Gaza plan	What would this actually entail? How would it impact Israelis? These are the pressing questions on people's minds Israelis woke up on Wednesday to U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest remarks about Gaza, in which he suggested that the United States should not only take over the territory but own the land inside Gaza. He even floated the idea of transforming it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' His comments have sparked widespread debate, prompting Israelis to consider what such a plan could mean for their future and the future of Gaza. What would this actually entail? How would it impact Israelis? These are the pressing questions on people's minds, with some critics calling Trump's proposal 'outlandish' or 'unrealistic.' Public Reactions Here’s what some had to say: 'If I understand Trump correctly, Gaza may become a new Miami Beach,' said Tel Aviv resident Mark Malavsky. 'If he can get any of these other countries to take these Gazan refugees and let them go someplace else, problem solved.' Tony Abrams took a different view, suggesting Trump’s approach could yield results. 'The end result is peace, one way or another,' he said. 'He's not like people in the past. Perhaps his ideas will bear some fruit. I mean, he's an extreme man, but he seems a lot more measured than he was last time—more organized and ready for this. So perhaps he's got a plan.' Others strongly opposed the idea. David Finn argued that it could harm Israel and complicate hostage negotiations. 'I'm not in favor of it at all,' he said. 'I think it would be bad for Israel … [and] unhelpful for the release of the hostages because I think Hamas is less likely to go along with negotiations if it means they have to withdraw and then Trump would follow up with his plan.' It remains unclear whether Trump’s proposal will have any impact on the ongoing negotiations in Doha, where discussions continue over the second phase of a hostage-for-ceasefire deal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjvfqr11t1g	2025-02-05T21:19:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/S1A4EAbtke/S1A4EAbtke_43_0_644_362_0_small.jpg
Former ambassador: U.S. takeover of Gaza could be feasible	Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon says there were six million Syrian refugees and there are only two million Gazans It remains unclear whether U.S. President Donald Trump is serious about America taking control of Gaza or if this is merely a negotiating tactic, according to former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon. 'We have seen this method before,' Ayalon told ILTV, referring to past negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and Panama. 'He sets a very high bar and then has much more room to maneuver and negotiate. This may be the case here, but quite frankly, if you take out the political argumentation or the political gist, it does make sense.' Ayalon explained that Gaza is essentially a demolition site, and Trump, with his extensive experience as a builder, understands how to handle large-scale reconstruction projects. He added that the U.S. could manage the effort, given its ability to bring in billions—if not tens of billions—of dollars, which could ultimately benefit the U.S. Treasury. 'This is out-of-the-box thinking, and we will see how it is received,' Ayalon said. So far, Arab countries and the Palestinians have rejected the plan. However, Ayalon noted that there is a significant stretch of empty land in Sinai, adjacent to Gaza. He also pointed out that six million Syrians left their country as refugees, whereas Gaza's population is only two million—suggesting that relocation should be feasible.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4lbcbfye	2025-02-05T21:08:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/HyB9svWWKkg/HyB9svWWKkg_0_180_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu says Trump plan to move Gazans '1st good idea I've hear...	Prime minister says Trump is Israel's greatest friend in the White House that has already done incredible things; says Israel single handedly changed the Middle East 'with some help from U.S.' but the arrival of Trump is a gamechanger Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday gave his full support for the idea proposed by U.S. President Trump to displace Palestinians from Gaza. 'I mean, what's wrong with that? They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back. But you have to rebuild Gaza,' In an interview with Fox News, Netanyahu said 'This is the first good idea that I've heard,' adding, 'It's a remarkable idea, and I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone.' He's the biggest friend Israel's ever had. Netanyahu said. 'Lood what he's done in the last few days. He's done remarkable things,' the prime minister said. 'He's released the ammunition we need to continue out march to victory, he's taken action against UNRWA and these other UN agencies that hate America and hate Israel, he's done enormous things and yes, he's the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.' Netanyahu said he did not think Trump meant to send troops into Gaza to destroy Hamas. 'That's our job, our commitment,' he said. Netanyahu was asked about the cease fire agreement with Hamas and the chances of all of the hostages being released and said that was one of the objectives of the war along with the elimination of Hamas's military power and ensuring Gaza can no longer pose a threat to Israel. He said not all of the military capability was destroyed, 'but we'll make sure that it is not there when this war ends. It can end very quickly,' he said. 'We're changing the Middle East,' he said 'It was basically an Iranian pawn,' he said adding Israel has single handedly changed the region with 'some help' from the U.S. but the arrival of Trump he said changed the equasion. On Iran Netanyahu said that there was no doubt that Iran was pursuing nuclear capability. He said most Arab countries have moved from regarding Israel as their greatest enemy to regarding Iran as such. 'But they recognize that Israel is the only country in the Middle East that fought Iran,' he said. 'In taking action against this we are not only doing it for our own survival but in the interest of many countries in the region and in the interest of the U.S. as well.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy870t11t1l	2025-02-05T21:05:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/SkgbH6WeYkx/SkgbH6WeYkx_0_0_3000_2002_0_small.jpg

After the destruction and the clashes, Hezbollah supporters 'quie...	After clashes with the IDF, Lebanon appears to have gotten the message, and now the residents of the southern villages are returning to their destroyed homes calmly and without provocation; Despite attempts to present a 'victory', Hezbollah brought destruction to the residents; A Lebanese woman recorded herself returning to the ruins, with crying heard in the background This is the second week that residents of southern Lebanon have been returning to their villages on the border, after months of being displaced by fighting. With the end of the first 60 days of the cease-fire, the return was initially accompanied by chaos, provocations and clashes with IDF forces, during which 24 Lebanese citizens were killed and 134 were wounded by gunfire, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. But now it seems that Lebanon has gotten the message, and in the past week things have looked different. The Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported Tuesday that the return of Lebanese civilians to villages in the south of the country last Sunday as part of what was they called the 'second Sunday of return,' passed peacefully, without clashes or deaths, unlike the previous week. This is reportedly due to an implicit agreement between Hezbollah, the Amal movement in Lebanon, and the municipalities in southern Lebanon to control the demonstrators in order to prevent bloodshed. Sources also told the newspaper that UNIFIL conveyed Israeli threats to the Lebanese, who wanted to avoid a repeat of the prior week's violent events. Lebanon closely monitors all IDF movements in the south of the country and consistently reports that it is still operating there, blowing up houses and flying drones in the country's skies. Al-Akhbar and the Al-Manar channel, which is also affiliated with Hezbollah, presented maps of the 'liberated' border villages to which the residents have returned and of the villages where the IDF is still operating. Although Hezbollah boasts about the return of residents of southern Lebanon, including its activists and supporters, and assures that the organization is still strong, the villages of the south have been completely destroyed. Despite attempts in Lebanon to present an image of 'victory' in documenting the return, Hezbollah brought destruction and devastation to the south of the country, destroying the villages it used as weapons depots, and operating and firing at Israel from those populated areas. Hezbollah also operated in other areas of Lebanon, such as Al-Baqa'a in the interior of the country and the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut, but the villages of the south were the main arena of fighting throughout the months of the war. The destruction and devastation in the area are visible every day in footage posted on social media. Alongside the residents' joy at their return, and the Hezbollah flags hoisted alongside pictures of the eliminated operatives, what can mainly be seen is the rubble. Residents of Al-Khaiam, north of Metula, for example, described in a video how they were organized in the field alongside a burning fire and food, but everything around them appears to be destroyed, and the Hezbollah flags placed on the rubble sharpen the question of who is to blame. One of the residents who returned to Al-Dahira in southern Lebanon photographed the ruins of the village, while walking among the fragments of collapsed houses, and said: 'Be careful where you step,' as the sounds of residents crying can be heard in the background. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hezbollah suffered significant damage during the war. Its warehouses, infrastructure and weapons were destroyed, its top leadership was eliminated, smuggling routes from Syria were blocked, especially after the overthrow of the Assad regime, and it appears that the organization is in need of extensive reconstruction – both internal and external. The Shiite terrorist organization also needs a lot of financial resources for the assistance it provides to the affected families. Behind the cries of joy of the residents of southern Lebanon these days and the entry into the villages together with the local army, lies great distress. Along with this, it is important to remember that the organization and its surroundings make it clear that they will rebuild everything on the border, and that they have not abandoned their path. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk11p7pbk1l	2025-02-05T13:51:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/S1M2TnXdye/S1M2TnXdye_0_347_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
US requested extradition of hacker who served his time in Israeli...	In 2021, Washington opposed the early release of the 'Ashkelon hacker' but agreed with Israel that he would serve his sentence there; Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s recent extradition request contradicts that agreement Despite a prior understanding, former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently requested the extradition of an Israeli citizen known as the 'Ashkelon hacker' after he was released from prison in Israel and later arrested in Oslo at Washington’s request. An internal document from U.S. prosecutors reveals that as early as 2021, Washington and Jerusalem had agreed that the hacker, now 25, would serve his sentence in Israel for crimes he committed when he was a minor. According to the document, U.S. authorities had opposed his early release but never requested or even considered his extradition without his attorney being informed of the agreement. The hacker, who made hoax bomb threats against Jewish community centers in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Israel ,as well as against several airlines, served seven years in an Israeli prison. The extradition request — particularly coming directly from Blinken – is unprecedented. The newly revealed document corroborates the claim by his attorney, Nir Yaslovitzh, that his client has already served his full sentence and that there is no legal justification for extradition. At this stage, Israeli prosecutors have refused to intervene or assist in securing his release from detention in Norway. The hacker, who has high-functioning autism and a brain tumor, has reportedly suffered a severe mental health decline after more than three months in custody. A letter he personally submitted to a Norwegian court raises concerns about his sanity. Meanwhile, a diplomatic cable from Israel’s Foreign Ministry to its counterpart in Oslo warns of serious risks to his life and well-being. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: These fears are compounded by the fact that he attempted suicide multiple times while incarcerated in Israel. His father and attorney have also criticized Israeli officials for failing to arrange a consular visit. Although the hacker signed a waiver declining such a visit, his family and lawyer argue that his fragile mental state should invalidate that decision. 'His life is in danger,' they stated. Attorney Nir Yaslovitzh condemned the Israeli prosecution's lack of action, saying that it 'is shameful that the International Department refuses to assist my client, even though the U.S. has pursued his extradition arbitrarily and outrageously. A formal document, sent in real-time to Israeli prosecutors, confirms that the U.S. agreed he would serve his sentence solely in Israel — yet nothing has been done to save him.' The case of the Ashkelon hacker first made headlines in 2017 when the FBI issued an unusual request to Israel’s cybercrime unit. Investigators alleged that an Israeli citizen had used false identities and hacked into computer systems at U.S. institutions — including airports, hospitals, and Jewish community centers — to make thousands of fake bomb threats. Some of his threats were so credible that planes were rerouted. Now, years after serving his time, his fate remains uncertain as legal and diplomatic battles continue over his extradition. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkbi6bbykl	2025-02-05T13:15:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/11/22/8898050/8898050_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg
Watch: Israel experiments with new drone interception systems	Nine Israeli defense companies conducted a test of prototype UAV interception systems in southern Israel, addressing the growing drone threat in the ongoing war; 'We will introduce new capabilities to the battlefield in the near future' Defense Minister Katz says Nine Israeli defense companies, including Elbit Systems, Rafael and Israel Aerospace Industries, conducted a live demonstration of drone interception technologies in southern Israel. The drill on Tuesday marked the culmination of a weeklong series of tests led by the Defense Ministry, aimed at evaluating Israel’s ability to counter the growing UAV threat – one that has particularly endangered northern communities in the current war. As part of the competition-style event, defense firms deployed prototype interception systems developed under the guidance of the Defense Ministry’s Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D). The systems were tested against UAVs of varying speeds, altitudes, and ranges. The ministry plans to fast-track select technologies for development and production, with the goal of deploying new operational capabilities in the near future. The closing event was attended by Defense Minister Israel Katz, and other senior officials. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The UAV threat is evolving across multiple fronts, driven by Iran and its proxies,' Katz said. 'This threat has already taken a heavy toll in lives, and we are fully committed to developing an effective response. Everyone involved understands that defending Israel’s skies is a top priority. We are determined to push forward and introduce new interception capabilities to the battlefield in the near future.' Brig. Gen. (Res.) Dr. Danny Gold emphasized that the Defense Ministry is focused on developing a cost-effective, multi-layered UAV defense system. 'Just as we have successfully built higher-tier missile defense solutions, we are now finalizing a comprehensive, robust, and affordable response to UAV threats,' he said. Maj. Gen. Harel added, 'This demonstration highlighted the importance of advancing technological efforts to enhance Israel’s defense capabilities. In the coming months, we will integrate the most effective solutions into IDF operations.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/symil4wtje	2025-02-05T13:06:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/BJNY3neWYJx/BJNY3neWYJx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

The Gazan journalist was hired by the network through an external production company to cover activities of the UN's mine clearance service and posted photos of himself with UN officials, sparking a diplomatic incident the UN and Israel, which accused the service of having ties to Hamas; Sky News said that when his problematic past became known, it severed ties with him and the external production company A Gazan journalist affiliated with Hamas, who documented the attack on October 7, was employed by the British Sky News network, sparking a diplomatic incident between Israel and UN peacekeeping forces. The journalist was hired as a photographer for an article about the activities of the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), and he posed for photos with its staff and uploaded the photos to social media. As a result, the Israeli embassy in Washington accused the UN body responsible for mine action of having ties to Hamas. Israeli officials called the event a 'serious scandal' and said that the incident proves once again that UN bodies employ people identified with terrorism. However, Ynet has learned that the journalist is not part of the UN team, but was working for Sky News and was sent to prepare an article about the mine clearance department following the appointment of Luke Irving as the new head of the mine clearance unit in the Palestinian territories. Irving's team is responsible for clearing explosive remnants from the war, to allow Palestinian refugees to return to their homes in Gaza. The network sent an independent camera crew that went with Irving and his team on a tour and interviews in the field. The article appeared on Sky on February 2. The team was unaware of the journalist's background and his ties to Hamas. A spokesman for the UN peacekeeping forces said that 'UNMAS has never had or has had any contact with this individual, and was not provided with any information about him before he came to film for Sky News. He is not an employee of UNMAS.' In a letter sent in recent days by Sky News to the UN and obtained by Ynet, the network apologized and admitted that he had been hired through an external production company. After his problematic past and ties to Hamas became known, contact with him and the production company that employed him was immediately terminated. The network added that they decided not to use the materials filmed by him as part of the article. 'This individual was booked as a camera operator by a third-party production company and was not known to Sky News,' a Sky News spokesperson told Ynet. 'When we were made aware that questions exist about the individual’s impartiality and alleged connections, we immediately made the decision not to air any of the content produced. We have now ended our relationship with the production company.' 'We are reviewing the relevant processes in Gaza and that work is underway internally,' the spokesperson told Ynet.

Israel claims that this is a recurring pattern in which news networks employ media personnel affiliated with Hamas without thoroughly checking their backgrounds. On the other hand, international media outlets claim that working in Gaza requires reliance on local freelancers, due to the difficulty of sending foreign teams to the region. Beyond the media implications, the incident led to further diplomatic tensions between Israel and the UN. In Israel, pressure was exerted on UNMAS to issue a public clarification on the issue and demanded that the organization conduct more rigorous background checks on media personnel who work with it. The Mine Action Service says that they had no knowledge or ability to obtain prior information about the past of employees of another body. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjhwqrztke	2025-02-05T12:15:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/11/S1eX1lOT00a/S1eX1lOT00a_0_94_1300_732_0_small.jpg

'This doesn't mean troops in Gaza, this means that Trump, who is the best dealmaker in the universe, is going to close a deal with our partners in the region,' she said. When asked if she completely ruled out the entry of American troops into Gaza, she replied: 'I am saying that the president has not committed to that just yet. He has not made that commitment.'

'The president has not committed to it, yet. The president has been thinking about it for a while, it is not a decision he makes lightly. He has already spoken with al-Sisi, he is meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan next week, and he was very clear that he expects them to accept Palestinian refugees temporarily so that we can build their home.

Ukraine's Zelensky: U.S. military aid not cut, no talks on new pa...	Ukraine continues to receive military aid from the U.S., but there's no discussion currently about any prospective packages, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday. 'There's no reduction in U.S. support today. It is not stopped, it continues,' he told reporters in Kyiv after a meeting with British foreign minister David Lammy. Washington has been one of the biggest suppliers of military aid to Kyiv since the start of the Russian full-scale invasion almost three years ago. But re-elected President Donald Trump has regularly criticized the extent of U.S. help provided to Kyiv. Reuters sources said that U.S. shipments of weapons into Ukraine were briefly paused recently before resuming over the last weekend. Zelensky said it was 'too early' for discussion on new batches of military assistance to take place. Asked about Ukraine's ability to fight without American aid, Zelensky said cutting supplies would hit hard on the country's defense capabilities. 'We will be weaker, and whether we would hold (the land) - I'm not sure,' he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjn3tqwtyl	2025-02-05T09:12:01-08:00

Israel withdraws from UN Human Rights Council, joining US	A day after the US left the international body, Foreign Minister Saar announces that Israel will not participate in the deliberations of the UN Human Rights Council - where it was an observer and not a member; This body 'has traditionally protected human rights abusers by allowing them to hide from scrutiny, and instead obsessively demonizes the one democracy in the Middle East - Israel' he explained.

Israel joins the United States and will not participate in the UNHRC. 'The UNHRC has traditionally protected human rights abusers by allowing them to hide from scrutiny, and instead obsessively demonizes the one democracy in the Middle East - Israel. 'This body has focused on attacking a democratic country and propagating antisemitism, instead of promoting human rights. 'The discrimination against us is clear: 'In the UNHRC, Israel is the only country with an agenda item dedicated solely to it.

Prosecutor prepares new indictment for Istanbul mayor over critic...	Turkish prosecutors have issued a third indictment against Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu - a potential challenger to President Tayyip Erdogan - for remarks criticizing the city's prosecutor, according to the indictment and local media. The indictment, which seeks to jail Imamoglu and ban him from politics, follows his portrayal of earlier cases against him as part of a campaign of judicial harassment of opposition figures, something Erdogan's government denies. This time, prosecutors requested he be sentenced for threatening and insulting a public official, as well as targeting people involved in the fight against terrorism, the indictment, seen by Reuters, said. Imamoglu said the latest indictment, which seeks to jail him for seven years and four months, showed Erdogan did not have the courage to stand in front of voters in elections. Imamoglu also said Erdogan believed he would 'remain standing through desk-bound games'. Opposition politicians have faced a series of legal challenges in Turkey, where rights groups say judicial independence has eroded under Erdogan's two-decade rule.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhv00fwyyg	2025-02-05T07:59:34-08:00

Israeli professor resigns from Columbia University due to 'anti-I...	Professor Avi Friedman resigned in protest of the institution’s decisions, including the appointment of a pro-Hamas professor to teach a course on Zionism; 'I can no longer be associated with this institution,' Friedman says; The Palestinian professor in question has openly praised Hamas and described the October 7 massacre as 'stunning' and 'impressive' A prominent Israeli-American professor at Columbia University’s Business School has resigned, citing what he described as a 'systematic anti-Israel atmosphere' on campus. In his resignation letter to the university administration, Professor Avi Friedman said his decision stemmed from the university’s handling of events following the October 7 Hamas attack and its appointment of Professor Joseph Massad – who previously described the Hamas assault as 'an impressive achievement' – to teach a course on Zionism. Friedman clarified in an interview with Ynet that the business school itself 'was fine,' but that he took issue with the university’s broader decisions. 'The university has gone out of its way to make bad decisions. Unfortunately, I don’t see how things will change without government intervention. Maybe now, something will start shifting. I hope so,' he said. Friedman is not the first to protest Massad’s appointment. Before him, Professor Lawrence Rosenblatt, a former international relations lecturer at Columbia, also resigned in response to the course’s launch. 'Columbia has a responsibility to teach in an objective and fair manner,' Rosenblatt said. 'It is inconceivable that someone who supports genocide should be allowed to teach such a course. Columbia has lost not only its moral compass but also its intellectual integrity. I cannot remain.' Massad, a longtime professor of Middle Eastern studies at Columbia, has been a controversial figure for years due to his fierce opposition to Israel and Zionism. Born in Jordan to a Palestinian family, he has taught at Columbia since the 1990s, focusing on Arab world politics, Palestinian nationalism and Zionist thought. He has repeatedly argued that Zionism is a 'colonialist movement' and that Israel is an 'apartheid state.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His writings and lectures have drawn criticism from Jewish organizations, members of Congress, and fellow academics. However, Columbia has never taken disciplinary action against him. The latest uproar surrounding Massad erupted following his response to the October 7 Hamas attack. In an article for a pro-Palestinian publication, he praised Hamas for its 'remarkable achievements,' calling the assault 'stunning,' 'impressive' and 'wonderful.' Shortly after, Columbia assigned him to teach a course on Zionism — a decision widely perceived as a provocation against Jewish and Israeli students. Backlash and university response The move sparked outrage from Jewish faculty, alumni and donors, with some threatening to withdraw financial support. A group of pro-Israel Columbia alumni published an open letter to the administration, stating: 'This appointment is like assigning a white supremacist to teach a course on civil rights. How can we be expected to learn about Zionism from someone who does not recognize Israel’s legitimacy?' Despite public pressure, Columbia refused to revoke Massad’s appointment, citing the importance of protecting academic freedom. The university declined to comment when contacted about either Massad’s appointment or Friedman’s resignation, instead referring to a December statement: 'Professor Massad’s statements following the terrorist attack on October 7 created pain for many in our community and contributed to the deep controversy on our campus. We have consistently condemned any celebration or promotion of violence or terror. We remain committed to principles of free expression and the open exchange of viewpoints and perspectives through opportunities for constructive dialogue and understanding throughout our campus community, and we seek to provide a learning environment and classrooms that promote intellectual inquiry and analytical thinking along with civility, tolerance, and respect. Professor Massad’s class is one of three courses Columbia students can elect to take next semester on the subject of Zionism and the history of Israel, two of which are offered through Columbia’s Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies. Professor Massad's class is limited to 60 students and is not a required course.' In his resignation letter, Friedman criticized the university’s response, calling it 'insufficient and disingenuous.' He wrote: 'Massad’s comments were not offhand remarks that ‘caused pain for many in our community and contributed to deep divisions.’ They reflect his consistent worldview, which he continues to promote through interviews, podcasts, and articles.' Friedman concluded: 'The university’s values do not align with mine. I can no longer be associated with this institution.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjv11ewbtkl	2025-02-05T07:38:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/H1e6Dpa1Kyx/H1e6Dpa1Kyx_0_0_888_500_0_small.jpg
Trump envoy issues unusual threat to Iraqi PM demanding release o...	The US president's envoy for hostage affairs has issued an implicit threat to the Iraqi prime minister, calling for the release of the Israeli woman kidnapped in his country. 'Either he is incapable, or he is an accomplice in the kidnapping,' Adam Buehler said U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Buehler, called on Wednesday for the immediate release of the Israeli woman kidnapped in Iraq, Elizabeth Tsurkov. On behalf of the U.S. president, Buehler threatened Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani. 'If she doesn't come home, he is an accomplice,' he said. Buehler said that 'Elizabeth Tsurkov is a Princeton University student who is being held hostage in Iraq. The Iraqi prime minister consistently made false promises to the previous administration about her release, but now President Trump is on it. If Tsurkov doesn't come home now - either the Iraqi prime minister is unable to return her, then he should be fired, or he is complicit in this (kidnapping). Bring Elizabeth Tsurkov home now!' The coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen (res.) Gal Hirsch, met with Buehler in Washington on Tuesday night. The two discussed, among other things, the Gaza hostage deal. After the meeting, Hirsch posted on the X network that 'in the meeting we discussed the hostage deal and ways to return all of our hostages, both living and dead.' Tsurkov, 36, is an Israeli national with Russian citizenship who had been living in the United States while pursuing a Ph.D. at Princeton University. She was abducted in Baghdad on March 26, 2023, during a research trip. While Kataib Hezbollah is widely believed to be holding her, the militia has denied involvement in her abduction. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last week, the Amwaj website, a British website that covers events in Iran and Iraq, reported that a proposal for a deal had been made in which Israel would release Hezbollah terrorists and a Lebanese ship captain who the IDF said was a senior member of the terrorist organization in exchange for the release of Tsurkov. Three Iraqi sources close to the pro-Iranian militias in the country later denied the reports, claiming: 'There are no channels with the Israeli enemy.' They also claimed that they first heard about it through the media. The sources also denied previous reports that the Iraqi government was working to free her.

Qatar says it is too early to talk about Palestinian displacement	Qatar, a mediator in Gaza cease-fire talks, said on Wednesday it was too early to talk about the resettlement of Palestinians from the enclave and Doha was busy trying to bring about the second phase of a deal to halt the war between Israel and Hamas. Asked by Fox News if Trump's proposal for a U.S. takeover of Gaza would help or hurt the ceasefire talks, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari said: 'I don't think it's a time now to start commenting on specific ideas.

Evacuation of Greece's Santorini island continues as tremors pers...	Hundreds more people were expected to leave Greece's Santorini island on Wednesday as tremors shook the popular summer tourist destination for a sixth day. About 10,000 people have left on ferries and planes in recent days as hundreds of small quakes were registered in the surrounding sea, shaking buildings, kicking up dust on the island's rocky cliffs, and raising fears of a major earthquake. Authorities have introduced safety measures, including halting construction, shutting schools on Santorini and the nearby islands of Ios, Amorgos and Anafi, and ordering residents and hotels to empty their pools to reduce the burden on the ground. Government officials and seismologists who met on Wednesday to assess the situation pointed to a high risk of landslides, including near the island's main port Athinios which serves some 1.5 million passengers a year. Local authorities have restricted access to some high risk areas, while first responders, vessels and a helicopter were on alert in case of emergency. Seismologists estimate that the high seismic activity could take days or weeks to abate, although locals and government officials said the shaking had lessened on Wednesday	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkyhvbzy1e	2025-02-05T06:46:49-08:00

Eli Albag drove the car down the street slowly, and mother Shira, who was sitting next to Liri in the back, waved her hands. 'Thank you very much, everyone, you are amazing citizens,' said Eli. 'We have all been waiting for this moment, I love you very much. You have given me a lot of strength. Liri is home and that is the most important thing, but there is still a long way to go.'

The Palestinian people will never abandon their land': Palestini...	Palestinian leaders reject Trump’s Gaza evacuation plan as 'violation of international law' and attack on sovereignty; Egypt opposes move, ramping up reconstruction to prevent displacement, while Hamas warns it will further destabilize the region Palestinian leaders reacted with shock Wednesday to U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to evacuate Gaza’s population, rejecting the plan as an unacceptable violation of Palestinian rights. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 'categorically rejected calls for the takeover of Gaza and the forced displacement of Palestinians,' vowing that 'the Palestinian people will never abandon their land—Gaza is an inseparable part of it.' Abbas called Trump’s remarks 'a grave breach of international law' and reiterated that peace and stability in the region would not be possible 'without the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders.' A statement from Abbas’ office reaffirmed appreciation for 'the firm and consistent Arab positions against displacement and annexation' and emphasized that the creation of a Palestinian state remains 'a fundamental requirement for peace in the region.' Abbas traveled to Jordan on Thursday to discuss with King Abdullah ways to 'block Trump’s proposal.' Hussein al-Sheikh, Secretary-General of the PLO Executive Committee, echoed Abbas’ stance, saying 'a two-state solution under international legitimacy and law is the only path to security, stability and peace.' He dismissed any plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza, adding, 'We were born here, we have lived here and we reject all attempts to uproot us.' Hamas also strongly condemned Trump’s statements, calling them an attempt to 'occupy Gaza and expel its people.' A Hamas spokesperson said the remarks were 'hostile to the Palestinian cause and would only inflame the region.' Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri warned that Trump’s claim that Gazans 'have no choice but to leave' was 'a recipe for chaos in the Middle East.' Another senior Hamas figure, Izzat al-Rishq, vowed that Palestinians would resist any forced displacement, s, 'Oayingur people in Gaza have thwarted expulsion plans under bombardment for over 15 months. They are rooted in their land and will not allow any plan to remove them.' Israeli Arab lawmakers also denounced Trump’s proposal. MK Mansour Abbas of the United Arab List (Ra'am) dismissed it as 'not a policy but a racist fantasy that normalizes the unacceptable.' He warned, 'Forced transfer cannot happen without war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: MK Ahmad Tibi called Trump’s remarks 'dangerous delusions,' adding, 'Palestinians will remain in their homeland. Trump, like every president, will not remain in the White House forever.' Egypt, one of the strongest opponents of Trump’s plan, has been working to counter it by accelerating Gaza’s reconstruction. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel Ati met with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on Wednesday, urging 'fast-tracked humanitarian aid, debris removal and rehabilitation efforts—without displacing Palestinians from Gaza.' Abdel Ati reaffirmed Egypt’s full support for the Palestinian government and stressed the need to 'strengthen the Palestinian Authority politically and economically.' During a visit to Turkey, he and his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan called for intensified international efforts to 'ease suffering in Gaza while ensuring Palestinians remain on their land.' A weekend meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Egypt ended with a joint statement emphasizing 'rebuilding Gaza in a way that ensures Palestinians remain on their land.' The ministers declared, 'Palestinian displacement is rejected—under any circumstances.' Egypt has consistently opposed any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, citing security, economic and political concerns. Cairo fears that an influx of Palestinians into Sinai could pose a national security risk, particularly by allowing armed elements to infiltrate its territory. Additionally, Egypt’s struggling economy makes absorbing a large refugee population unsustainable. Despite this opposition, over 100,000 Palestinians have already entered Egypt since the start of the war. 'Trump can pave the sea' Many in Gaza have reacted coolly to Trump’s proposal, with some blaming Hamas for creating the conditions that led to the plan being discussed. Mustafa Ibrahim, a Palestinian writer from Gaza whose home was destroyed in the war, dismissed Trump’s idea outright. 'Far from Trump’s slogans and threats—he doesn’t recognize the Palestinian people or the injustices they have endured since 1967. But we are staying here. The people of Gaza will not leave,' he said. 'Trump can pave the sea if he wants—that’s all he has.' Dr. Samith Shataat, a school principal from Khan Younis, questioned Trump’s thinking. 'We can no longer understand this man’s personality,' he said. 'He thinks outside the box, sometimes too far. His ideas feel like pure fantasy—either dreams or explosions. All he sees is money, real estate, investments, stocks and markets. It’s time for us Arabs, especially Palestinians, to think carefully about how to confront this imminent danger. We must wake up before it’s too late.' Meanwhile, a Gazan now living in Europe—who fled after surviving an assassination attempt by Hamas due to his opposition to the group—suggested that Trump’s plan could work under certain conditions. 'If the Trump administration and Israel, along with countries like Belgium, Cyprus and Turkey—where there are large Palestinian communities—facilitate family reunifications, it could immediately remove nearly 300,000 people from Gaza,' he said. Prominent Gazan social media influencer Mohammed Al-Attar criticized Hamas for its role in the crisis. 'We were thinking about post-war reconstruction, and now we’re facing total displacement,' he said. 'Whoever drowned us in this ‘flood’ must be the one to pull us out of it—even if they sink themselves,' he added to the Hamas-given name to the October 7 attack—'al-Aqsa Flood.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkuhqkbkjl	2025-02-05T04:26:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/HkAKhngY1l/HkAKhngY1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Why the world can’t ignore Iran’s nuclear ambitions any longer	Avi Mayer: ‘I think it is certainly possible that they're going to fast-track a path to some kind of crude nuclear weapon’ The world should take seriously the possibility that Iran is fast-tracking the development of a crude nuclear weapon, which could give the regime leverage against the West, said Avi Mayer, former editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post and a regular Middle East analyst. Mayer told the ILTV News Podcast, 'I don't know that Iran has ever felt as cornered as it does now. Its proxy army has been decimated. Almost all of its proxies have been smashed to smithereens. It still has the Houthis, but they are relatively weak compared to the others. So, I wouldn't put it past them to say we need leverage, we need a strategic advantage, and that can only come in the form of a nuclear weapon.' His remarks came on the same day a report emerged indicating that U.S. officials believe Iran is accelerating its nuclear program, aiming to develop a weapon 'faster,' albeit in a 'cruder' form. 'I don't take those reports lightly,' Mayer said. 'I think it is certainly possible that they're going to fast-track a path to some kind of crude nuclear weapon to be able to say, ‘We are still a player to be reckoned with, and you have to take us seriously.’' While some analysts argue that the Iranian regime is more rational than it appears and that its threats are merely rhetorical, Mayer warned against underestimating the seriousness of Tehran’s ambitions. 'Whether or not they intend to use it, I have to assume that they will,' he said. 'We have to prevent them from reaching that capability.' Watch previous ILTV News Podcast episodes: MK Amit Halevi: Hostage deal will rehabilitate Nazi monster Hamas This country is the world's least antisemitic – can you guess where? Rising Antisemitism in the U.S. During the same discussion, Mayer also addressed the alarming rise in antisemitism, particularly in the United States. He noted that antisemitism surged during the first term of former U.S. President Donald Trump and has continued to escalate, particularly since the start of the October 7 war. 'Antisemitism tends to manifest itself at times of great polarization and, agree with him or disagree with him, that was one of the markings of President Trump's first term,' Mayer observed. 'It was a very polarizing period in American history, and I don't think that that is going to change in this term.' He added that antisemitic sentiments, which may have previously existed under the surface, have been emboldened in recent years. 'It has been given sort of a free rein,' he said. 'Now, with a 16-month war raging on seven fronts, many antisemites have used Israel’s response to October 7 and the war itself as a pretext to let their hate be more publicly known.' One of the most dangerous developments, Mayer stressed, is the growing politicization of antisemitism in the U.S. 'The worst thing that can happen in the fight against antisemitism is that it becomes a political issue,' he said. 'I think it should supersede politics. To the extent that Democrats, Republicans, and independents can come together to fight this scourge—not just in one another’s camps but in their own—that is absolutely critical.' Mayer expressed concern that both major political parties have failed to sufficiently address the issue within their ranks. 'I think we haven't seen enough of that,' he continued. 'It's very easy for Democrats to point at the Republican Party and say, ‘You have an antisemitism problem,’ and for Republicans to do the same to Democrats. I don't see nearly enough Republicans fighting antisemitism on their side of the political map, and I don't see nearly enough Democrats doing the same.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy4zhpxkke	2025-02-05T04:12:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/HJjDpzpOJg/HJjDpzpOJg_0_194_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Trump rejects Iran strike reports, pushes for new nuclear deal	Trump denies reports of US-Israel strike on Iran, saying he prefers 'verified nuclear peace agreement' to prevent nuclear arms while allowing Iran to prosper; despite pushing diplomacy, he reinstates tough sanctions, which Tehran calls failed policy U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday dismissed reports that Washington, in coordination with Israel, was planning a military strike on Iran, signaling instead his preference for a renewed nuclear agreement with Tehran. 'Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens, ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon... I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East! Trump’s comments follow his statement Tuesday that he was open to negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran and even willing to speak directly with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Such a move, if realized, would be highly unusual and reminiscent of the historic 2013 phone call between then-President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani—the first direct communication between U.S. and Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi responded Wednesday, saying Washington’s concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions were 'not complicated' and could be addressed. He reiterated Iran’s longstanding position that it does not seek nuclear weapons, pointing to the country’s membership in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and a fatwa issued by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei prohibiting nuclear weapons. Araghchi also criticized Trump’s decision to reinstate his 'maximum pressure' sanctions policy, arguing that it had already failed during Trump’s previous term. 'If this failed policy is pursued again, it is destined to fail once more,' he said. Despite signaling openness to diplomacy, Trump on Tuesday signed a presidential memorandum reinstating sweeping economic sanctions on Iran, aimed at crippling its economy and forcing Tehran to abandon any nuclear ambitions. The sanctions particularly target Iran’s oil revenues, a critical source of funding for the regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While signing the order, Trump acknowledged the severity of the measure, stating that he had deliberated extensively before reimposing the sanctions. Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani, when asked about Trump’s openness to talks with Pezeshkian, responded that Iran’s foreign policy has always been guided by 'principles of national honor, wisdom, and strategic interests.' Meanwhile, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Wednesday dismissed U.S. accusations that Tehran had plotted to assassinate Trump. Last year, U.S. security officials reported the arrests of several suspects allegedly linked to an Iranian plot targeting Trump. On Tuesday, Trump warned that he had instructed his team to 'destroy Iran' if such an attempt were successful. The Iranian spokesperson rejected the allegations as 'fabricated ideas spread by warmongers.' Israeli officials had been aware before Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump that the former U.S. president was hesitant to use military force against Iran, according to Israeli sources. Trump had repeatedly emphasized that he 'would not start new wars.' As a result, Israeli leaders focused their efforts on urging Trump to reinstate crippling sanctions on Tehran—a request he ultimately granted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1fkjaef1l	2025-02-05T03:45:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/B1ZxwpMeYyl/B1ZxwpMeYyl_0_68_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Settlers hail Trump’s Gaza plan as end of Palestinian statehood	US president's proposal to evacuate Gaza and promote Palestinian emigration embraced by settler leaders, who see it as a historic chance to advance Israeli sovereignty in West Bank The plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to empty Gaza of its residents and take control of the enclave was widely welcomed by right-wing politicians and local West Bank leaders. 'This is a rare moment for historic actions—to apply sovereignty in the West Bank,' said Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council. Yisrael Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council and chairman of the Yesha Council settler lobby, added: 'The Palestinian vision has come to an end.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and MK Itamar Ben-Gvir also quickly voiced their support. The settlers, for the most part, are less focused on the Gaza Strip itself and are instead setting their sights on what they consider a historic event—the application of Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank. Dagan argues that 'the new administration is acting strategically in the opposite way of the previous administration, and it will respect what the Israeli government defines as critical to Israel’s security.' 'I call on the prime minister: this is the time to apply sovereignty in the West Bank,' he further said. 'President Trump’s declaration is clear and exciting—both regarding the encouragement of emigration from Gaza and the strategic importance of the State of Israel. Such things have never been said in such a direct and transparent manner. The world is divided into two sides: good and evil, and Trump has chosen the right side of history.' Gantz also praised 'the great news that Trump is bringing to Israel and the entire world, standing alongside the Jewish people and its historic values.' He added, 'For the first time, a president is essentially declaring the end of the Palestinian dream to destroy Israel through Gaza or by establishing a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel. The Palestinian story, which aims to uproot the Jewish people from their land, is over.' 'The Israeli government must adopt Trump’s vision today and translate it into action,' he continued. 'Applying sovereignty over the West Bank is the necessary action now, completing Trump’s vision and turning it into reality. I urge Prime Minister Netanyahu to advance this immediately.' Shai Alon, head of the Beit El Council, also called on Netanyahu 'to promote immediate operational plans to apply sovereignty in the West Bank' and said, 'This is a moral obligation to the settlers, and it does not depend on other factors.' 'Residents of the West Bank are not second-class citizens in Israel,' he added. 'Their living conditions are no different than any other citizen in the country, and they cannot be treated as bargaining chips in such deals. Sovereignty over the West Bank should have been implemented 50 years ago and settlers should not have been left without equal status in Israel.' The heads of the Israel Lobby, MKs Yuli Edelstein, Limor Son Har-Melech and Simcha Rothman, said: 'President Trump once again proved his unwavering and courageous commitment to the Jewish people. His declaration is another significant step toward cutting off aspirations for a Palestinian terror state. The State of Israel has woken up this morning to a new and historic day.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also expressed his gratitude, saying: 'Then the nations said, ‘The Lord has done great things for them.’ The Lord has done great things for us; we were joyful.' In a post on his account on platform X, he quoted a popular Israeli song by Sasson Shaulov and wrote: 'And it will get better and better. Thank you, President Trump. Together, we will make the world great again.' Ben-Gvir took to social media to voice his support for Trump, writing, 'Donald, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' The Otzma Yehudit chief, who had resigned from the government following the hostage release deal, said that when he proposed encouraging the emigration of Palestinians, he was mocked. 'President Trump is saying very important things: the only solution for Gaza is encouraging the emigration of Gazans. When I repeatedly said during the war that this was the solution for Gaza, they mocked me.' He added, 'Now it’s clear—this is the only solution to the Gaza problem—this is the strategy for the 'day after.' I call on the prime minister to announce the adoption of the plan and begin advancing it immediately in a practical manner.' Later, Ben-Gvir told Galey Israel radio: 'I haven’t tailored a new ministerial suit yet, but there’s no doubt that the chances of Otzma Yehudit returning to the government have increased. The ball is now in the prime minister’s court. If he implements this plan, I’m fully on board. The moment steps are taken, and there’s intent to execute, I’m back. I don’t want to elaborate too much, but there are already plans in place.' Settlers now view the goal of sovereignty as their ultimate objective, alongside thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state by any means. With Trump’s entry into the White House, they outlined several objectives, including removing sanctions, significant leeway in settlement construction processes, sovereignty in the West Bank, and initiating settlement in northern Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1fhmteykl	2025-02-05T03:14:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/SylnchlYye/SylnchlYye_0_277_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

'Iran does not agree with any displacement of Palestinians and has communicated this through various channels. However, this issue and the path of Iran's nuclear agreement are two separate matters and should be pursued separately,' the official said.

Trump kept Gaza relocation plan tightly under wraps, report says	Wall Street Journal reports officials outside Trump’s inner circle were unaware of Gaza relocation plan before meeting with Netanyahu; him calling Gaza 'the Riviera of the Middle East' harks back to failed 2018 real estate pitch to North Korea U.S. President Donald Trump kept his sweeping Gaza relocation plan tightly under wraps, sharing it only with his closest advisers before unveiling it publicly, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. According to two senior administration officials, the proposal for full U.S. control of Gaza and the removal of its population was kept in 'absolute secrecy' within Trump’s inner circle. The report also revealed that even some of Trump’s staunchest pro-Israel supporters were blindsided. A longtime donor who had fundraised for Trump for years was quoted as calling the idea 'crazy' and warned that it involved 'too many unpredictable factors.' During a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump doubled down on his vision, proposing a full-scale redevelopment of Gaza: 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too... We will be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, [for] get[ting] rid of the destroyed buildings, level[ing] it out, creat[ing] an economy development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing to the people of the area.' He did not rule out deploying U.S. troops, adding, 'As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that.' Trump further justified his plan by portraying Gaza as unlivable, saying: 'Gaza has been a source of destruction and misery. The people there should go elsewhere. Many of them want to leave. 1.8 million Gazans need to go.' He suggested wealthy regional nations should fund the relocation, saying, 'They can go to one place, or seven, or 12. We will make sure something incredible happens. There will be peace—no more rockets, no more killing, no more destruction.' CNN analysts noted similarities between Trump’s Gaza proposal and his 2018 pitch to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. At their summit, Trump had presented Kim with a promotional video showcasing a futuristic skyline and suggested that Pyongyang could trade its nuclear ambitions for real estate development. 'North Koreans have beautiful beaches,' Trump said at the time. 'Instead of testing missiles over the water, they could have the world’s best hotels.' That proposal was ultimately rejected, and U.S.-North Korea negotiations stalled. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gaza was also a point of discussion in March 2023 when Trump’s son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner suggested Israel relocate Gaza’s Palestinian population. 'Gaza’s coastline holds significant economic value,' Kushner had said at the time, sparking controversy. Palestinian leaders swiftly condemned Trump’s proposal. Hamas issued a statement saying, 'We strongly denounce the U.S. president’s remarks aimed at occupying Gaza and expelling our people. His statements are hostile and will only fuel instability in the region.' Hussein al-Sheikh, Secretary-General of the PLO Executive Committee, reaffirmed the Palestinian Authority’s rejection of any displacement plan.

We were born here, we live here, and we reject all attempts to uproot us.' Saudi Arabia, which has been central to reports of a broader regional normalization deal involving Israel, also distanced itself from Trump’s plan. Riyadh reaffirmed its longstanding stance, stating: 'Saudi Arabia will not establish relations with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state.' The kingdom also rejected Trump’s proposal to relocate Gaza’s population, declaring: 'We oppose any attempt to transfer Palestinians from their land.

Resurrected? Hamas shot-callers keep reappearing despite IDF clai...	Senior Hamas commanders previously declared eliminated by IDF reemerge, raising doubts about intelligence accuracy; 'Evaluating strike results is not always 100% accurate,' security official says On December 3, 2023, IDF announced the elimination of al-Shati Battalion commander Haytham al-Khawajri. However, this past Saturday, he appeared at the 'release ceremony' for Keith Siegel, photographed himself with 'his soldiers,' and roamed freely without attempting to conceal his identity. This marks at least the third instance where a senior Hamas commander, whom Israel had claimed to have eliminated, reappeared later. The IDF and Shin Bet admitted the embarrassing mistake, explaining that their earlier announcement was based on intelligence that has now been proven inaccurate. This incident follows footage from last month showing the commander of Hamas' Beit Hanoun Battalion, Hussein Fayyad, attending a funeral in northern Gaza. This occurred after IDF claimed he had been eliminated in Jabaliya in May. At the time, the IDF reported Fayyad was responsible for numerous anti-tank missile operations launched into Israeli territory during the war, as well as mortar fire targeting northern border communities. At the funeral, Fayyad spoke about 'Gaza’s victory over the IDF in the war.' His statements confirm the footage was recent and filmed after the cease-fire. The reappearance of the Beit Hanoun Battalion commander—one of Hamas’ weaker battalions—again forced the IDF and Shin Bet to admit they were mistaken and that the intelligence about his death in an Air Force strike was incorrect. A similar incident occurred with the commander of Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan neighborhood, Mahmoud Hamdan, who also served as a bodyguard for slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Hamdan was reportedly killed in a skirmish with IDF troops about 220 yards from the location where the Hamas leader himself was killed in September 2024. The IDF had announced that Hamdan and the rest of the Tel al-Sultan Battalion’s leadership were eliminated in an Air Force strike. However, following Sinwar’s elimination, it became clear that this intelligence was inaccurate, as Hamdan survived until he was killed in another confrontation later. 'There’s a chance we’ll see more Hamas commanders we thought we had eliminated suddenly reappear,' admit security officials. 'Sometimes even Hamas itself doesn’t know the outcome of an attack targeting one of their commanders, and the process of evaluating strike results is not always 100% accurate. Some were targeted inside tunnels or buildings that collapsed on their occupants.' The IDF officially announced throughout the war that over 100 senior Hamas commanders had been eliminated. These included company, battalion and brigade commanders, as well as top organizational leaders like Mohammed Deif, Marwan Issa and Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in a clash with Israeli infantry and armored forces in Rafah. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite the intelligence lapses revealed in the past month, Hamas still retains senior commanders across Gaza who play a key role in rebuilding the organization, which continues to rule Gaza in the absence of an alternative. Besides Mohammed Sinwar, who likely replaced his brother as Hamas leader, other prominent field commanders remain alive, including at least two brigade commanders: Mohammed Shabana of Rafah and Izz al-Din Haddad of Gaza City. It is reasonable to assume that the higher the rank of the commander, the more resources—including extensive bomb payloads and intelligence efforts—are invested to ensure their elimination. In this context, Israel has been cautious about immediately announcing the results of targeted strikes on senior Hamas or Hezbollah commanders. Often, days or even weeks pass before the verification process is complete, as both terror organizations deliberately delay confirming whether their commanders have been killed. At the same time, many IDF commanders criticized the seemingly astronomical numbers of terrorists, including field commanders, that security officials claimed had been eliminated during the war. 'The public was told that a brigade-level combat team eliminated around 60 terrorists in Beit Lahia within a week or 150 in Shijaiyah, for example, without full verification. Battalion and brigade commanders, when you speak with them, are honest enough to add a disclaimer: ‘Of those, X were confirmed killed by sight, and the rest are based on informed estimates,’' IDF sources recalled from the war. 'There were also cases of Gazans, including many unarmed civilians, running in the streets or in combat zones where civilians were not supposed to be. We fired at them, hit them and saw them fall from afar, assuming they were terrorists. These were added to the daily enemy casualty assessment under the ‘neutralized’ category—without anyone verifying who they were, or even whether they were killed or only wounded.' Regardless, Israeli officials acknowledge that by the time the cease-fire began, Hamas still had at least 10,000 armed operatives remaining out of the approximately 30,000 it had on October 7. Among them are commanders, in addition to the hundreds of new operatives who were hastily recruited and trained in recent weeks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1olycef1e	2025-02-05T00:23:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/yk14248891/yk14248891_0_58_572_323_0_small.jpg

Palestinian officials warn plan could destabilize Middle East; despite the criticism, senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk says group open to talks with US, acknowledging Washington’s key role in region Hamas officials on Thursday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal for long-term American control of Gaza and the relocation of Palestinian residents, calling it 'absurd' and 'ridiculous.' 'Trump's remarks about his desire to control Gaza are ridiculous and absurd, and any ideas of this kind are capable of igniting the region,' Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters. Joining him was Izzat al-Rishq, another senior Hamas official, who also sharply criticized Trump’s remarks. 'Our people in Gaza have thwarted displacement and expulsion plans under bombardment for more than 15 months. Our people are rooted in their land and will not allow any plan to remove them from it,' he said. Meanwhile, senior Hamas Politburo member Mousa Abu Marzouk told Russia's RIA state news agency that the group was 'ready for contact and talks with the Trump administration.' 'In the past, we did not object to contacts with the administration of (former U.S. President Joe) Biden, Trump or any other U.S. administration, and we are open to talks with all international parties.' It was not clear when RIA interviewed Marzouk, who was visiting Moscow on Monday for talks with the Russian foreign ministry. Marzouk told RIA that talks with the U.S. have become a kind of necessity for Hamas, considering that Washington is a key player in the Middle East. 'That is why we welcomed the talks with the Americans and have no objection to this issue,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The remarks came after Trump, speaking alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House, suggested that the U.S. could oversee Gaza and that its population could be moved elsewhere. 'Why would they want to return? That place has been hell,' he said. Asked how many Gazans he is thinking of relocating, he said, 'All of them. We’re talking about probably a million [point] seven, maybe a million eight. But I think all of them. They’ll be resettled in areas where they can live a beautiful life and not be worried about dying every day.' The proposal has sparked strong reactions across the region, with Arab leaders weighing potential responses to the controversial suggestion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1bdfcgt1e	2025-02-04T23:03:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/H1tJ8Vxtkx/H1tJ8Vxtkx_0_78_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

National Unity leader Benny Gantz on Wednesday praised former U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on potential American control of Gaza and the relocation of its residents, calling them 'further proof of the deep alliance between the U.S. and Israel.' 'He has shown, not for the first time, that he is a true friend of Israel and will continue to stand by its side on key security matters,' said Gantz. Gantz described Trump’s statements as 'creative, original and interesting' and said they should be examined alongside Israel’s war objectives, with priority given to securing the release of all hostages held in Gaza.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk90akekjg	2025-02-04T22:13:14-08:00

US top diplomat Rubio backs Trump plan on US takeover of Gaza	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio late on Tuesday appeared to back President Donald Trump's plan for a U.S. takeover of Gaza, saying the Palestinian enclave must be free from Islamist group Hamas. Trump on Tuesday proposed a U.S. takeover of Gaza where Israel's military assault in the last 16 months has killed tens of thousands, after he earlier suggested that Palestinians in the enclave should be permanently displaced. The idea was condemned by experts and rights advocates. Trump's earlier comments that Palestinians should move to Egypt and Jordan were already rejected publicly by Palestinian leaders and leaders of the Arab world while being condemned by human rights advocates as amounting to a proposal of ethnic cleansing. 'Gaza MUST BE FREE from Hamas. As @POTUS shared today, the United States stands ready to lead and Make Gaza Beautiful Again,' Rubio said on X. 'Our pursuit is one of lasting peace in the region for all people.' While Trump had floated suggestions of Palestinian displacement since Jan. 25, statements issued since by Rubio's State Department on its websites after the top U.S. diplomat's subsequent calls with regional leaders did not explicitly mention Trump's suggestion. Trump did not offer much detail in his Tuesday proposal. Rubio's post also did not elaborate further.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/synkvoly1e	2025-02-04T20:29:03-08:00

The decision follows the Trump administration’s move to freeze foreign aid and dismantle the agency, a step that has sparked concern among lawmakers and international aid organizations.

Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it would not establish ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state - a statement that comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said that the Saudis were not demanding a Palestinian state. In a shock announcement, Trump said on Tuesday the U.S. would take over the war-ravaged Gaza Strip after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and develop it economically. He was speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The statement from the Saudi foreign ministry said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has affirmed the kingdom's position in 'a clear and explicit manner' that does not allow for any interpretation under any circumstances. Saudi Arabia also rejects any attempts to displace the Palestinians from their land, the statement said, adding that its stance toward the Palestinians is unnegotiable. Netanyahu said during the press conference with Trump that Israel will give it a good shot with Saudi Arabia and would succeed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjf0xuet1x	2025-02-04T20:15:29-08:00	
Netanyahu mismanaged Gaza—can he shift focus before it’s too late...	Einat Wilf: ‘The prime minister has to accept that the whole operation in Gaza was mismanaged, that he failed, and that he needs to cut his losses’ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed to win the war in Gaza. Now, his only move should be to bring the hostages home and then re-launch the war—this time, against Palestinianism rather than Hamas, according to Mideast expert Einat Wilf. Speaking on ILTV’s Insider, Wilf said, 'The prime minister has to accept that the whole operation in Gaza was mismanaged, that he failed, and that he needs to cut his losses.' She urged Netanyahu to 'ransom' the kidnapped individuals through the current hostage-for-ceasefire deal and get them out of Gaza. 'Enough with the drip, drip, week after week of operations,' Wilf said. Once the hostages are freed, she argued, Israel should shift focus to 'the actual war that should have been fought.' Watch previous episodes of Insider: Will Trump’s Return Rewrite Middle East History? Netanyahu or Hamas: Who’s Really to Blame for the Ceasefire Delays? Wilf explained that the October 7 attack was not just perpetrated by Hamas but 'the Palestinian ideology of no Jewish state.' She described Hamas as 'merely the executive arm' of this ideology and said Netanyahu must now fight 'the actual war that should have been waged 15 years ago' to dismantle the belief system preventing peace. While Iran is often viewed as Israel’s greatest existential threat, Wilf argued that it is only the most recent backer of Palestinianism. She pointed to past supporters, including the Nazis, pan-Arabists, and the Soviets. 'If Iran falls, Turkey or Qatar will take its place,' she warned. 'The Ayatollah regime will fall because all previous supporters of Palestinianism have always ended in the dustbin of history—unfortunately, not before causing a lot of damage to the Jewish people,' Wilf said. She criticized Netanyahu for avoiding the core issue. 'If you're not going to deal directly with the enemy and keep running away to projects that you feel are more appropriate to your station, you're not going to deal with the real threat,' she said. Jonathan Pollard: Iran is capable of anything However, during the same discussion, former American intelligence analyst Jonathan Pollard, now a vocal figure in Israeli affairs, argued that while Palestinianism may be the root issue, Iran’s immediate nuclear ambitions remain a top concern. A report released this week indicated that Iran is exploring a fast-track path to developing nuclear weapons. 'When you have a wounded totalitarian regime that understands it’s lost the support of its people, they’re capable of anything at that point,' Pollard told ILTV. 'The trick is to defuse their nuclear threat, bring down the government, and allow a popular uprising to occur without destroying the country.' He suggested that Israel has 'technical' capabilities to cripple Iran’s leadership. 'I've already been very public about our need to use a nuclear weapon—an electromagnetic pulse weapon,' Pollard said. An electromagnetic bomb detonated high in the air would short out all electronic systems, including those crucial to Iran’s nuclear program. 'Electronic centrifuges do not spin unless they have electricity, and once you've destroyed the regime’s ability to control their police, security services, and armies, a popular uprising can occur,' Pollard explained. Not everyone agrees with his approach. 'I think using a nuclear weapon is absolutely something of the absolute last resort,' stressed author and analyst Ilan Evyatar. He argued that before Israel takes action, it should give newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump a chance to impose sanctions and pressure the regime. However, he acknowledged that by then, if intelligence reports are correct, Iran may already have a nuclear weapon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rktwsuef1g	2025-02-04T18:43:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/BkllXXeFJe/BkllXXeFJe_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Trump says US will take ownership of Gaza; Netanyahu calls it 'A ...	U.S. president says he 'sees long-term ownership' of Gaza; 'We will be responsible for Gaza, we will remove the dangerous bombs and the destroyed houses, it's a great idea,' he said; Netanyahu says 'Israel will end the war by winning the war' Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a joint press conference at the White House Tuesday night, following their meeting that dealt with a variety of critical issues on the agenda – from the negotiations that have now opened on phase two of the hostage deal, through the Iranian threat and the question of a possible attack on its nuclear facilities, to the long-awaited normalization with Saudi Arabia. 'We had wonderful conversations,' Trump said at the beginning of his remarks. 'Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to visit our administration. Bibi, I want to say it is a great honor to host you. In the last four years, the alliance between our countries has been tested more than ever before in history, but the bond and affection between our peoples have been maintained for years and are unwavering. I am confident that under our leadership the alliance between our countries will soon be stronger than ever.' 'We have had great victories in the past - not in the last four years,' Trump said in a clear dig at his predecessor Joe Biden, and recited his achievements in his first term. 'During my tenure, I brought peace and stability to the Middle East that had not been seen in decades. We defeated ISIS, we withdrew from the nuclear agreement and imposed very harsh sanctions on the Iranian regime. We stopped Iran's proxies and deprived them of resources. I recognized the Golan Heights, in the historic Abraham Accords we achieved the most important peace agreement in the Middle East. I believe that many countries will join this wonderful peace and this economic peace. There will be many who will sign. Unfortunately, in the last four years, no one has signed.' 'The horrors of October 7th would not have happened if I had been president,' Trump repeated, something he has said many times before. 'Israel has endured aggression and murderous attacks on every front and fought back with great courage. This was a threat to the very existence of the Jewish state in its homeland. Israel stood strong against an enemy that kidnapped, raped and slaughtered innocent people, children and women, little babies. I want to salute the Israelis who stood with courage and determination. They were strong.' After thanking his team and asking those present to applaud Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump said: 'We will only be satisfied if all the problems are solved and we have the team to solve them. It will happen quickly. The Gaza Strip has been a source of destruction and so bad for the people, the lives of the residents there are miserable. They need to go to other places. There are many of them who want to go from there. 1.8 million Gazans need to leave. The rich countries of the region need to finance it. They can go to one area, or 12. We will ensure that something amazing is done. We will have peace and they will not be shot, killed and destroyed.' Trump stunned when he later said that 'the United States will take over the Gaza Strip, we will do work there. We will control it and neutralize all the bombs. We will clear Gaza and get rid of the destruction and carry out economic development that will provide endless jobs and housing. It is impossible to go back. If they go back, it will happen again.' Netanyahu supported the idea: 'A new future for the territory, it's worth paying attention to' Netanyahu, who issued a statement afterward, told Trump: 'You are the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House. Its policy is bringing our hostages home, including American citizens. You have resumed the transfer of weapons that were withheld from Israel during a seven-front war against our existence.' The prime minister said that the two 'see eye to eye on the Iranian issue. This is the same Iran that tried to kill both of us. It tried to assassinate itself and through a proxy to kill me.' At the end of his statement, he said that 'Israel will end the war by winning the war. Israel's victory will be the victory of the United States. We will work together and win in peace as well. With your leadership, we will create a great future for the region and bring our alliance to greater heights than ever.' In response to a question about a possible agreement with Saudi Arabia, Netanyahu replied: 'I believe that peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only possible but will happen. If you had continued in office, it would have happened. I think the Saudi leadership wants it.' Trump, for his part, said he was not sure the cease-fire would last. 'The Biden administration didn't help us, but we were able to get some hostages out and we'll get more out. We're dealing with problematic people. I hope we get more out, they'll come out very damaged. But they'll get better and be strong and have a good life and we hope to release as many as possible. We hope the cease-fire will last, but I'm not sure.' The American president said, further in his statement, that he 'sees long-term ownership of Gaza, it will bring stability to the Middle East. Everyone I've talked to loves the idea. Developing this area and creating thousands of jobs would be a great thing. Today you can't see it because you only see destruction. I've seen it from every angle and it's a dangerous area to be in and it's only going to get worse.' Asked whether he recognized Israel's sovereignty over the West Bank, also known as Judea and Samaria, Trump replied: 'We will discuss it with your representatives, we have not yet taken a position. We will issue a statement on this issue in the coming month.' He stated that he would visit Israel - as well as Gaza, Saudi Arabia and other regions: 'The Middle East is a wonderful place, one of the most beautiful places with wonderful people. A lot of bad leaders allowed this to happen in the Middle East, and that includes the American side. We should not have gone there in the first place, spent so much money and caused death.' At the beginning of the meeting, Trump spoke at length, essentially saying that his plan was to evacuate all residents of the Gaza Strip to seven or eight areas around the world- and forever. 'Who would want to go back there? There's nothing but death and destruction. We'll build them lovely cities,' he said. He had even said before that the Palestinians 'have no choice but to leave Gaza . ' The prime minister promised in the same statement at the beginning of the meeting not to give up any of the war's goals: 'Hamas will not remain in Gaza.' He did not commit that Israel would continue with Phase 2 of the hostage deal, only saying: 'We will try.' Before the press conference began, Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, said the meeting was 'strong and steady.' He said, 'Trump is a leader who will do amazing things.' When asked by reporters if there would be any surprises, he replied, 'Wait and see.' Israel's ambassador to the United States, Yechiel Leiter, said before the press conference: 'You can feel the change in the air. Everything has changed.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The press conference, in the East Room of the White House - the place where Trump presented the 'Deal of the Century' five years ago - was also attended by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The assistant secretary of defense, an officer with the rank of major, was photographed carrying a large bag that apparently contained maps and aerial photographs that were shown to Trump at the meeting. Netanyahu, the first foreign leader Trump has hosted at the White House since his return to the presidency, met with the American president privately. A larger meeting with the two leaders' teams was then held in the Cabinet Room at the White House. After the press conference, the two were expected to continue for a joint dinner. The two discussed a variety of topics during their meeting, the first of which was the question of continuing the hostage deal. Trump and his people made it clear over and over again that they wanted to maintain the cease-fire and continue with the second phase – which would mean a permanent cease-fire and the end of the war. When Trump was asked at the beginning of the meeting if he believed the deal could be completed, he replied: 'Why not? Yes, of course. We can definitely complete the deal.' The issue of the Iranian threat was also discussed, with estimates before the meeting that Netanyahu would argue that this would also serve the interests of the Saudis and 'give time' to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip. Just before the meeting, Trump said that he intended to speak with the Iranian president, after repeatedly signaling his intention to promote a 'deal' - meaning a new nuclear agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjepzvgf1x	2025-02-04T15:59:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/H1Yy44gt1l/H1Yy44gt1l_0_0_3000_1997_0_small.jpg

Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said that U.S. President Donald Trump's ambitions regarding Palestinian migration from Gaza are a recipe for chaos in the Middle East. 'Our people in Gaza will not allow these plans to pass. What is required is an end to the occupation and aggression against our people, not their expulsion from their land,' he said. He was joined by Izzat al-Risheq, a senior Hamas official, who also criticized Trump's words. 'Our people in Gaza have thwarted displacement and expulsion plans under bombardment for more than 15 months. Our people are rooted in their land and will not allow any plan to expel them from their land,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skl7nfgt1g	2025-02-04T14:02:34-08:00	
Female field observer hostages used as human shields for senior H...	Karina, Daniella, Naama, Agam and Liri were held in a hideout apartment in Gaza, where a senior Hamas military commander was also present; He provided them with food and ensured they could shower – while simultaneously manipulating them in an attempt to extract information about IDF activity in the days leading up to Oct. 7 For an extended period during their captivity, observers Daniella Gilboa, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, Agam Berger and Liri Albag were held in an apartment in Gaza where a senior Hamas military commander was also hiding. According to reports from Kan News, the commander used the hostages as human shields and was a 'dominant figure' in the hideout. The Hamas leader not only issued orders to terrorists but also attempted to manipulate the young women, coaxing them into revealing information about IDF activity near the Gaza border in the days leading up to the Oct. 7 terror attack. Some of the hostages only realized after their abduction that he was a high-ranking Hamas operative. This was not an isolated tactic. Several Hamas leaders deliberately stayed close to hostages to protect themselves. The treatment of the lookouts was largely similar to that of other captives, apart from the targeted efforts to extract intelligence from them. Throughout their captivity, Hamas terrorists frequently filmed the hostages, forcing them to deliver scripted messages. Some of these videos were later released in Israel. Many of those who returned had no idea what footage had been disseminated. Several freed hostages said they had little access to television or radio and remained unaware of their families' fates until their release. Others spent most of their time underground in Hamas tunnels and were unclear about how much time had passed. Testimonies from the observers revealed that Naama Levy was held alone for a long period before being reunited with her fellow captives. When she finally saw them again, she asked if what was happening was real and whether they were alive. The five women spent time both above and below ground, and in some cases, were held by families, forced to cook, clean, and care for children. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The four hostages who were released first tried to pass the time by exercising despite the harsh conditions and lack of food. Their captors forbade them from holding hands or crying, but they found ways to support each other. Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev, who had known each other from their base before the abduction, were held together for most of their time in captivity, strengthening their bond. One of the previously released hostages recounted that her Hamas captors dismissed reports of the assassination of Hamas’s military chief, Mohammed Deif — news that Hamas officially confirmed only recently, nearly six months later. The guards even laughed at the reports, while the hostages insisted that Al Jazeera was broadcasting 'false propaganda.' Based on her conversations with her captors, one of the freed hostages speculated that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was not viewed as a revered leader among them. She noted that there was a more pronounced sense of mourning when senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran. Many of the captives had limited knowledge of calendar dates, as they were only occasionally allowed to watch television. 'We didn't know when Passover was, but we knew when Yom Kippur was, and we fasted,' one released hostage said. Following Agam Berger’s return, new details emerged about her captivity alongside the other lookouts. She spent a significant period with Liri Albag, and the group refrained from eating leavened bread during Passover. Agam also observed Shabbat while in captivity and spoke about the faith that sustained her throughout the ordeal. Upon arriving at Rabin Medical Center, she wrote a message on a whiteboard that read: 'I chose the path of faith, and in the path of faith, I have returned.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by3mqmxyyx	2025-02-04T13:51:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/H1gd00Wtdyx/H1gd00Wtdyx_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg
Empty Gaza of all its residents and settle them around the world ...	The US president and the prime minister are now meeting in the Oval Office, in what could shape the face of the Middle East for years to come; Trump spoke about removing Palestinians from Gaza forever: 'Who would want to go back there? There is nothing but death and destruction'; Netanyahu on Israel's goals in the war: 'Hamas will not remain in Gaza' A fateful summit that could shape the face of the Middle East for years to come: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the White House Tuesday evening for a meeting with President Donald Trump that will address a variety of critical issues on the agenda - from the negotiations that have now opened on phase two of the hostage deal, through the Iranian threat and the question of a possible attack on its nuclear facilities, to the long-awaited normalization with Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu, the first foreign leader Trump has hosted at the White House since his return to the presidency, was supposed to arrive at the White House as early as 11:00 p.m. but was delayed by about 20 minutes. Trump waited for him at the entrance, shook his hand and raised his fist to reporters waiting outside. Before their meeting in the Oval Office they spoke to reporters inside the room and when asked if he thought the deal could be completed, Trump replied: 'Why not? Yes, of course. We can definitely finish the deal' - meaning continue with the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage return agreement. Trump also claimed that he deserved a Nobel Prize. 'But they won't give it to me. Everyone is demanding peace, we want people to stop getting killed,' he said. Netanyahu was asked if he supported the release of all the hostages, and he replied yes - but emphasized that he insisted on delivering 'all the war goals,' including the dismantling of Hamas and a promise that Gaza would never again become a threat to Israel. The prime minister was asked if he was optimistic about the possibility of reaching the second phase of the deal, and he replied: 'We will try, that's one of the things we will talk about. When Israel and the US work together, the chances increase - when we don't work together, it creates problems,' he said, appearing to be alluding to past tensions with the Biden administration. Later, President Trump was asked about his relocation plan for Gazans - and he again claimed that the Palestinians should be evacuated from the Strip, while unlike previous times he now called for 'resettlement' of them permanently outside the Strip. 'I don't think people should be going back,' Trump said. 'You can't live in Gaza right now. I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that's going to make people happy. You look over the decades, it's all death in Gaza. This has been happening for years. It's all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what's happening in Gaza.' He added that 'I hope we can do something nice, why would they want to go back? This place is hell, it's the worst place in the world.' He emphasized, however, that he does not support Israeli settlements in Gaza: 'I don't see it happening. It's too dangerous. Nobody would want to live there, soldiers don't want to be there, so how would people want to settle it? The best way is to get out, find nice, open places with sunlight, they (the Palestinians) wouldn't want to go back to Gaza.' Shortly after midnight, Trump and Netanyahu are scheduled to hold a press conference, and then continue to have a joint dinner. Netanyahu is accompanied on the visit by his wife Sara, who has been in Miami for the last 70 days and met with him after he landed in Washington on Sunday. First Lady Melania Trump will not accompany her husband to the meeting, since she is not currently in Washington. At the summit, the two leaders will discuss a variety of critical issues, not all of which they necessarily have compatible interests in. 'He came to meet with me, and I'm here to listen,' Trump said before the meeting. The most central and immediate issue is the question of continuing the hostage deal. Trump and his people have repeatedly made it clear that they want to maintain the cease-fire and continue with the second phase – which means a permanent cease-fire, and the end of the war – and although the American president admitted that there are 'no guarantees' that the agreement will last, ahead of the meeting a senior American official said that Trump is focused on releasing 'all the hostages ,' along with the need to prevent Hamas from returning to power in Gaza. Netanyahu is expected to present to Trump the demands that Israel will raise in negotiations on phase two – including the demilitarization of the Strip, the exile of the Hamas leadership, and the terrorist organization's non-involvement in the reconstruction of the Strip 'the day after.' Israel understands that the chances that Hamas will agree to this are slim, and that therefore there will be no escape from a return to fighting. Netanyahu will try to get Trump to ratify his promise that if an agreement on the second phase cannot be reached, Israel will be able to return to fighting. The issue of the deal is closely linked to another central issue that Trump and Netanyahu will discuss – the Iranian threat. Netanyahu is expected to try to convince Trump that in the order of priorities in the Middle East, it is better and right to start dealing with this threat. He will argue that this will also serve the interests of the Saudis and 'give time' to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip. His critics claim that the prime minister is actually hoping to torpedo phase two of the deal, in the shadow of the fear of the dissolution of his government with the 'red lines' of Minister Bezalel Smotrich in the background, who promises to withdraw from the coalition if fighting does not resume at the end of phase one. Trump did not rule out the possibility of an attack on the nuclear facilities, but he repeatedly signaled that he intended to promote a 'deal' – that is, a new nuclear agreement – ​​and noted that 'it would be nice' to resolve the crisis with Tehran without an Israeli attack. On Tuesday evening, Trump said that he intended to contact Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, adding that he was 'torn' while signing the tougher sanctions. 'I hope we don't have to use them a lot, I'm not happy about using them.' Shortly before the summit, Trump ordered a renewal of his 'maximum pressure' policy from his first term – meaning tougher sanctions on Iran than those already imposed. Trump warned that Iran was too close to a nuclear weapon, but said on the other hand that he was 'torn' about the move and expressed hope that it would not be necessary to implement it extensively, meaning to reach an agreement with Tehran. The possibility of normalization with Saudi Arabia will also be raised at the meeting, with estimates that such a move could be part of the 'inducement package' that Trump will offer Netanyahu to continue to Phase 2 - despite the political risk for him. However, there is a major obstacle in the way: Netanyahu refuses the condition set by the Saudis for such a deal - providing a 'political horizon' for the Palestinians, which Smotrich also set as a 'red line' for him. Other issues expected to be raised at the meeting include the arrest warrants against Netanyahu at the International Criminal Court in The Hague and sanctions on Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan and his team; the continuation of the cease-fire in Lebanon; the attitude toward the new government in Syria; and the beginning of discussions on the security memorandum of understanding between Israel and the U.S. The current memorandum is set to expire in 2028. Musk, Yair and the hotel for the weekend Netanyahu and his wife are staying at Blair House, the official White House guest house. Their son Yair is also there, and tonight he posted a photo of himself alongside his father and billionaire Elon Musk – a Trump confidante who wields immense power in the new administration. 'So grateful to be in the company of these two geniuses,' Yair wrote on Instagram. On Wednesday, the Netanyahus will leave Blair House and move a few hundred meters away – to the Willard Hotel – where they will spend the weekend. The entourage will return to Israel on Saturday night, and their stay at the Willard Hotel will be financed by taxpayer money. The Prime Minister's Office said that the extension of their stay in Washington stems from 'numerous requests for meetings from officials.' Daniel Adelson and Yael Ceichanover participated in preparing this article.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdvgglk1g	2025-02-04T13:32:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/ByWA5jWgKJe/ByWA5jWgKJe_0_108_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Trump says he thinks he will wind down US humanitarian agency	U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he thinks he will wind down the U.S. Agency for International Development, in what would be a dramatic overhaul of how the world's largest single donor allocates foreign assistance. When a reporter said to Trump it sounded like he was going to 'wind down' the agency, Trump chuckled and said 'I think so.' Chaos has consumed the agency, which distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid around the world, since Trump ordered a freeze on most U.S. foreign aid hours after taking office and tasked billionaire Elon Musk, who has falsely accused USAID of being a 'criminal' organization, with scaling down the agency. 'He's done a great job. Look at all the fraud that he's found in this USAID ... radical left lunatics,' Trump said, without providing evidence of fraud.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjs0iwgk1x	2025-02-04T12:30:54-08:00

Rubio, asked about the proposal during a news conference in Costa Rica on Tuesday, called it 'an incredible offer, an unprecedented one.' 'Obviously, we'll have to study it on our end; there are obviously legalities involved.

Trump signed a renewal of the tough sanctions policy on Tehran: 'Too close to a nuclear weapon, we will reduce its oil exports to zero'; Netanyahu will try to convince the president to focus on the Iranian threat, but an Israeli official admitted: 'There is no more talk of an attack, Trump has another goal - one that requires ending the war' About an hour before the White House meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the American president on Tuesday evening signed a renewal of the 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran, the name for the heavy sanctions policy he imposed on the Islamic Republic during his first term. Trump said that Iran is too close to a nuclear weapon, and warned that if Tehran decided to assassinate him in response, Iran would be 'obliterated.' He said he left 'instructions' to do so if Tehran did indeed assassinate him. The U.S. president was asked whether he intends to assist Netanyahu and give the green light to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. 'I don't know that he's going to ask for that. We'll have a long meeting, we'll talk about a lot of things. I'll update when the time comes, but I can't talk about it right now,' he responded Trump added: 'I would love to have a good relationship, but they must not have nuclear weapons. It will be very tough if they insist on that. A lot of people at the highest levels in Iran do not want nuclear weapons.' Before Trump's signing, a U.S. official said the goal is to deny Iran any way to obtain nuclear weapons and combat its 'malign influence' - and within the framework of the sanctions the hope is to reduce Iranian oil exports 'to zero.' The Iranian issue is expected to be central – perhaps the most central – issue at the White House meeting with Netanyahu. Trump and Netanyahu will discuss a host of issues that could determine the face of the Middle East in the coming years, including the transition to phase two of the hostage deal, a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia, and dealing with the Iranian threat. Netanyahu is expected to try to convince Trump that in the order of priorities in the Middle East, it is better and right to start dealing with this threat. He will argue that this will also serve the interests of the Saudis and 'give time' to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip.

On Tuesday evening, Trump said that he intended to contact Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, adding that he was 'torn' while signing the tougher sanctions. 'I hope we don't have to use them a lot, I'm not happy about using them.' Sanctions are seen by Trump as a way to force Iran to compromise but, at least in the past, this policy has not worked. Former President Joe Biden left Trump’s sanctions in place – although some argue that his administration did not effectively enforce them – and failed to advance a new agreement or save the old one. Although Israel has talked in recent months about the possibility of an attack o Iran's nuclear facilities - against the backdrop of assessments that Tehran is weaker than ever, after the crushing of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, and the Israeli attack on Iran in October, which significantly damaged Iran's air defense capabilities - it seems that Jerusalem understands that the chances of such a move are now low. 'There is no talk of an attack on Iran,' an Israeli source told the Washington Post Monday night - noting that, after the October attack, Israel had formulated plans for a joint attack with the U.S. against the Iranian nuclear facilities. However, he said the new American administration has 'another goal' in the region, one that would demand an end to the fighting, when in fact he meant the idea of ​​a regional arrangement that would perhaps also include normalization with Saudi Arabia. 'Trump is interested in rebuilding Gaza through a regional agreement with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia,' he noted. 'Netanyahu will not go against Trump.' Either way, Israel hopes that, unlike Trump's first term, this time the new sanctions will be accompanied by a more credible military threat. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1r000llkkg	2025-02-04T12:11:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

Ynet has learned that the issue has been under consideration for some time, and a green light has been given to a plan to encourage the migration of Gazans to a third country other than Egypt or Jordan Senior Israeli officials have been considering for several months a plan to encourage the migration of Gaza residents to a third country as part of efforts to rebuild the enclave, according to a report on Tuesday. Israel appears to be signaling a green light for preparing such a program, which would involve the relocation of Gaza residents to a country that, according to the discussions, would not be Egypt or Jordan. The idea surfaced about two months ago, even before U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a voluntary migration plan for Gazans to neighboring Arab states as part of a massive reconstruction effort. A source familiar with the matter said that Israeli government teams have been reviewing plans, including legal aspects, to facilitate migration from Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to publicly address the idea, which has drawn significant backlash in the Arab world. As a result, any discussion of the topic is being handled delicately. However, it is possible the issue will be raised during Netanyahu's meeting with Trump, or in subsequent talks with reporters. The Prime Minister's Office has not responded to requests for comment. Within the Israeli cabinet, right-wing ministers have pushed for the plan on multiple occasions, advocating for both encouraging migration from Gaza and establishing Israeli settlements in the enclave. Leading this effort is National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has been lobbying Netanyahu directly. Two months ago, Ben-Gvir said Netanyahu was beginning to show 'some openness' to the idea. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the Religious Zionism party, has also promoted the idea of settlements in Gaza. Trump to meet with Egyptian president Following Trump's statements that Egypt and Jordan should absorb Gazan migrants, Egyptian officials told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to visit Washington on Feb. 18 to discuss several issues, including Trump's proposed relocation of Gazan residents. According to the report, Sisi plans to discuss a cease-fire agreement in Gaza and long-term solutions for the Palestinian issue. The sources indicated that Egypt would propose a comprehensive reconstruction plan for Gaza that does not involve displacing its residents. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Egypt, along with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League, issued a joint statement on Saturday rejecting Trump's proposal. 'We affirm our categorical rejection of the forced displacement of Palestinians from their land for any reason,' the statement read. The declaration was released following a meeting in Cairo between several foreign ministers and Hussein al-Sheikh, the secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee. The statement also emphasized that Arab nations expect to work with the Trump administration toward a 'just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on a two-state solution.' The officials discussed efforts to support the Palestinian cause and maintain the cease-fire in Gaza. The meeting also addressed a potential 'mechanism' that would allow the Palestinian Authority to resume governance in the territory. Last week, Trump proposed that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinian residents from Gaza while the enclave undergoes a process of reconstruction and 'cleansing.' Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, he described Gaza as a massive wreckage site and suggested that relocating its residents to Egypt or Jordan might be a long-term solution rather than a temporary measure. 'You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, we just clean out that whole thing,' Trump said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjk2m0ytyx	2025-02-04T10:02:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/r1gyNt1K1x/r1gyNt1K1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Holocaust survivor Mordechai Ciechanower dies at 100: 'We were to...	Mordechai, who survived the gas chambers, immigrated to Israel with his father after the war and dedicated his life to Holocaust remembrance; He led IDF and school delegations to Poland, lectured worldwide about his personal story, and died two weeks before his 101st birthday Just weeks before his 101st birthday, Holocaust survivor Mordechai Ciechanower died at the age of 100. Ciechanower, who was laid to rest Tuesday morning, dedicated his life to Holocaust education. He led delegations of Israeli students and IDF officers on educational trips to Poland, lectured worldwide about his personal experiences, and authored an autobiography, 'A Star Gleams in the Distance,' which was translated into English, German and Polish. Ciechanover was born in 1924 in the Polish town of Maków Mazowiecki. To survive two years in Auschwitz, he worked as a roofer, repairing barracks in the camp. He was liberated from Bergen-Belsen on April 15, 1945, and later that year immigrated to Israel under a false identity, posing as a British soldier. He was laid to rest Tuesday in Yarkon Cemetery. Senior officials from the Shin Bet and Mossad, who had attended his lectures — including former Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai — helped carry his casket. Singer Yonatan Razel performed 'Shir Mispar,' a song he and Ciechanower had created together. Born to Meir Zvi Hirsch and Rachel, Ciechanower grew up in a family that made edible and industrial oils. He was educated at the Yavne religious school, where his primary language was Yiddish, though most subjects were taught in Hebrew. As a child, he studied the Talmud at night while listening to discussions among members of the Zionist youth movements Hashomer Hatzair and Betar. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When World War II broke out in September 1939, the Jews of Maków Mazowiecki were ordered to assemble in the town square. Ciechanower, along with hundreds of other young men, was sent to forced labor camps. By late 1940, the town’s Jewish residents were relocated to a designated Jewish quarter, and by the end of 1941, a ghetto was established. Ciechanower’s family shared a cramped room with two other families. 'The overcrowding was unbearable, and food was scarce,' he recalled in a 2018 Zikaron BaSalon testimony - a social initiative of informal gatherings in private homes where participants listen together to the testimonies of Holocaust survivors. 'I removed my yellow badge, approached Poles, and asked for bread – they gave it to me. I brought it home, and within 20 minutes, my family had devoured a whole kilogram of bread. For three years, from 1942 until the end of the war, I was constantly hungry. My greatest dream was simply to sit at a table full of bread and eat.' In November 1942, the ghetto was liquidated and Ciechanower was deported to the Mława Ghetto before being sent, along with his family, to Auschwitz a month later. Upon arrival, his mother, Rachel, and sisters, Rivka and Chana-Hadasa, were murdered in the gas chambers. Ciechanower and his father were selected for forced labor, surviving for three and a half months. 'The journey to Auschwitz — the largest Jewish cemetery in the world — was horrifying,' he recounted. 'A man who leaned on me throughout the trip died during the journey. I wept as I bid farewell to my mother and sister. I took one last look at them before entering the camp.' On his first night in Auschwitz, Ciechanower recalled the barracks overseer telling them: ‘The weak will be exterminated, the strong will work until they die. Look at the smoke rising from the chimney—those are your families.’ His father’s fingers froze in the bitter cold, and he was taken to the infirmary. A month later, Ciechanower was injured. During a selection process, he was loaded onto a truck bound for the crematorium, but a delay due to the arrival of a transport from Greece saved his life. Later, Ciechanower worked as a roofer in the camp and acted as a messenger for the Jewish underground inside Auschwitz. After the Sonderkommando uprising, he and 500 others were transferred to the Stutthof concentration camp in northern Poland. His journey of suffering continued, moving from camp to camp, and enduring brutal forced labor. At the end of the war, he was liberated from Bergen-Belsen. In Munich, he discovered that his father had survived. 'I took a train to see him. When he opened the door, we both fainted. I promised him we would never be separated again,' he said. Ciechanower and his father immigrated to Israel through Egypt, disguised as British soldiers. He served in the Alexandroni Brigade during the War of Independence and later married his wife, Deborah. Together, they raised two daughters. On the most recent Holocaust Remembrance Day, Ciechanower participated in Paskol Shlishi, a collaborative album by Galgalatz Radio and Zikaron BaSalon. The album featured songs inspired by personal testimonies, collective memory, and a shared future, created by Israeli musicians. The artists met with Ciechanower during the project and even celebrated his 100th birthday with him. 'Each of us held onto something from his story,' they said of the songwriting process. 'One remembered divine intervention, another recalled the search for his father, and a third was struck by the number tattooed on his arm. However, the most remarkable detail was the mandolin — a musical instrument that symbolized life before the war and resurfaced even in Auschwitz. That’s why, at the end of every verse, we let the mandolin play. The melody carries an old European Jewish essence, filled with sorrow yet unwavering optimism —j ust like Mordechai Ciechanower’s story.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sji3layfye	2025-02-04T09:00:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/04/17/Hylbdvqf3/Hylbdvqf3_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Hospital concert honors IDF field observers returned from captivi...	Liri Albag, who celebrated her previous birthday in Hamas captivity, was celebrating freedom Tuesday with her friends and family: 'The only wish I ask for - the return of all the hostages'; Watch the field observers join in singing at the concert to mark their return and as a tribute to violinist Agam Berger Liri's family just recently belatedly celebrated her 19th birthday. On Tuesday, the returned hostage and all her relatives are already celebrating her 20th birthday, and freedom. A little more than a week after she was released from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip, Liri Albag celebrated her 20th birthday Tuesday in the returnees' ward at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva. Shortly afterward, dozens of musicians gathered in the lobby of Schneider Hospital to play pieces of music for the returning observers - for Liri's birthday and as a tribute to Agam Berger, a violinist. The field observers themselves stood on one of the upper floors, excitedly watching the concert, clapping during Naomi Shemer's 'Lo Yehi' and Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah.' Agam even joined in singing. Her mother, Meirav Berger, delivered a speech: 'We will pray for those who are still there, we will not be silent until everyone returns.' She wished Liri a mazal tov and added: 'We can say that the music held Liri and Agam captive.' The national anthem 'Hatikva' was played to mark the end of the concert. The observers sang the anthem - and then they also sang Happy Birthday to Liri, and the orchestra joined in. In a post on Instagram, Liri wrote: 'Today I get to celebrate my 20th birthday with my loved ones. The only wish I asked for is for all the hostages to return.' Her sister Roni wrote in another post: 'Our Lirosh, our number 1. I dreamed of this moment countless times and here you are. Today you celebrate your 20th birthday at home, today you celebrate the life that was given to you again, our victory, our heart and the light of our home. I love you and am here for you forever and ever.' Shai, Liri's sister, also congratulated: 'Congratulations, my little sister, who is celebrating 20 and has returned to life. Always remember that everything is small for you and there is nothing you cannot do. I will take care of you for a better world.' Liri returned home exactly as her family and friends described her during the 15-month struggle for her return: brave, optimistic and with a smile that brightened everything. Her fellow observers who had been kidnapped with her from the Nahal Oz outpost - Daniella Gilboa, Karina Ariev, and Naama Levy - returned with her. Five days later, their friend, observer Agam Berger, was also released, and the five were reunited together in the returnees' department in Beilinson. Liri's friends said Monday that 'she is truly a special girl, full of energy - and that has not gone to waste. Today the family will celebrate her 20th birthday with her friends. Last year she celebrated her 19th birthday in captivity , now our Liri has been released, and she will celebrate today in a big way with cakes and balloons.' 'Liri is always smiling, she is optimistic, loves life and loves to spend time and be with friends a lot,' a friend described, echoing how her friends and family described Liri on many occasions during the arduous journey of their fight for her return. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On the sixth floor of Beilinson Hospital, in the special ward set up for the returnees, Liri and her fellow observers received spa treatments from hair stylists and manicurists who had come especially for them - a first step on the path to normalcy. At the same time, from the testimonies that are beginning to emerge about the period of captivity, it becomes clear that Liri became a leader there, too. 'Liri is a superhero, she was the one who took care of the kidnapped women and spoke to the captors. When Hamas tried to humiliate them upon their release and put them on a stage, they showed that they were stronger than that,' said a family member. Her friends said that Liri and the girls were kept informed of what was happening, and Liri told her parents: 'You were my strength. I heard you so much. You are the only ones who gave me hope.' She told them that she even heard their birthday greetings in February, when she was in captivity and turned 19. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjuovt1fjg	2025-02-04T08:19:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/B1V22k9yYJx/B1V22k9yYJx_0_74_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen's family awaits his return, concerned fo...	Sagui's brother Itay Dekel-Chen, is urging a more nuanced perspective on the highly charged debate over the cease-fire and hostage release; 'We must bring everyone home, but at the same time, this comes at a heavy price,' he says, 'If we choose only one side, there won’t be much left here' As Israel prepares for the next phase of a hostage deal, Itay Dekel-Chen, the brother of Sagui-Dekel Chen – who is expected to soon be freed – expressed his anticipation while lamenting the growing divide over the negotiations. 'The stark polarization in the discourse surrounding the deal and the return of the hostages is troubling,' Itay said. 'Reality is more complex, and we need to approach it with a more clear-eyed perspective than what we hear in the usual debate. Both sides have a point. We must bring everyone home, but at the same time, this comes at a heavy price, with serious future security risks. There is the sanctity of life and the sanctity of our people and land. If we only choose one side, we won’t have much left here.' He added: 'If, as a people and a nation, we can find a way to secure the hostages’ release while maintaining strength and full trust in our security forces, perhaps we can emerge from this with a sense of victory. I’m not saying it’s easy – it requires deep and strategic thinking. I live in a world of both. I grew up in Kibbutz Nir Oz, and today I live in the religious moshav of Zimrat. I was raised in a kibbutz and now live in a moshav. We must find a middle path here as well. With the right discourse and effort, we can find common ground — maybe through dialogue with the Americans, maybe through long-term strategies —but alongside the fight to bring the hostages home, we must also avoid tearing our society apart or creating internal crises.' Alongside the fight to bring the hostages home, we must also avoid tearing our society apart or creating internal crises Sagui Dekel-Chen, who was abducted from Nir Oz on October 7, is also an American citizen. His family has worked tirelessly to advocate for his release, lobbying U.S. officials for intervention. His wife, Avital, recalled the horrifying moments before he was taken. 'Sagui was kidnapped from our home while I was in the safe room with our two daughters, seven months pregnant,' she told lawmakers at the Knesset. 'Before he was taken, he stepped into the safe room and said: ‘There’s no way out of this alive. The army isn’t coming.’ He didn’t want the girls to understand, so he said in English, ‘Milly, this is the end.’' Avital had hoped for a miracle — that Sagui would return in time to be by her side for the birth of their third child. But he never came home. Their daughter Shachar was born without a father. More than a year has passed, and Sagui has missed her first birthday, as well as the daily lives of his two other daughters, Bar and Gali, who wait for him at home.

Israel opens first embassy in Israel: 'After October 7 attack you...	Some 34 years after Jerusalem officially recognized Moldova's independence, an Israeli embassy opened in Chisinau. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said at the ceremony:'This is a historic moment that marks a milestone in relations between the countries'; Saar laid a wreath in memory of his family at the monument to the victims of the Chisinau ghetto Foreign Minister Gideon Saar inaugurated the Israeli embassy in Moldova Tuesday morning. 'This is a historic moment that marks a milestone in relations between the countries. Moldova is a friendly country to Israel, we are upgrading our relations today and we are doing so with great joy,' Saar said at a ceremony attended by Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mihai Popșoi. This is the first time Israel has opened an embassy in the Eastern European country. 'After the Hamas murderers attacked on October 7, the most serious attack on Jews since the Holocaust, Moldova stood by us,' Saar said at the ceremony. 'You condemned Hamas' evil barbarity, you clearly recognized Israel's fundamental right to self-defense.' The foreign minister added: 'We were also attacked by Hezbollah, the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen, which is 2,000 km from our border, by militias in Syria and Iraq, and finally by the head of the snake, Iran. But we managed to defeat them. This showed the world that Israel is an anchor of strength and stability in a very dangerous and unstable region.' Pro-Palestinian demonstrations took place outside the new embassy area. After the opening of the new embassy, ​​the foreign minister continued with his counterpart to the memorial to the victims of the Chisinau Ghetto. Saar laid a wreath in memory of his family and participated in the recitation of Kaddish in memory of the victims. Saar's grandfather, David Zerchansky, left Chisinau in 1908 and moved to Argentina. His three sisters, who decided to stay in Chisinau, were killed in the Holocaust. The wreath laid by Saar bears the names of the three sisters - Yocheved, Raizel and Rivka. In 1939, about 200,000 Jews lived in Serbia (most of which was in present-day Moldova). More than 100,000 of them were murdered in the Holocaust. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saar then met with Moldovan President Maia Sandu. The meeting dealt with the opening of the new embassy, ​​relations between the countries, the struggle against the Iranian axis, and the war in neighboring Ukraine. The foreign minister expressed appreciation for Sandu's words against antisemitism, and invited her to visit Israel. In his meeting with the president, Saar addressed the situation in Syria. 'The new government in Damascus is made up of jihadists and Islamists. It is currently focused on the economy, governance and legitimacy from the world, and therefore is currently speaking softly. This happened with many Islamist movements that came to power, including Khomeini's revolution in Iran in 1979. But it would be advisable to monitor its activities closely. 'What is clear is that Turkey has the greatest influence on it. The most important thing for us is maintaining our security. The Iranian threat is the most urgent. It is important to pay attention to Turkey's actions in the region. Turkey is currently the most dominant country in Syria, it aspires to be the leader of Sunni Islam in the region.' Israel officially recognized Moldova's independence in 1991. A year later, diplomatic relations between the countries were established and since 1994 Moldova has had an embassy in Israel. Over the years, Israel has had a non-resident ambassador to Moldova. In December, Saar made the decision to open an embassy in the country for the first time. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1c3h3yt1e	2025-02-04T07:38:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/SJKukiJtyl/SJKukiJtyl_0_44_1280_720_0_small.jpg

In addition, the Israeli Navy observed vessels that were violating the security restrictions in the maritime area of the Gaza Strip and fired warning shots to distance them. The vessels did not retreat and additional shots were fired. The vessels returned to the shore. In the central Gaza Strip, two suspects posed a threat to IDF troops, and warning shots were fired to distance them. As the suspects did not retreat, IDF troops fired additional shots, and a hit was identified. Additionally, IDF troops operating in the area fired warning shots in several areas in the Gaza Strip, following suspects who were approaching the troops and posing a threat to them, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj9dknjyjg	2025-02-04T06:19:07-08:00

Hours before the 'fateful' meeting between the US president and Netanyahu, a senior American official said that the two would discuss 'preserving' the cease-fire and preventing Hamas from returning to power; 'Phase 2? There will be unity'; Trump insists on relocation for masses of Gazans; 'Rebuilding the Strip will take between 10-15 years, it is impossible to force people to live in land that is uninhabitable' A U.S. official said Tuesday afternoon, just hours before the scheduled meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump at the White House, that the two leaders will discuss 'preserving the cease-fire agreements' - apparently referring to both Gaza and Lebanon - and their commitment to freeing the hostages held by Hamas. 'Trump is focused on getting all the hostages out, and on ensuring that Hamas cannot return to control the Strip,' the source told Reuters. He added that at Tuesday evening's meeting, Trump and Netanyahu will also discuss the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, the initial talks on the terms of which have already begun indirectly, and that, according to him, there will be 'unity' in the way they want to pursue it. The possibility of normalization with Saudi Arabia will also come up in the talks, with estimates that such a deal will be part of the 'inducement package' that Trump will offer Netanyahu in order to continue with phase two of the deal - which means the release of all remaining hostages that are still living and an end to the war - despite the political risk for the prime minister. 'We hope that the Abraham Accords will expand and prosper,' the U.S. official said, referring to the peace agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco that were signed during Trump's first term. 'We see an opportunity to bring more countries into the Abraham Accords,' he added. Netanyahu himself said before his departure for Washington that he hoped to 'expand the circle of peace' - but so far he has refused the condition set by the Saudis for such a deal: providing a 'political horizon' for the Palestinians - that is, some progress, declarative or practical, in the process of establishing a Palestinian state.

Australia bans DeepSeek on government devices citing security con...	Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices over concerns that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup poses security risks, the government said on Tuesday. The Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs issued a mandatory direction for all government entities to 'prevent the use or installation of DeepSeek products, applications and web services and where found remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services from all Australian Government systems and devices,' the statement said. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said DeepSeek posed an 'unacceptable risk' to government technology and the immediate ban was 'to protect Australia's national security and national interest,' several Australian media outlets reported on Tuesday evening.

Donald Trump Jr. accused of illegal duck hunting near Venice	Donald Trump Jr., the oldest son of U.S. President Donald Trump, broke Italian and European Union environmental protection laws when he hunted ducks near Venice in December, according to two Italian Green party lawmakers. Andrea Zanoni, a member of the Veneto regional assembly, and Luana Zanella, a national parliamentarian, have filed two separate parliamentary questions urging regional and national authorities to take action against the alleged offence. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Zanoni said he had seen footage of Trump Jr. hunting in a 'Natura 2000' EU conservation zone in the Venice lagoon, standing near a dead ruddy shelduck, a protected species. Hunting in Italy is legal, but strictly regulated. In the nearly 6-minute video Zanoni referred to, Trump Jr. can be seen on a duck hunting trip in marshlands near Venice promoted by Field Ethos, an outdoors activities brand he co-founded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6liqyt1e	2025-02-04T04:53:03-08:00

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke to Elon Musk on the subject of misinformation about South Africa, the presidency said on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would suspend aid to the country over its land reform policy. Trump on Sunday accused South Africa of confiscating land and badly treating 'certain classes of people.' Ramaphosa responded on Monday that the government had not confiscated any land and the policy was aimed at ensuring equitable public access to land.South African-born billionaire Musk, who is close to Trump, had waded into the dispute on Monday with a post on X accusing South Africa of having 'openly racist ownership laws', suggesting white people were the victims. The presidency said on X that Ramaphosa and Musk had spoken on Monday 'on issues of misinformation and distortions' about South Africa. 'In the process, the President reiterated South Africa's constitutionally embedded values of the respect for the rule of law, justice, fairness and equality,' it said, giving no further details.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpzsqyyyx	2025-02-04T04:50:42-08:00

Netanyahu has a chance to to fix mistakes in Trump meeting	Opinion: Following missteps and failures accrued throughout his political career culminating in Hamas' attack, prime minister has an option to return Israel to the right path during his U.S. visit Tuesday night could be Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s best chance to fix things. A man who has repeatedly proven his ability to rise from the ashes and overcome personal failures now stands before U.S. President Donald Trump with a chance to address national failures — many of which are deeply tied to his own political career. This night is set to be one of the most fateful in Israel’s history and certainly in Netanyahu’s own. At 11:00 p.m. local time, he will enter the Oval Office with some of Israel’s most pressing issues on the table — issues in which he has played a direct role in shaping the current reality. Netanyahu has the chance to correct historical missteps resting on his shoulders. He must push Trump with all his might toward military action against Iran’s nuclear program. Though he was the first to identify the threat, he has been the last to act. The failure of diplomatic agreements is evident — Iran is closer than ever to military nuclear capability. This must now be the top priority. Netanyahu must push Trump for the broadest possible military backing — an Israeli strike with U.S. support and likely direct American military involvement. On Gaza, Netanyahu himself voted for the 2005 disengagement and orchestrated the Gilad Shalit deal in 2011, setting the unbearable precedent of releasing over 1,000 terrorists — many of whom had murdered, not only attempted to do so — in exchange for a single IDF soldier. Under his leadership, Hamas thrived. Now, after these strategic failures, he has the opportunity to change course. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The change must be decisive: Hamas cannot remain standing. After carrying out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, it has shown fundamentalist Muslims across the region that kidnapping civilians from their beds is an effective tactic against Israel. Hamas and the hundreds of millions who surround us must see that there is no worse mistake than the October 7 massacre. Netanyahu, who enabled Hamas through Qatari funding, who may not have received a precise warning on the night of October 6 but knew full well the terror army’s capabilities and intentions, cannot cleanse himself of this stain in Jewish history unless he ensures Hamas is entirely dismantled as a governing and military entity in Gaza. Having voted for the disengagement, Netanyahu learned along with the rest of us that expelling Jews from Gaza brought terror to our doorstep. Now is the time to advance Trump’s plan for the voluntary relocation of Gazans — not by force, not through violence but with incentives and international cooperation. Countries could take them in exchange for American aid, even with Israeli financial support — this is better than paying for endless wars. Netanyahu must put forth a serious plan to relocate as many Gazans as possible. This could be a game-changer in our relationship with that cursed strip of land. Fate has brought these critical issues to tonight’s meeting — all challenges Netanyahu has faced before. Until now, he has consistently chosen the easy, wrong path. Maybe tonight, a shift will take place — a historic correction that can set Israel on the course it deserves. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byd5yyyf1l	2025-02-04T03:55:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BkxxMc3dyx/BkxxMc3dyx_0_0_1259_696_0_small.jpg
What are the three pillars of artificial intelligence?	Dr. Roy Sasson: 'How do you build better predictive analytics to understand what people wish to read more about?' Artificial intelligence is built on three key pillars, according to Dr. Roy Sasson, Director of the AI & Big Data Track at the GMBA program at Reichman University: No. 1 - Data No. 2 - Machine learning, which enables predictions No. 3 - Generative AI 'If you're a news vendor, you have access to a lot of data feeds from various places, so you don't always need to rely on what is coming from people,' Sasson explained. 'You can tap into social media. You can tap into various sources and so on. 'How do you digest all of that information?' he continued. 'And most importantly, for the sake of news, how do you make sense of what is true and what is fake? On the machine learning aspect, how do you build better predictive analytics to understand what people wish to read more about, and based on that, adapt what is the real focus of journalists?'

IDF confirms to IDF reserve soldiers killed in West Bank attack, ...	Sergeant Major (res.) Ofer Yung, 39, from Tel Aviv, a Squad Commander in the 8211th Battalion and another reserve soldier were killed in action after terrorist opened fire Two IDF reserve soldiers were killed in a shooting attack at the Taysir checkpoint in the West Bank after the terrorist entered the post and ambushed them, the IDF Spokesperson reported on Tuesday. Eight other soldiers were wounded, two seriously and the rest suffering minor injuries. One of the fallen soldiers was Sergeant Major (res.) Ofer Yung, 39, from Tel Aviv, a Squad Commander in the 8211th Battalion. The second soldier’s name has not yet been cleared for publication. The wounded were evacuated to Israeli hospitals. The checkpoint had 11 soldiers and a commander on duty. At dawn, as the checkpoint opened for inspections, the first soldier who stepped out of the guard post was ambushed by the attacker, who also targeted another soldier. A close-range firefight ensued, lasting several minutes. The soldiers fired from inside the rooms and the guard area, while the attacker shot from the entrance of the guard post. Rapid response teams were called in and a force led by a platoon commander fired at the terrorist from outside the post. He then tried to flee between buildings but was intercepted by another unit. After several minutes of gunfire, one soldier threw a grenade that hit the terrorist. He was neutralized and then eliminated by two other soldiers. A UAV tracked him from the air but he was ultimately taken down by ground forces. The IDF described the attack as 'a very serious incident' and said, 'Lessons will be learned.'

Syria's Sharaa to discuss defense pact with Turkey's Erdogan, sou...	Talks focus on air defense cooperation, training a new Syrian army and countering Kurdish fighters, with Turkey eyeing bases in the Badiyah region to secure Syria's airspace Syria's transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan are expected to discuss a joint defense pact in Ankara on Tuesday, including establishing Turkish airbases in central Syria and training for Syria's new army, four sources familiar with the matter said. NATO member Turkey has long backed Syria's armed and political opposition to ousted leader Bashar Assad, who was toppled in late December in a lightning offensive spearheaded by Sharaa's forces. Ankara is positioning itself to play a major role in the new Syria, filling a vacuum left by Assad's main regional backer Iran, in an expansion of Turkish sway that could spark rivalry with Gulf Arab states and put Israel on edge. The sources - a Syrian security official, two Damascus-based foreign security sources and a senior regional intelligence official - spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media about the meeting. This is the first time that elements of any strategic defense arrangement by Syria's new leaders, including details of additional Turkish bases, have come to light. The pact could see Turkey establish new air bases in Syria, use Syrian airspace for military purposes, and take a lead role in training troops in Syria's new army, the sources said. Syria's new leadership has dissolved the army and its various rebel factions and is working on integrating them into a new military command. Turkish air bases in Syria The regional intelligence official, the Syrian security official and one of the Damascus-based foreign security sources said the talks would include setting up two Turkish bases in Syria's vast central desert region, known as the Badiyah. An official in Syria's presidency said that Sharaa would discuss Turkey's 'training of the new Syrian army, as well as new areas of deployment and cooperation' with Erdogan, without specifying the deployment locations. The Turkish presidency and Syrian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue. The Turkish presidency's communications director Fahrettin Altun said on Monday that Erdogan and Sharaa would discuss the latest developments in Syria and possible joint measures to rebuild Syria's economy and achieve stability and security. A Turkish defense ministry official familiar with the talks between both defense ministries said he did not have information on Turkish bases in Syria and training for Syrian troops as part of a possible defense pact. Turkey's air defense role The senior regional intelligence official, the Syrian security official and one of the Damascus-based foreign security sources said the bases under discussion would allow Turkey to defend Syria's air space in case of any future attacks. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Assad's other main backer - Russia - is also in talks with the new Damascus administration about the fate of its two military bases in Syria, a naval base in Tartous and an air base near the port city of Latakia, the Kremlin said on Monday. In an interview in January, Syria's defense minister Murhaf Abu Qasra said the country's new leaders would seek to build strong ties in the region, 'and that through these ties, we will be able to build our military force well.' If these ties lead to a partnership 'on arming, training, air defense or other issues - we would welcome it,' Abu Qasra said, without mentioning Turkey. The regional intelligence official said the possible airbase locations were the Palmyra military airport and the Syrian army's T4 base, both in the province of Homs. Message to Kurdish fighters The official said Ankara was keen to set up bases there as a message to Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria, known as the People's Protection Units (YPG). Ankara views them as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and is deemed a terrorist group by both Turkey and the U.S. Turkey has threatened a military offensive against the YPG, but has held off as talks are underway to address the fate of the Kurdish forces. The Turkish defense ministry official said that Turkish and Syrian military delegations exchanged views last week on 'what can be done in defense and security matters, especially in the joint fight against terrorist organizations that pose a threat to both Syria and Turkey.' 'Our meetings will continue within the framework of the needs that will occur in coming period,' the official added. Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler said in December that Turkey was 'ready to provide the necessary support if the new (Syrian) administration requested it. Ankara may discuss and reevaluate the issue of Turkey's military presence in Syria with the new Syrian administration 'when necessary conditions arise,' Guler said at the time. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjzzvd1tjl	2025-02-04T02:20:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/B1dx2H008yl/B1dx2H008yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Snuck inside checkpoint and surprised soldiers: IDF probes deadly...	Investigation finds terrorist, armed with an M16 and two magazines, snuck in before dawn and opened fire on soldiers exiting post; at least 10 Israelis injured in attack The IDF's Initial findings from the investigation into the deadly shooting attack at the Tayasir checkpoint in the West Bank on Tuesday, in which at least 10 were injured with two in critical condition, revealed that the incident began inside the checkpoint's pillbox. According to the investigation, the terrorist approached on foot, wearing a military vest equipped with an M16 rifle and two magazines. He infiltrated the post overnight, ambushing soldiers at dawn, just before 06:00 a.m., as they prepared for inspections. The checkpoint, manned by 11 reservists and a commander, came under heavy fire. The first soldier exiting the pillbox was immediately opened fire at the entrance of the post, followed by another. A prolonged close-range gunfight ensued, with the terrorist firing from the pillbox entrance while soldiers returned fire from inside the rooms and guard posts.

I didn’t see sunlight': Freed Thai hostages recall harrowing Gaz...	Five Thai hostages freed after 482 days in captivity shared accounts of confinement, survival and hope; families, some traveling to Israel for emotional reunions, celebrated their release The five Thai hostages released from Hamas captivity during the third hostage handout in the cease-fire agreement with the terror group spoke to Thai media about their time in Gaza. Their family members, who waited 482 days for their return, began their journey to Israel on Monday to reunite with their loved ones. Pongsak Tanna recounted being abducted on the morning of October 7, together with Bannawat Seathao, who was also released in the deal. 'The two of us were together. We were kidnapped from different places but were put in the same vehicle. They brought two more people from elsewhere. We didn’t all meet. We were locked in a room the entire time, never went outside, didn’t see sunlight and didn’t see stars. 'Occasionally, we saw the light of a vehicle passing by the window. We showered once every four or five days and there was a guard with us 24 hours a day,' he said. He added that later, an Israeli hostage was also held with them in Gaza. In an interview with the Bangkok Post, Tanna described his release from captivity in Gaza as 'a rebirth.' He said that life in captivity was extremely difficult, but he never lost hope that he would one day be freed. He shared that thoughts of his family, especially his 15-year-old daughter whom he hadn’t seen for more than seven years, gave him the strength to survive. Seathao said, 'From the day I was kidnapped, I missed home in Thailand. We forced ourselves to eat just to survive and return home. We encouraged each other.' He expressed gratitude to the Thai people for not giving up, for continuing to care about them and for demanding their release. Thailand’s Labor Minister Phipat Ratchakitprakarn spoke from Bangkok with the freed hostages, who are currently being treated at Shamir Medical Center in Israel. He told Thai media the hostages are expected to be discharged from the hospital on February 11. He added that their return date to Thailand has not yet been set but promised to personally welcome them upon their arrival at the airport. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the freed hostages, during their captivity, they longed to eat 'Som Tam' salad with fish sauce — a dish made from strips of green papaya, sometimes served with shrimp and crabs. They have already managed to enjoy this popular Thai dish since their release. Wiwatchot, younger brother of Watchara Sriaoun, and Kami, the mother of Surasak Lamnau, left their home in Udon Thani province on Monday, heading to Bangkok and continuing on to Israel. The province’s deputy governor accompanied them to the capital, where they were issued passports and entry visas to visit their relatives who survived captivity in Gaza. Wiwatchot, whose brother was photographed after his release with injuries to his mouth and missing front teeth, said, 'The whole family is happy' that he is traveling to meet him. 'Our parents are waiting in Thailand for Watchara to come home,' he added. Lamnao’s mother shared how she waited for her son for over a year, expressing her longing for his return even as some claimed he had been killed. She continued to believe her son was alive. Thai media also reported that the Social Security Administration is expected to pay the freed hostages approximately $15,500. In addition, they will receive a monthly payment of around $780. This information was confirmed by the Thai Ministry of Labor. The five hostages came to Israel from rural provinces in northern and northeastern Thailand and had worked in border communities from which they were abducted. The five released Thai hostages are Sathian Suwannakham, Pongsak Thenna, Bannawat Seathao, Watchara Sriaoun and Surasak Lamnau.

Elon Musk targets 'apocalyptic' closure of US humanitarian aid ag...	The move, supported by Trump and opposed by Democratic lawmakers, could disrupt billions in global aid with critics calling it illegal and dangerous U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said it would lock U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) workers out of their headquarters in downtown Washington DC for a second day on Tuesday as it moved to shutter the agency, prompting two Democratic senators to vow to block confirmations of State Department nominees in protest. Monday's lockout added to the chaos that has consumed the agency, which distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid around the world, since Trump ordered a freeze on most U.S. foreign aid hours after taking office on January 20. USAID has been targeted for closure by billionaire Elon Musk, who has been tasked by the president with downsizing the federal government. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was considering merging USAID into the State Department and had 'entrusted Elon to oversee the efficiency of this agency.' A group of Democratic lawmakers, cheered by dozens of furloughed agency employees and contractors, held a protest in front of the USAID headquarters, which was shut to the employees on Monday, according to an internal email. Another internal email went out late on Monday, telling employees at the agency's headquarters and a second site in Washington to work remotely again on Tuesday, adding to concerns voiced by staff members and lawmakers. 'We don't have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,' said U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin, speaking outside the building. Senators Brian Schatz and Chris Van Hollen said they would block confirmation of Trump's nominees for State Department positions under rules that allow them to hold up nominations even if the Republican majority of the chamber want them to move forward. 'We have control over the calendar for nominees,' said Van Hollen. 'We will do everything we can to block State Department nominees from going forward until this illegal action is reversed.' 'Against the law' Hundreds of USAID programs covering billions of dollars worth of lifesaving aid across the globe came to a grinding halt after Trump on January 20 ordered a freeze of most U.S. foreign aid, saying he wanted to ensure it is aligned with his 'America First' policy. If USAID were put under the State Department, it would likely have dramatic consequences for the distribution of aid from the United States, the world's largest single donor. Musk has been increasingly critical of USAID, calling it a left-wing agency unaccountable to the White House. Musk critics say his accusations are often lodged without evidence and may be ideologically driven. The rush of events has underlined Musk's powerful role in setting Trump's agenda. Last week, Musk's team at the Department of Government Efficiency gained access to the most sensitive payment systems at Treasury and locked some employees out of their agency's computers. At USAID, two senior security staff were put on leave after refusing to provide classified documents to DOGE employees on site over the weekend. Since then, dozens of USAID career staff have been put on leave. Three sources familiar with the matter said that USAID personal services contractors, who carry out the bulk of the work in the agency's humanitarian bureau, have also been locked out of their government accounts. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Some USAID staff waved signs as the lawmakers spoke, including one that read: 'USAID saves lives.' Democrats have argued that eliminating USAID's independence requires an act of Congress. Trump told reporters on Monday that he did not believe that was necessary. 'I love the concept (of USAID), but they turned out to be radical left lunatics,' Trump said. Rubio becomes acting USAID head U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting head of USAID, calling the agency 'completely unresponsive' and accusing the staff there of being 'unwilling to answer simple questions' about programs. 'If you go to mission after mission and embassy after embassy around the world, you will often find that in many cases, USAID is involved in programs that run counter to what we're trying to do in our national strategy with that country or with that region. That cannot continue,' Rubio said. He informed Congress in a letter of the looming reorganization of the agency, saying some parts of USAID might be absorbed by the State Department and the remainder may be abolished. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said she found Rubio's notification 'wholly insufficient on the law and devoid of any rationale for the drastic, abrupt action the administration has taken, with no prior notice to Congress.' In fiscal year 2023, the United States disbursed, partly via USAID, $72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024. And yet it is less than 1% of its total budget. The State Department issued worldwide stop-work directives after Trump's freeze order, with the exception of emergency food assistance. Experts warned that the move risks killing people. Since then, dozens of USAID career staff have been put on leave. Three sources familiar with the matter said that USAID personal services contractors, who carry out the bulk of the work in the agency's humanitarian bureau, have also been locked out of their government accounts. 'Without PSCs, there is no longer functionally a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance in USAID. The waivers from Secretary of State Rubio for emergency food and other urgent assistance are a smokescreen and farce if there is no one to make the awards happen,' a USAID official said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00tk8jkye	2025-02-04T00:46:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ByRmw30Oke/ByRmw30Oke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Will Netanyahu give in on the Palestinian state issue?	They say that Israel has to discuss a pathway to the creation of a Palestinian state... A pathway is a thing with gravel, it's not very significant Peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is once again on the table, but part of the Saudi criteria includes a pathway to a Palestinian state. Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren said this is something Israel could potentially agree to. 'They don't say that Israel has to discuss the creation of a Palestinian state,' Oren told ILTV. 'They say that Israel has to discuss a pathway to the creation of a Palestinian state. Now, if you ask me, a pathway is a thing with gravel, it's not very significant.' He noted that while Saudi Arabia is not a democratic government, it still has to consider public opinion. The kingdom must demonstrate to its people that, in exchange for making peace with Israel, it is taking action on the Palestinian issue. 'I think that Netanyahu would agree to discuss a pathway,' Oren said. 'He might even agree to some symbolic Palestinian Authority presence in Gaza on the day after, but his government won't, and he'll have a hard time—not only with the far-right wing of his government but perhaps with elements within his own Likud party.'

U.S. President Donald Trump will be constructive in trade talks with the EU, in order to avoid a trade war and spiking inflation in his own economy, Luxembourg's foreign minister Xavier Bettel said on Tuesday. 'All the European products, if they have to pay much more, at the end of the day, it's inflation. And I think that Donald Trump has been elected also to reduce inflation, not to raise inflation,' Bettel said before a meeting of EU ministers in Warsaw.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1yisl1t1e	2025-02-03T23:52:49-08:00	
Israel faces driest winter in over a century	Despite the severe drought, desalination and water management efforts are preventing any immediate drinking water shortages Israel is experiencing its driest winter in more than 100 years, with only 55% of the annual average rainfall recorded so far, according to the Water Authority. Despite the severe drought, desalination and water management efforts are preventing any immediate drinking water shortages. The last similar dry spell was in 2009. The Sea of Galilee, Israel’s main freshwater reservoir, barely rose this winter, and the Jordan River’s flow is at its lowest since 1960. The only significant rainfall came from one heavy downpour in the Carmel region, pushing local precipitation above average. More rain is expected Wednesday and Thursday, with up to 50 millimeters forecasted, but experts say it won’t be enough to change the overall trend.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryexmu1fjx	2025-02-03T23:41:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/03/04/S18eFneJn/S18eFneJn_0_176_1024_577_0_small.jpg

Iran working on secret 'shortcut' to nuclear bomb, report says	International outlet reports U.S. intelligence data delivered from Biden to Trump's administration suggests Iranian scientists working on clandestine plan to expedite development of a nuclear warhead Amid tensions between Tehran and Washington and former U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, 'We need to apply more pressure to Iran until they stop doing the activities that they’re doing.' In an interview with Fox News, he added, 'They’re [Iran] trying to ultimately get to a nuclear weapon.' Meanwhile, The New York Times reported on Tuesday that new intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program has convinced U.S. officials that a secret team of scientists in Tehran is exploring new development options. Sources said this intelligence was gathered in recent months under former U.S. president Joe Biden’s administration and passed to incumbent President Donal Trump's incoming national security team. The assessment warned that Iranian engineers and scientists are seeking a 'shortcut' to turn their growing stockpile of nuclear fuel into a functional weapon within months. U.S. officials still believe Iran, led by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, has not yet decided to build a nuclear weapon but suspect it may consider doing so as a deterrent against a potential U.S. or Israeli strike. According to the American outlet, Iran has the knowledge to develop a crude nuclear weapon using an outdated but faster method. Such a weapon wouldn’t be small enough for a ballistic missile and would likely be unreliable, making it less suitable for an immediate attack. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, officials warned that Iran could quickly develop a basic device, conduct a test and declare itself a nuclear power. While such a weapon might not be effective against Israel, it could serve as a deterrent. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump are set to discuss the Iranian threat in their meeting set for Tuesday. About a week and a half ago, Trump said 'it would be nice,' if the Iran issue could be resolved without Israel attacking its military facilities. When asked if he would support an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Trump said, 'I won’t answer that question.' In a previous Fox News interview, Trump stressed that Iran 'cannot have nuclear weapons.' The Financial Times recently reported that Trump was open to diplomatic solutions before increasing pressure on Tehran. A former senior Israeli official told the paper, 'I don’t see the Trump administration using force early on without at least trying other approaches. That doesn’t align with his stance that wars started under Biden and that he’s going to end them.' Iran has signaled its willingness to negotiate, though analysts believe any talks would be difficult for both sides. Iran’s Vice President Mohammad Mokhber recently said at the Davos Forum that he hopes Trump will be 'more serious, more focused and more realistic' in dealings with Tehran. He acknowledged the economic burden of sanctions but denied Tehran’s involvement in the activities of Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis, saying, 'We’ve never had proxies.' Meanwhile, Saudi news outlet Al-Hadath reported that Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi expressed willingness to negotiate with the U.S. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s19qhhjf1e	2025-02-03T23:19:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

After 15 months of captivity, Bibas family still awaits reunion	As Yarden reacclimates to life, his family have no answers to offer him about the fate of his wife Shiri and two sons, Kfir and Ariel; Members of the Bibas family now demand answers from the government On Monday evening, the Bibas family gave a statement to the press from Sheba Medical Center, two days after Yarden Bibas was released from Hamas captivity, while his wife Shiri and their children Ariel and Kfir remain in Gaza, with serious concerns for their safety. At the beginning of the statement, Yarden’s sister, Ofri Bibas Levy, said: 'We endured 484 days of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty, and now Yarden is home. Yarden is here and we’ve rediscovered what we already knew — how strong and amazing he is. 'We’ve learned how he survived hell with his sensitivity and humor, which are so characteristic of him. We look at him, hug him, and still can’t believe he’s here. He’s adjusting and learning about everything that happened. There’s a lot of information to process, some of it difficult to handle.' According to Ofri, 'Yarden says he was moved between many locations during his captivity, held in harsh conditions, with food often scarce and poor hygiene. He was exposed to little sunlight for long periods. Yarden also discovered that he and his family are no longer anonymous. He has realized how loved he and his family are. It moves him, but it’s not easy to cope with.' Ofri also referred to Shiri, Kfir and Ariel. She said, 'Yarden’s journey to recovery has only just begun, and it’s clear it won’t be complete until his family — Shiri, Ariel and Kfir — are home. My brother is back, but my sister-in-law and my nephews are not. 'Yarden asks about them, and I have no answers for him. I demand that the prime minister and the negotiation team provide us and him with answers. Our journey will not be complete until we have certainty about Shiri and the children’s fate and until all 79 captives are home.' Ofri also sent a message to Shiri and the children, who are still in captivity: 'We miss you so much and are waiting for you, now together with Yarden. I appeal to the prime minister and the ministers: you made the right decision in favor of the agreement. 'The price is heavy, but there is no price for life, freedom, and security. Today, negotiations for the next phase are supposed to begin. The challenges are great, but the commitment is clear—to bring everyone back, the living for recovery and the fallen for burial.' Later, Dana Silverman Seaton, Shiri’s sister, who rarely speaks out in public, also gave a statement. 'Two days ago, I finally managed to breathe a little after 15 months of hell in which I lost my parents, my friends, and my younger and only sister, Shiri, who was kidnapped along with my nephews Ariel and Kfir and her husband Yarden to Gaza,' she said. 'I am so happy I got to hug Yarden, hear his voice, and look into his eyes again,' she added. 'Yarden has only one question: Where are Shiri and the children? Three-quarters of our hearts are still held in captivity and until they return, we will remain incomplete. We will no longer accept uncertainty—we demand answers. We demand them back. It is the state’s duty to us after everything we’ve been through.' According to Dana, 'Shiri and her children were in their kibbutz, still wearing their pajamas, as the entire country and the world saw, and the state failed to protect them. It is the responsibility of the government and the state toward Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir, toward Yarden, toward me, toward our entire family, and toward every citizen who looks and asks whether the State of Israel knows how to protect its citizens. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I appeal to the Prime Minister and the members of the government: complete the deal in all its stages until the last captive is home. Do not let extreme voices derail the agreement,' she concluded. 'This is what distinguishes us from our enemies. Bring everyone back—the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial.' Earlier, relatives of Keith Siegel, who was released from captivity alongside Yarden and Ofer Kalderon on Saturday, also gave a statement. Keith’s daughter, Shir, said: '484 days of hell have passed for my father. A year and four months in the darkest, scariest place on earth. 'He says he was held in inhumane conditions by cruel terrorists who abused him mentally, physically, and emotionally. He barely saw daylight, was starved for long periods, and lost significant weight. He says he was held in harsh isolation conditions and sometimes lost hope of ever returning home.' After Shir spoke, Aviva, Keith’s wife, who was released in the previous deal in November 2023, also spoke. She thanked the Prime Minister and the negotiation team for their 'brave decisions,' as she put it, and added that Keith’s return highlights the urgency of bringing back all the captives. 'There are still 79 captives in Gaza. Everyone deserves to come home. All their families deserve to feel what we are feeling now.' Aviva thanked President Donald Trump for 'saving his life' and also thanked former U.S. president Joe Biden for 'supporting the family throughout the process.' After Yarden returned from captivity, the Bibas family said: 'Yarden is home. A quarter of our hearts has returned to us after 15 long months. Words cannot describe the relief of holding Yarden in our arms, hugging him, and hearing his voice. Yarden is home, but the home is incomplete.' 'Yarden is a father who left the shelter to protect his family, survived captivity heroically and returned to an unbearable reality. We continue to hope and call for the return of Shiri, the children, and all the captives. Please continue to amplify their voices and the urgency of their return. Help us echo this louder than ever. For Yarden and for everyone. We won’t stop until everyone is home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tzxscoye	2025-02-03T21:01:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/Bk5jGcs00Je/Bk5jGcs00Je_253_6_595_335_0_small.jpg

Gaza, the day after the war; four options for rule of the Strip	There is no doubt Hamas maintains its control over Gaza including policing, food distribution and more despite Israel's goal to remove it; some in Israel urge for mililtary control and settlements; PM must chose between ruling Gaza and normalization with Saudi Arabia The images of armed Hamas terrorists during the release of hostages in Gaza, leave little doubt. After a year and five months of war, Hamas, although weakened, is in full control of the Gaza Strip and the lives of its residents, despite Israel's declared goal to destroy the terror group and prevent it from ruling over the enclave. The future of Gaza will likely be discussed on Tuesday in the meeting of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump and may be connected to a larger deal that would include a normalization of ties with Saudi Arabia. For now, there are four possible options for who would rule Gaza after the war, each of them complex and critical for Israel and the civilians in Gaza. Hamas continues to rule the Strip Despite Israel's objections, Hamas may maintain its rule over Gaza. The terror group has thousands of armed members, a police force and a security agency. It also has local municipal workers already busy clearing some of the rubble from the destruction caused by the war. Until the cease-fire most of them avoided being affiliated with Hamas but since the truce was announced, they returned wearing their uniforms. Maintaining Hamas rule over Gaza may make rebuilding the strip more difficult. The mammoth task would require years and a flow of foreign donations. Hamas has been discussing the establishment of a civilian management committee run by Palestinian technocrats and members of the Palestinian Authority (PA) but refused any possible dissolution of its military wing. The terror group has been attempting to copy the Hezbollah model in Lebanon where the Iranian proxy was both a political party that had a seat at the cabinet table and also a military force. This would not be acceptable for the PA. A continued Hamas rule over Gaza poses a threat to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government because it had vowed to prevent any future that leaves Hamas the ruling power across the border. In fact, Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners have called for Israeli military control of the entire Strip and the establishment of settlements there. Israel conquers Gaza and established a military rule Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Israel to conquer Gaza. According to the cease-fire agreement, Israeli troops who are still deployed to the Netzarim Corridor in the center of the Strip and the Philadelphi Corridor to the south, will have to withdraw on day 22 of the deal from Netzarim and 20days later from Philadelphi. The release of all of the hostages named in the first phase of the deal relies on the pullback of troops. If Netanyahu decides not to move on to the second phase of the deal and orders the IDF to resume the war, he may also task the military with civilian matters such as the distribution of food and the collection of garbage. This would be detrimental to Netanyahu's efforts to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia and would require the backing of the United States, under the Trump administration. Trump said he wanted the war to end and all of the hostages to be returned. Palestinian Authority rule over Gaza The PA is considered the only alternative to a Hamas rule in the Strip but is opposed by Israel. Netanyahu has tried to avoid any Palestinian rule there and even denied that the PA had any role in the administration of the Rafah border crossing into Egypt, despite evidence to the contrary. The PA is weak in the West Bank and has failed in its military operations against Iran backed terror groups in Jenin and elsewhere. The PA insists they alone would rule the Strip after they were violently ousted by Hamas in 2007, but if they would be able to, remains in doubt. Israel tried to enlist local clans to take on the responsibilities of a civilian government but failed. The defense minister Yoav Gallant also tried to divide Gaza into several dozen sectors to be individually managed, but that has failed as well. According to a report in the New York Times, the role filled by the PA I Rafah could indicate that Netanyahu was backing down in his opposition under pressure from Trump and the Gulf states and may allow it to take on more responsibilities, perhaps in cooperation with international forces or 'contractors.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An international force American security contractors are already operating in the Netzarim corridor, conducting security checks for vehicles heading to the northern areas of the Strip to prevent Hamas from smuggling weapons and terrorists. Thus far there are only 100 people assigned to the job and other than Egypt and Qatar no other Arab county has chosen to participate. But in Israel there are those who are hoping and planning for an influx of foreign forces who would take control and fill governing positions. Israeli officials quoted in the New York Times said the use of foreign forces could expand, with the support of Saudi Arabia and the UAE but they would demand guarantees that a Palestinian state would be advanced or the agreement of the PA for their involvement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s18myacoyl	2025-02-03T13:30:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/BJlDkHodkg/BJlDkHodkg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Freed Palestinian terrorists go from jail to luxury hotel	The former prisoners now reside at Al Masa Hotel in Egypt’s new administrative capital, where they have access to a gym, café, and snooker rooms; As Egypt grapples with a severe economic crisis, some are asking: Who is footing the bill? On Jan. 25, following the release of four IDF lookouts—Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, and Daniella Gilboa—from Hamas captivity in Gaza, Egypt swiftly prepared to receive 70 Palestinian prisoners, many serving life sentences or lengthy prison terms, who were exiled as part of a ceasefire agreement. According to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Egyptian sources said some of the released prisoners would remain in Egypt for the duration of their exile, while others would later relocate to other destinations in the Arab world and Europe. However, based on images and footage of their accommodations, it is unclear why they would be in any hurry to leave Cairo. The prisoners were welcomed at the opulent Al-Massa Hotel ('The Diamond'), located in Egypt’s newly constructed administrative capital east of Cairo. Their reception was lavish, attended by senior figures from Hamas’ political bureau and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. According to Al Jazeera, hundreds of people gathered outside the hotel, chanting 'Allahu Akbar' in support of the released prisoners despite the heavy security presence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Reports suggest negotiations were ongoing to determine the prisoners’ long-term residences, with Cairo described as merely a 'transit point.' However, images and videos from the event at Al-Massa revealed a grand affair, with the prisoners wearing specially branded hats and scarves for the occasion. Several Arab media outlets also published footage of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal attending the celebration at the hotel. Since the initial reception, no further images have emerged from the hotel, but following the release of Israeli hostages Ofer Kalderon, Yarden Bibas, and Keith Siegel on Saturday, another group of deported Palestinian prisoners arrived in Egypt. The Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that the seven prisoners released that day were also taken to Al-Massa, which is effectively serving as their temporary residence. The paper published additional images and videos of the newly arrived prisoners. There have been claims that the released prisoners were unable to leave the hotel premises, but given the luxurious accommodations, it is unclear why they would want to. Al-Massa is far from a mere 'transit point'—it is a sprawling luxury complex featuring a grand lobby, elegantly designed rooms, restaurants, a large fitness center, a spa, and conference halls. The hotel also boasts a sports club, snooker rooms, a shooting range, a cinema, a café, and even a mosque. Previously managed by the Egyptian military’s engineering division, the hotel was later taken over by Marriott International and rebranded as The St. Regis Al-Massa. According to reports, it was the first hotel completed in Egypt’s new administrative capital. In recent days, social media users have questioned why this particular hotel was chosen to host the released prisoners. Another lingering question remains: who is funding their extended stay? Are Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups footing the bill, or is Egypt—grappling with its own severe economic crisis—covering the costs? >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjacaj0ukx	2025-02-03T12:28:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ryWQuwGCuye/ryWQuwGCuye_0_0_1280_694_0_small.jpg

Torturned, held in inhumane conditions, barely seeing sunlight' ...	Shir Siegal says her father was strengthened by knowledge that Israelis were fighting for he release but disheartened by the division and incitement in the country; says he chose to wrap himself with flag and walk despite pain and weakness Keith Siegal was tortured physically and emotionally, starved and held in inhuman conditions, his family said in a statement on Monday. Siegal who was released from Gaza on Saturday suffered extreme weight loss. Siegal barely saw sunlight, his daughter Shir, said. 'He was held in isolation and often lost hope of ever returning home. 'He was in the darkest and scariest place on earth,' she said. 'My father passed 484 days knowing each moment could be his last, and that the terrorists could execute him if the military pressure increased, as he knew had been the fate of others among the captives. He went through hell that no one would ever be able to understand. Shir said her father chose to wrap himself with an Israeli flag when he returned to Israel and was flown to the Soratzky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. 'He chose to walk, despite the pain and weakness but inside he was broken hearted over what happened to our community on Oct. 7 and what the people of Israel must still endure.' Siegal's daughter said her father drew strength from the public's fight for the release of hostages and from the military's efforts to find and rescue them. 'In contrast he was broken by the violence, the divide and the incitement among Israelis. One of his first questions to us was what could he do to help bring all of the hostages, home?' she said. Siegal asked about what had happened in Kfar Aza, his kibbutz and home from which he was abducted. 'We went over the cruel list of 64 deal and beloved people who were murdered. He could not believe how many of his friends and neighbors were massacred. People from our community who will never return. My father came back to life and is begging us not to miss any more opportunities to save the hostages who are alive and bring those who are dead, to burial.' Shir said she had feared she would never see the moment that her father returned and had often lost hope fearing the worse. She then turned her comments to the families of fallen soldiers who died in the war. 'I am sorry bereavement came to your door so that we receive life. I apologize to civilians, soldiers and members of the security forces who sacrificed their lives for us, for the country and the security of each and every citizen.

However, we cannot ignore the price we are paying and the harsh images we are witnessing in Gaza—scenes of Hamas asserting its rule and control, and the cruelty and bloodthirsty hatred of many Gazans who support Hamas.' Smotrich said the war cannot end before Hamas is completely destroyed. 'If, heaven forbid, we do not achieve this, it will only be a matter of time before they regroup and launch the next massacre. We are determined and are preparing for this.' Netanyahu far-right coalition partner threatened to bring down the government if the prime minister proceeds to the next phase of the deal. He said he woudl support a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations but 'they must be based on truth and not on lies, such as the notion that Arabs have national rights in the Land of Israel,' he said. 'Furthermore, they must not come at the expense of the security of Israeli citizens, which includes achieving the objectives of the war: destroying Hamas’ military and governmental power, removing the threat, and returning all the hostages.' Smotrich told his faction that an agreement with Saudi Arabia cannot, come alongside providing hope to the terror-supporting Palestinian Authority or to Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza for the establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the State of Israel.' Earlier, Itamar Ben-Gvir head of the Otzma Yehudit Party who resigned from the government after the cease-fire deal was agreed, calling it a catastrophe, also addressed the Netanyahu-Trump meeting during his faction’s meeting. 'Netanyahu must return with commitments to resume fighting and dismantle Hamas. Without returning to the fight and toppling Hamas’ rule, any other declaration he receives will not change the unfortunate fact that the war’s objective has not been achieved. As long as there is no government willing to dismantle Hamas’ rule, I do not see myself—and Otzma Yehudit will not return—to the government.'

'The decisions we made during the war, combined with the bravery of IDF soldiers, have already changed the face of the Middle East,' Netanyahu continued. 'They have changed it beyond recognition. I believe that through hard work with President Trump, we can change it even more for the better.' 'We can strengthen Israel’s security, expand the circle of peace even further, and bring about a wonderful era we never dreamed of—an era of prosperity, security, and peace through strength. The strength of our soldiers, the strength of our citizens, the strength of Israel, and the strength of the alliance between Israel and the United States,' Netanyahu concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byhibu000yl	2025-02-03T09:56:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/01/rkXCYv7lvR/rkXCYv7lvR_0_115_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Sweden's Minister for Social Affairs said on X that the Swedish Security Service assessed that the Imam Ali Islamic Center in Stockholm was used by Iran as a platform to spy and conduct activities threatening security. 'This is extremely serious,' Jakob Forssmed said, and added that Sweden had stopped all state monetary aid to the centre. He added, without elaborating, that 'an additional process' was under way. 'State funds should not be used for activities that conflict with fundamental democratic values,' he said. The mosque could not be immediately reached for comment.

Trump to view clip of Hamas atrocities at Witkoff's urging	Envoy saw the film with images filmed by Hamas terrorists during their atrocities, when on a visit to Israel last week; officials say he was shaken and shocked and believed the president must also see the material U.S. President Donald Trump will for the first time, watch the 'clip of horrors' prepared by Israel using mostly footage filmed by the Hamas terrorists during their atrocities in the Oct. 7 massacre, ynet has learned. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff who saw the film during his visit to Israel last week, told Trump he must see it for himself, to truly understand what had happened on that day. Officials who were involved in Witkoff's visit said the envoy was shocked and shaken but what he had watched. Trump will be given a shortened from the original 47 minutes to a 20 to 30-minute version at most. The IDF's practice has been to insist that only a representative of the military showed the film but in the case of the president, that practice was set aside and there will be no Israeli officials present during the screening. Trump will see the clip, on Monday or Tuesday, likely before he is to beet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at 6 pm EST on Tuesday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy1lpvc001e	2025-02-03T07:27:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/ByVzgYbO1l/ByVzgYbO1l_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Jordan faces regional pressures as King Abdullah prepares for Whi...	Controversial proposal to resettle Gazans outside their territory has drawn strong regional opposition, all while Jordan is dealing with domestic unrest and a strained economy Jordan’s King Abdullah II is set to visit the White House later this month for a high-stakes meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Jordanian royal palace announced Sunday. This will be their first face-to-face discussion since Trump returned to office and revived a controversial idea: relocating Gazans outside their territory, a proposal that has been met with strong opposition from Jordan, Egypt, and other regional actors. Jordan’s firm rejection of Gaza resettlement Trump recently revealed that he had spoken with Abdullah about the matter, urging Jordan to accept some of Gaza’s population. 'I’d love you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess,' he told reporters aboard Air Force One. He left open the question of whether such resettlement would be temporary or permanent, stating, 'Could be either.' Abdullah has strongly rejected the proposal, reiterating Jordan’s long-standing position that Palestinians must remain on their land and obtain their legitimate rights through a two-state solution. During a meeting with European officials in Brussels last week, the king emphasized that Jordan would not support any alternative homeland for Palestinians. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi echoed this stance, as did foreign ministers from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar during a recent meeting in Cairo. In a joint statement, they condemned any attempts to displace Palestinians, forcibly or otherwise. This latest dispute comes as Jordan navigates a complex and evolving regional landscape. Long considered a stabilizing force in the Middle East, the Hashemite Kingdom now finds itself at the center of multiple crises, including shifting US policies, security threats at its borders, and growing domestic discontent over economic conditions. This proposal has further intensified tensions, with critics condemning it as forced displacement. MENA political analyst Dr. Nicolai Due-Gundersen, author of Defending Dictatorships, told The Media Line that while Jordan has historically taken in refugees—including those from the 1948 and 1967 wars, the Gulf conflicts, and the Syrian civil war—it is now at a breaking point. 'Jordan may not be willing to receive further refugees at a time when it is already stretched thin,' he said, citing economic difficulties and high youth unemployment. Jordanian political analyst Amer Sabaileh raised additional concerns, warning that an influx of refugees from Gaza could introduce security risks. 'We have seen how radical groups can exploit refugee crises, and this is a scenario Jordan must be prepared to prevent,' he told The Media Line. He further warned that the pressure may not stop with Gaza. 'Now Jordan is pressured into taking people from Gaza as a first wave. Later, the Trump administration may demand Jordan take in refugees from the West Bank as well. This is simply not manageable.' The case of Ahlam al-Tamimi In a separate development, Hamas’ Al-Aqsa TV reported that Jordan had sought the deportation of Ahlam al-Tamimi, a Palestinian terrorist convicted for her role in the 2001 Sbarro pizzeria bombing in Jerusalem, which killed 16 people, including two US citizens. Tamimi has lived in Jordan since her 2011 release in a prisoner exchange. The United States has long sought her extradition and continues to offer a $5 million reward for information leading to her capture. In 2022, Interpol dropped its warrant for Tamimi’s arrest, but US authorities still consider her a high-priority target. Jordan has not publicly commented on the report from Hamas’ media wing, and it remains unclear whether the government has taken formal steps to extradite her. The Palestinian identity debate in Jordan With nearly 2.2 million registered Palestinian refugees, Jordan holds the largest Palestinian population outside Palestine. The question of Palestinian identity has long shaped Jordan’s domestic politics, but some analysts believe the monarchy has over-prioritized Palestinian advocacy at the expense of national interests. 'Jordan made a huge mistake promoting itself as more Palestinian than the Palestinians,' Sabaileh argued, contending that this approach has led to resentment among Jordanian citizens. Due-Gundersen noted that Jordan’s support for Palestine plays a role in maintaining stability, but warned that agreeing to Trump’s plan could backfire, feeding into the argument that 'Jordan is Palestine'—a narrative the monarchy vehemently opposes. At the same time, Abdullah must manage growing domestic frustrations over Israeli policies while maintaining Jordan’s security cooperation with Israel. 'The king will likely not wish to fully freeze relations with Israel for security and intelligence reasons,' Due-Gundersen explained. However, this balancing act has sparked public protests, particularly among Jordan’s Palestinian population. Security threats at Jordan’s borders Beyond the political ramifications of the Gaza issue, Jordan faces ongoing security threats, particularly from narcotrafficking along its borders. The smuggling of Captagon, an amphetamine widely produced in Syria, has become a growing concern for Jordanian authorities. 'The network of Captagon and weapons smuggling was centralized under [Syrian President Bashar] Assad,' Due-Gundersen explained. 'Weapons smuggling drew more on tribes and networks close to the Syria-Jordan border on both sides.' Jordanian security forces have intercepted nearly 17 million Captagon pills in 2023 alone, highlighting the scale of the problem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sabaileh emphasized the level of organization behind the drug trade. 'It’s not drug trading, it’s narcotrafficking. When we talk about narcotrafficking, it’s more organized, more sophisticated with local partners. Nobody sends a huge amount of drugs to the borders if you don’t have a local dealer.' Jordan’s next steps As Jordan prepares for King Abdullah’s meeting with Trump, the stakes are high. Abdullah must navigate US pressure while safeguarding Jordan’s national interests and security. The rejection of forced Palestinian resettlement remains a cornerstone of Jordanian policy, but the kingdom’s broader geopolitical and domestic challenges require careful maneuvering. Due-Gundersen predicted that Jordan will likely maintain its role as a buffer state while resisting the relocation of Gaza’s population. 'While it may refuse to take in refugees from Gaza, it still hosts Syrian refugees, and with uncertainty remaining over Syria’s transition, it is possible that aid will continue to flow from various donors to Amman.' Sabaileh, however, cautioned that Jordan cannot rely on external aid indefinitely. 'Nobody wants to see Jordan collapse, but ultimately, its stability depends on the actions of its own leadership and people. Without proactive internal reforms and strategic decision-making, external support alone will not be enough to safeguard the country’s future.' As Jordan charts its course in an increasingly unstable region, the coming weeks will test Abdullah’s leadership, diplomatic skills, and ability to balance competing domestic and international pressures.

Ofer was put through hell in captivity, up until the last moment,...	Calderon tells family of the physical and psychological terror the hostages endure in the hands of Hamas; Cousin says images of joy in first days and hours, misleading, says Ofer drew strength from seeing family members protesting for his release Ofer Calderon who was released by Hamas on Saturday after 484 days in captivity told family members that the hostages endured physical and psychological terror of the worse kind, up until they were released. He said those who remain captive in the hands of the terrorists are in under imminent threat of death, after 38 hostages had already died. Calderon said he was able to see Al Jazeera coverage of the protests demanding his and the other hostages' release and recognized some of his family members. 'It strengthened him. In captivity you hang onto little things and seeing the family fighting for him was everything,' his cousin Eyal told Ynet. 'These things are critical to their survival there,' he said. Calderon's two children Sahar and Erez who were released in the first exchange in November, 2023. His parting words to Sahar were 'Fight for me. I don't want to die in the tunnels.' Calderon was released along with Yarden Bibas and soon after, Keith Siegal was also freed. The three men arrived in Israel walking on their own feet and appearing strong. Eyal warned that the images of the hostages who were freed were misleading. 'We've become experienced after Erez and Sahar's return. At first there is so much joy but very quickly there is an understanding that things are more complex. These images of adrenaline in the first hours and days, do not reflect the real condition of the hostages,' he said. 'It's difficult to understand or describe his emotions. He was held by a terror group that could do whatever they wanted with him.' Eyal vowed that the family will continue the fight for the release of the remaining 79 Israelis still in Gaza. He said the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal must not be foiled. 'My fight was to bring Ofer home. Now I will go on fighting for all the others.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1gimprd1g	2025-02-03T06:50:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/S10k9Piukl/S10k9Piukl_167_98_1007_566_0_small.jpg

Set be to released from Hamas captivity, Eli Sharabi faces an exc...	After months in captivity, Eli Sharabi returns to a shattered life—his wife and daughters murdered, his brother gone; His family prepares to support him as he faces unimaginable grief and the challenge of rebuilding his life from scratch 'I'm going through endless, overwhelming days. For the first time, I feel like I understand what the hostages must be experiencing, counting the seconds in the tunnels. When will Eli finally walk out of there on his own two feet?' said Sharon Sharabi, the brother of Eli Sharabi, who is set to be released in the first stage of the deal, and of Yossi Sharabi, who was murdered while in captivity in Gaza. Eli’s wife, Lian, and their two daughters, Yahel and Noya, were murdered on October 7. 'When we found out Yossi was murdered, I said to myself: we failed. When Eli comes home, I’ll say we succeeded,' Sharon explained. 'It’s not just me—an entire nation feels the same way. It feels like all our hearts are bursting with excitement. But alongside that, there’s so much pain. Pain for October 7, for these past 16 months, for the brother Eli lost, for his wife and daughters who are no longer with us. After everything he’s been through, he’s coming back to a completely different reality—a nightmare. Without his wife and daughters, without a home. 'I don’t think there’s any chance he knows Yossi didn’t survive. Maybe he knows about Lian and the girls—maybe some terrorist told him—but not about Yossi. When he comes back and finds out, his world is going to shatter all over again,' Sharon added. 'I don’t know how you prepare for such an insane situation. How do we tell him? When? There are no words that can comfort him after such devastating news. All we can do is hug him, show him that we’re here for him, and never leave his side.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharon shared that the first thing he’ll do after Eli comes home is mourn. The second is to help Eli rebuild his life. 'These are my life’s missions,' he said. 'I’m full of faith and hope that Eli will find his way out of this loop of grief and hold on to life. I’ve been listening to testimonies, learning, and processing—it might be similar to what Eli is experiencing. I know I’ll need to be the strong person by his side. Strong, but also sensitive.' Their mother will wait for Eli in Kibbutz Re’im. 'She’s so eager to see her survivor,' Sharon said, adding that he plans to meet his brother at the hospital. 'But this immense excitement is accompanied by a sense of loss. I know Yossi could have been on that same helicopter. We failed as a country in a big way. They were there far too long, and there were opportunities to save lives. The hostages are coming home, and we’re grateful to the politicians who were involved, but the ones who truly paved the way to bring them home were the IDF soldiers who gave their lives, and the bereaved families whose loved ones were murdered by the terrorists now being released. They’re the ones who deserve our gratitude.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkel0b0uyx	2025-02-03T06:00:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/SyLWkDsV4ye/SyLWkDsV4ye_0_41_1280_721_0_small.jpg
IDF expands West Bank counter-terror operation, residents flee	Jenin mayor says forces duplicating their offensive on Gaza, warns his city will be abandoned; Tulkarm mayor says Israel changing refugee camps' demographics The IDF has been conducting a counter-terror operation in the northern West Bank for the past 13 days, concentrating on the cities of Jenin and Tulkarm and their surroundings and on the villages bordering with the Jordan Valley. The aim is to destroy terror infrastructure, clear explosive devices on main routes and kill or arrest terrorists. An explosive and weapon-production lab was found and destroyed in Tulkarm and five suspects were detained. At the same time, forces detained terror suspects in Jenin and prepared the surrounding for an extensive stay in the refugee camp. As of Sunday, security forces said 35 people were killed and Palestinian sources said 29 of them were in Jenin while dozens more were hurt. Tulkarm governor Abdullah Kamil said on Monday that half of the city's residents fled. 'Tow hospitals are under siege, soldiers are attacking civilians in their homes, vandalizing and burning houses and destroying furniture in some,' he said. 'Israel is changing the camps' demographics and fighting every Palestinian, not only in the refugee camps.' He accused Israel of taking advantage of the presence of armed militants in villages and towns and that 1,500 families have been displaced from the city. The IDF said it was evacuating uninvolved civilians from the fighting, for their safety. They are allowed to leave through passageways after security checks. Jenin mayor and the governor of Tubas called for international intervention. 'Half the city's neighborhoods have been cut off from water and electricity,' Jenin mayor Mohammed Jerar said.

Crime cell stole over a ton of medical cannabis from licensed far...	Officers in central Israel arrest group that moved over one ton of medical cannabis to criminal bodies throughout the country while masquerading as legal drug handlers; Health Ministry shuts down licensed farm The Israel Police recently uncovered the theft of over 1.2 tons of medical cannabis from a licensed farm to criminal groups in Israel and arrested four suspects who posed as security guards involved in the crime. The case emerged in early December when central Israel detectives stopped a suspicious vehicle carrying two men with fake security credentials and 300 kilograms (661 lbs) of medical cannabis. The four suspects were indicted and the farm was shut down. The investigation found that the suspects used a sophisticated scheme, posing as security personnel legally transporting the drug while actually delivering the stolen cannabis to a secret warehouse in Azaria, a moshav in central Israel near Ramle, where two other accomplices awaited. Police uncovered five such transfers, totaling 1.281 tons. Due to the severity of the case and public safety risks, Israel Police Central District Commander Deputy Commissioner Yair Hetsroni issued an administrative closure order for the farm, later upheld by the court. The district's legal advisor also contacted the Health Ministry’s medical cannabis unit, which immediately revoked the farm’s license.

During visit to Russia, Musa Abu Marzook says Trupanov, abducted from his home in Nir Oz on October 7, will be released 'despite being a soldier' as a gesture to Moscow Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzook, during a visit to Moscow on Sunday, told Russia's Sputnik network that hostage Alexander (Sasha) Trupanov would be released soon. 'He will be freed in the first stage despite being a soldier,' Marzook said, calling it a gesture to Russia for its stance on the Palestinian issue. Abu Marzook also addressed the case of hostage Maxim Herkin, a Donbas native, saying his release would be decided in the negotiations about the cease-fire deal’s second phase with Israel. 'Hamas is ready to make him a top priority,' he said. Abu Marzook, Hamas' deputy political leader, is leading the terror group's delegation in meetings with Russian officials as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the U.S. for talks on the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Russia's RIA news agency reported that the Hamas delegation was holding talks with senior Russian officials 'as part of Moscow's engagement with key Middle East players, including Israel, Iran, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.' Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov told the news channel Rossiya 24 two weeks ago that Hamas leadership gave Moscow a 'firm commitment' that Trupanov 'will be released alive and well.' He said that 'Alexander Trupanov could be freed from Gaza within three to four weeks,' referring to a framework in which he was among 33 hostages set for release in the first stage as part of the sick and wounded category slated for release. He added that Moscow had information that Trupanov was wounded in Gaza. A day earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered efforts to be intensified to secure the release of Herkin, 36, from Tirat Carmel, who is not on the list of 33 hostages set for release. The previous week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow 'expects the release of hostage Sasha Trupanov from Gaza as part of the deal.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Russia welcomed the agreement and had raised 'the issue of his swift return home in our ongoing contacts with Hamas representatives.' Russia sought obligations from Hamas that Trupanov would be included in the deal. Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov spoke with Abu Marzook and, days earlier, with Hamas' foreign leader Khaled Mashal. Russia said Palestinian officials expressed appreciation for Moscow's efforts to support Palestinian rights and its stance on the issue. The officials were also briefed on cease-fire talks, with Bogdanov urging Hamas to ensure Trupanov's release. Trupanov, 29, an Israeli resident who also holds Russian citizenship, was kidnapped on October 7 along with his mother, Yelena, grandmother, Irina and girlfriend, Sapir Cohen, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The three women were released in the first hostage deal in late November 2023 after 54 and 55 days in captivity. His father, Vitaly, was murdered by a Hamas terrorist. The Islamic Jihad terror group has released several videos of Trupanov in captivity, the most recent about two months ago. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ie0xaojx	2025-02-03T03:42:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/Sk24uZ2v1e/Sk24uZ2v1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Pilots joined soldiers in arrest operations in Operation Iron Wall as part of new program; 'The mission of assisting the ground forces has reached a very high level in Gaza and Lebanon - we will continue to train for effectiveness in all sectors,' said deputy squadron commander; Meanwhile, the IDF and Shin Bet plan to expand the use of airstrikes The Israeli Air Force has launched a new program, which is intended to strengthen cooperation between ground forces operating in Operation Iron Wall in the West Bank with pilots and air crew members. The program was initiated by Air Force Commander, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, and as part of it the deputy commander of the Operation Strike Squadron in the sector participates every few days in arrest operations with ground forces in West Bank villages and cities. The deputy commander of Squadron 109 last week joined a complex operation in the West Bank under the command of the reserve battalion of the 8109th Samaria Brigade. Over the course of a day, the deputy commander of the squadron spent time with the battalion's commanders and fighters, learning up close the combat methods, challenges and threats in the field, and gaining a new perspective on the needs of the ground forces. At the same time, the ground forces commanders were exposed to the depth of the Air Force's operational concept, which contributes to improving operational coordination. The program offers creative solutions to strengthen and deepen air-ground cooperation, drawing lessons from events in the Iron Swords War. 'I arrived at the Samaria Air Force Base to get to know the area and the missions up close, and in the future to better assist soldiers on the ground in any complex event that may develop in the sector,' said the deputy commander of Squadron 109, Major Y. 'The mission of assisting the ground forces has reached a very high level in Gaza and Lebanon, and we will continue to train and practice so that we are effective in all sectors, at all times.' Cooperation between ground forces and air forces has become an indispensable product in the war in various sectors. 'What would have taken hours a few months ago now happens in minutes. The battalion commander in the field knows what he wants to attack, and the target is attacked within minutes,' explains a security source. Operation Iron Wall, for example, began with an opening blow that included air strikes in the heart of the Jenin refugee camp. With the expansion of the operation to Tulkarm, the IDF has continued to use aircraft to attack terrorist cells from the air. In recent years, airstrikes have become a central tool in the West Bank, and are used to thwart fleeing terrorists, prevent attacks, neutralize IEDs, and even strike during ongoing attacks. The Shin Bet and the IDF plan to expand the use of this tool, and over the coming weeks pilots and squadron commanders will stay in various sectors in the West Bank each for 24 hours, in order to improve cooperation with ground forces.

On Sunday afternoon, the IDF announced that as part of the operation to thwart terrorism in the northern West Bank, the IDF destroyed buildings in Jenin that were used as terrorist infrastructure. Dramatic footage shows the moment the houses were blown up, and according to the Palestinians, nearly 20 buildings in the Jenin refugee camp were blown up. The operation in Tamun began with a ground maneuver by the forces, with the main focus of the operation being a rapid entry into the village for various purposes of locating, seizing, and entrenching. At the same time, the IDF attacked from the air with an opening strike, followed by the arrival of heavy equipment - excavators and bulldozers - which opened up traffic routes for the ground forces, so that they could begin searching for weapons and arresting suspects. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjp5pm0uyl	2025-02-03T02:19:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkGag81Tuyx/rkGag81Tuyx_0_204_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The prosecutor's office filed an indictment against four suspects who posed as security guards and stole medical cannabis from a licensed cultivation farm with a total weight of 1.281 tons. The farm's license was revoked, and a closure order was issued for the location. In December 2024, Ramla police detectives detained a suspicious vehicle in an operational activity, with a driver and passenger who presented fake security guard IDs, with more than 300 kilograms of medical cannabis in their vehicle. The two, who worked at the farm, posed as security guards, when in reality they planned to transfer the cannabis to criminal elements. In the continuation of the investigation, the police were able to identify four additional transfers using a similar method.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1tlzmrujl	2025-02-03T01:58:09-08:00

The 'Smurfs' who fought for Ofer Calderon's release	Members of cycling group that former hostage was a part of recall their efforts to keep him in their hearts and minds at all times and their short reunion before his arrival at the hospital As former hostage Ofer Calderon arrived at the hospital in Israel, he took a moment to ask the van to stop so he could wave to a group of longtime friends – members of 'The Smurfs' cycling group who had waited 15 months for his return. The group, active for over a decade, dedicated every ride in recent months to his safe return. Unable to stay home at the time of his release, they cycled to the closest point they could reach. 'We're a unique group from all over the country. We've been riding together for 13 years,' said Navit Hermesh, one of the group’s veteran members. 'We meet in small teams and take an annual trip abroad.' Attorney Shai Rave, known as 'Papa Smurf' among the riders, explained: 'During the week, we’re busy with work, but we ride together on Fridays. We have 30–40 members of all ages and we love riding in the Judean Desert, the Gaza border region and the Golan Heights. Our full name is 'The Smurfs: Riders, Reasonable and Mediocre.'' Since the October 7 attack and Calderon's abduction, the group remained focused on that day. 'It's been a troubling time,' Hermesh said. 'The worst part was losing Oren Goldin, the youngest in our group, who was murdered in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. He was the first to leave the gate, leaving behind a wife and twins.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We stay in touch with his family and held a memorial ride for him,' she added. 'When Ofer was kidnapped, it felt like the ground was pulled from under us. We barely rode for six months, focusing instead on keeping his memory alive. Seeing him again felt like our hearts began beating again.' 'We carried signs with Ofer’s name In every ride in Israel and abroad,' Rave added. 'We wrote his name on stones. He was always with us – at work, at home. I have a picture of him in my office. People talk about the families of the victims and hostages, but each of them also has close-knit circles of friends. We felt like Ofer’s family.' 'I had an 'Our heart is held captive' necklace, half of which symbolized Ofer,' Hermesh noted. 'It stayed with me through difficult times and I can't wait to give it to him when we meet.' Calderon was flown to the hospital by the son of a fellow Smurf. 'That’s how we got live updates about his flight,' Hermesh said. 'We planned to meet at a friend's house in Ramat Gan and ride to the hospital. When we arrived at the helipad, the security realized they had no choice but to let us follow the car taking him to the ward. 'When he stepped out of the car, he was only 10 meters away, waving and smiling. I couldn’t hold back — I lay down on the grass. We’re in a completely different place now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skgjll0d1e	2025-02-03T00:51:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rJd311T300yl/rJd311T300yl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Despite denials, Palestinian Authority is managing Gaza's Rafah C...	Senior officials confirm that Israel has given up its presence at the Rafah crossing, which contributed to delay of the hostage deal; The PA operates the crossing together with international parties, but the government hid this from the public The Rafah crossing has been operating for two days, managed in cooperation with Palestinian Authority officials, contrary to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements. Among the PA officials involved in running the crossing are senior Fatah official who manage it in cooperation with a special European force and with Egyptian security officials who assist in securing the place from Islamist Salafi terrorist elements. Israel is involved for the time being with approving those who cross it, and only in one direction: out of Gaza. Contrary to denials from Netanyahu's office, the official spokesman for the Palestinian Authority police, Louy Izriqat, told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth Sunday that Fares a-Rifi has been appointed to manage the police station at the Rafah Crossing, which opened Sunday. Rifi, a resident of Gaza City, was a police officer in the central governorates of the Gaza Strip on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, and holds a bachelor's degree in law and an advanced degree in police science from the Police College in Yemen. He is considered an active Fatah figure in the Gaza Strip. His brother congratulated him in a post: 'The legitimate Palestinian police are the ones who will control and maintain security at the Rafah crossing under the command of Fares a-Rifi.' The Palestinian force stationed there includes seven policemen and two policewomen, all of whom previously worked on behalf of the PA at the border crossings of the Gaza Strip, and are now returning to work in the same role. The political sensitivity of the issue in Israel is clear to everyone, which is why Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas asked his people not to be interviewed. However, Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth learned that for many weeks now PA officials, in cooperation with Egyptian intelligence, have been in feverish contact with IDF officials, the Civil Administration, the Coordinator of Government Activities, and the Shin Bet in Cairo to prepare the cooperation that led to the opening of the Rafah crossing. The Palestinian Authority began preparations to control the crossing over the past month. The head of the Palestinian Authority's crossings authority Nazmi Mohanna, a resident of Jericho, and the deputy director general of the PA's Ministry of Civil Affairs Ayman Qandil, a Ramallah resident, have been intensively attending meetings with security officials in Egypt in order to open and manage the Rafah crossing. Mahmoud al-Habbash, an adviser to Abbas, said that 'the Rafah crossing will be managed according to the 2005 agreement, that's all.' The 'crossings agreement' concluded between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 2005 stipulates that the Rafah crossing will be managed by the Palestinian Authority, in cooperation with Egypt, and under the supervision of a force from the European Union. According to a senior Palestinian official, the PA was instructed not to mention the new management and procedures at the Rafah crossing so as not to upset Israel. The obstacle to the deal The sensitivity of operating the crossing in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority is twofold, and stems from internal political reasons in Israel. This is one of the internal coalition reasons why the Israeli government and its leader delayed the deal for at least six months, and some argue since the collapse of the previous deal. The first reason: The IDF and security officials have claimed over the past year that there can be no military victory that does not include Israeli rule over all of Gaza, without creating an alternative to Hamas. The professional consensus was that a 'day after' solution must be promoted in the Strip to prevent Hamas rule and that it must include the PA, with international financial and manpower reinforcements. Netanyahu, whether this was his own opinion or fear of the coalition falling apart, claimed that he would not give the Palestinian Authority any foothold, thereby effectively thwarting discussions about the day after. The second reason: As part of the obstacles Netanyahu added to his demands in the deal after the parties were very close to an agreement, he demanded control of the Rafah crossing. 'I and one other minister (Ron Dermer) were the only ones in the war cabinet who prevented the Palestinian Authority from controlling the Rafah Crossing,' he said on one occasion. 'We will not allow the Palestinian Authority to control the Gaza Strip, and we are working to thwart any of its control.' In the hasty press conference he convened in September, after the murder of the six hostages in the Tel a-Sultan tunnel and to explain why he opposed the deal, Netanyahu called the Rafah Crossing and the Philadelphi Corridor 'Hamas' oxygen pipeline,' and declared that Israel would not withdraw from them. The Rafah crossing did not appear to interest Netanyahu until he raised it as one of the obstacles to the deal. On the morning of July 3, intelligence sources estimated that Hamas was going to give a relatively positive answer, though with many more difficulties and insistences. By the evening, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich already knew that 'I would not be surprised if suddenly, after months of refusal, Sinwar responds positively to the offer he received for the deal.' This is to say that everything must be done to prevent the deal, which Israel had proposed. The next day, Sinwar did give the same relatively positive answer that was received by large parts of the negotiating team who thought there was a chance of a breakthrough. Then, suddenly, on July 11, in Netanyahu's speech at the end of an officers' course at the 1st Battalion, nine months after the outbreak of the war, the Israeli presence at the crossing and at Netzarim is mentioned as a condition that Israel will not give up. 'We will not allow weapons smuggling to Hamas from Egypt, first and foremost through Israeli control of the Philadelphia route and the Rafah crossing,' he said. Six months passed, during which many hostages and soldiers died, and a deal was concluded in which Netanyahu withdrew from almost all of the conditions that had sabotaged the previous deal. On January 22, the Arabi-language, London-based Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported that an agreement had been reached on the mechanism for controlling the Rafah crossing - which the IDF took over in May. According to a source in the joint cease-fire monitoring team, 'the parties reached an agreement regarding the management of the crossing on the Palestinian side. It was agreed that it would be managed by the Palestinian Authority, under international supervision and monitoring by the UN.' The Prime Minister's Office denied this: 'The report is not true despite the Palestinian Authority's attempts to create a false impression that it controls the crossing. According to the agreement, IDF forces surround the crossing and no one passes through it without prior control, supervision and approval from the IDF and the Shin Bet.' The statement also said that the 'technical management within the crossing is carried out by non-Hamas Gazans, who are vetted by the Shin Bet, and who have been managing civil services in the Strip since the beginning of the war, such as electricity, water, and sewage. Their work is supervised by the international force EUBAM.' This formulation denies without actually denying the main point and the documents have not been made public. The agreement is vague The appendix to the main agreement states in Article 5 that 'the Rafah Crossing will be ready for the transfer of civilians and wounded after the release of all women (civilians and soldiers). Israel will work to prepare the crossing as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement.' The agreement explicitly states that the forces will only 'redeploy around the Rafah Crossing in accordance with the attached maps.' In other words, the IDF and Israel will not be present at the crossing itself. In addition, it was stated that '50 wounded fighters will be allowed to cross daily, accompanied by three people. Each crossing will require Israeli and Egyptian approval.' It also stated that 'the crossing will be activated in accordance with the discussions that took place with Egypt in August 2024.' The words '50 wounded fighters' refer to 50 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who will leave for Egypt daily, accompanied by three additional people who may also be Hamas members. The agreement stipulates that the lists of those who are to pass, provided by the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry, will be given the day before to Egypt and Israel, who will have to approve them. It is likely that Israel will not let senior Hamas figures leave, but will let everyone else. Fifty Hamas members a day is a lot, even if it is only for the first phase of the cease-fire. At the moment, this is a one-way passage: only from Gaza to Egypt, and not the other way around. Therefore, at least for now, from Israel's perspective a Hamas member who leaves cannot return according to a vague agreement. Israel says that this matter should be discussed as part of the second phase of the deal. It is still unclear how the mediating countries will approach the matter and whether they will also demand the opening of the other direction. The Rafah Crossing was destroyed and burned in the fighting that Israel waged when it entered it in early May. The crossing facilities are unusable, so the mediators, together with the PA, had to bring in several temporary structures to carry out the checks and procedures for leaving Gaza. All of this is happening in the meantime in a way that is hidden from the Israeli public due to political reasons, but as stated in the agreement between Israel and Hamas. But the big question is how long the agreement will last, and whether the parties will be able to reach an agreement on the second phase. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Negotiations regarding the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal are scheduled to begin no later than Sunday, 16 days after the cease-fire came into effect. Senior officials in Israel and the mediating countries expressed serious concern on Sunday that it will blow up. Some fear that in between two weeks and a month Israel will announce that the negotiations - within the framework of which the remaining living hostages are supposed to return and the IDF is supposed to withdraw from the Strip - have run aground and are in fact hopeless because Muhammad Sinwar is making unreasonable demands. These words were echoed over the weekend in a report through channels which says that 'an understanding has formed' in Israel that Hamas will not return the remaining live hostages and therefore Israel will be forced to return to war. Military sources, including those whose work is related to the negotiating team, said that Israel does not have such information. 'Basically, nothing is coming together,' says a senior Israeli official. 'To conclude and finalize the Saudi deal, which will also include an international solution for Gaza and allow Netanyahu to risk dissolving the government, it will take no less than four months. To sign a second phase of the deal in the immediate term, Netanyahu will have to take a risk and take it without all the 'goodies' of a Saudi normalization deal. And that, he will tell Trump, is too big a risk. That's why the deal is destined to explode.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkd00iz0o1l	2025-02-03T00:36:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/B1Je4Ppdyg/B1Je4Ppdyg_0_156_1280_721_0_small.jpg

On Monday the prime minister will meet with Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, in what will mark the opening of negotiations for phase two of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Netanyahu's meeting with Trump is scheduled for Tuesday evening (6:00 p.m. in Washington and 1 a.m. in Israel). The meeting was scheduled to take place a few hours earlier, but was postponed at the request of the White House. Sources who work with Witkoff said that watching the feature film about the October 7 massacre while he was in Israel seemed to have had a profound effect on him. He is very involved in the issue of the hostages, and his commitment to the issue is profound. Families of hostages asked to join the prime minister's flight to Washington, but they were refused. Several family members, including Einav Zangauker - the mother of Matan Zangauker - arrived in Washington on commercial flights. Netanyahu is also scheduled to meet with family members of hostages during his visit. On Wednesday, Netanyahu will visit the Pentagon and meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. In addition, Netanyahu will meet with Congressional and Senate leaders, evangelical leaders, and the designated U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, during the week. After, contrary to the agreements, Arbel Yehoud was not released in either of the first two rounds of hostage releases, Israel decided not to open the Netzarim Corridor to allow the movement of Gazans north. After the images of horror from the release of Arbel and Gadi Mozes, in the third round that was brought forward, the release of terrorists from Israeli prisons was delayed and angry messages were sent to the mediators in Israel. The question now is what leverage remains to continue the deal - with 79 hostages still in captivity, and 20 of them scheduled to return during Phase 1 of the deal. Those 20 hostages include 15 men (eight over the age of 50 and seven wounded and sick), the three members of the Bibas family, whose lives are in serious danger, and Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held captive in Gaza for a decade. Eight of those 20 hostages are no longer alive. Last week, after Hamas's violation of the agreement, preventing the return of the displaced and the updated agreement, Ynet security commentator Ron Ben Yishai wrote that the return of the displaced is not the only significant lever of pressure that Israel has at the present stage. There is the humanitarian aid - the pace of which Israel controls in the Gaza Strip, and if there are blatant violations of the agreement the IDF is still in a position where it can maneuver without difficulty wherever it is needed. After those horrific images in the southern Gaza Strip during the liberation of Arbel and Gadi, Israel sent a harsh message to Qatar and Egypt, announcing that 'it has a great many levers of pressure that it can immediately apply if the scenes are repeated - and not a hair on the head of the hostages will be harmed.' One of the levers of pressure is the Rafah crossing , which opened on Tuesday to allow the exit of wounded Palestinians - most of them from Hamas. Israel could close it in the event of future violations of the agreement. Hamas wanted very much to open the crossing, and this was also one of the reasons that led it to agree to two phases of releasing hostages within 48 hours. In a week, on the 22nd day of the deal, Israel is scheduled to withdraw from the center of the Gaza Strip - including the Netzarim Corridor - eastward to the area along the border. Hamas violations could lead to a change. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another lever of pressure is, of course, the release of the terrorists. For every adult or wounded hostage that Hamas releases Israel will release 30 adult and sick terrorists (who have up to 15 years left in prison). Alongside this, in addition to releasing the terrorists, Israel is also to release 1,000 Gazans who were arrested after the October 7 massacre. Some 111 of them were released on Saturday, and the rest will be released in the following rounds. The agreement stipulates additional clauses, from which Israel may also withdraw - at least partially - in the event of future violations of the agreement. These clauses include: the beginning of the rehabilitation of infrastructure (electricity, water, sewage, communications and roads) throughout the Gaza Strip, and the entry of an agreed amount of equipment necessary for civil defense; facilitating the entry of supplies for the settlement of the displaced - 60,000 caravans and 200,000 tents; and the beginning of the necessary arrangements and plans for the reconstruction of the houses , civilian facilities and civilian infrastructure destroyed during the war in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1lefapukg	2025-02-02T20:45:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/H13mrITu1e/H13mrITu1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Jewish schools see renewed interest after Hamas massacre, says Ya...	I would say that we see many more people everywhere going to Jewish schools, Jewish synagogues, and community spaces than ever before' The October 7 Hamas massacre brought many Jews closer to their faith, according to Chaya Yosovich, CEO of the Yael Foundation. In an interview with ILTV News, she explained how, following the attack, the Yael Foundation—which funds groundbreaking programs ranging from innovative curricula to educator training and scholarships—took swift action. Within three days, the organization ensured that all its programs had the necessary security measures in place to keep children and families safe. At the same time, while some parents chose not to send their children to Jewish schools out of fear for their safety, many others reconnected with their faith and community. 'I would say that we see many more people everywhere going to Jewish schools, Jewish synagogues, and community spaces than ever before,' Yosovich said. 'They do feel closer. They feel like, you know, something has shaken them up, and they are looking for it.'

Will the U.S. take the lead in a future attack against Iran?	ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman says it is 'unlikely' that America will launch an attack against the Islamic regime Will the U.S. take the lead in a future attack against Iran? This is a question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely ask U.S. President Donald Trump during their meeting on Tuesday. However, according to ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman, it is 'unlikely' that America will launch an attack against the Islamic regime. 'In Trump's inauguration speech, he made it very clear that he wants to be a unifier and a pacifier. He said he wants to be remembered for the wars that America did not enter,' Hoffman explained. 'On the other hand, Trump approved the big bunker busters, the large bombs that Israel would need in order to carry out such an attack.' She said part of the discussion on Iran will need to focus on the timeline. How will Israel and the U.S. coordinate? If Israel is going to attack Iran, should it target nuclear facilities? Should it go after energy infrastructure, such as oil facilities? Or will Israel wait until the U.S. reimposes a series of sanctions against the Iranian regime, potentially empowering the people to rise up and overthrow it?

What happened to the hostages during more than 480 days of captiv...	The testimonies of the freed hostages so far are harrowing—ranging from prolonged isolation to immense physical and psychological abuse Four male hostages are officially home after their release on Saturday. The testimonies of the freed hostages so far are harrowing—ranging from prolonged isolation to immense physical and psychological abuse. Each hostage has their own story, experiences, and traumas. Ofer Calderon, Keith Siegel, and Yarden Bibas are the latest hostages to return home after more than 484 days in Hamas captivity. While all three men miraculously walked out of Gaza on their own two feet, their time in captivity tells a much darker story. According to Israeli media reports, all three men were held in harsh conditions, frequently moved to different locations, and had little food. Keith Siegel, 65, is the first American-Israeli hostage to be released in this deal. Kidnapped from Kfar Aza, reports indicate that Siegel was held in Gaza City with other hostages. He was occasionally kept in tunnels but spent most of his time locked in rooms inside various homes to avoid detection. With barely any food, Siegel—who is a vegetarian—was forced to eat meat to survive. Hamas released a propaganda video of Siegel last April. Reports state that Bibas and Calderon were held together at the beginning of their captivity, brutally beaten by terrorists, locked in cages, and subjected to both physical and psychological abuse. The men say they were held underground and in buildings, frequently relocated, and at times held with other hostages. At the time of Calderon’s release, Hamas dressed him in military clothing, treating him as if he were a reservist soldier. Yarden Bibas, 36, was taken from Nir Oz. He walked out of Hamas captivity without his wife, Shiri, and their two young children, Kfir and Ariel, who remain hostages. According to the framework of the deal, they were supposed to be released on the first day of the agreement, but they remain in captivity. Bibas said he was constantly relocated in Khan Younis and even learned Arabic. According to reports, he endured horrific psychological abuse, including being forced to make a video claiming his wife and children were killed in an IDF airstrike in November 2023. He said his captors constantly spoke about them to torment him. New details have also emerged about released hostage Gadi Moses, who was held alone for his entire 15 months in captivity. He reported that every five days, he was given a single bowl of water and a cup to shower. He lost 15 kilograms during his time in captivity. The five Thai nationals released said they were held in underground tunnels, where they struggled to breathe and were not always given food. Meanwhile, the mother of Emily Damari, who was freed in the first hostage release of this deal, revealed that her daughter was held in UNRWA facilities, where her captors refused to provide her with medical treatment. Damari lost two fingers in captivity after being shot on October 7. The Bibas family released a statement saying that 'a quarter of their heart' has returned home after 15 months, as Yarden comes back to an unbearable reality. They continue to call for the release of Shiri and the children.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1c00pstoyg	2025-02-02T17:24:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/B1yuXpj00yl/B1yuXpj00yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
State witness against Netanyahu files $1.6M lawsuit over alleged ...	Disturbing details: Shlomo Filber alleges severe abuse, including sexual assault and humiliation, during his detention and interrogation, claiming a coerced confession; The state's witness against Netanyahu is also suing over unlawful use of spyware on his phone Shlomo Filber, the state witness in the case against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday filed a lawsuit against senior officials in the law enforcement system. In the lawsuit, he claimed he endured 'abuse and humiliation' during the investigation. The following details might prove disturbing. Filber alleges that he was sexually assaulted during a search of his private areas conducted by a prison officer. The lawsuit, in which he demands over $1.6 million in compensation, was filed against several individuals, including former Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, former State Attorney Shai Nitzan, Deputy State Attorney Liat Ben-Ari, and the prosecutor in the case, Yehudit Tirosh. Filber’s attorneys detailed in the lawsuit: 'During his arrest and interrogation, particularly in the stages leading up to his signing of the state witness agreement, the defendants subjected Filber to seven circles of hell in a severe campaign of abuse. This culminated in a brutal act of sodomy committed by a prison officer at Hadarim Prison the night before he signed the agreement.' According to Filber's lawsuit, the assault, which he also testified about during Netanyahu’s trial, was 'the result of premeditated planning and was deliberately carried out with the involvement of all the defendants, aiming to crush his dignity, humiliate him, and break his spirit.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Filber’s attorneys further argue that the alleged abuse and the humiliating search 'led to the confessions extracted from him and caused him to sign the state witness agreement while in a completely unstable mental state.' They claimed that, during the search, 'he was ordered to completely undress as part of his admission to Hadarim Prison as a detainee. During this process, his naked body was groped by a prison officer, who then committed a brutal act of sodomy against him.' In July of last year, Filber filed a lawsuit for approximately $130,000 against the state and police, alleging invasion of privacy and violation of personal space in the spyware affair. The lawsuit stated: 'Police conducted a covert criminal investigation against Filber, during which they infiltrated his mobile phone using spyware.' Filber and his wife also sued the state, claiming the police used spyware to extract information from both his and his wife’s mobile phones. 'Under the guise of a wiretapping warrant, but in blatant and severe violation of that warrant and in clear breach of the law, the investigating unit used a hacking tool known as ‘The System’ (publicly identified as Pegasus spyware) to infiltrate Filber’s mobile phone and extract a significant amount of personal and private information,' according to the lawsuit. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1xkyd6ojl	2025-02-02T13:59:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/06/29/ryVmZyOFcc/ryVmZyOFcc_0_23_2784_1568_0_small.jpg
Australia hits right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' with sancti...	Australia on Monday imposed sanctions on extreme right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' as part of its efforts to combat a rise in antisemitism and online extremism, and after similar moves by Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government's move would make it a criminal offense to engage with 'Terrorgram' and it would also help prevent children from becoming caught up in far-right extremism. 'Terrorgram is an online network that promotes white supremacy and racially-motivated violence,' Wong said in a statement. 'It is the first time any Australian Government has imposed counterterrorism financing sanctions on an entity based entirely online.' Offenders will face up to 10 years in jail and heavy fines, she said. The Australian government has also re-listed and hit other right-wing groups with sanctions including the National Socialist Order, the Russian Imperial Movement, Sonnenkrieg Division and The Base for counterterrorism financing sanctions, Wong said. Australia has also seen an escalating series of attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023, sparking fear among Australia's nearly 115,000 Jewish citizens.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkjxr00tuyg	2025-02-02T13:45:19-08:00	
Emily Damari returns to the house in Kfar Aza from where she was ...	Damari returned to the house in Kfar Aza where she was kidnapped and posted on Instagram: 'I came back to my home, to the oxygen I nearly lost, to the place where my nightmares began 485 days ago – and I've closed only part of the circle I longed to complete' On a sofa bearing the sign 'From this home, Emily Tehila Damari was kidnapped,' the freed hostage, who returned to her home in Kfar Aza for the first time, posted on Instagram: 'I'm Back.' Accompanying her on the visit was freed hostage Romi Gonen, who later replied on Instagram: 'My sister from captivity.' Liekwise, IDF field observer Liri Albag, who was released after them wrote in response: 'We will fight for everyone through fire and water.' 'Today I returned to my home, to my apartment, to the oxygen I had that was nearly gone. I returned to the place where all my nightmares began, 485 days ago, and I have closed only part of the circle that I so longed to close,' Damari wrote, adding: 'Like me, there are 79 other hostages who need to complete the circle and are waiting to fill the missing pieces. We must not stop here; we must bring everyone back home – life for the survivors and honor for the fallen. I will feel my true victory only when they all return.' Tom, Emily’s brother, posted an Instagram photo of his sister with Romi Gonen during their visit to Kfar Aza, with a picture of Aviv Baram – a close friend of Emily’s killed on Oct. 7 – visible in the background. 'Emily came today to close a circle – to conquer her personal victory and return to the place where she was kidnapped by the monsters of Hamas. She returned there with her family and accompanied by someone who joined our family and became an inseparable part of it, Romi Gonen. Romi and Emily became one, and it’s so amazing to see,' he wrote. 'Their unspoken understanding, eye to eye – sometimes without uttering a word. There was a moment during this complicated day when my heart truly clenched. Emily and Romi sat on a bench beneath the olive trees by the arms depot, with Aviv Baram’s picture in front of them,' he continued, adding: 'This moment was so complete, yet at the same time so empty. That’s exactly how the prisoner swap agreement feels. It is a great joy to see our captives returning, and a sick feeling in my stomach to see buses of lowly murderers being released. I am so sorry for what you are going through and for the unimaginable loss; I truly hope that as a people we become worthy of them and of you.' Emily, a British citizen, was freed from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip during the first phase of the current swap along with Rumi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher. Immediately upon her release, she became a symbol of bravery after pushing one of the Hamas terrorists out of the vehicle that brought her to the Red Cross pickup point – and during a phone call, she shared a striking victory image with her brother by showing him her severed fingers. Until her release, Emily was the only British citizen held in Gaza and no sign of life was offered during her captivity. On the morning of Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists stormed her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, killed her dog and kidnapped her from the kibbutz young generation neighborhood. Her mother, Mandy, also hid when terrorists broke into their home — and survived after a bullet struck the door lock of the room where she was hiding, jamming it so the terrorists could not enter. About a week and a half before Emily’s release, her mother pleaded, 'Emily, Lolo, if somehow you can hear me, know that we all love you here to the moon and back. Not a second goes by without us thinking of you, praying for you, fighting so you can return home alive.' On Friday, Mandy revealed that her daughter was held at a facility run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. She said she spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, thanked him for his support and assistance, and added that 'Hamas held Emily at UNRWA facilities and denied her access to medical treatment after she was shot twice.' 'It’s a miracle that she survived.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjuyhlau1e	2025-02-02T13:35:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkdphm6Oke/rkdphm6Oke_0_308_1123_632_0_small.jpg
North Korea criticizes Rubio, says it will respond strongly to US...	North Korea on Monday criticized U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a 'rogue state' in a media interview, saying his comments do not help U.S. interests, state media KCNA said. North Korea's foreign ministry said the country will respond strongly to hostile U.S. provocations, KCNA reported. It is North Korea's first criticism of the Trump administration since President Donald Trump reentered the White House on Jan. 20, Yonhap news agency said. The ministry also condemned United States' new missile defense shield plan, saying that it makes it necessary for North Korea to strengthen its own military power, KCNA reported. Trump last week signed an order that 'mandated a process to develop an 'American Iron Dome,'' a next-generation U.S. missile defense shield against ballistic, hypersonic, cruise missile and other forms of aerial attack.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1rx2paojg	2025-02-02T13:06:34-08:00	
Incoming IDF Chief of Staff: '2025 will continue to be a year of ...	Eyal Zamir, set to become the 24th IDF chief of staff, said Israeli will produce its own weapons and emphasized the need to reduce reliance on foreign arms; He faces major challenges, including Gaza, Iran and integration of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military The day after his appointment as the next IDF Chief of Staff, Major General (Res.) Eyal Zamir, currently the director general of the Ministry of Defense, delivered his first speech following the announcement of his selection as the intended successor to Herzi Halevi. Despite cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon, 'the year 2025 will continue to be a year of combat,' said Zamir during the Ministry of Defense’s work plan conference. 'The war has proven that we must only rely on ourselves,' said Zamir, who is expected to assume the role of Chief of Staff on March 6. 'We were all raised on the principle that 'The State of Israel will defend itself by itself.' Now, I am telling you that Israel will also produce its own weapons independently, in the face of any threat or scenario. During the war, we restarted production lines that had been shut down, expanded existing production lines, and established new manufacturing capabilities. Reducing our dependence on the world benefits security, the economy and industry. This will also prove itself in defense exports.' The incoming IDF chief of staff added: 'We are in a global arms race – a technological race. In our region, there is no room for mercy. Our neighbors, from Iran to Gaza, from Yemen to Beirut and Damascus, misjudge us. The people of Israel and the IDF are strong. During moments of crisis, a fighting spirit emerges in our people. We must salute the IDF, its soldiers, and its commanders. They saved the State of Israel. The Ministry of Defense provided the IDF with the tools, support and safety net needed to complete its mission. 'During the war, the IDF rose from the depths. Enemies on all fronts were defeated, and their leaders are now buried beneath the rubble. But the campaign is not over, and challenges remain ahead. We must remember the heavy price we paid in lives lost and wounded. The year 2025 will continue to be a year of combat. The Ministry of Defense must continue to build strength and support IDF needs and national security missions.' 'In the coming days, I will conclude my role as director general of the Ministry of Defense,' Zamir said. 'I feel that I am leaving behind a strong, leading and powerful ministry that is focused on its primary mission, which I defined during the second day of the war – providing the military and the defense establishment with the breathing room they need.' He also expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to lead the IDF. 'I want to thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz for their trust in selecting me as the 24th IDF chief of staff,' he said. 'We will show our enemies that they face a determined, powerful, and victorious force, as it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'I will pursue my enemies and overtake them, and I will not turn back until they are destroyed.'' From tank commander to chief of staff Zamir’s appointment as chief of staff still requires approval from the Advisory Committee for Senior Appointments, and final government approval. Assuming these are secured, Zamir, who was already considered the leading candidate, is expected to assume his role next month, following the resignation of outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. With this appointment, Zamir will become the first tank officer to serve as Chief of Staff since David (Dado) Elazar in the 1970s. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Upon entering his new role, Zamir will face significant challenges alongside ongoing combat efforts. These include appointing a new Deputy Chief of Staff and a new commander for the Southern Command to replace Major General Yaron Finkelman, who has retired. Additionally, Zamir will need to oversee the integration of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the IDF, the potential military dismantling of Hamas in Gaza (if the war resumes), and possibly an unprecedented operation in Iran, with U.S. assistance. For quite a while, Zamir has been regarded as the leading candidate to succeed Halevi due to his experience, authority and professionalism, particularly his stance against downsizing the military. Having served for 38 years in various combat and senior command roles, Zamir at 59 will be the oldest chief of staff in IDF history. For comparison, Gadi Eizenkot and Dan Halutz concluded their terms at age 58. Among the roles he has held in the IDF, Zamir served as commander of the Southern Command. In his most recent position, from 2018 to 2021, he was deputy chief of staff under Aviv Kochavi. During this time, he oversaw the implementation of the multi-year Momentum plan and managed all military support for the civilian sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Before serving as deputy chief of wtaff, Zamir was the military secretary to the prime minister and also served as the chief of staff for the Ground Forces Command. Over the past year, Zamir has been heavily involved in building military capabilities and has maintained excellent relations with the Americans. Among other responsibilities, he oversaw unprecedented arms acquisitions from the United States, including deals for fighter jets and munitions, as well as expanded local production within Israel’s defense industries. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydw2s6001e	2025-02-02T12:58:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BJALMXpdyx/BJALMXpdyx_119_107_932_525_0_small.jpg

Iran secretly building nuclear weapons able to reach Europe based...	National Council of Resistance of Iran reports Tehran is covertly expanding its nuclear weapons program – with a missile range of 1,800 miles – using North Korean designs at facilities disguised as satellite launch sites Iran has allegedly been covertly developing nuclear weapons with a 1,800‑mile range that could reach Europe using North Korean designs, according to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). The Telegraph in Britain reported Sunday that details provided by the NCRI indicate that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is expanding its warhead program at two sites disguised as communication satellite launch facilities. The facilities, controlled by Iran’s nuclear weapons division – the Organisation for Advanced Defence Research (SPND) – are reportedly expediting missile production. Soona Samsami, a U.S. representative of the NCRI, told The Telegraph: 'For over two decades, they have used negotiations and the West's leniency as a means to advance their nuclear weapons program, threatening global peace and stability. Tehran has never been as weak and vulnerable as it is today. The desperate Iranian regime is thus speeding up the development of nuclear weapons. Now is the time to hold the regime accountable for internal killings, regional warmongering and nuclear weapons development.' According to the report, the first warhead base is located about 22 miles from the Iranian city of Shahrud. Experts from the SPND and the IRGC Aerospace Force have been working on a nuclear missile integrated into a Ghaem-100 rocket, capable of traveling 1,800 miles. This range would put targets in Europe –including Greece –and Israel within reach. The Telegraph noted that three rocket launches have already been successfully carried out, with tests for the more advanced Ghaem-105 rocket slated for the coming months. Past tests were masked as satellite launches to obscure their true purpose. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Satellite imagery reportedly shows a concrete platform used in the experiments, with nearby buildings believed to support related research. Another site, about 43 miles southeast of the city of Semnan, is said to be producing Simorgh missiles inspired by North Korean designs, similar to the 18‑meter-tall UNHA‑1 rocket. Much of the work at this site is conducted underground to evade intelligence surveillance, with six new constructions added since 2005. To further conceal the work, the regime has named the facility the Imam Khomeini site, ostensibly an homage to its space governing body, while it is reportedly being used for warhead tests. Images distributed by the NCRI showed extensive ground excavation in the northeastern part of the base in 2019, with concrete foundations installed afterward, while older photos revealed the structure covered in dirt. The NCRI claims that SPND experts have observed an increase in subterranean explosions linked to missile production. Although the press was once allowed on site – where IRGC soldiers in civilian clothing were seen – only a few photos were released, taken by regime workers. Security at both facilities is stringent. Workers arrive in private vehicles from surrounding cities, including Tehran, and are taken by bus from a checkpoint several miles from the main site by IRGC personnel as an additional security measure. Iran's Deputy Minister of Communications and Information Technology and head of the Iranian Space Organization, Hassan Salaria, said last week that Tehran would unveil a number of Iranian satellites and noted that 'by the end of the current Iranian year' two more important satellites would be launched (the Iranian year ends in March, according to the IRNA news agency). He said that Iran has so far launched 24 to 25 satellites into space of various categories. 'Currently, we are designing and building satellites that can operate with an imaging accuracy of up to about two meters, and this process is gradual,' he explained. The Iranian Space Agency on Sunday announced that during a ceremony marking National Space Technology Day, three satellites were unveiled: Nabouk 1, Fars 2, and an improved version of Fars 1. At the same time, as part of the 'Achievements of the Iranian Ministry of Defense' exhibition, and in the presence of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, the Atmad ballistic missile, which has a range of 1,700 kilometers, was unveiled on Sunday. The Iranian president said during the visit: 'Our defense capabilities are so advanced that they do not allow any country to attack Iran.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkmumsaukg	2025-02-02T12:03:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/SkGrpWTdkx/SkGrpWTdkx_0_266_2550_1435_0_small.jpg

With Trump back in White House, Saudi Arabia looks to be major pl...	Saudi Arabia hopes a stronger bond with the US will solidify its influence in the Middle East despite the challenges posed by its controversial standing in the region Now that President Donald Trump is back in the White House, Saudi Arabia hopes to play a greater role in the Middle East. The Gulf nation's leaders aim to restore its glory after four years of tense relations with the administration of former President Joe Biden. Soon after Trump took office, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud announced the kingdom’s intention to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over four years. That figure is higher than the $450 billion Saudi Arabia committed to investing in 2017. Trump told the media he would pressure Saudi Arabia to raise the intended investment to $1 trillion. Saudi Arabia may take him up on that offer if it means obtaining a green light from the U.S. regarding its intended geopolitical strategy. Analysts say Riyadh sees investing in the U.S. as a double opportunity, leading to both economic prosperity and unlimited support from the Trump administration. 'The deals that Saudi Arabia concludes with the United States are deals that benefit both countries,' according to Saudi political analyst Faisal Al-Kaam. 'The previous deal, which was concluded in 2017, led to the transfer of technology to Saudi Arabia and the issuance of special models of the famous F-15 fighter jet, which means that Saudi Arabia also benefited.' Al-Kaam rejected the notion that the investment was a form of tribute to be paid to the U.S. 'This economic and political relationship is long-standing, and the two countries continue to support each other,' he said. 'It is true that during President Joe Biden’s term, the relationship was a little tense, but it quickly returned to normal.' 'Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East regarding influence, size, and economy. It is now the fastest growing among the G20, and it is influential in all decisions in the region,' Al-Kaam continued, highlighting the mutual benefit resulting from a partnership between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Al-Kaam described cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. as 'a simple equation,' but some critics are more skeptical. 'The truth is that Saudi Arabia is paying bribes to the Donald Trump administration to keep them in power,' said Iraqi political analyst Haider Shaheen. 'Otherwise, he will impose sanctions on them or at least marginalize them.' Shaheen said that Saudi Arabia expects its investments to result in the U.S. suppressing those who oppose the kingdom, including the Houthis and the Iranian regime, 'in addition to keeping quiet about Saudi Arabia’s serious violations in the areas of human rights.' Saudi ties with Israel After nearly a year and a half of war, a cease-fire was declared earlier this month between Israel and Hamas. That deal brought conversations about establishing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia back to the surface. Trump has made it clear that he hopes to see the two countries establish ties. In his last term, his administration brokered the Abraham Accords, which established relations between Israel and four Arab nations. Saudi officials have consistently said that the kingdom will not establish peace with Israel until a Palestinian state is declared with East Jerusalem as its capital. 'Various U.S. administrations have tried to pressure Saudi Arabia to start relations with Israel, and the answer has always been that there must be a recognized Palestinian state, and then there will be Saudi-Israeli relations,' said former Saudi diplomat Hassan Barqi. 'This is the opinion that Saudi Arabia says, in secret and in public.' Barqi said that Saudi Arabia would stand firm on this condition, regardless of the October 7 attacks and Trump’s declared intention to resettle Palestinians in other countries. 'Now things are easier. Most of the Hamas leaders have been assassinated, Hamas has lost its power, and it may be easy to establish a Palestinian state according to the conditions of the international community. And there are more countries in the world that recognize Palestine as a state,' Barqi said. 'This is what paves the way for the establishment of a Palestinian state, and President Donald Trump has been convinced of this idea from the beginning.' On the other hand, Aisha Al-Sayed, an Egyptian journalist, dismissed Saudi Arabia’s conditions for normalization with Israel as 'a thing of the past.' 'Saudi Arabia sees that it does not benefit from the Palestinian issue, and its priorities have changed. It only looks at economic and social interests and the desire for development,' Al-Sayed said. 'As for fixed issues such as the Palestinian issue, it will not continue to defend them, and it will sign a peace agreement with Israel within the next four years.' Tense role in the Middle East Saudi Arabia’s relations with fellow Middle Eastern and Arab countries have caused controversy in recent years. When King Salman came to power in 2015, Saudi Arabia changed its regional strategy. Two months after Salman was crowned, Saudi Arabia declared war on the Houthis in Yemen. In 2022, after years of devastating fighting, Saudi Arabia recognized that it had failed to impose control over the Houthis and decided to appease the group. Saudi Arabia also signed a reconciliation agreement with Iran despite years of cold war between the two countries. During the long Saudi-Iranian conflict, a 'fifth column' of Iran-affiliated militias targeted Saudi interests several times, striking numerous military, oil and civilian targets in Saudi Arabia with thousands of ballistic missiles. Relations between Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates deteriorated after Riyadh made several economic decisions that harmed the interests of neighboring countries. Saudi Arabia banned companies without regional headquarters from working on government contracts, which led many companies to withdraw. The kingdom also significantly increased import tariffs from fellow Gulf countries, fanning tensions. For years, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been in conflict, with Saudi Arabia attempting to exert power over its neighbor to the east. In 2017, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, led by Saudi Arabia, all simultaneously cut off ties with Qatar. Less than four years later, the two countries reached an agreement that did not involve any of the concessions from Qatar that Saudi Arabia had insisted upon. Saudi Arabia failed to resolve the civil war in Sudan, and even after normalizing relations with Bashir Assad’s Syria, it was unable to protect the Syrian leader. Turkey managed to impose Ahmed al-Sharaa, head of the Turkish-aligned Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham group, as the new leader of Syria, and Saudi Arabia was forced to accept the fall of the Assad regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Having faced numerous regional challenges, Saudi Arabia is now working to expand its influence through economic interests. The kingdom has signed many economic agreements with Iraq, which is ruled by parties loyal to Iran. It also has economic agreements with Egypt and Oman. Upcoming agreements are expected with Lebanon and perhaps Syria. Saudi Arabia’s influence on African countries remains comparatively weak. 'Saudi Arabia may not appear in the picture, but it is working to solve the region’s problems through its extensive international relations, and this is the secret,' according to Mamdouh Al-Kharif, a Saudi political analyst. 'Its steps are taken in secret to solve the region’s problems and not increase them.' Al-Kharif said that many of the kingdom’s regional strategies will take a long time to come to fruition. 'Gulf relations are witnessing significant growth. There are no fundamental differences, but rather a redrawing of the relationship to be better and sustainable for the future, and so that the differences do not return,' he said. 'As for Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the Arab countries, it is for the growth of this region again and for it to be in a better economic state.' While asserting that 'compatibility' between Trump and the Saudi leadership would lead to the resolution of many issues in the Middle East, Al-Kharif insisted that Saudi Arabia’s role in the region is independent of the US. 'The change in the US administration has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia’s influence, as it had influence even under the administration of former President Joe Biden,' he said. 'Saudi Arabia does not rely on anyone for its influence, but rather on its internal strength, its great diplomacy and its extensive relations.'

Date set for Hassan Nasrallah's funeral, 5 months after assassina...	Hezbollah announces Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral will take place in three weeks, alongside his assassinated successor Hashem Safeddine; Amid internal criticism and weakening influence in Lebanon, the group faces scrutiny as it tries to maintain political power under mounting external and internal pressure The funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the former secretary-general of Hezbollah who was assassinated in September, will take place in three weeks. This announcement was made on Sunday by Hezbollah’s current Secretary-General Naim Qassem during a speech broadcast throughout the country. Alongside Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine, who was considered a potential successor to Nasrallah but was assassinated a week later, will also be buried. Qassem urged supporters 'not to fire into the air' during the funeral. The slogan for Nasrallah’s funeral, according to Qassem, will be: 'We are committed to the alliance.' Qassem accused Israel of violating the cease-fire and stated that Lebanon must act against it. 'The state of Lebanon is responsible for monitoring and demanding that the countries sponsoring the agreement ensure the enemy’s commitment to the cease-fire,' he said, adding: 'This is not just about violations but also about attacks. The state of Lebanon must act forcefully.' Regarding Hezbollah’s activities, Qassem justified the continuation of the fighting. 'Resistance is a path and a choice,' he said. 'We act according to our assessment at the appropriate time.' He also criticized Washington. 'Since the U.S. considers itself a sponsor, there must be pressure on it to adhere to the agreement,' he said. Qassem claimed there is an international campaign aimed at undermining Hezbollah’s position. 'There is a campaign against us, backed by the U.S., Israel and foreign states, accompanied by internal support, promoting defeat,' he said. He attempted to frame the fighting balance as positive for his organization, adding: 'We did not speak of total victory; this is a battle with gains and losses. Our people understand they won in some areas and lost in others. We speak of a victory tied to resilience, halting the Israeli invasion, and the enemy’s inability to eliminate the resistance.' Announcement of Nasrallah’s funeral date Hezbollah has faced significant internal criticism recently. After the 60-day cease-fire period expired, motorcycle convoys from the organization took to the streets to celebrate 'victory in the war.' They waved Hezbollah flags and chanted slogans in support of the group. This display was poorly received by the Lebanese public. The Amal Movement in Lebanon even prohibited its supporters from participating in the motorcycle convoys. On Friday, another incident occurred involving a Hezbollah motorcycle convoy when a young man struck Hezbollah motorcyclists participating in a funeral procession near the village of Sarafand, close to Sidon. Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed channel reported that it was unclear whether the act was intentional. Footage of the incident was widely shared on social media. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hezbollah’s weakened position within Lebanon has limited its ability to provoke, particularly as it seeks to maintain its political power during the formation of the new government. Lebanon’s new president, Joseph Aoun, and its prime minister-designate, Nawaf Salam, were not Hezbollah’s preferred candidates. All eyes in Lebanon are now on the organization, with some blaming it for the destruction of southern villages and its participation in the war for external motives. Qassem emphasized Hezbollah would continue its path and would not succumb to external pressures. 'The popular liberation is intertwined with the armed resistance and the Lebanese army. In southern Lebanon, they say there is no possibility for Israel to remain and occupy the area,' he said. 'Let everyone know that sacrifices will lead to the liberation of the land. Those with principles do not surrender under pressure,' he declared. Since the strike in Beirut’s Dahieh neighborhood, where Nasrallah was assassinated, the site has become a pilgrimage destination. The location, which served as Hezbollah’s central command, remains a disaster zone and has yet to be rebuilt. Despite the destruction, Hezbollah supporters continue to hold events at the site, with many visiting daily. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjv1cepdkx	2025-02-02T10:59:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/06/HkzHdEad11kg/HkzHdEad11kg_0_0_2200_1513_0_small.jpg
Trump invites King Abdullah of Jordan to formal White House visit	King Abdullah will meet with President Trump on Feb. 11, a week after he meets with Netanyahu; Trump’s controversial Gaza relocation plan faces strong opposition from Jordan, Egypt and other Arab nations, who reject displacing Palestinians as a solution to Gaza’s crisis Jordan’s King Abdullah II has received an invitation to meet with President Donald Trump on February 11. The announcement of the invitation coincided with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s departure for Washington aboard the government-owned Wing of Zion plane for his official visit. Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday. In recent days, President Trump has reiterated his proposal for neighboring countries of Israel, specifically Egypt and Jordan, to absorb residents of the Gaza Strip as part of his 'relocation' plan for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians. Both Cairo and Amman have rejected the idea, but Trump remains adamant: 'They will do it. We do a lot for them – they will do this.' Trump first raised the proposal last week following the second round of hostage releases of the first phase of the hostage deal. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, he described Gaza as a 'massive demolition site' and argued that rebuilding it would require relocating its residents to Jordan or Egypt. He suggested this could serve as a long-term solution rather than just a temporary measure. 'This involves moving 1.5 million people and simply clearing out the entire place,' Trump said. So far, despite early support for the idea among Israeli right-wing factions, strong opposition from Palestinians, as well as from Jordan and Egypt, has made the plan appear unfeasible. It is also unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the proposal, as even one of his closest allies, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, has expressed significant doubts about its viability. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Saturday, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League issued a joint statement opposing Trump’s push for the migration of Palestinians out of Gaza to neighboring countries – a proposal he has repeatedly mentioned over the past week. 'We emphasize that we reject the idea of displacing Palestinians from their land for any reason,' the statement read. It was released following a meeting in Cairo between foreign ministers of several nations and Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary-general of the PLO Executive Committee. The joint statement also expressed the countries’ willingness to work with the Trump administration 'to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, based on a two-state solution.' The representatives said they discussed efforts to support the Palestinian cause and maintain the cease-fire in Gaza. Among the issues raised was the 'mechanism' that would enable the Palestinian Authority to carry out its responsibilities in Gaza. Meanwhile, Qatar’s Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed diplomatic source, that 'Egypt’s task in confronting Trump’s plan will not be easy unless it receives Arab support, given Trump’s insistence on advancing his proposal.' The report also revealed that a senior Trump administration official visited Cairo last week to hold discussions about the plan. According to the report from Doha, Egyptian officials who met with the American representative expressed Cairo’s concerns and warned of potential consequences if Trump’s plan is implemented. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxs37p00jx	2025-02-02T10:48:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/06/25/8617894/8617894_0_0_1300_866_0_small.jpg

As Israel releases hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, debate rene...	Israel’s recent deal with Hamas, which releases hundreds of Palestinian prisoners - including convicted murderers - in exchange for Israeli hostages, has sparked controversy and renewed calls for capital punishment for terrorists amid fears of further attacks Israel has begun releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in recent weeks as part of a cease-fire deal with the Hamas terrorist organization. The scenes of jubilant prisoners receiving a hero’s welcome in Palestinian cities and towns have been received with mixed feelings by Israelis. On the one hand, Israeli hostages being held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, are also being released, but on the other hand, some of the prisoners have been sentenced to life for murdering Israelis, many of them vowing to continue to operate against Israel. The war and the deal between Hamas and Israel have rekindled a debate in the country about the death penalty for terrorists. Throughout the years, there have been several attempts to legislate a bill that would allow capital punishment for terrorist acts, including those committed in the West Bank, which Israel has control over since 1967 under a different legal system. Military law, which is applied to Palestinians in the West Bank, allows the death penalty for convicted murderers. It has never been used as prosecutors have never requested it. The current law in Israel allows for the death penalty on a narrow range of crimes, namely treason, genocide, crimes against humanity and crimes against the Jewish people during wartime. Those in favor of a wider use of capital punishment believe the persistence of terrorist attacks in recent decades can also partly be attributed to the avoidance of using the ultimate punishment. The death penalty was used in Israel twice throughout its history – against a Jew who was accused of treason only to be posthumously exonerated and against Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1962. 'Ideologically, the death penalty has not been handed out because there is no rehabilitation aspect to the punishment,' according to former Magistrate Court Judge Haran Feinstein. Legal experts in the country are divided on whether a specific law mandating capital punishment for terrorist acts would be without petitions to the Supreme Court. Public opinion in Israel is largely favorable toward using the death penalty for convicted terrorists. Some see it as a deterrent against future attacks, especially those intended to stop the kidnapping of Israelis in order to free Palestinian prisoners. There is also frustration among Israelis that their taxes are paying for lengthy prison sentences for Palestinians, including funding university degrees and advanced health care. 'When it will be clear to the murderers that they will be sentenced to death, they will think twice,' right-wing Israeli Knesset member Limor Son Har Melech said. 'Thousands of prisoners in Israeli jails now prove that the current deal proves that, if there was capital punishment, we wouldn’t have to face such embarrassing and disgraceful deals in which murderers of Jews are released.' Son Har Melech herself is a victim of a terrorist attack in 2003, during which her husband was murdered, and she was critically wounded. 'My husband’s murderer was sentenced to seven life sentences, and during the trial he said the sentence had no meaning to him, knowing he will be released,' she added. Khaled Najar was later released as part of a deal in which Israel released over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in return for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was taken into captivity by Hamas in 2011. Najar resumed his terrorist activities, killing more Israelis. Israeli soldiers killed him in Rafah during the latest war. 'There is fear and aversion among Israel’s leadership from the legislation of a death penalty law,' said Son Har Melech. 'Attempts to legislate such a law at the beginning of the war, when it was very clear to everyone that this needs to be corrected, the relatives of the hostages raised objections and even those in favor of the law got cold feet.' Families of hostages voiced their concern that instating the death penalty in the midst of the war, while Israeli hostages are at the mercy of Hamas captors, would lead to their execution. Some begged Knesset members to shoot down any proposals. According to Feinstein, also an adjunct lecturer at the Department of Criminology at Bar Ilan University, the current law allows for the death penalty but is not used only for ideological reasons by which modern countries do not employ capital punishment, barring a few states in the United States. 'When facing terrorists, there is concern that Israelis captured by them will be executed if Israel will employ the death penalty,' Feinstein said. 'Therefore, Israel shouldn’t use capital punishment because its enemies will abuse this.' 'I feel the contrary is true; capital punishment could be used as leverage that they will not have prisoners to release in return for our hostages,' Son Har Melech explained. 'This, of course, needs to be one part of the leverage against Hamas, added to limiting humanitarian aid to Gaza and intense fighting in order to create a new reality and deterrence against terrorists.' Even before the war, there were attempts to legislate capital punishment, including a bill currently stalled, waiting for a preliminary reading in the plenum of the Knesset. 'All our efforts at this point to complete the legislation have met closed doors,' Son Har Melech said. 'Not only do we not have deterrence without capital punishment, but we are also making murdering and massacring Jews lucrative. Our enemies need to know very clearly that prisoner release is off the table; this will change how the conflict is managed by Israel, making it more powerful with greater ability to face our enemies and subdue them.' As a former judge, Feinstein suggests sentencing convicted terrorists to death but not implementing it. 'Convicts should be held in similar conditions to those on death row in the U.S., with very minimal conditions, complete isolation and no option for parole,' he said. 'This could prevent future murders by deterrence.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The current deal between Israel and Hamas, which spans six weeks in which hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are slated to be released, has stirred controversy in the country. Memories of the Shalit deal are still fresh in the minds of many. One of the terrorists released as part of that deal was Yahya Sinwar, who then became the leader of Hamas and was the mastermind of the October 7 attack that stunned Israel and began the war. 'I am happy for each hostage that is freed from captivity,' said Son Har Melech. 'But we need to echo the great danger in releasing murderers and the unspeakable travesty of their release to the loved ones of the victims. This is also true for our soldiers, who I do not think fought and lost their lives for such pictures. This voice needs to be heard.' It is important to note that should the deal progress into its second stage next month, there is a possibility that terrorists who participated in the October 7 attack also will be released. Throughout its history, Israel has carried out many prisoner swaps at high prices, making this one no exception, likely leaving capital punishment off the table, even as emotions run high. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkspe4puye	2025-02-02T09:27:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/Bkq18BF00kx/Bkq18BF00kx_0_307_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US FAA pilot safety messaging system resumes operations	A key system that provides safety messages to pilots resumed operating on Sunday after an outage that began the previous night, the Federal Aviation Administration said, in the latest difficulty for the U.S. aviation system in the past week. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Sunday the FAA's 'Notice to Air Mission,' or NOTAM, system is old and needs an upgrade. The system went down late on Saturday, prompting the agency to set up a hotline to send notices every 30 minutes with updates to airlines. 'We are investigating the root cause of the outage,' the FAA said in a statement on Sunday. The NOTAM system provides pilots, flight crews and other users of U.S. airspace with critical safety notices. It could include items such as taxiway lights being out at an airport, nearby parachute activity or a specific runway being closed for construction.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkrtmn6okg	2025-02-02T09:04:58-08:00

Syria's transitional president in inaugural foreign trip visits S...	Ahmad al-Sharaa met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss rebuilding war-torn Syria; The visit signals a shift away from Iranian influence as Syria seeks Gulf investment and international support to restore diplomatic and economic ties On Sunday, Ahmad al-Sharaa, the new leader of Syria, visited Saudi Arabia. This was the country's interim president's first trip outside Syria since taking power in December, after rebel forces – led by the jihadist organization Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which he heads—overthrew the regime of Bashar Assad. During his visit, al-Sharaa met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Bin Salman is the second regional leader to meet with al-Sharaa since he assumed power, the first being the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who visited Damascus last month. After the meeting, al-Sharaa issued a statement describing the visit. 'I want to express my gratitude to my brother Mohammed bin Salman for the warm reception and hospitality. We held an extended meeting, during which I witnessed a genuine desire to support Syria, its future, its people, and its territorial integrity. We discussed numerous topics and took steps to strengthen cooperation,' according to the statement. The presidential office in Damascus reported that the two leaders discussed future plans for Syria in energy, technology, health and education. In January, al-Sharaa appointed himself as Syria’s interim president. Before his visit to Saudi Arabia, the presidential office in Damascus released a photo of al-Sharaa and his foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaybani, aboard a plane en route to Riyadh. Al-Sharaa’s visit to Saudi Arabia is widely viewed as a signal of the new Syrian regime distancing itself from Iran, which had been a significant ally of Assad. Since taking power, al-Sharaa has sought support from both Muslim and Western leaders, working to restore Syria’s ties with nations that severed relations during the civil war, which began in 2011 and ended in December. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi Arabia and Iran announced the restoration of diplomatic relations in 2023 after a seven-year freeze. However, regional tensions and disagreements, particularly regarding Syria, persist between the two powers. In late December, al-Sharaa gave an interview to the Saudi network Al-Arabiya, stating that Riyadh 'will definitely play an important role' in Syria’s future while highlighting the 'great investment opportunities' in his country. Damascus is hopeful that Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf nations will assist in rebuilding the war-torn country. Last month, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan visited Damascus and pledged Saudi support in efforts to lift the international sanctions imposed during Assad’s war against the rebels. During his visit, bin Farhan said Riyadh is engaged in dialogue with all relevant nations and entities, including the United States and the European Union. 'We are hearing encouraging messages,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk110imt00yx	2025-02-02T08:41:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/H1JKIfaO1g/H1JKIfaO1g_0_0_3000_2001_0_small.jpg

Electronics, food and alcohol: This is how Trump's tariffs will a...	Trump's sweeping tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China ignite a trade war, sparking swift retaliation, economic uncertainty, and fears of rising inflation United States President Donald Trump fulfilled his election promise and announced that he would impose high tariffs on America's three largest trading partners - Mexico, Canada, and China - citing a national emergency due to the entry of illegal immigrants and fentanyl drugs into the country's borders. On Saturday he signed an order to impose the stiff tariffs on imports drawing swift retaliation and an undeniable sense of betrayal from the country’s North American neighbors as a trade war erupted among the longtime allies. The Republican president posted on social media that the tariffs were necessary 'to protect Americans,' pressing the three nations to do more to curb the manufacture and export of illicit fentanyl and for Canada and Mexico to reduce illegal immigration into the U.S. The products coming from those countries are among the most common and essential items used by Americans, including fruits and vegetables, meat, gasoline, cars, electronics, toys, clothing, lumber, beer and other alcoholic beverages. The tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to significantly worsen, threatening the trust that many voters placed in Trump to lower the prices of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos, and other goods as he promised. They also risked throwing the global economy and Trump’s political mandate into turmoil just two weeks into his second term. Trump declared an economic emergency to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10% rate. Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates charged by the U.S. against retaliation by other countries, raising the specter of an even more severe economic disruption. 'The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a somber tone as he announced that his country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports, including alcohol and fruit. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He channeled the betrayal that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina. 'We were always there standing with you, grieving with you, the American people,' he said. Mexico’s president also ordered retaliatory tariffs. 'We categorically reject the White House’s slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory,' Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote in a post on X while saying she had instructed her economy secretary to implement a response that includes retaliatory tariffs and other measures in defense of Mexico’s interests. 'If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do, and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population. The premier of the Canadian province of British Columbia, David Eby, specifically called on residents to stop buying liquor from U.S. 'red' states and said it was removing American alcohol brands from government store shelves as a response to the tariffs. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country’s government 'firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.' China began regulating fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances in 2019 and conducted 'counternarcotics cooperation with the U.S.,' the ministry said, calling on the U.S. government to correct what it considers wrongful actions. The Ministry of Commerce in China said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for the 'wrongful practices of the U.S.' and take measures to safeguard its rights and interests. The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, setting up a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth. A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale University laid out the possible damage to the U.S. economy, saying the average household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes. Economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen, and the situation could be even worse with retaliation from other countries. Democrats were quick to warn that any inflation going forward was the result of Trump’s actions. 'You’re worried about grocery prices. Don’s raising prices with his tariffs,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote in a series of posts on X. 'You’re worried about tomato prices. Wait till Trump’s Mexico tariffs raise your tomato prices,' read another. 'You’re worried about car prices. Wait till Trump’s Canada tariffs raise your car prices,' read another. A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize disruptive increases in the price of gasoline or utilities. That’s a sign White House officials understand the gamble they’re taking on inflation. Price spikes under former President Joe Biden led to voter frustration that helped return Trump to the White House. The order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries. The official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addiction. The order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties. 'It doesn’t make much economic sense,’’ said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. trade official. 'Historically, most of our tariffs on raw materials have been low because we want to get cheaper materials so our manufacturers will be competitive ... Now, what’s he talking about? He’s talking about tariffs on raw materials. I don’t get the economics of it.’’ With the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics. The president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil, and natural gas, as well as copper, pharmaceutical drugs, and imports from the European Union — moves that could essentially pit the U.S. against much of the global economy. Trudeau warned of economic pain as the tariffs take effect and encouraged Canadians to 'choose Canadian products and services rather than American ones.' But he also voiced optimism about the enduring relationship between the two countries. 'It is going to have real consequences for people, for workers on both sides of our border. We don’t want to be here. We didn’t ask for this, but we will not back down in standing up both for Canadians and for the incredibly successful relationship between Canada and the United States,' Trudeau said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycbxmt00ye	2025-02-02T08:15:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/r1IwhjhOJg/r1IwhjhOJg_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

A day after his release from captivity, Yarden Bibas' family thanks the people of Israel for the support and concern: 'Yarden is here and finally air is entering his lungs. He has lost weight, but feels good and his physical condition is normal.' Among the 79 hostages that remain in Gaza are his wife, Shiri, and children, Kfir and Ariel - and the fear for their lives is great; 'Respect our privacy, allow us the time and peace we need' In a statement released a day after Yarden Bibas returned from captivity - and while his wife Shiri and children Ariel and Kfir are still in Gaza and there is great fear for their fate - the Bibas family expressed their gratitude to the people of Israel. 'The amazing people of Israel, thank you for being excited with us, caring and embracing Yarden from afar,' they said in their statement, a day after-some 484 days in Hamas captivity Yarden Bibas was released alongside Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegel. 'Your support is felt and appreciated. Yarden is here and finally air is entering his lungs.' The Bibas family said that 'Yarden has lost a lot of weight, but he feels good, his physical condition is normal. He is strong and amazing.' They emphasized that 'along with acclimatization and the beginning of Yarden's rehabilitation journey, we continue to fight for Shiri, Ariel and Kfir, and all the other 76 hostages who must not be left behind. Tomorrow evening we will make a statement to the media. Until then, we ask that our privacy be respected and that we be allowed the time and peace that we need.' On Saturday afternoon, after he returned from captivity, his family announced that 'Yarden is home. A quarter of his heart has returned to us after 15 long months. There are no words to describe the feeling of relief to hold Yarden in our hands, hug him and hear his voice. Yarden is back home, but home is missing. Yarden is a father who left the military to protect his family, bravely survived captivity and returned to an unbearably difficult reality.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The family asked to protect Jordan and his soul. 'Respect his privacy and give him the space he needs so that his mind and body can recover a little. Thank you to our beautiful people. Thank you to our soldiers. Thank you and forgiveness to all those who sacrificed their lives so that this day would come. It will take us a few days to unite with Jordan, but we continue with the hope and call for the return of Shiri, the children and all the kidnapped. Please continue to make their voices heard and the urgency for their return. Help us resonate this now more than ever. For Jordan and for everyone. We won't stop until everyone is home,' the family added. The Bibas family has been preparing for the possibility of Yarden being released before his wife and children over the past two weeks, since the cease-fire and hostage release deal was reached. In an interview earlier this week, after Shiri, Kfir and Ariel were not included in the initial stages of the deal, the family even received an update that the fear for their lives was increasing, and in Israel officials demanded information from the mediators about their situation. So far, no new information has been received following the demand, but the fact that they were not released in the first stages has increased concern about the fate of the mother and children. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skosaz6u1e	2025-02-02T08:04:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/HkiwW9iuJg/HkiwW9iuJg_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

IDF terrorist hunt expands in West Bank amid fear that most relea...	IDF expands operations in the West Bank, raiding Tamun village to dismantle arms smuggling and terrorist havens; Counterterrorism efforts also intensified in Jenin and Tulkarm, with troops demolishing terror infrastructure, and confiscating weapons to suppress growing threats Alongside the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of the hostage deal, the IDF expanded its operations in the West Bank early Sunday, announcing its entry into the Palestinian village of Tamun, which has recently become a hub for explosive-related terrorism. Later in the afternoon, the IDF announced that, as part of its counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank, it had demolished buildings in Jenin used as terror infrastructure. Dramatic footage captured the moment of the explosions, and Palestinian sources reported that close to 20 buildings had been destroyed in Jenin's refugee camp. The demolitions followed a mapping process of buildings where terror infrastructures, explosives labs, and surveillance tools – such as closed-circuit cameras – were discovered. Among the destroyed buildings was the one where Haruv Reconnaissance Unit soldier First Sergeant Liam Hazi from Rosh HaAyin was killed. So far, IDF troops have conducted searches of more than 1,000 buildings during this operation in the West Bank. A joint statement by IDF and Shin Bet revealed that, to date, the counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank has resulted in the elimination of over 35 terrorists and the arrest of more than 100 wanted individuals. Additionally, preemptive airstrikes have killed more than 15. Troops have confiscated dozens of weapons, destroyed hundreds of explosives, and neutralized dozens more planted along roads to target soldiers. Tamun operations The operation in Tamun began before dawn with ground maneuvers focused on a rapid entry into the village for searches, arrests and fortification. Heavy equipment, including bulldozers and excavators, was used to clear paths for ground troops, who began searching for weapons and detaining suspects. Tamun is part of the 'Five Villages' area, which also includes Tubas, Tayasir, Far'a, and Aqaba. In recent months, terrorism originating from these villages has intensified, including planting roadside bombs and using smuggled weapons for attacks. The proximity of Tamun and Tubas to Israel's eastern border has made them key points for arms smuggling by terror groups such as Iran and Hamas. Many arms dealers, including criminal elements, frequent the border area to collect weapons smuggled from Jordan. The villages have also become a haven for terrorists fleeing security forces. Many retreat to these villages before continuing on to Jenin or Tulkarm. Now, with the operation expanded to include Tamun, IDF is operating in three key locations in the eastern West Bank: the refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarm, and the village of Tamun. The goal is to maintain aggressive and sustained pressure on the terror groups that have grown in the area in recent years. Another goal, following the hostage deal, is to prevent celebrations by released prisoners in cities and villages. Due to the military presence, such celebrations have significantly decreased, and no large armed parades have been reported so far. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the operation in Tamun, troops discovered an M-16 rifle and magazines. The IDF is also investigating an incident in which a 73-year-old man, reportedly shot by Israeli forces, was killed. Initial assessments indicate that the deceased, Walid Lahlooh, was in an isolated area where no civilians were expected to be present. Troops who identified him followed standard arrest procedures, which ended with him being shot in the lower body. An IDF announcement regarding the raid stated: 'During the operation, the forces located and confiscated dozens of weapons, destroyed hundreds of explosive devices, and neutralized dozens of additional explosives that had been planted along routes to target our forces.' As part of the broader operation that began nearly two weeks ago, soldiers have been scanning buildings in the hostile Jenin camp, which spans no more than 1.5 square kilometers, arresting and eliminating militants. Last week, Staff Sergeant Liam Hazi, a soldier from the Haruv Reconnaissance Unit, was killed during clashes in Jenin. Four other soldiers sustained light to moderate injuries, while one soldier was seriously wounded. More recently, IDF launched similar operations in the Nur al-Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm. In both Jenin and Tulkarm, checkpoints have been established to inspect Palestinians trying to leave the area, ensuring that no terrorists attempt to flee. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4p911toyg	2025-02-02T07:28:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/B17VMZWaukg/B17VMZWaukg_0_0_1600_1067_0_small.jpg
The world needs to hear the children's voices': Israel's 'spokes...	Meet 9-year-old Ben Carasso, Israel's youngest spokesperson; He tells Ynetnews about his drive, efforts and future ambitions while defending the country on the international stage With Israel facing worldwide criticism and scrutiny over its war against Hamas following the terror group’s massacre on October 7, 2023, many within the country and across the world have taken part in advocating for Israel's actions and its right to defend itself on the international stage. One of the most surprising speakers for Israel is 9-year-old Ben Carasso of Tel Aviv, a third-generation to Holocaust survivors, who decided to embark on a mission to be the voice of Israeli children during the war. Speaking with Ynetnews, he explained the motivation behind his fight for Israel all over the world: 'Children got hurt in this war. If they were scared of the alarms, if they were kidnapped, if they were evacuated from their homes. I felt that the world needs to hear the children's voices, because if we can't do nothing about it, at least let us speak about it.' Ben also discussed his initial steps into advocacy for the country. 'I saw how important it was from October 7. There are no words to describe what happened here. I saw how important it is. So I started really from the start.' When asked about when he began studying English, Ben replied, 'I learned from the age of three.' He also discussed why he decided to involve advocacy in his daily life alongside his days in school and activities as a regular child in Israel. 'I'm advocating because it’s important. And sometimes I do it with my friends, like every regular child. My family supports me and so do my friends. But I'm just a regular child that wants the world to hear what they feel,' he told Ynetnews. When asked where his advocacy efforts took him around the world, he answered: 'I was in London for poster hangings. I was in schools, universities and media outlets. I did almost everything I could to release the hostages and now I’m so happy to see we have hostages back.' Ben also talked about his connection with released hostage Romi Gonen: 'I have two friends whose family members were kidnapped, one is Romi Gonen who’s a cousin of my friend Mika. And another one, Hanan Yablonka, who was kidnapped and murdered. I went to his funeral. He's the father of my best friend from kindergarten. I also have a friend that's evacuated from their home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked about facing challenges during his advocacy abroad, Ben said that 'sometimes they just won't want to hear me. But I think one situation is that they don't understand that we're not committing genocide and we just want to help the Palestinians.' He added that he tries to face negative comments head-on. 'If there are negative reactions, I know I said something good because they don't want the world to hear the truth.' Ben shared about his role models working to defend Israel around the world. 'I think whoever is doing advocacy and helping Israel is really instrumental,' he said. ' I'm so happy that we have other people like Hayley Ace. She's a Christian and she's helping us. There are many more out there and I'm so happy we have them and every single spokesperson that helps Israel.' When asked about his ambitions for the future, Ben said: 'I really don't know, but advocacy will always be a part of my life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byqg3h200yx	2025-02-02T07:13:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/By44R32uke/By44R32uke_56_0_341_192_0_small.jpg
Former hostage Daniella Gilboa reflects on captivity and return: ...	Freed hostage Daniella Gilboa recounts the terror of October 7 and her months in captivity, describing the moment of her abduction and the faith that kept her going Daniella Gilboa, who was released in the second round of the first phase of the hostage deal, shared a heartfelt post on Instagram Sunday morning about her time in captivity and her return home. 'What a surreal year I've had –I don’t even know where to begin,' she wrote. 'First and foremost, I want to thank the people who stood by my family for a year and three months, who never gave up, never lost hope.' A widely shared video shows Gilboa and fellow female IDF lookouts singing 'Am Yisrael Chai' in a meeting with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 'We want to say thank you, to you and President Trump for everything,' Liri Albag told him. Witkoff responded: 'The people of the United States stand with you, the president stands with you. We have a common goal – to bring everybody home.' Hamas, in a psychological warfare tactic against the hostages’ families, previously released a video showing Gilboa’s tattoo in an attempt to falsely claim she had died in captivity. Addressing the incident, she wrote: 'Thank you for waiting for me, for not believing the horrific rumors, for continuing to pray for me throughout this entire time. That was my last request before I was taken.' Gilboa then described the moment of her abduction from a reinforced shelter in Nahal Oz. 'I refused to despair or say goodbye. Instead, I prayed and believed with all my heart that my story wouldn’t end in that shelter,' she recounted. 'For half an hour, I prayed for every girl with me because I felt there was nothing more powerful I could do at that moment. I couldn't rely on the army coming to protect me, or on the shelter itself – it wasn’t just about missiles this time. Even the few armed girls with us weren’t enough to make me feel safe.' 'I knew the only thing that could save us was faith' On Saturday morning, she and fellow hostages Karina, Naama, Liri and Agam recited the Birkat HaGomel prayer in synagogue, a prayer of thanksgiving after surviving a life-endangering situation – a moment she had long awaited. 'From the day I survived October 7, I was waiting for this – to thank God for saving us against all odds,' she wrote. 'Eight days ago, after 477 days in captivity, I was finally reunited with my loved ones – the family I thought about and worried for more than I worried about myself. The people who were with me, not physically, but in spirit, who never gave up and did everything to bring me home. They strengthened me even without knowing it. 'Thank you, my dear family. Thank you, my beloved friends who fought for me until I returned.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gilboa also expressed gratitude to her boyfriend, writing: 'Thank you, Roiko, my love, for giving me so much strength from afar. You appeared in my dreams, in my thoughts every hour of the day. For over a year, we were together in heart and soul. I love you.' She then praised the soldiers who risked their lives in the fight to bring the hostages home. 'Thank you to the heroic soldiers who fought with immense bravery and to those who gave their lives with one goal in mind – to find us and bring us back. Each and every one of us. I appreciate and love you so much. Stay strong, you are incredible.' 'With God’s help, very soon we will see all the hostages – both the living and those we lost – back home with their families and loved ones. We cannot give up now. This isn’t over – there are still people who need to come home. And if anyone understands that, it’s you, the people of Israel, who are fighting with all your might and giving them a sliver of hope in the darkness.' Gilboa ended her message with a vow to honor the memory of her fallen friends. 'I am deeply grateful for the incredible chance I was given – to live and to commemorate all the friends who were brutally murdered in the command center and in Nahal Oz. May their memory be a blessing. I will never stop until the end of my days.' 'I love you all so much,' she concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bye11jg6oje	2025-02-02T06:56:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BJxDE11ChOJx/BJxDE11ChOJx_24_174_415_234_0_small.jpg

More Hamas cruelty: The 'thank you' letter Keith Siegel was force...	Not just 'gift bags' and 'release certificates': In a letter circulated online, the hostage released from captivity yesterday allegedly confessed to Hamas; 'Those guarding me during this period took care of all my needs,' it read; But the Hostages and Missing Families Forum clarified: 'The terrorists who held him forced him to write them a detailed letter of thanks, this is another example of Hamas' cruelty' In a letter distributed online by Hamas, Keith Siegel - who was released Saturday from captivity in Gaza - allegedly thanked the terrorists who held him for 484 days. 'I was treated well by them,' he allegedly wrote. But a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum clarified that 'the Hamas terrorists who held Keith forced him to write them a detailed letter of thanks. This is one example of many of the cruel and cynical conduct of the Hamas terrorist organization and the urgency of returning all the hostages to Israel.' 'To the Qassam fighters, my name is Keith Siegel and I am from Kfar Aza. I was a prisoner in Gaza from October 7, 2023 until January 2025,' the letter began. The release date was not specified, and it is possible that the letter was dictated by the terrorists a few days before - when it was not yet clear when Siegel would be released. According to the letter that Siegel was ordered to write: 'My guards during this period took care of all my needs, food and drink, medicine, vitamins, eye drops, a blood pressure measuring device and more. They also made sure I got a doctor's checkup when I felt unwell for a long time. The guards considered my needs and responded to my requests regarding nutrition, eating habits and more. They made sure I had food that suited my health needs.'

I wish and hope for peace soon. To the fighters who guarded me during this period, I would like to say thank you,' the letter also said. Siegel said upon his return that he was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian, and that he ate it when it was given to him since he received very little food. The last time he ate before he was released was Friday afternoon. This letter joins the cynical 'release certificates' that Hamas distributes to released hostages as a kind of receipt for the prisoners, including murderers, who are being released from Israeli prisons in the cease-fire and hostage return deal. To all those released so far, Hamas has distributed so-called 'gift bags,' which in some cases also included a map of the Gaza Strip; Siegel was given an additional 'gift bag' to pass on to his wife, Aviva Sigal, who was released in the deal more than a year ago. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h12orwtdjl	2025-02-02T06:21:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/H1LbTgp00kx/H1LbTgp00kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Greek resort island Santorini on alert after dozens of earthquake...	Greece closes schools at Santorini and bans gatherings in enclosed spaces following a series of earthquakes in the area, the strongest of which clocked in at 4.6 Greek authorities have advised people on the Aegean island of Santorini to shut schools on Monday, avoid two small ports, and refrain from gathering in indoor spaces after increased seismic activity in the area over recent days.

Syrian President Sharaa meets Saudi Crown Prince in Riyadh on fir...	Syria's transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa met Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh on Sunday in his first foreign trip as Syrian leader, Saudi state news agency SPA reported. Live TV footage showed Sharaa shaking hands with the crown prince in the Saudi capital before sitting down for talks. The Saudi crown prince is the second Gulf leader to meet Sharaa since the latter was declared president for a transitional phase last week. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani met Sharaa in Damascus on Thursday, becoming the first head of state to visit the Syrian capital since Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December. Sharaa, an Islamist who was once an affiliate of al-Qaida, has been trying to gain support from Arab and Western leaders since Assad was toppled. Sharaa was accompanied on his visit by Syria's foreign minister, Asaad Hassan al-Shibani.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1gynza00ke	2025-02-02T05:42:44-08:00

The family of captive survivor Keith Siegel, who was released on Saturday after 484 days in Gaza, said that 'the Hamas terrorists who held Keith forced him to write them a detailed letter of thanks. This is one example of many of the cruel and cynical conduct of the terrorist organization and the urgency of returning all the hostages back to Israel.' In the letter, Keith wrote: 'The guards took care of all my needs: food and drink, medicine, vitamins and more. They made sure I was examined by a doctor when I felt unwell, and they responded to my requests regarding nutrition. I was treated well.' It also said that 'the government did not do what was necessary to reach a deal. I wish for peace soon, and would like to say thank you to the fighters who guarded me.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1nigwaojx	2025-02-02T05:38:01-08:00

It becomes a part of your story': American-Israeli violinist's f...	Award winning violinst Miri Ben-Ari talks with Ynet about her special connection to former hostage due to their shared instrument and an upcoming show featuring the two All of Israel is closely following the advance of the second hostage deal with Hamas, currently in its first phase, as many celebrate the return of captives held in Gaza since the terror group’s attack on Israel on October 7 nearly a year and a half ago. One of the recent hostages to be released was IDF lookout Agam Berger who was abducted from her post in Nahal Oz. Berger is also a talented violinist recognized in the country and had many local and foreign musicians follow her release from Gaza. One of them, Grammy Award-winning American-Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari, told Ynet she felt a deep connection to Berger: 'She's a violinist, I am a violinist. We both enjoy playing violin and once you relate to someone on that level it becomes a part of your story.' Ben-Ari recalled hearing Berger’s violin playing while she was still in captivity. 'I heard her playing 'Hallelujah' and I said that once she's out, I’ll invite her to come to New York and play violin with me. 'I also spoke to this terrific organization, the Israeli American Council, that has organized so many protests and demonstrations all over America for the hostages and they would facilitate this performance. This is official. I'm putting it out. And I'm so looking forward to meeting her,' she said. Ben-Ari added she believed the power of music and playing the violin could help Berger face her trauma in a way akin to therapy. 'I think the violin could become extremely therapeutic. It's something she knows. You don't forget how to play the violin. And it's like an extension of your soul,' she said. 'You get to express yourself to sometimes say things beyond words. The violin comes from your soul. I recommend everyone who is going through a healing journey and especially Agam, who is a violinist, to pick up her violin again and try and create some music. Hopefully with me.' 'I think that music is the very universal language. It is the best vehicle to show unity, to show how harmony should look like, to be proud, to have a voice, not to be afraid,' she added. 'Music and violin could become anything that you want.' 'In my journey, it was hip hop music, which has been my career. I've been the hip hop violinist from the Apollo stage to the White House to my many collaborations. And I hope that with music, we'll be able to make a whole different statement that is going to have a really good and positive impact.'

And we all deal with that in different capacities. There is a lot of antisemitism all over the world and unfortunately also in America.' 'One of the things that I chose to do to combat hate and antisemitism is through my project, Symphony of Brotherhood,' she added. 'It's a partnership with the Israeli Commission here and the government in New Jersey and the Department of Education.' 'We are opening Black History Month in a couple of days: 18 high schools here in Newark, 2,000 high school students, the lieutenant governor and a lot of politicians and influentials will attend.' 'I am taking my electric violin along with a Holocaust survivor violin that was given to me by Violins of Hope. It was, Amnon Weinstein who facilitated all of these instruments. And I'm going to switch violins in the middle of my show in order to tell the story of that violin that survived the Holocaust,' she explained. 'Now I get to tell the story by playing this instrument. I get to talk about the Holocaust and my family, who are third generation to Holocaust survivors through this violin. This is so unique and I'm so honored. I've gotten to play those violins of hope before and I usually don't make myself cry while I'm on stage, but these violins made me cry,' she concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rj3cat3dkl	2025-02-02T05:30:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rJDGhi2dkl/rJDGhi2dkl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hamas prisoners deported in hostage deal remain stranded in Cairo...	Dozens of Hamas terrorists freed in hostage deal remain stuck in Cairo as host countries delay acceptance; Palestinian official describes their situation as moving 'from an Israeli prison to an Egyptian prison' Seventy Hamas terrorists released from Israeli prisons and deported to Egypt as part of the hostage deal remain confined to a hotel in Cairo, as the countries expected to take them in have yet to formally approve their entry. 'Not a single Arab country has agreed to accept even one deported Palestinian prisoner,' a Palestinian Prisoners' Authority official told Ynet. He added that Turkey has agreed to take in the Jerusalemite deportees but will first review their backgrounds. According to the official, all released prisoners are housed in a hotel and are not allowed to leave. He described their situation as moving 'from an Israeli prison to an Egyptian prison,' noting that Hamas leadership has so far remained silent and has not publicly pressured nations like Qatar and Turkey to expedite their acceptance. The official also claimed that the former prisoners spent an extended period wearing Israeli prison uniforms and slippers, adding, 'The Egyptians are not treating them warmly.' Meanwhile, 23 additional prisoners who were set to be deported abroad remain stranded in Gaza. Besides Egypt, other countries mentioned as potential hosts for the deported prisoners include Algeria, Turkey, Tunisia and Qatar. In a joint statement, Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s foreign minister said they are willing to accept some of the released prisoners but did not specify a number. Separately, Palestinian sources reported two airstrikes in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. The second strike reportedly killed three people and wounded others. The strikes targeted vehicles traveling along the Al-Rashid coastal road, designated for pedestrian movement northward. Under the current agreement, Palestinians wishing to drive north must do so via Salah al-Din Road, where vehicles are subject to inspection. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyuwt0h00yx	2025-02-02T03:01:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/r1mPpsuHdJe/r1mPpsuHdJe_0_92_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Israel grants residency to 5 Thai hostages freed from Gaza	Interior Minister Moshe Arbel tells Thai foreign minister Israel will grant residency to five Thai nationals freed from Hamas captivity after 15 months in Gaza, calling it a humanitarian gesture Interior Minister Moshe Arbel announced Sunday that five Thai nationals freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza will be granted Israeli residency as a humanitarian gesture. The five were held hostage for more than 15 months after being abducted during the October 7 massacre. Arbel shared the decision during a meeting in his office with Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa, where the two also discussed expanding bilateral agreements on employment sectors. Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation has arrived in Bangkok for talks with Thai officials on advancing cooperation. The five freed hostages—Sathian Suwannakham, Pongsak Thenna, Bannawat Seathao, Watchara Sriaoun and Surasak Lamnau—were released Thursday after 482 days in captivity.

I have been waiting for this moment for so long—I can barely breathe,' she said. Upon their return, the freed hostages described harrowing conditions in captivity. They said they were split into two groups and held in underground tunnels, where they struggled to breathe, endured severe food shortages, and were subjected to near-constant bombardment. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by8hqrh00yx	2025-02-02T02:51:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/H1kl7zYO1l/H1kl7zYO1l_18_62_771_434_0_small.jpg
The hunger, the fear and the fight to stay alive: Freed hostages ...	Held for over 15 months in tunnels, safe houses and UNRWA facilities—some in isolation—hostages endured starvation, injuries and psychological terror; some were locked in cages, others forced to work; many learned Arabic, some managed to read, write and observe Shabbat Gadi Mozes, 80, maintained a morning walking routine and kept a journal, while the IDF lookouts refrained from eating leavened food on Passover and fasted on Yom Kippur. Keith Siegel, a vegetarian, was forced to eat meat due to food shortages. Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon were held in cages during their first days in captivity, while Emily Damari, after being shot twice, was transferred to a UNRWA facility without medical care. These are some of the first testimonies emerging after the release of 13 Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals, who spent over 15 months in Hamas captivity. Siegel was held in Gaza City for 484 days, frequently moved between safe houses and tunnels. Terrorists locked him in separate rooms to prevent him from being found if anyone entered. According to reports by public broadcaster Kan, Siegel initially believed his son, Shai, had been killed, until he heard his voice on the radio and realized he had survived. He described the severe food shortages, recounting that he had to eat meat despite being vegetarian and that his last meal was a full day before his release. Bibas and Calderon, who were violently abducted, were reportedly held in cages together in their first days in captivity. Terrorists mistakenly assumed Calderon was an IDF reservist, which is why he was released in a military uniform. Both men were kept in tunnels and various buildings alongside other hostages, enduring psychological terror. One of the most harrowing moments was the brutal video in which Bibas was filmed after being falsely told that his wife, Shiri, and their sons, Ariel and Kfir, had died—an assertion that Israeli authorities have been unable to confirm or refute. Eyal Calderon, who has yet to reunite with his cousin Ofer, said he learned from Ofer’s children that, until a few weeks ago, Ofer did not know his son Rotem was alive. 'He was in a state of complete uncertainty, and then he found out through a media interview that his son had survived,' he said. 'What he endured is unimaginable. There’s still a long road ahead—his recovery will be long, with ups and downs.' Jimmy Pacheco, the caregiver of Amitai Ben-Tzvi, who was murdered on October 7, was kidnapped and later released in a previous deal. He had previously recounted being held in tunnels with Bibas and Calderon, developing a close bond with them. 'When I cried, they comforted me and assured me that the Israeli government was helping. We sang together, we laughed and I even taught Yarden my language,' he told Army Radio. Isolation, faith and forced labor Newly released hostages are sharing harrowing accounts of their time in Hamas captivity, detailing extreme isolation, forced labor and the small routines that helped them survive. Gadi Mozes, 80, structured his days in captivity to maintain both his physical and mental well-being. He walked in circles, counting tiles to track his distance, and solved math problems to stay mentally sharp. For most of his 484 days in captivity, he was alone. The first hostage he met was 29-year-old Arbel Yehoud, just before her release. Mozes, who speaks Arabic, used his language skills to communicate with his captors, who eventually provided him with English books. He kept a daily journal, writing a few lines each day, though it was confiscated before his release. He had limited access to outside information, but glimpses of his family on TV reassured him that they were fighting for his freedom. When asked what kept him going, he said the thought of reuniting with his loved ones was his main motivation, though he also experienced moments of betrayal, wondering why he and the others were still in captivity. Arbel Yehoud spent nearly 16 months in total isolation, unaware of the full extent of the October 7 attack on her kibbutz, Nir Oz, where one in four residents was either killed or kidnapped. Mozes was the first Israeli she encountered in captivity, meeting him just hours before she was freed. After her release, her father, Yechiel, said, 'She returned in relatively good health, considering the hell she endured. She survived heroically until the very last moment.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF lookouts who were taken hostage on October 7 spent their 477 days in captivity in both apartments and tunnels, some held together, others alone. Naama Levy was kept in isolation for a long period before being reunited with fellow captives Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev, who had known each other from their service on base. Despite strict prohibitions against physical contact or crying, they found ways to support each other, exercised despite the extreme conditions and food shortages, and were often forced to cook, clean and care for the children of their captors. The hostages tried to preserve their identities and faith even under duress. They refused to eat leavened bread during Passover, attempted to fast on Yom Kippur, and Agam Berger, the last lookout to be released, even observed the Sabbath. Liri Albag, another captive, relied on her charisma to navigate captivity and managed to avoid being held in tunnels for most of her time in Gaza. The two were separated shortly before their release, with Albag taken to film a propaganda video while Berger remained alone. As she was freed, Berger said, 'I chose the path of faith, and in faith, I returned.' Naama Levy, who was freed in an earlier exchange, was initially held alone for a long time before being reunited with her fellow hostages. When they finally met, she asked if the moment was real and whether they were still alive. Many of the lookouts recounted being forced to perform household chores for their captors. In an interview with Kol BaRama radio, Yafa Deri, who met with the released soldiers, said they had fasted on Yom Kippur and observed Passover customs, with Daniella even requesting traditional sfenj (North African doughnuts) for Mimouna at the end of the holiday. 'There were bombings, and they had to move from place to place, so there were no sfenj, but they are so sweet and knew their role, which is incredible,' she said. She added that Agam Berger refused to accept a Quran from her captors and instead prayed from a Hebrew prayer book she found, possibly left behind by Israeli soldiers. Mandy Damari, mother of Emily Damari, who was freed after 471 days in Hamas captivity, revealed that her daughter was held in facilities operated by UNRWA. 'Hamas held Emily in UNRWA facilities and denied her access to medical treatment after she was shot twice,' she said. 'It’s a miracle she’s alive.' Emily was released during the first phase of the current hostage deal alongside Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher. She was seen pushing a Hamas terrorist out of the vehicle that brought her to the Red Cross transfer point. Due to her injuries, two of her fingers had to be amputated. Eitan Gonen, father of Romi, told Ynet that the freed hostages supported each other in captivity. 'Romi needed permission from the terrorists for everything, even just to move right or left,' he said. He described the deep bond formed between Romi, Emily and Doron, who were held together. 'They were each other’s entire world in captivity. They talked, helped and took care of one another—like a mother, a father, a sister. Now that they’re back, they do everything together. They go out to eat, visit each other’s rooms and are inseparable. I look at them and see three superheroes.' In a video message played at a rally for the hostages in Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square, Doron said, 'I’m okay. The moment I can, I’ll be out there holding a sign,' signaling her commitment to continuing the fight to bring the remaining hostages home. Over the weekend, five Thai nationals abducted by Hamas on October 7 were also released in Khan Younis as part of a separate deal brokered by the Thai government. It remains unclear whether any concessions were made for their release. The freed hostages—Sathian Suwannakham, 34; Pongsak Thenna, 35; Bannawat Seathao, 27; Watchara Sriaoun, 32; and Surasak Lamnau, 30—spoke of prolonged periods of hunger, difficulty breathing in underground tunnels and being held in dark rooms. They were kept in two separate groups, with two in one location and three in another. During their captivity, they learned to communicate in Arabic with their captors. Despite the harsh conditions, their medical condition was reported as stable upon release. One more Thai hostage remains in captivity, along with a Nepalese citizen. Two Thai nationals and one Tanzanian citizen are believed to have been killed in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjbm6a3ukx	2025-02-02T02:15:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkWevT3001g/rkWevT3001g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israeli forces detained Lebanese fisherman, reports claim	Lebanese media claim Israeli Navy detained fisherman near Naqoura as Hezbollah supporters push for new border march despite IDF presence; Hezbollah-affiliated network alleges Israeli sniper shot at camera near Yaroun, releasing footage of incident Lebanese media reported Sunday that Israeli forces detained a fisherman near the coastal town of Naqoura, close to the Israel-Lebanon border, amid ongoing tensions as residents attempt to return to villages in southern Lebanon despite Israeli warnings. A video circulating online purportedly shows the moment of the arrest, with a voice in the background exclaiming, 'Look, he’s raising his hands. I swear to God, he raised his hands!' According to reports, the detained fisherman was identified as Mohammad Jahir. Lebanon’s state-run news agency claimed he was apprehended by an 'enemy Israeli boat' while fishing with his brother, who was left behind. The IDF said it was aware of the reports and the incident was under review. The alleged arrest comes amid renewed calls for Lebanese civilians to participate in 'marches of return' to southern villages still under Israeli military presence. Organizers have dubbed it the 'Second Sunday of Return,' marking a week since violent clashes erupted as thousands of Lebanese demonstrators, many waving Hezbollah flags, attempted to re-enter border villages following the expiration of the initial cease-fire agreement. According to Lebanese sources, at least 22 people, including a Lebanese soldier, were killed in those clashes, with over 100 others wounded. Although the cease-fire was extended until February 18 under U.S. mediation, Hezbollah and its affiliates continue urging civilians to push back into the disputed areas. Calls circulated Saturday night urging residents to gather at village entrances and 'stand alongside the families and the army in defense of the homeland.' By Sunday morning, small groups of Lebanese were seen assembling near border villages, including Meiss El Jabal and Hula, again carrying Hezbollah flags. Despite the mobilization efforts, participation appeared lower than last week, and no major confrontations had been reported. However, in the village of Yaroun, Hezbollah-affiliated network Al Mayadeen claimed an Israeli sniper shot at one of its cameras positioned at the northern entrance of the town. The news outlet shared footage allegedly showing the camera falling from its tripod, though no gunfire was heard in the video. Israeli officials have defended their continued military presence in parts of southern Lebanon, citing the Lebanese army’s failure to deploy effectively in Hezbollah-controlled areas south of the Litani River. Israeli assessments suggest that last week's border confrontations were orchestrated by Hezbollah to provoke clashes with IDF forces, reinforcing Israel’s justification for maintaining a presence in the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although the cease-fire remains in effect, it is unclear whether the IDF will complete its withdrawal by the February 18 deadline. A senior Israeli military official told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth last week that 'until the Lebanese army fully assumes its responsibilities and demonstrates sufficient control over the area, we will not recommend transferring authority to them.' Tensions have also flared in recent days, with the IDF intercepting a suspicious aerial target over the northern border town of Zar'it on Friday. A day earlier, Israeli fighter jets downed a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone—the first such incident since the cease-fire extension. The IDF also conducted a rare airstrike deep in southern Lebanon, targeting a truck and another vehicle suspected of smuggling Hezbollah weaponry in violation of the cease-fire terms. On Thursday night, the Israeli Air Force carried out additional strikes in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, hitting multiple Hezbollah positions. According to the IDF, the sites targeted included an underground weapons production facility and cross-border smuggling routes used by Hezbollah to transfer arms from Syria into Lebanon. The military said the strikes were intended to neutralize threats to Israeli forces and civilian areas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4aka3okl	2025-02-02T01:42:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/By11qfAihOyg/By11qfAihOyg_0_221_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israeli forces push into another West Bank terrorist stronghold	After operations in Tulkarm and Jenin, IDF forces enter Tamun overnight, where 10 terrorists killed in airstrike last week; troops launch ground maneuver at dawn, uncovering weapons and explosives as part of counterterror efforts The IDF announced Sunday the expansion of its Iron Wall counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank, confirming that combat teams from the Bislach Brigade have begun operating in the Palestinian village of Tamun. According to the IDF, forces entered Tamun overnight and uncovered weapons, including an M-16 rifle and ammunition magazines. This marks the latest expansion of the nearly two-week-old operation, which now includes brigade-level combat teams operating simultaneously in three locations: the Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps, and now Tamun. 'Security forces continue the operation to thwart terrorism in northern Samaria while ensuring the safety of Israeli civilians,' the IDF said. Since the start of the operation, IDF troops have been conducting raids in the hostile urban terrain of Jenin, a densely packed area of approximately 1.5 square kilometers, arresting and eliminating terrorists. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last week, Staff Sgt. Liam Hazi of the Haruv Reconnaissance Battalion was killed in an encounter with Palestinian gunmen in Jenin, where four other soldiers were lightly to moderately wounded, and another was seriously injured. The IDF has recently extended its operation to Tulkarm's Nur Shams refugee camp, implementing checkpoints to screen residents for potential terrorist activity in both Jenin and Tulkarm. On Saturday, Israeli aircraft struck two groups of armed terrorists near the Jenin refugee camp, with confirmed hits, according to the military. Later, the IDF targeted a vehicle carrying terrorists in Kabatiya, south of Jenin, killing three individuals. Palestinian sources identified one of the dead as Abd al-Hadi Kamil, a Hamas operative who was released from Israeli prison in the first hostage deal in November 2023. Tamun, the latest focus of IDF operations, was targeted in an Israeli airstrike last Wednesday that killed at least 10 terrorists, including Omar Basharat and Montaser Bani Odeh, who were involved in a roadside bomb attack that killed IDF reservist Sgt. First Class (res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda. The two were also linked to additional shooting and bombing attacks. In early January, the IDF confirmed another airstrike in Tamun targeting a group of terrorists. Palestinian reports claimed three people were killed, including two children aged 8 and 10. The IDF claimed that those killed were confirmed as terrorists actively planting explosives near Israeli forces. Prior to that, two armed Palestinians who opened fire at Israeli troops were killed in a drone strike. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjqnmhhu1l	2025-02-02T00:02:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BkHuBq3Oyl/BkHuBq3Oyl_0_534_1200_676_0_small.jpg

Iraqi militias deny negotiations for Israeli hostage Elizabeth Ts...	Three Iraqi sources close to pro-Iranian militias denied reports of negotiations to secure the release of Israeli hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov, insisting there are 'no channels of communication with the Israeli enemy.' The sources told the Qatari newspaper The New Arab that claims circulating in Israeli media were false and that they had first heard about such reports through the press. However, on Friday, sources in Baghdad and Beirut told the British-based news outlet Amwaj that a proposal had been raised for a potential prisoner exchange. Under the suggested deal, Israel would release Hezbollah operatives and the captain of a Lebanese vessel—whom the IDF identified as a senior Hezbollah figure—in return for Tsurkov’s freedom.

Pro-Iranian militia sources in Iraq deny reports of negotiations for Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov’s release, saying, 'There are no channels with the Israeli enemy' and dismiss Iraq’s claim of efforts to free her Three Iraqi sources close to pro-Iranian militias denied reports of negotiations to secure the release of Israeli hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov, insisting there are 'no channels of communication with the Israeli enemy.' The sources told the Qatari newspaper The New Arab that claims circulating in Israeli media were false and that they had first heard about such reports through the press. However, on Friday, sources in Baghdad and Beirut told the British-based news outlet Amwaj that a proposal had been raised for a potential prisoner exchange. Under the suggested deal, Israel would release Hezbollah operatives and the captain of a Lebanese vessel—whom the IDF identified as a senior Hezbollah figure—in return for Tsurkov’s freedom.

She was abducted in Baghdad on March 26, 2023, during a research trip.

Prison issues warning bracelets to terrorists freed in hostage de...	Palestinian prisoners set for release under hostage deal given bracelets inscribed with Bible verse in Arabic and overview of Gaza’s destruction, aimed at deterring them from returning to terrorism Palestinian prisoners released in the third and fourth rounds of the hostage deal’s first phase received bracelets from the Israel Prison Service (IPS) with an Arabic inscription from the Book of Psalms, reading: 'The eternal nation does not forget; I will pursue my enemies and overtake them.' Signs with the same message were displayed in IPS detention facilities as part of a psychological campaign alongside the prisoner releases. The translation on the bracelets was written in formal Arabic, which many prisoners struggled to understand. 'No matter what they write, will it change anything?' a Palestinian Prisoners’ Affairs official said. 'It’s a gesture of provocation and threat, but beyond that, it has no meaning. All the prisoners removed IPS-issued clothing, including the bracelet meant to insult them.' The International Red Cross criticized the IPS, arguing that the method of shackling and the use of the bracelets harmed the prisoners. During the release process, one prisoner felt unwell and was treated by IPS medical staff. Ynet has learned that the prisoners were briefed on the destruction in Gaza to deter them from returning to terrorism. Israel released 183 prisoners on Saturday — 143 were transferred from Ketziot Prison in the Negev to Gaza, eight were deported to Egypt and 32 were released to the West Bank from Ofer Prison, after which celebrations were held in Ramallah.

We can expand the circle of peace': PM says talks will focus on Saudi normalization, next phase of hostage deal and countering Iranian threat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed for Washington on Sunday for his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump since the latter’s return to office. Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the White House, underscoring the strong ties between the two allies. Before boarding his flight, Netanyahu said the meeting was of 'great significance' for Israel, highlighting the deep bond between the two nations and his personal relationship with Trump. 'This connection has already yielded great achievements, including the historic Abraham Accords,' he said, referring to normalization agreements with four Arab nations brokered during Trump’s previous term. 'We can strengthen Israel’s security, expand the circle of peace even further and usher in a remarkable era beyond our imagination—an era of prosperity, security and peace through strength. The strength of our soldiers, our citizens, Israel and the alliance between Israel and the United States,' Netanyahu concluded. During the visit, Netanyahu is expected to discuss key issues, including the ongoing hostage deal negotiations, post-war governance in Gaza and broader regional stability. Talks will also address Iran’s nuclear ambitions and potential normalization with Saudi Arabia—though Riyadh has conditioned any agreement on a political pathway for the Palestinians, a demand Netanyahu has so far resisted. Netanyahu’s delegation includes Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, hostage coordinator Gal Hirsch and newly appointed communications advisor Caroline Glick. Also on board was Netanyahu’s personal physician, following his recent prostate surgery. The visit comes as Trump’s administration is still shaping its Middle East policy. Israeli officials believe the trip could influence the White House’s approach to the region. 'Only after this meeting will it be possible to fully assess Trump’s policy direction,' a senior Israeli official said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu and Trump will seek to establish priorities for urgent regional matters, including the second phase of the hostage deal and Gaza’s future. The negotiations, led by Qatari, Egyptian and U.S. mediators, are expected to resume Monday.

Iran is expected to be a central focus of discussions, with Israel seeking clarity on whether the U.S. plans to engage diplomatically with Tehran on a new nuclear deal. Israeli officials stress that Washington’s broader regional commitments—particularly to Saudi Arabia and the UAE—are closely tied to its Iran strategy. Netanyahu is likely to urge Trump to prioritize countering Iran before addressing Palestinian-related demands from the Saudis. During the visit, Netanyahu will reunite with his wife, Sara, who has been in Miami for the past 70 days. Trump is set to host Netanyahu at Blair House, the presidential guest residence, and a formal dinner at the White House.

These are the 20 hostages set to be freed ahead of fifth hostage ...	3 hostages will be released each week in deal's first phase, followed by expected release of 11 more captives before negotiations begin on next stage Despite challenges, Israel’s hostage deal with Hamas remains intact and the terror group appears intent on maintaining it at least until day 42, the final day of the agreement’s first phase. Following the release of hostages Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon and Yarden Bibas on Saturday, the number of hostages returned to Israel under the deal has reached 18, including five Thai nationals freed on Thursday. Seventy-nine hostages remain in Gaza, a third of the 251 taken on October 7, 2023, in Hamas’ massacre, 35 of whom are considered deceased. The deal’s first phase, set to return 33 Israelis, is expected to bring back 20 more, including the remaining members of the Bibas family —mother Shiri and children Ariel and Kfir. The IDF warned there was a 'grave concern for their lives.' Seven hostages over 50 are slated for release: Ohad Ben Ami, Eliyahu Sharabi, Itzik Elgart, Shlomo Mansour, Ohad Yahalomi, Oded Lifshitz and Tzachi Idan.

A separate list includes two foreign nationals, a Thai and a Nepalese hostage, whose condition remains unknown, along with the bodies of three foreign workers — two Thai and one Tanzanian. Four more release rounds remain in the first phase: three rounds of three hostages each, followed by a final release of 11 hostages on day 42, including al-Sayed and Mengistu.

New IDF chief faces tough task of rebuilding military amid war	Architect of Israel’s wartime arms race now faces new battle—balancing draft exemption debate as combat units lack troops and reserve turnout drops; with war dragging past 16 months, Eyal Zamir must brace for fresh rounds against Hamas The Israeli government has named Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir as the next chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), replacing Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Zamir, a former deputy chief of staff and director-general of the Defense Ministry, was the leading candidate for the position since the early days of the war, following Halevi’s acceptance of responsibility for the failures of October 7. Zamir, who previously served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s military secretary, was widely seen as the most experienced and suitable choice. His appointment marks the second time in recent history that a defense ministry director-general has transitioned directly into the IDF’s top position, following Lt. Gen. (res.) Gabi Ashkenazi’s appointment in 2007 after the failures of the Second Lebanon War. As chief of staff, Zamir will face the immense challenge of rebuilding the IDF after months of intense combat, implementing a long-term restructuring plan and preparing the military for multi-front conflicts rather than the traditional two-front model. He will also have to navigate the political and military complexities surrounding the draft exemption for ultra-Orthodox men, a contentious issue that has placed strain on the IDF’s manpower needs. During his tenure as defense ministry director-general, Zamir played a key role in securing military aid, orchestrating air and sea supply lines that brought critical weapons shipments to Israel amid increasing international pressure and embargoes. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, he is expected to benefit from renewed U.S. military support, including the delivery of thousands of precision-guided munitions previously frozen by the Biden administration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zamir’s immediate priorities will include overseeing fragile cease-fires in both Gaza and Lebanon. While a temporary truce with Hezbollah is in place until at least February 18 under U.S. mediation, tensions remain high, and Hamas’s agreement with Israel is also on shaky ground. If fighting resumes in Gaza, Zamir will be responsible for executing further military operations against Hamas while securing an expanded buffer zone along the border. The lack of a long-term governance plan for Gaza presents another significant challenge. With Hamas still exerting civilian control over the enclave’s population, military gains from months of operations risk being eroded. Zamir may be forced to revert to a policy he knows well from his time as head of the Southern Command: frequent, limited engagements with Hamas to maintain deterrence, but this time with stronger defensive measures aimed at preventing another October 7-style attack. The new chief of staff will also have to address growing fatigue among Israel’s active-duty and reserve forces. Many reservists have served between six months and a year in the ongoing war, and enlistment rates are declining. With the government keeping forces deployed in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, Zamir will need to push the political leadership to establish clearer military priorities and address troop shortages in combat units. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1sjufnukx	2025-02-01T20:59:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/07/11/HJUG3cOpu/HJUG3cOpu_0_91_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Saudi Arabia, Iran and 'the day after': Netanyahu heads to crucia...	The prime minister will meet with the U.S. president, with the goal of influencing American policy that is still being formed; At least one fateful decision will be made during the visit - which will likely affect both the fate of the hostage deal and the Netanyahu government The Iranian issue, 'the day after' and normalization with Saudi Arabia are on the table as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes off Sunday morning for a significant visit to Washington, with the aim of influencing the new administration's policy priorities. The most important part of the trip will be Netanyahu's personal meeting with the new-old U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House, during which the two will try to piece together the complex puzzle of the Middle East and set priorities on all the burning issues on the agenda. In focus: the hostage deal , the Gaza Strip, Hamas, 'the day after' and the entire issue of reconstruction. Netanyahu is the first foreign leader invited to meet with Trump, who will roll out the red carpet for him, host him at the official Blair House guest house, and invite him to a gala dinner at the White House. Israel attaches great importance to the visit, and believes that the prime minister will be able to influence the way Trump shapes his administration's policy regarding the Middle East - along with the understanding that the U.S. president also has his own instincts and interests. Trump talked about the Middle East before his inauguration on January 20, but on many issues he has not yet made decisions. Netanyahu is interested in influencing this process, and an Israeli official even said that 'only after his meeting with Trump will it be possible to formulate a policy. Until then, there is not much room to move forward.' Trump's ambitions for the 'relocation' of Gazans in favor of rebuilding the Strip are no joke, and his statements are also consistent with his statements about deporting immigrants to Mexico. Even if there is currently no Arab country willing to accept the Palestinians, Trump continues to bring it up again and again - perhaps also for internal American considerations. In his view, it would be impossible to rehabilitate Gaza without evacuating the population - the land is contaminated, uninhabitable, and it would take years to clear the rubble and clean it up. The Iranian issue: Agreement or military operation After some hoped that the U.S., led by Trump, would cooperate with an attack on Iran, Israel is expecting to hear what the new president's plan is on the subject - and whether he intends to enter into a diplomatic dialogue with Tehran to reach a new nuclear agreement. Israel understands that the Iranian issue fits into the American perspective in the regional architecture, as there are other countries in the Middle East for which this issue is important - such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Therefore, the U.S. has obligations on this issue not only in the Israeli context. Trump's goal is for Iran to not have a nuclear bomb, and the two options he faces are either an agreement or military action against Iran, Israeli or joint. Until one of these outcomes is achieved, Israel would like to see the U.S. impose crippling sanctions on Iran, alongside a credible military threat to deter it. Trump, as has already been understood based on his statements and the statements of his deputy, will not initiate military action against Iran. He does not want to start wars and Iran is not his war, but there are certainly wars of others in which he can help. In doing so, Trump is effectively resolving for himself the contradiction between the desire to be a peacemaker and the ability to help Israel win on various fronts. In addition to the president, Netanyahu is also expected to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz , House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Senator Lindsey Graham. In the meetings he will hold, the parties will also discuss the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court in The Hague against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and the imposition of sanctions on ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan and his team. In addition, they will talk about the continued transfer of weapons from the U.S. to Israel, the maintenance of the cease-fire in Lebanon, the attitude toward the new regime in Syria, and the beginning of discussions on the security memorandum of understanding between the countries, with the current memorandum set to expire in 2028. During his visit, Netanyahu will meet with his wife Sara, who is expected to join him from Miami after not seeing each other for 70 days. This is the first time Netanyahu has flown abroad since the arrest warrant was issued against him, and Sara said she will return to Israel with him on the Wing of Zion official airplane after extending her stay in the U.S. several times. Phase 2 of the cease-fire and hostage deal Negotiations on the second phase of the hostage deal and the cease-fire, which have actually already begun behind closed doors but not formally, are scheduled to begin on Monday - on the 16th day after the cease-fire in the Gaza Strip comes into effect, as stipulated in the agreement. But on Saturday night Netanyahu announced that he will not send a team to Doha or Cairo, and right now it appears that the talks will be conducted in dialogues through envoy Steve Witkoff. Netanyahu holds onto promises from former President Joe Biden (in writing) and President Trump (oral), which state that Israel will be able to return to fighting in the Gaza Strip without it being considered a 'violation' as long as no agreements are reached in negotiations. But, it is clear to everyone that it is much more complex. The Americans are busy building pillars for strategic policy, and Trump is likely to ask - and even demand - the prime minister for more time, and not to return to fighting. From the statements made this week by Donald Trump's Middle East envoy , Steve Witkoff, it can also be understood that the administration does not want to see a return to fighting so quickly - and demands that the negotiations be exhausted to the end. However, voices can be heard in the administration expressing doubt about the ability to fully implement the agreement. As part of the negotiations on phase two of the deal, the parties are also supposed to discuss the issue of 'the day after' in Gaza, which is related to a crucial decision that may be made at the Netanyahu-Trump meeting - the answer to the question of what comes first: dealing with the Iranian threat or normalization with Saudi Arabia . The U.S. and Israel know that the Saudis will not come to the table unless there is a permanent cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and a 'political horizon' for the Palestinians, and it is still unclear as to what exactly it will demand from Israel in general and Netanyahu in particular on a practical or declarative level. It is not impossible that Netanyahu will try to convince Trump during their meeting to deal with the Iranian threat first. He will argue that this will also serve the interests of the Saudis and will give them time, without pressure, to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip.

In such a scenario, Trump could tell the prime minister: Before Iran, first end the war and return all the hostages. If you don't do this, you will get nothing - neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran. Therefore, if Netanyahu fails to convince Trump, and the American president insists on continuing the deal, he may in effect set a date for early elections in Israel. Either way, the prime minister plans to stay in the U.S. over next weekend - during the next round of the hostages' release. Netanyahu's intention is evident from the fact that, in a referendum on filling his position in his absence that was brought to the government, the ministers were asked to confirm that Netanyahu would stay in the U.S. between February 2 and February 9. His place will be filled by Minister Yariv Levin, and the cabinet meetings will be chaired by Defense Minister Israel Katz. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1liv73dkg	2025-02-01T14:32:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/23/ryxHzeETdC/ryxHzeETdC_0_68_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Keith thought his son had been murdered, then heard his voice on ...	The three hostages released Saturday spoke of appalling conditions including lack of food and frequent moves to new hiding places; Keith was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian; and Yarden Bibas, who learned Arabic in captivity, was imprisoned in a cage with Ofer Calderon and was subjected to physical and mental abuse. Keith Siegel, Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon returned to Israel Saturday morning after 484 days in captivity, during which they were held in very difficult conditions. Upon their return, they said they suffered from a lack of food and often were moved from place to place by Hamas terrorists. Keith was held in Gaza City, where he stayed with other hostages and moved between safe houses and tunnels. The terrorists locked him in a room each time, so that he could not be found if anyone broke in. Keith, according to a report on the public broadcaster, Kan, recalls the days of his captivity in detail - and said that he thought his son Shai had been murdered until he heard his voice on the radio and realized that he was alive. His wife, Aviva, did not know what had happened to her son until the day she was released from captivity in the previous hostage deal and saw him. Keith also described how he was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian, and that he ate it when it was given to him since he received very little food. The last time he ate before he was released was Friday afternoon. In addition, the public broadcaster reported that Yarden Bibas learned Arabic in captivity, and that the terrorists treated Ofer Calderon as a military reservist - which is why he was released in a military uniform. Yarden and Ofer said that during their first days of captivity in Khan Younis the terrorists beat them and locked them in cages - as described by the hostages who were with them and who were released in the previous deal. The two were subjected to severe physical and mental abuse, and were held in tunnels and buildings alongside other hostages. Among other things, the cruel video in which Yarden was filmed while the terrorists informed him of the death of his wife Shiri and his children Ariel and Kfir is particularly memorable - a statement that Israel has so far been unable to verify or discount. When Ofer arrived at the collection point with the IDF on Saturday, he asked the soldiers for a beer - but because of he was weak and just out of captivity he was told that it could only be done gradually. All three of the hostages who returned Saturday testified that they were exposed to the media, especially Al Jazeera, and that they saw the demonstrations for their release. According to them, the protests gave them strength and hope that they would eventually be reunited with their families. At Ichilov Hospital, where Keith Siegel was taken, Deputy Director General Professor Gil Fire said this evening that 'an initial assessment of his condition revealed that his condition is overall fine and stable, allowing him to spend time with his family, both to rest and to process the experiences of the last few days and the entire period. We will continue to accompany Keith and Mr. Gadi Mozes and examine in more depth the effects of the captivity. We will provide them with everything they need, including ancillary services. We will continue to keep them in the hospital as long as their medical condition requires and also provide additional tests, according to their wishes and those of their families.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Moran, the daughter of Gadi Mozes, who was released in the previous round on Thursday, told Ynet Saturday evening: 'I call on the entire public to take to the streets and fight until the last hostage is released. We must ensure that the rounds of release continue and move on to phase two of the deal as quickly as possible. We are there for my father, hugging him, and asking to maintain the privacy of my father and the family.' The other hostages who were returned in the current deal also spoke of food shortages, being moved from place to place and even being forced to stay in tunnels. Two of them - Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, who were held by Islamic Jihad - said they were alone for the entire period, and in fact the first time they saw an Israeli was when they met each other before they were released. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjewsw200yl	2025-02-01T12:01:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/B1yuXpj00yl/B1yuXpj00yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Syria's president to visit Saudi Arabia on Sunday, first trip abr...	Syria's transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa will visit Saudi Arabia on Sunday, the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported on Saturday, citing sources. It will be Sharaa's first official visit abroad since he assumed power after leading a rebel campaign that ousted Bashar al-Assad in December. Sharaa, an Islamist who was once an affiliate of al Qaeda, has been trying to gain support from Arab and Western leaders since former Syrian President Assad was toppled. The Saudi foreign minister visited Damascus on Jan. 24 and said the kingdom was engaged in talks with Europe and the U.S. to help lift economic sanctions imposed on Syria that had decimated its economy.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryconznokl	2025-02-01T11:32:17-08:00

Israel's next IDF chief of staff: Eyal Zamir	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have chosen Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, director general of the Defense Ministry, to be the first Chief of Staff to come from the Armored Corps since David (Dado) Elazar in the early 1970s; Next month, he will replace Herzi Halevi, who congratulated Zamir: 'I am sure he will lead the IDF forward' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have selected Eyal Zamir, a retired major general and director general of the Defense Ministry, to be the next IDFchief of staff. His appointment still requires the approval of the advisory committee for senior appointments - the Grunis Committee - and the official and final approval of the government. Assuming he passes successfully, Zamir - who was previously identified as the leading candidate for the position - is expected to take office on March 6, upon the resignation of outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. In doing so, Zamir will be the first chief of staff to come from the Armored Corps since David (Dado) Elazar in the 1970s. Zamir, 59, has been considered the leading candidate to succeed Halevi due to his experience, authority and professionalism, and mainly due to his views that opposed a small army. He is also considered a leading candidate by Netanyahu. At the 2021 Deputy Chief of Staff exchange ceremony, Zamir sounded a warning, stating that 'in the face of a multi-threat campaign, the IDF needs a critical mass of quality and quantity.' Senior political figures said of his candidacy that 'Zamir is the leading candidate for the position of the next Chief of Staff. He is accepted by the top brass of the country, and the right man to bring about healing to the army after the October 7 debacle.' Zamir, the former deputy chief of staff, is also considered very popular with many army officers. He has been involved in force building over the past year and has had excellent relations with the Americans. Since the beginning of the Iron Swords war, Zamir has been involved in an unprecedented purchase of weapons from the United States, including purchase deals for fighter jets and armaments, and also in increasing local production in Israel in the defense industries. As soon as he takes office, he will face major challenges: the immediate appointment of a deputy chief of staff, and a new commander of the Southern Command to replace Major General Yaron Finkelman, who retired. Zamir served in the IDF for 38 years in a variety of senior combat and command positions, including commander of the Southern Command and commander of the Ga'ash Division. In his last position in the army, which he held between 2018 and 2021, he served as Deputy Chief of Staff under Aviv Kochavi. During this period, he coordinated the headquarters' work to implement the multi-year Tnufa (Momentum) plan, and managed all military assistance to the civilian sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and during Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Before becoming Deputy Chief of Staff, Zamir served as Commander of the Southern Command and as the Prime Minister's Military Secretary. Before that, he was also IDF Ground Forces Chief.

In the coming weeks, we will complete a professional and high-quality transfer of command of the IDF.' The candidates were interviewed by Defense Minister Israel Katz, and at the end of the week by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The prime minister planned to announce the appointment of Chief of Staff before his departure for the United States, which is Sunday morning. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rylp7ghuje	2025-02-01T10:31:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/06/13/Hkv03iHwn/Hkv03iHwn_0_0_1024_683_0_small.jpg
Freed hostage Doron Steinbrecher speaks for 1st time: 'I am here ...	Freed hostage released nearly two weeks ago promised to fight for those left behind in a video message at the weekly rally in Hostage Square; 'I will do everything, until everyone returns home. We are together until the end ' Doron Steinbrecher , who was released from Hamas captivity in the first phase of the current deal, sent her first video message to the participants of the rally in Hostages' Square Saturday evening. 'The last time I sat like this with a camera pointed at me, it was in captivity, and this whole thing sends me back to all the videos of captivity that I filmed and saw,' she began. 'But this time I'm sitting comfortably on a couch, in a warm and cozy place, with my family looking at me - and no matter how difficult it is, it was important to me to film this video.' Steinbrecher said that 'I want you to see me, that I'm okay, and that it will take more time and it's a process that doesn't end in a week or two - but I'm here thanks to you. Thank you to all the people who embraced my family and are embracing me now, people who don't even know me. It's important for me to also say thank you to all the soldiers and security forces. I sit here to see and contemplate everything that was here in this crazy year - and I see what an important and huge part they played both on October 7 and after.' Steinbrecher then addressed the families of the hostages who remained in captivity: 'You are not alone, and we continue to fight for you. We will do everything, I will do everything, until everyone returns home and until you can close the circle. We are together until the end. The first second I can leave here, I will be there with a sign in my hand.' At the end, she addressed the citizens of Israel with a smile and a message: 'I understand that everyone knows me from the terrible recording 'Help me, help me,' or as the blonde wearing pink, 31 years old from the Kfar Aza. But I am no longer a blonde and I will no longer wear pink. I am Doron, 31 years old, and I am no longer a prisoner of Hamas. I am in my own home.'

We call on the people of Israel to come to Hostages' Square.'

'A mother who was privileged to hug her daughter, a hug that you all saw and hugged us back. Thank you very much for this, it is a victory that is so obvious, and also so not. I feel the missing, the silent cry of those who are waiting for their return. We cannot let go. We must not stop! I ask you, don't stop! Be there, continue with all your strength!' Doron's sister, Yamit Ashkenazi, also spoke: 'She is no longer a hostage. How I waited to say this. And how afraid I was to imagine this moment. 471 days of a long journey, in which optimism cracked time and time again, but hope – it always remained there, burning within us. The emotions are mixed – there is such great joy and gratitude, but also great anxiety. We must not be confused by the sights, we must not sink into euphoria. The recovery and reconstruction will not truly begin until everyone is home.' She turned to the leaders: 'Trump, Bibi and the mediators, you succeeded! 18 hostages have returned, thank you! I trust you to ensure that everyone returns home, down to the last hostage.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjkvnj2ujl	2025-02-01T10:16:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/H1lWVdy3dyx/H1lWVdy3dyx_0_267_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Trump says he ordered airstrikes on Islamic State in Somalia	U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered military airstrikes on Saturday targeting a senior Islamic State attack planner and others from the organization in Somalia. 'These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. 'The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.' Saturday's strikes were carried out in the Golis Mountains, said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who added that an initial assessment indicated multiple operatives were killed. He said no civilians were harmed. An official in the Somali president's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the strikes and said Somalia's government welcomed the move.

Defense minister threatens released terrorist Zubeidi: ' One mist...	Israel Katz sent a message to the former commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, saying that 'We will not accept support for terrorism'; Zakaria Zubeidi has complained since his release about torture in prison Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened released terrorist prisoner Zakaria Zubeidi, who was released on Thursday as part of the hostage deal, saying on Saturday evening that: 'We will not accept support for terrorism. One mistake and you’re going to meet old friends.' Zubeidi, a symbol of terrorism in Jenin who was formerly the commander of Fatah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in the Palestinian city in northern Samaria, was welcomed as a hero during celebrations in Ramallah on Thursday, making a V-shaped sign of victory and saying: 'Thanks be to Allah who blessed me with liberation today. May God have mercy on the martyrs in Gaza.' When asked about reports that Israel would not allow him to return to the Jenin refugee camp, where he was born and raised and where the IDF's major Operation Iron Wall is currently underway, he promised that he would eventually return. 'The dragon is the owner of the land and the hunter is an invader – and he must leave,' replied Zubeidi, referring to the nickname he was given in Jenin, and to Israel by 'the hunter.' The origin of these nicknames is the thesis he prepared for his master's degree at Birzeit University, titled 'The Hunter and the Dragon: Being Wanted in the Palestinian Experience 1968-2018.' Zubeidi, as he defines it, embodies the character of 'the dragon,' which originates from an ancient legend in which the dragon overcomes the hunter, after a long and difficult chase, referring to his personal experience with Israel. In an interview with the Turkish news agency Anadolu, Zubeidi claimed that he suffered torture in prison. 'I was beaten in Israeli prisons and remained handcuffed until the last day,' he alleged. 'For three and a half years I was in solitary confinement under torture in Israeli prisons. Gaza returned me to my family and we must unite to rebuild it.' In an interview with the British Sky News network on Saturday, Zubeidi said: 'My life is worth nothing without freedom, and freedom has no price - but the world has ignored my freedom - especially Britain, France and the U.S. They must return what they took from me and my children. They are the ones who were wrong about us - and they need to think about repairing the pain they caused me and my children.' Zubeidi, 49, began his career as a police officer in the Palestinian Authority, but became a terrorist whose main activity took place after Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, which brought about the end of the Second Intifada. He then became a very well-known figure in Israel, mainly due to his ties with Israeli left-wing activist Tali Fahima, who aided Palestinian terrorists, which attracted a lot of media attention. He is one of the senior terrorist operatives in the West Bank and is among the terrorists included in the 'wanted persons agreement' that was formulated in 2007 after the intifada, at which time he ceased to be wanted. Zubeidi was appointed as the representative of the Prisoners' Office in the Jenin refugee camp, and later also served as a member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council. In early 2019, he was arrested and imprisoned following several shooting attacks in the Beit El area. In 2021, he managed to escape from Gilboa prison, along with five other terrorists, and was only captured after a five-day extensive manhunt. Zubeidi had previously spent many years in an Israeli prison, for being the commander of Fatah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Jenin.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byl0acsoke	2025-02-01T09:30:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/SkSLePKuye/SkSLePKuye_0_163_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Dad, you’re a hero!': Keith Siegel's emotional homecoming from G...	Wrapped in Israeli flag, Siegel returns to Israel after 484 days in Hamas captivity, waving to supporters at hospital; his wife Aviva tearfully exclaims, 'He looks good!' His daughter Shir calls him a 'champion' Israeli American hostage Keith Siegel returned to Israel on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity, reuniting with his family in an emotional meeting at Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. Siegel, who was released at Gaza’s seaport, was transferred to Israeli security forces and documented smiling and waving before crossing into Israel. After undergoing an initial medical evaluation at a reception center near Gaza, he was flown by helicopter to the hospital, where he walked out wrapped in an Israeli flag alongside his wife, Aviva, who was freed in a previous hostage release deal. Ignoring a wheelchair offered to him, Siegel waved to the crowd as Aviva tearfully exclaimed, 'He looks good!' Their daughter, Shir, shared a celebratory message on social media: 'Our dad is home!!!' In video footage from the hospital, Siegel’s children embraced him, saying, 'Dad, you made it! You're amazing for surviving!' to which he replied, 'You are the amazing ones.' Family members described their relief and gratitude. 'Finally, we can breathe again,' said Siegel’s nephew Gil. 'It feels like a dream. We’re waiting for the hug we’ve missed for so long.' The family prepared Siegel’s favorite meal—pancakes—for his return. 'This will be his first treat, but the real gift is the huge hug from all of us,' Gil added. The family also vowed to keep fighting for those still held in Gaza. 'This is not over until the last hostage comes home,' said Siegel’s nephew, Itay, who noted that another relative, Elia Cohen, remains in captivity. Former hostage Emily Damari, who was freed last month, watched Siegel’s release with Shir, writing on Instagram: 'What a moment of true joy. We won’t stop until Gali, Ziv and all the hostages are home,' referring to Gali and Ziv Berman, who were abducted from Kfar Aza. Siegel was abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7 and was released quietly compared to the chaotic handover of hostages in previous days. He was briefly placed on a stage at the transfer site, where he waved while wearing a cap. Hamas handed him two plastic bags, with reports suggesting one contained belongings for his wife, Aviva. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a statement, the Siegel family expressed overwhelming gratitude. 'At this moment, our father sets foot on Israeli soil, and we are overwhelmed with indescribable emotion. After 484 long, terrifying days filled with immense worry, we can finally breathe. We thank the Israeli and U.S. governments for making this deal happen—one that prioritizes human life and Jewish and Israeli values.' The statement also called for continued efforts to bring back all remaining hostages. 'Our father was cruelly taken from his home, and today he returns. As citizens, it is our duty to ensure that every hostage is brought back—those still alive to their families and those murdered to be laid to rest on Israeli soil.' Ahead of his release, Aviva Siegel was visibly emotional as she prepared to reunite with her husband for the first time since her own release. 'The big day has arrived! I’m so happy, happier than I could ever be,' she told her daughter Shir in a video message. 'I’m ready with everything. I’m going!' Shir responded with excitement: 'See you with Dad!' The hostages’ reception center at Re’im saw another emotional reunion earlier in the day when Jordan Bibas and Ofer Calderon were also freed. Israel is set to release 183 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages under the fourth phase of the cease-fire deal. 'Words can’t describe the joy we feel' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Office welcomed the release of Siegel from Hamas captivity, saying, 'The Israeli government embraces the return of Keith Siegel. His family has been informed by the relevant authorities that he has joined our forces. The government, along with all security agencies, will continue to support him and his family.' Friends from Kibbutz Kfar Aza gathered to watch Siegel’s release. Mor Yitzhak (Pitsu), one of his longtime friends, recalled, 'We met at Ruhama’s clubhouse and watched Keith’s release together—it was incredibly emotional. Keith had pre-existing medical conditions, so Aviva was worried about whether he would survive without proper treatment. We’ve known Keith since he moved to the kibbutz—he’s a quiet, introverted person. We were closer to Aviva because our daughter used to work with her after school and admired her as a caregiver.' Yitzhak noted that Siegel appeared to be in relatively good condition. 'Keith has always been thin, and I didn’t notice anything unusual,' he said. 'He looked pale, unshaven and unkempt, which is unlike him—he was a salesman and always well-groomed. I was afraid I’d see him in worse shape. Words can’t describe the joy we feel. But for the Kfar Aza community, we’re still waiting for Gali and Ziv. Over 70 people remain in Hamas captivity, and every passing day makes their situation worse.' Hagai Horowitz, another resident of Kfar Aza, described the relief of seeing the helicopters arriving in the morning. 'So much happiness for the Siegel family. Keith is a dear man returning home. Now, our hearts are with Gali and Ziv—we must do everything to bring them back.' Two of Siegel’s friends, Hila Sagiv and Ora Lavi, prepared a welcome sign and waited for his arrival near Re’im. 'We’re here for Keith, so that even for a moment, he sees us and feels the warmth—that he knows we’ve been waiting for him,' they said. 'We imagine our first reunion and going back to our favorite restaurant. We know recovery will take time.' Ora added, 'When Aviva came back, I made signs and got ready, but I missed the moment. Today, I’ve been here since 8 a.m.—I won’t miss it this time.' Keith Siegel, 65, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza alongside his wife, Aviva. She was freed in November 2023 after 51 days in captivity. Following her release, Aviva recalled that during their time in captivity, when Hamas filmed them, Keith told her not to cry so their children would see her as strong. However, in April 2024, Hamas released a video showing Siegel alongside fellow hostage Omri Miran, visibly distressed and crying. His daughter Shir explained, 'I felt like this was his way of showing us how much he was struggling and asking us to get him out already.' On Friday, Shir posted an emotional video embracing her mother. 'Dad is on the list—he's coming home!' she exclaimed. Keith Siegel immigrated to Israel from the United States at the age of 21 and worked as an occupational therapist. In December 2024, while he was still held captive in Gaza, his mother passed away. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpkecsuyg	2025-02-01T08:10:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/By2zb3jdyl/By2zb3jdyl_0_0_1426_951_0_small.jpg

The fall of Assad: A predetermined outcome	Syrian rebels toppled Bashar Assad’s regime in just 11 days, seizing Damascus after years of internal dissent; expert Dr. Mordechai Kedar says Assad’s fall was inevitable due to his regime’s lack of legitimacy On November 27, 2024, the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect, and within mere days, the long-awaited rebellion in Syria exploded into action. In just 11 days, Syrian rebels seized the opportunity to overthrow Bashar Assad’s regime. By the time the dust settled, Syria was under the control of a coalition of rebels, Damascus was in their hands, and Assad had fled to Russia. The speed and intensity of the collapse of Syria has shocked the world, but for Lt. Col. (res.) Dr. Mordechai Kedar, a member of the 'Securityists' movement and a prominent expert on the Middle East, it was not unexpected. Dr. Kedar, whose writings on the legitimacy of the Assad regime date back decades, argues that the collapse of Syria was foreseeable. 'Syria is a hollow country,' Kedar states, as 'the people never believed in the regime, and the army was unwilling to die for it.' His 2005 book Asad in Search of Legitimacy chronicles the Baathist regime's fruitless efforts to establish itself as a legitimate governing force in Syria. In his view, the Assad family never earned the legitimacy of their people, ruling instead through force and repression. This lack of legitimacy, Dr. Kedar explains, can be traced back to 1966, when the minority Alawite regime took over Syria. To the Sunni Muslim majority, the Alawites were considered infidels. The Alawite rulers, recognizing the lack of public support for their regime, understood the necessity of establishing an iron-fisted dictatorship instead to secure their grip on power. The suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1980s, including the infamous Hama Massacre in 1982, solidified the Assad family’s reputation for merciless repression. However, Kedar argues that this strategy was always destined to fail. The regime’s foundation was inherently unstable because it never had popular support. The regime’s inevitable collapse of the regime was a consequence of this lack of legitimacy. Still, the speed at which the rebels took control was aided by more than just internal dissent. The timing was also crucial. The weakened state of the Assad regime, following Hezbollah’s war against Israel, had left it vulnerable. The opposition forces, many of whom had been exiled to Idlib for years, were then poised to strike the moment the regime’s attention wavered. Rebel groups, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, linked to Al-Qaeda), then launched a surprise offensive that quickly gained momentum. Their rapid victories in Aleppo, Hama, and Homs were followed by uprisings from Druze and Bedouin populations in the south, culminating in the fall of Damascus. Despite their ideological differences, the rebels managed to unite to overthrow Assad. Yet, not all rebel groups share the same agenda. Some moderate groups even express a willingness to work with Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One rebel leader even declared that the true victory would be when Israeli flags fly over the Iranian embassies in Damascus and Amman. This sentiment reveals an interesting dynamic in the rebellion: the desire to eliminate Iranian and Hezbollah influence in the region. However, while the fall of the Assad regime may seem like a victory for freedom and democracy, the future of Syria is uncertain. Syria remains a deeply divided country, with ethnic, religious, and tribal groups historically at odds. For this reason, if Syria falls into the hands of Islamist groups, it could disintegrate into chaos. However, such a scenario may be preferable to a unified Iran-backed Syria under Assad. Israel is preparing for any outcome following the regime collapse, including the rise of extremist groups. The IDF has concentrated forces in the strategically vital Golan Heights and strengthened its positions on the Syrian border in anticipation of potential fallout. The uncertainty surrounding Syria’s future has already prompted Israel to take preventative measures as Israel would prefer to deal with ISIS-style militias over the strategic threat posed by an Iran-backed regime. Israel cannot afford to be caught unprepared, as it was on October 7, 2023, when a surprise attack from Hezbollah put the country on high alert. While the outcome of the rebellion in Syria is yet to be determined, the fall of the Assad regime was almost inevitable. Syria's lack of national unity, its sectarian divisions, and the regime’s lack of legitimacy created a powder keg that only needed the right spark to ignite. What follows, however, remains unpredictable. Whether Syria will emerge as a modern, liberal state or a failed, fragmented one remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that the collapse of the Assad regime marks a turning point in Middle East security, with significant implications for the broader region.
