Saudi FM: Demand to build Pal. state inside Saudi Arabia is 'irre...	Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry condemned the 'irresponsible Israeli statements against Saudi Arabia,' which, according to them, 'demanded that it establish a Palestinian state on its territory.' It was further stated that 'this constitutes a violation of international law.' Israeli officials this week expressed support for President Trump's plan to relocate Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to countries in the region as part of its rehabilitation efforts.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1som64yyx	2025-02-08T02:45:15-08:00	
Blood on your hands!': Pro-Palestinians shout at Yoav Gallant in...	Visiting New York for the first time since being fired from his position as Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant ran into pro-Palestinian protesters who called for his arrest; 'War criminal! Why should he be able to walk the streets of New York?', they yelled Pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouted at former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in New York, accusing him of being a 'war criminal' who 'should be arrested.' Gallant, against whom, along with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, international arrest warrants have been issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, was filmed leaving a business in the city when several passersby began shouting at him as he made his way to his car. 'You have the blood of 61,000 Palestinians on your hands,' they shouted. 'Why should he be able to walk the streets of New York?' After a few minutes, Gallant entered his car accompanied by his security guards. Footage of the incident was published on the social media account of a local left-wing organization on the platform X (formerly Twitter). Alongside the footage, the organization wrote: 'War criminal Yoav Gallant confronted on the streets of New York by pro-Palestinians! The former Israeli Defense Minister, who has an arrest warrant for his war crimes against humanity issued by the ICC, will not live peacefully for a single day! People around the world stand with Palestine and against Israel's violent apartheid regime. We will continue to fight every day until the full liberation of the Palestinian people. There will be no rest for the wicked.'

While Gallant was inside the synagogue, one of the protest organizers said, 'Palestinians and our Jewish allies who oppose the war will continue to protest, disrupt, and demand the arrest of Gallant and anyone else who supports genocide, across the United States.' Other protesters chanted 'From the river to the sea,' while some submitted a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice's Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, demanding a criminal investigation be opened against the former Defense Minister. In his first interview since becoming Defense Minister, a position from which he was dismissed about three months ago, Gallant told Nadav Eyal that he is not afraid of the arrest warrants issued against him. 'I am proud to be accused of defending the State of Israel. When leaders and others from around the world came to me, I told them, ‘2023 is not 1943. Jews now have the ability to defend themselves independently, and I am responsible for that, and I will do it. That’s what I did, and I am proud of what I did,’' he emphasized. He acknowledged that mistakes may have been made during the war that led to 'heavy costs,' but he clarified: 'I think our mistakes are smaller than those of other armies. The results are always harsh, and I regret that. I also did not want to harm any Palestinian civilian. And I am not the only one. The Chief of Staff and others as well – we worked tirelessly to provide humanitarian aid wherever possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1k8sneykl	2025-02-08T02:36:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/16/Sy8yeA119h/Sy8yeA119h_0_0_1024_576_0_small.jpg

This is proof that the hostages have run out of time, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement after the harsh images were broadcast from Gaza.

Who are the terrorists set to be released in this stage of the de...	As part of the fifth phase of the deal, Israel will release 183 prisoners, including 18 serving life sentences; Among those freed are Hamas operatives convicted of terror attacks, including bombings in the southern city of Be’er Sheva and other deadly assaults As part of the fifth phase of Stage A of the deal, during which hostages Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy, and Eli Sharabi will be released, Israel will on Saturday release 183 prisoners, including 18 serving life sentences. Among them are 54 prisoners who have served long sentences and 111 detainees from Gaza who were arrested during the war. Among the prominent prisoners being released is Shadi Barghouti, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for his involvement in attacks against Israel. His father, Fakhri Barghouti, was a participant in the murder of Mordechai Yakuel, and his brother, Hadi Barghouti, was convicted in 2004 of terrorist activities and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Another prisoner being released is Ali Haroub, a resident of Dura, who has been serving a sentence for membership in a terror cell that planned attacks and for his involvement in the production of explosives and Molotov cocktails. In December 2013, Shin Bet, with the assistance of Israel Prison Service (IPS), thwarted an attempt to establish a kidnapping cell that Haroub was part of, under the guidance of prisoners in Israel. The attempted attack, which was in its early planning stages, was prevented. Senior Hamas figure Jamal Tawil, who was arrested in Ramallah in June 2021, will also be released. At the time of his arrest, IDF stated that Tawil was detained following a joint operation by the Duvdevan Unit and Shin Bet. It was noted that he was one of the key figures responsible for rebuilding Hamas’ infrastructure in the West Bank region. According to IDF, Tawil 'actively participated in organizing riots, incitement to violence, and the re-establishment of Hamas' headquarters in Ramallah.' Among those being released is Eyad Abu Shahidam, who was behind the double suicide bombing in the southern city of Be'er Sheva carried out by two Palestinian terrorists in 2004. The attack killed 16 Israelis and injured over 100. Abu Shahidam was convicted of preparing the explosives and planning the detonation of two bombs on buses near the city hall on Reger Street. He was also convicted of preparing an explosive belt for a terrorist who was intercepted in July 2004 on his way to detonate the bomb at 'Café Kafeit' in Jerusalem. The terrorist was armed with an explosive belt and a pistol and planned to first shoot the security guard before entering the café to carry out the attack. A few days earlier, Shin Bet, IDF, and the Gideonim Unit of the Jerusalem Police arrested several Hamas operatives from Hebron and nearby villages. These operatives admitted to facilitating the terrorist's entry into the capital to carry out the attack. According to their statements, the terrorist had second thoughts and returned. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another prominent released prisoner is Hatem al-Jayousi, one of the founders of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which continues to operate as a terror organization with dozens of members in the West Bank and Gaza. He is serving six life sentences for the murder of six Israelis during the Second Intifada. Also being released is Yosef al-Mabhouh from Jabaliya, who is serving 15 years in prison for launching rockets, planting explosives, and engaging in tunnel-related activities. In December 2021, while imprisoned in the Hamas wing of Nafha Prison, he carried out a stabbing attack within the prison. He attacked a prison guard with a sharp improvised weapon, causing minor injuries. Footage from the incident shows al-Mabhouh sneaking up behind the guard and assaulting him with the weapon. IPS has operationally prepared for the prisoner release process in accordance with the agreed deal after receiving the list of security prisoners scheduled for release. Once the necessary procedures are completed in the prisons, fighters from the Nachshon Unit, IPS's central escort unit, will transport the prisoners to central reception points at Ofer and Ktzi’ot prisons. Upon arrival, prisoners will be identified by representatives of the Red Cross and will wait until the hostages arrive in Israel. Once approval is granted by state authorities, the prisoners will be transported by the Red Cross from Ofer Prison to release points in the West Bank, and by Nachshon Unit fighters to the Kerem Shalom crossing. Earlier, it was revealed by Ynet that prior to their release, the prisoners will be shown footage of the extensive destruction in Gaza. IDF’s Operations Division, in collaboration with IPS, produced a video showcasing the significant destruction in Gaza, which will be shown to the Palestinian prisoners being released as part of the fifth phase of the deal. The video, approximately three minutes long, will be screened for the prisoners on television screens in the prisons during their release process. Last week, IPS printed the message 'The Eternal Nation Does Not Forget' on the identification bracelets of the prisoners, along with the IPS logo and the Israeli flag. Many of the security prisoners, particularly those serving life sentences, are unaware of the reality outside the prison walls. The video will reflect the new reality in Gaza for them. So far, 583 prisoners have been released as part of the deal. Prior to Saturday’s release, IPS’s prison population, which includes both security and criminal prisoners, actually increased by 298. As of now, there are 23,741 prisoners in Israeli prisons—10,197 of them are security prisoners, and 13,544 are criminal offenders. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjh7h5vkyg	2025-02-08T00:42:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/SJxQ2v00su1g/SJxQ2v00su1g_0_198_2457_1384_0_small.jpg

Israel to receive guided munitions and bombs in $7.4 billion US d...	The US has approved a $7.41 billion military deal with Israel, including Hellfire missiles, bombs, and guidance systems; Officials affirm the sale enhances Israel’s defense capabilities without disrupting regional balance or US military readiness The United States has approved a military sale to Israel, including guided munitions, bombs, and related equipment, with a total value of $7.41 billion. The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced on Friday that it had submitted the required authorization to Congress for the agreements, which are 'intended to preserve Israel's ability to defend itself.' This effectively confirms the move initiated by the administration of former President Joe Biden, who informed Congress of an $8 billion arms deal in January, shortly before Donald Trump assumed office. As part of these agreements, Israel will purchase, using American aid funds, 3,000 Hellfire missiles at an estimated cost of $660 million, along with 2,166 AGM-114 Hellfire bombs, also valued at approximately $660 million. Additionally, Israel will acquire 2,166 GBU-39 bombs, around 13,000 JDAM guidance kits for bombs of various weights, and 17,475 FMU-152A/B fuse bombs under a separate deal valued at $6.75 billion. The supply of Hellfire missiles is expected to begin in 2028, while the additional munitions will be delivered starting from 2025. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the Pentagon, the equipment will be sourced from existing U.S. stockpiles and from American companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and L3Harris. The official statement noted that 'the deal will not alter the regional balance of power and will assist Israel in defending its borders, critical infrastructure, and population.' The State Department stated that the agreements align with U.S. policy to maintain Israel's security and defensive capabilities. The report indicates Israel will be able to integrate the new equipment into its military system with ease and that the deals will not negatively impact U.S. military readiness. Weapons sales are subject to approval by the House and Senate committees, but they are typically approved swiftly when it comes to sales to Israel. According to estimates, the supply will be conducted gradually over the coming years, with initial deliveries starting in 2025. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met this week with evangelical leaders during his visit to Washington. During the meeting, Netanyahu addressed delays in the shipment of munitions during the Biden administration and, for the first time, explicitly acknowledged that this was a 'weapons embargo.' A statement from Netanyahu's office said that he 'thanked the evangelical leaders, who represent millions of believers, for their longstanding and consistent support of the State of Israel.' The meeting was attended by the incoming U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said: 'We have a responsibility to the Jewish people in Israel and worldwide. You will never stand alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqzak4y1g	2025-02-07T23:30:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/03/07/H1iOCRLaa/H1iOCRLaa_0_0_1000_633_0_small.jpg

Here’s why it’s legal for the U.S. to take over Gaza and relocate...	Human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky argues that those preventing Gazans from leaving are the ones truly violating international law U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to offer Gazans the opportunity to relocate while the U.S., alongside international partners, rebuilds Gaza is 'absolutely legal,' according to international human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky. Speaking to ILTV News, he said, 'Einstein's famous definition is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And for many, many years, including since October 7, the international community at large has had the same failing strategy with respect to Gaza that essentially allows Hamas to remain in power, and that we know is simply unacceptable.' Ostrovsky emphasized that this would not constitute forcible transfer, which is prohibited under international law. 'What President Trump has spoken about is the intention to create, essentially, a set of circumstances and conditions to allow Gazans to voluntarily choose to move to conditions that are better elsewhere,' Ostrovsky explained. He went a step further, arguing that those insisting Gazans must stay in Gaza—despite Hamas remaining in power—could be the ones violating international law. 'I would actually go one step further and suggest that those that are perhaps in fact guilty here of violating international law are the ones that are insisting that the Gazans stay there. Because by doing so, including whilst Hamas is still in power, they're essentially calling for the Gazans to stay in an active war zone and essentially be continued to be used as human shields by Hamas,' Ostrovsky said. Trump unveiled his plan earlier this week during a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Israelis have largely welcomed the proposal, the Arab world has outright rejected it. The plan would involve working with neighboring and moderate Arab states to take in Gazan refugees while the United States rebuilds Gaza, a process that could take upwards of a decade.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1u00yvvkyl	2025-02-07T20:24:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/r1lP4ecmFJl/r1lP4ecmFJl_1_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
From two points in central Gaza: How the fifth hostage handover w...	Eliyahu Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami are set to be released after 491 days in captivity on Saturday during the morning hours; IDF and Israeli hospitals making ready to receive captives, release prisoners The fifth hostage handover in the first phase of the deal between Israel and Hamas in which Eliyahu Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami are set to be released after 491 days in captivity, is expected to take place on Saturday. Like previous handovers, the three, who were kidnapped from the Nova music festival and Kibbutz Be'eri, will likely be released in the morning from two locations in central Gaza. Israeli officials are uncertain about the exact timing and whether the release will occur from one or two points. The IDF is preparing for an early morning operation. Unlike last week, when Hamas announced the names of those to be freed in the morning, this time, the terror group provided the list to mediators in the evening, again blaming Israel for delays in aid deliveries and cease-fire breaches. Before the names were released, Israel pressured mediators to secure the return of Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, whom Hamas claims were killed but has provided no proof. The father, Yarden, who was released in the previous handover, said: 'My light is still there, and as long as they are, everything is dark here.'

The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global nonproliferation agency, will meet Syrian officials in Damascus on Saturday, three sources familiar with the visit said.

IDF spokesperson in Arabic reveals terror group field commander Abbas Haidar was killed after a charge detonated in his home; Lebanon claims IDF negligence caused explosion IDF spokesperson in Arabic Col. Avichay Adraee announced Friday that Hezbollah field commander Abbas Haidar was killed along with his family when an explosive device accidentally detonated at his home in Tayr Harfa, near Tyre in southern Lebanon. Lebanese reports earlier in the day attributed the blast to 'leftover Israeli munitions.' 'I remind the Lebanese people that Hezbollah’s weapons are a double-edged sword, endangering Lebanon’s residents and even Hezbollah’s own surroundings. Stay away from Hezbollah’s weapons,' Adraee wrote on his X account. The initial Lebanese report did not name Haidar, saying only that 'a man and his three daughters were killed in an explosion at a home in Tayr Harfa, caused by leftover Israeli munitions.'

Ezzeddine added, 'This is part of the attacks yesterday and today in Lebanon.

Locals say they are determined to rebuild their own seafront restaurants and hotels, dismissing Trump's vision of creating a 'Riviera of the Middle East' Palestinians in Gaza say they are determined to rebuild their own seafront restaurants and hotels, dismissing U.S. President Donald Trump's vision of creating a 'Riviera of the Middle East' emptied of its population and under U.S. control. Before Israel's 15-month offensive left buildings across Gaza in ruins, the densely inhabited Palestinian territory had developed a local tourism scene on its Mediterranean shore. 'There is nothing that cannot be repaired,' said Gaza resident Assad Abu Haseira, pledging to start serving food from the restaurant he owns even before it is rebuilt. 'Trump says he wants to change the restaurants, and he wants to change Gaza and wants to create a new history for Gaza. We remain Arab and the history of Arabs will not be replaced with the history of foreigners.' Other Palestinians share his defiance. Mohammed Abu Haseira, another restaurant owner, said his eatery would become operational again 'and much better than before'. 'Trump has come up with a decision that he wants to establish restaurants, but the restaurants are here and the hotels are here. Why did you destroy them to establish other ones?' he said.

It triggered condemnation from around the world, with critics saying it would be tantamount to ethnic cleansing and illegal under international law. Gazans were also quick to denounce the scheme, vowing never to leave the ruins of their homes. For Palestinians, such talk recalls the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe' after the 1948 war around the creation of the state of Israel, when 700,000 fled or were forced from their homes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy5ozknt1l	2025-02-07T11:12:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/BJc8dhlF1g/BJc8dhlF1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Yarden Bibas, in first statement since release, asks the Israeli people to stay united and push for the return of all remaining captives including his family members whose fate remains uncertain Former hostage Yarden Bibas, released last Saturday along with Keith Siegel and Ofer Calderon after 484 days in captivity, issued his first statement Friday addressing his wife Shiri and their children, Ariel and Kfir, who remain in Gaza. 'Unfortunately, my family hasn’t returned to me. They’re still there. My light is still there, and as long as they are, everything is dark here.

In a statement released on his behalf by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Bibas wrote: 'On October 7, 2023, I was kidnapped from Israel.

We found Dad': Hostage Or Levy to return to orphaned 3-year-old ...	After being abducted from the Nova party where his wife was murdered, Levy is set to reunite with his son on Saturday for the first time in 491 days Hostage Or Levy, a 33-year-old from Givatayim, is set to be freed from captivity on Saturday in the hostage deal's fifth handover after 491 days in Gaza. Levy was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7, where his wife, Einav, was murdered. His mother, Geula, reacted emotionally to the news, saying, 'My heart is leaping from my chest. For a year and four months, the little one [their 3-year-old son, Almog] has been alone without his father and mother. Finally, Or is coming back to us — I can’t believe it.' Gaula added: 'Our military liaison officer updated us — she couldn’t even speak. She’s been with us since the first day. We’re one family. I don’t even know what to say, I’m so excited. I’m not sure if I’ll make it to [the reunion at] Re’im due to some physical limitations. 'I’m just thinking about the hug. How do I hug him after so long? This is a child I talk to every day. We told little Almog, and he screamed, ‘Dad is coming back!’ while he jumped on the bed.' Or and Einav met in high school, became close friends and later married, welcoming their first son, Almog.

He previously recounted: 'Or called our mom when the sirens started. She told him they were at the party. She said they were heading home, so I didn’t panic. 'Even when videos of terrorists on trucks surfaced, I thought they were fake. Around 8:30 a.m., Mom said she couldn’t reach Or. She was crying and I got angry — told her the lines were down and not to be stressed. Two hours later, my uncle called asking about Or. I sensed something was wrong and set up a war room at home.'

Hamas delays delivery of hostage list in fifth handover to late evening while accusing Israel of cease-fire violations and lack of aid in Strip Israel on Friday approved the hostage list provided by Hamas for the deal’s fifth handover expected on Saturday. The three hostages set to be released are Or Levy, 34, Eliyahu Sharabi, 53, and Ohad Ben Ami, 56. The terror group earlier announced it had delivered the list of hostages set to be released Saturday in the fifth hostage handover of the hostage deal's first phase to mediators. Israeli officials awaited the list of names, with an Israeli source saying that Israel 'will view harshly,' any violation of the agreement which included the delivery of hostages' names – though no specific actions were outlined in response. Even before the names were published, Israel pressed the mediators to prioritize – alongside the release of three male hostages – the return of Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir, whom Hamas claims are deceased without providing clear evidence.

IDF equips troops facing snow in Syria, Lebanon	Logistics Corps forces deliver weapons, warm food and winter gear to troops stationed across the Israeli border facing harsh weather Under constant threat, IDF Logistics Corps forces delivered weapons, food, fuel and other supplies to maneuvering troops beyond the border Thursday overnight in freezing snow. Despite harsh winter conditions, long convoys continue crossing the border to supply the necessary equipment. 'Winter readiness is an integral part of the IDF's operational preparedness,' said IDF Northern Command deputy logistics officer Lt. Col. Fares Nazem. 'We ensure that vehicles, equipment and logistical systems are adapted to extreme weather, providing immediate solutions as needed. Our goal is to enable continuous, safe and effective operations regardless of environmental conditions,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although the year’s winter has been dry, temperatures in the northern mountains remain frigid. In recent weeks, logistics forces have supplied over 885,000 winter items, including insulated sleeping bags, snow gear and cold-weather clothing, supplementing existing stock distributed throughout the past year of combat. More than 1,900 mobile shelters and containerized living quarters have been deployed at permanent and temporary IDF outposts in Syria and Lebanon. These are equipped with heating, air conditioning, electrical panels and fixed or mobile power infrastructure, ensuring adequate facilities for troops, including showers and heating. Ahead of the weekend, which will remain cold in high-altitude areas beyond the border, troops received hot, fresh meals delivered directly to combat zones. Soldiers stationed in observation posts, snow-covered ambush positions and weapons search operations in Syria and Lebanon will receive rations suited for winter conditions, while infantry units have been equipped with rapid-cooking meal kits. 'We work around the clock to ensure our forces operate under optimal conditions without critical shortages,' Nazem added. 'Even in harsh conditions and at night, we continue complex logistical operations because a strong logistics system is key to sustaining continuous combat. This war has proven that without robust logistics, troop endurance cannot be guaranteed.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1p6q2qfje	2025-02-07T07:52:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/r1aecOmY1x/r1aecOmY1x_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Why don't we know which hostages will be freed on Saturday?	It remains unclear which hostages will be released on Saturday, but Russia has been actively pressuring Hamas to release one of its citizens taken captive during the October 7 attacks. Hamas has stated that it plans to release Russian-Israeli citizen Alexander Sasha Trufanov 'in the near future,' specifically as part of the first phase of the ongoing ceasefire hostage deal. Trufanov is listed among the 33 hostages set to be released in this initial stage. Russia has maintained working relations with Hamas and has strengthened its ties with the group since the October 7 massacre. The 29-year-old Trufanov was kidnapped alongside three family members from Kibbutz Nir Oz, while his father was murdered that day. His relatives were freed in November 2023. In the same month, Palestinian Islamic Jihad published a propaganda video featuring Trufanov. So far, 18 hostages and five Thai nationals have been freed. Fifteen more hostages remain in captivity, including eight bodies that have yet to be recovered. U.S. Policy Could Impact Phase Two of Hostage Deal There are growing concerns that former U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent comments about the U.S. potentially taking control of Gaza could undermine phase two of the hostage deal. This next phase, which aims to secure the release of the remaining hostages— all men— was already expected to be a difficult transition. Officials now warn that these remarks could further complicate negotiations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1pyqcxf1g	2025-02-07T05:38:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/yk14251874/yk14251874_0_21_1201_677_0_small.jpg
Israeli Hamas victims will continue to work with ICC after US san...	Decision comes amid Trump's decision to sanction the UN court which is also investigating the terror group's October 7 attacks across Israel Israeli victims of the Hamas attack that triggered the Gaza war will still work with the International Criminal Court even after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the tribunal, a lawyer for victims and victims' families said on Friday. The sanctions are in retaliation for the court's issuing of arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense chief Yoav Gallant, who are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The ICC's prosecutor is also investigating the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks that killed 1,200 people. Prosecutors sought arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders for the crimes, but they were all killed in the past 16 months of war in Gaza, according to Israel and Hamas. While sanctions will complicate dealings with the ICC, the Israeli families want to continue engaging with it as part of efforts to seek justice, said Yael Vias Gvirsman, a lawyer who represents over 350 victims and families of victims. 'Sanctions could complicate the communications channels between Israeli citizens and the court, but victims are ever more committed to have direct contact with the court and to pursue the justice they deserve,' Gvirsman said in an interview. The U.S. sanctions, which focus on punishing the court for investigating Israeli officials, can also affect the prosecution's probe into crimes committed by Hamas, says Vias Gvirsman. 'It will be a dilemma for the court how to engage with Israeli citizens and assess if contact with the court endangers them,' she said.

Trump's Groundhog Day? Same speech, 8 years later	US President Trump has promised a bold new vision for the Middle East, but his press conference with the Israeli prime minister bore striking similarities to the same event eight years earlier Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood side by side at the White House, addressing reporters in a highly anticipated press conference. Their speeches touched on security, diplomacy, and the future of U.S.-Israel relations—echoing a similar scene from 2017, during President Trump’s first term. At first glance, the two press conferences, held eight years apart, might seem worlds away. The Middle East has undergone seismic shifts, most notably with the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Yet despite these dramatic changes, striking similarities emerged between the speeches given then and now. An analysis of both transcripts reveals that key themes—Israeli resilience, the need for peace with the Palestinians, and U.S. support for Israel—remained essentially unchanged. While some see this consistency as a sign of enduring commitment, others argue that it underscores a deeper problem: the status quo is stuck. Analysts warn that without a shift in strategy, which is what Trump is recommending, we may hear the same speeches in another eight years—offering the same promises and addressing the same conflicts but failing to break the cycle. Israel has long been a bipartisan issue in the U.S., with strong support for the country from both Democrats and Republicans. President Trump took office in 2017, following President Barack Obama, whose relationship with Netanyahu has often been described as strained. In his speech that May, Trump emphasized the 'unbreakable bond' between the U.S. and Israel, praising the Jewish state as a 'symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression.' Netanyahu, in turn, stressed the need to 'dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field.' He also reminded the new president that while Israel has no better ally than America, 'I want to assure you, the United States has no better ally than Israel.' President Trump’s strong stance on Israel has been key in attracting Jewish support. 'The more Jews in America care about Israel, the closer it brings them to Trump,' political media consultant Steve Rabinowitz told The Media Line. Eight years after 2017, the same themes are being repeated once again. This time, Trump came into office replacing President Joe Biden, whose administration has been accused of harming Israel’s war efforts by withholding weapons and ammunition and of prioritizing humanitarian aid to Gaza—even when it risks falling into Hamas’ hands—over ensuring the defeat of the terror group. Following October 7, 2023, tensions flared between Israel and the U.S. In February 2025, for example, President Joe Biden told reporters that Israel’s actions in Gaza were 'over the top,' signaling a rift. On Tuesday, President Trump sought to reaffirm the relationship again, telling the world that 'the bonds of friendship and affection' between the U.S. and Israel are 'absolutely unbreakable.' So, which other issues remain on the table—or have resurfaced—from 2017? Iranian nuclear threat President Trump first took office shortly after the Obama administration signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known as 'the Iran deal,' aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program. Netanyahu vehemently opposed that deal, urging the U.S. not to sign it. When Trump entered the White House, he immediately reimposed sanctions on Iran, calling the agreement 'one of the worst' he had ever seen in his 2017 speech. For nearly four years, President Trump’s policies financially squeezed Iran. But when President Biden took office, he lifted many of those sanctions. Over four years, the Biden administration enriched Iran by more than $50 billion. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Now, President Trump has vowed to reverse course once again. 'I also took action to restore a maximum pressure policy on the Iranian regime, and we will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions, drive Iranian oil exports to zero, and diminish the regime’s capacity to fund terror throughout the region and throughout the world,' Trump said. With the situation now more volatile than ever, sanctions alone may not be enough. Some experts warn that military action could become necessary. While President Trump has signaled that the U.S. is unlikely to take direct military action, his administration has signed agreements for weapons purchases that could give Israel the firepower to act if needed. If such an attack occurs, one thing is clear—it would only happen in full coordination with the United States. United Nations vs. Israel In December 2016, just weeks before Trump took office, the UN Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and calling for all Israeli settlement construction to stop. It also pushed for stricter labeling of products made in Israel versus those produced in settlements. The Obama administration, in a parting move, chose not to veto the resolution—an act many saw as a final rebuke to Israel. Six months later, President Trump made his stance clear. 'I reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations—just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly—or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel,' he said. Today, the situation is no different. Now, after more than 15 anti-Israel resolutions passed at the UN in 2024, President Trump faces the same challenges. On Tuesday, he announced his response: 'The United States withdrew from the antisemitic UN Human Rights Council and ended all support for the UN Relief and Works Agency, which funneled money to Hamas and was very disloyal to humanity.' U.S. military aid to Israel When Trump took office in 2017, he declared that U.S. security assistance to Israel was at 'an all-time high.' This came after the U.S. finalized a $38 billion military aid package in September 2016—the largest of its kind under the Obama administration. But after 16 months of war, Israel’s needs have only grown. In August 2024, the U.S. State Department confirmed that an additional $3.5 billion had been sent to Israel for American-made weapons and military equipment. This announcement, however, was followed by delays and what many criticized as a 'de facto arms embargo' on Israel. Now, just days into his return to office, President Trump has taken action. He lifted the previous administration’s embargo on over $1 billion in military aid, signaling a renewed commitment to Israel’s defense. West Bank annexation The fate of settlements in the West Bank, also known as Judea and Samaria, has been a challenge for every U.S. administration since 1967. That year, Israel won the territory in the Six-Day War. Israel annexed East Jerusalem and imposed control over the rest of the West Bank without formally annexing the area. Since 1967, Israel has maintained a military presence and established civilian settlements in the West Bank while managing aspects of security and administration. Under Obama, Israel agreed to a partial West Bank settlement freeze in 2009 and 2010, though construction continued to expand during his presidency. In his official remarks in 2017 and 2025, President Trump avoided the topic of settlements. However, when asked by a reporter about the topic in 2017, he responded, 'We’ll work something out. I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made. I know that every president would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasn’t possible because they didn’t do it.' Normalization agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in 2020 temporarily halted Israel’s annexation plans. As part of the agreements, known as the Abraham Accords, Israel agreed to delay annexation efforts, despite pressure from Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. Now, annexation may be back on the table. Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, has hinted at this possibility. While he acknowledged that he was not in charge of policy, he stated that the West Bank annexation was 'of course' a possibility during Trump’s second term. When pressed on Tuesday, Trump refused to confirm whether he supported a two-state solution, a one-state solution, or any other framework. Instead, he stated that his priority is to 'give people a chance at life.' He added that his administration has yet to take a position on annexation but promised an announcement within the next month. Trump’s peace vision When Trump first took office, he believed he could bring peace to the Middle East—and he still does. In 2017, he declared, 'The United States will encourage peace and, really, a great peace deal. We’ll be working on it very, very diligently. Very important to me also—something we want to do.' The Abraham Accords were signed three years later, normalizing ties between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain. Morocco and Sudan later joined the agreement. Now, peace with Saudi Arabia is within reach, and Trump is determined to make it happen. Saudi leaders have insisted that a pathway to a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for any deal. But analysts say there may be flexibility in how that 'pathway' is defined. Israel, for its part, has formally ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state. Over the past year, the Knesset passed two laws reinforcing this stance. Still, there is speculation that Israel’s position could shift—depending on who governs a potential Palestinian state and how much involvement the U.S. and moderate Arab nations have in its establishment. On Tuesday, Trump highlighted his record on Middle East diplomacy. 'We achieved the most significant Middle East peace agreements in half a century,' he said. 'But the Abraham Accords in particular, and I really believe that many countries will soon be joining this amazing peace and economic development transaction. It really is a big economic development transaction. I think we’re going to have a lot of people signing up very quickly.' He added, 'We will restore calm and stability to the region and expand prosperity, opportunity, and hope to our nations and for all people in the Middle East, including the Arab and Muslim nations.' Former Jewish Telegraphic Agency Washington bureau chief Ron Kampeas told The Media Line that Trump has remained committed to his 'grand vision' for the Middle East and is now 'trying to get it back on track.' However, he pointed to a key difference between 2017 and 2025: the absence of the Palestinians from the conversation. 'In 2017, he still envisioned a Palestinian state,' Kampeas said. 'Now it seems this is off the agenda completely, and he is even talking about encouraging Palestinians in Gaza to leave. He has dismantled any kind of Palestinian sovereignty.' Despite this shift, those in Netanyahu’s camp see hope in Trump’s approach. On Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister praised Trump’s leadership, saying, 'Your willingness to puncture conventional thinking—thinking that has failed time and time again—your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas will help us achieve all these goals.' Trump cannot run for another term after this one. By 2029, the results of his Middle East vision will be clear. Will Netanyahu be proven right—or will history repeat itself?

Hamas fails to deliver names of hostages to be freed	Israeli officials warn that if Hamas does not deliver the names to mediators, it would be perceived as a grave violation of the cease-fire agreement Hamas has thus far failed to deliver a list of the names of the hostages that are to be released on Saturday, according to the cease-fire agreement. An Israeli official warned that if Hamas does not transfer the names to the mediators, it would be considered a grave violation of the agreement but did not specify what steps may be taken. Israel has pressured the mediators to urge Hamas to release Shiri Bibas and her two little boys in addition to the three men that are expected to be freed, according to the deal. The mother and her baby sons were abducted during the Hamas massacre and the terror group claimed that they were killed in November 2023, although no evidence was provided. In Israel, concern for their safety grew after the IDF said they too have been increasingly concerned. Women and children who were taken captive by the terrorists, were to be released earliest in the first phase of the deal. Meanwhile an Israeli delegation was expected to leave for Qatar over the weekend, for low level talks on the continued implementation of the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Negotiations on the second phase were to begin last week but according to the Prime Minister's Office, they began in Washington, with American officials and not in Doha with the other mediating countries. After U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan to relocate Gaza's Palestinian residents to neighboring countries while the Strip was being rebuilt, Hamas strongly rejected the idea, prompting concerns among some officials that the next hostage release could be delayed at least – in response and as the vast obstacles that could emerge from the Trump plan, become evident ahead of any negotiations for the second phase that would include the release of all live hostages,a withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza and an end to the war.

US has set 'red line' that Hezbollah not join Lebanese govt, envo...	Deputy envoy on first visit by an official of the Trump administration says the United States would not be able to recognize the government in Beirut if the Shi'ite group joins, while parliament speaker Berri, a Hezbollah allie insists on their participation The United States has set a 'red line' that Shi'ite terror group Hezbollah should not be a member of Lebanon's next government after its military defeat by Israel last year, U.S deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus said in Lebanon on Friday. Ortagus is the first senior U.S. official to visit Lebanon since U.S. President Donald Trump took office and since Joseph Aoun was elected president in Lebanon. Her visit comes amid a stalled cabinet formation process in Lebanon, where government posts are apportioned on sectarian lines. Hezbollah's ally Amal has insisted on approving all Shi'ite Muslim ministers, keeping the process in deadlock. Speaking to reporters after meeting President Aoun, Ortagus said she was 'not afraid' of Iran-backed Hezbollah 'because they've been defeated militarily,' referring to last year's war between the group and Israel. 'And we have set clear red lines from the United States that they won't be able to terrorize the Lebanese people, and that includes by being a part of the government,' she said. Ortagus had been widely expected to deliver a tough message to Lebanese officials about Hezbollah, which was battered by months of Israeli air strikes and ground operations in southern Lebanon last year. Fighting ended in late November with a ceasefire brokered by the United States and France that set a deadline of 60 days for Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon, Hezbollah to pull out its fighters and arms and Lebanese troops to deploy to the area. That deadline was extended to Feb. 18. Ortagus referred to the new date on Friday but did not explicitly say the Israeli army (IDF) would withdraw from Lebanese territory. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'February 18 will be the date for redeployment, when the IDF troops will finish their redeployment, and of course, the (Lebanese) troops will come in behind them, so we are very committed to that firm date,' she said.

Armed terrorist in show of force in Marwan Issa funeral	The senior member of Hamas was killed in an airstrike last year with Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif; Funeral attended by mass crowds in the El Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza Armed Hamas terrorists participated on Friday in a funeral service for Marwan Issa, a senior member of the Hamas military wing, that was held in the El Bureij refugee camp in the center of the Strip. A massive crowd of Gazans attended the event. Issa was killed in an airstrike on Gaza last march along with the head of the Hamas military wing Mohammed Deif. The funeral was a show of force by Hamas ahead of another release of hostages scheduled for Saturday and after U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan to remove and relocate Palestinians from Gaza while it is rebuilt, an idea that was widely rejected by Palestinians and Arabs across the Middle East. Issa who was the third among Hamas leaders and considered a deputy of Deif was the victim of one of Israel's most significant achievements during the war, eliminating Deif who was the mastermind of the Hamas massacre and had evaded assassination by Israel, over years. The IDF said that the senior terrorist who was 59 when he was killed, was among the terror group's founders, an architect of the military operations of Hamas and involved in the planning of the October massacre. He was also complicit in the planning and executing of the abduction of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, who was held as a hostage in Gaza until 2011 when he was released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including Yahya Sinwar who soon became the Hamas leader. Issa who had been jailed for his terror activity in the past, was among the Hamas members most wanted by Israel. He, like Dief escaped previous assassination attempts, including when his home was bombed in 2021, killing his brother. His face was unfamiliar to the public before 2011, when he was photographed during a reception for the prisoners released in the Shalit deal. He played a central role in the development of military systems in Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades and became a wanted figure in Israel. His name featured prominently among the most wanted in Hamas and was targeted by Israel in 2006 during a meeting he held with Deif and other leaders, as well as in 2014 and 2021 when his house was bombed and his brother killed. His face was not publicly known before 2011, and he was photographed during the reception of prisoners released in the Gilad Shalit deal. Unlike many Hamas leaders, Issa remained in the Gaza Strip. His son was killed in an airstrike in December, and his oldest son died about a year ago due to illness; at that time Issa failed to get him out of the Gaza Strip for medical treatment. Issa was one of the planners of the Hamas attack on October 7, and his elimination is a severe blow for Hamas.'He was a multifaceted figure who simultaneously held three roles. He was the 'Defense Minister' of Hamas, a member of the Hamas government; additionally, he was the 'Deputy Chief of Staff,' serving as the deputy head of the military wing. Perhaps most importantly, he was the strategic mind of Hamas,' Managing Director of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) and former head of the Military Intelligence Maj. Gen. (Res.) Tamir Hayman said. Under the guise of his role as 'labor minister,' he played a central role in the Hamas movement, in a broader sense than just the military aspect. Beyond that, he was a close confidant of (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar. He was his balance and managed to largely control Sinwar's psychological volatility. As a very close friend of Deif, he was the one who connected Sinwar to Deif. So, yes, the public may not know him, but sometimes the connecting factor is almost as important as the leader himself.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjg0x007y1l	2025-02-07T03:29:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/BJ115QnwXt1e/BJ115QnwXt1e_0_112_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Ribhi Karajah sentenced to jail for involvment in the murder of Rina Shnerb in a 2019 West Bank attack is invited by pro-Palestinian group to speak about detention and torture by Israel Students at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. will host a convicted terrorist involved in the murder of 16-year-old Rina Shnerb in an attack in the West bank in 2019, and the wounding of her father and brother. Ribhi Karajah, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) who was sentenced to three years in prison after the terror attack, is to be a guest of the university’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter to speak about 'arrest, detention, and torture in the Israeli military system.' Dinner would be provided said the invitation posted on Instagram. Karajah pleaded guilty to knowing in advance about the attack on Shnerb and her family and failing to stop it. According to the indictment he was told by his friend, also a member of the PFLP that they planned to carry out a terror attack including a photograph of the location, a natural spring often visited by settlers. Students for Justice in Palestine has been behind many of the anti-Israel protests on American university campuses and has even been barred from some for antisemitism. Jewish and Israeli students at Georgetown complained to the school administration claiming that a visit by a convicted terrorist was putting their own safety at risk.

Inside the IDF’s strategy to avert a West Bank disaster	Military assigns Home Front Command units to protect border communities and prevent October 7-style attack; officials criticize government roadblocks, warning heavy traffic fueling Palestinian unrest more than Trump’s remarks The Shin Bet announced Thursday that it had recently arrested a Hamas and Fatah terror cell from Ramallah that was planning to carry out a bombing attack on a bus in Jerusalem. According to the investigation, the cell intended to remotely detonate an explosive device smuggled into Israel as part of the attack. The plot was reportedly motivated by a desire for revenge over the ongoing war in Gaza. While Israeli security forces have thwarted nearly 1,000 terrorist plots over the past year, senior military officials are increasingly concerned about the security situation in the West Bank. Some officials describe the threat level there as even greater than in Gaza, fearing a potential large-scale attack similar to the events of October 7, 2023, targeting Israeli settlements and communities near the security barrier. In response to these concerns, the IDF has established a special command to address potential threats in the West Bank. The newly designated force, which includes multiple reserve brigades from the Home Front Command, will be tasked with defending border communities stretching from the northernmost tip of the West Bank, through the Sharon area and down to Hebron. The brigades, formed in the wake of lessons learned from May 2021’s Operation Guardian of the Walls, are trained to secure key transportation routes, similar to those blocked by Israeli Arab rioters during previous unrest. Additionally, a specialized reserve mobilization unit will be responsible for swiftly deploying forces to security breaches along the border fence. Last month, reserve soldiers from the elite Duvdevan Unit thwarted a Hamas-inspired infiltration attack just three kilometers from Highway 6, an event that could have had significant consequences. Meanwhile, the IDF’s Central Command has conducted complex large-scale drills simulating extreme attack scenarios, including the defense of border communities, challenges in intelligence gathering and aerial response coordination. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Nearly three million Palestinians live in the West Bank, many in close proximity to more than half a million Israelis. For years, Iran and its proxies—particularly Hamas—have sought to establish a stronger foothold in the area. From Hamas’ perspective, Gaza has already served its purpose by carrying out the deadliest terror attack in Israel’s history and is now embroiled in a prolonged war. Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq have rallied in support of Gaza, and some within Hamas are questioning why West Bank Palestinians have not followed suit. In recent months, Israeli security agencies have observed a surge in terrorist activity, the use of advanced weaponry and the emergence of new local terrorist cells in Tulkarm, Jenin and Tubas. In response, Israeli forces have launched a nearly unprecedented counterterror operation in the northern West Bank, focusing on Jenin, Tulkarm and the surrounding villages. The head of the IDF’s Menashe Brigade has led efforts to separate the Jenin refugee camp from the city itself, working alongside Shin Bet officers and Civil Administration officials to dismantle terror infrastructure. Some of these operations have intercepted imminent threats moments before attacks on civilians and security forces. While the Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps remain terrorist strongholds, their adjacent cities have largely resumed normal life, with trade and education continuing despite ongoing military activity nearby. Meanwhile, restrictions imposed on Palestinian movement in the West Bank have sparked growing unrest. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds the portfolio of a minister in the Defense Ministry, pushed for roadblocks, which were approved by the government and security officials, but military leaders have questioned their effectiveness. Some IDF officials argue that the deployment of combat forces to maintain checkpoints diverts resources from offensive operations, straining an already stretched military force. Recent intelligence suggests that Palestinian frustration is mounting—not over Trump’s proposal to relocate Gazans to a third country or his vague remarks on potential annexation, but over the daily traffic congestion caused by roadblocks, which have led to hours-long delays. While the IDF and Shin Bet remain focused on preventing terror attacks and safeguarding Israeli citizens on both sides of the Green Line, officials warn that political decisions that disrupt daily life could further destabilize the region. In response to the developments, the IDF said: 'The IDF is working to strengthen readiness for various scenarios across all sectors. We do not comment on operational preparations.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wigb7yje	2025-02-06T23:28:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/Hker9v4ztyg/Hker9v4ztyg_0_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg

Rights groups have condemned Trump's suggestion that Palestinians in Gaza should be permanently displaced as part of a U.S. takeover of the enclave. Rubio said on Wednesday that Palestinians in the enclave will have to relocate in the 'interim' while it is rebuilt following the Israel-Gaza war. The U.S. official said Rubio would discuss Gaza and the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas on Israel during the trip, and would pursue Trump's approach of trying to disrupt the status quo in the region. 'The status quo can't continue. It's like wash, rinse and repeat. It becomes familiar and you begin to think this is just what life is and what we have to expect. President Trump and Marco Rubio believe that that's not the case, that things can change,' the official said. Since Jan. 25, Trump has repeatedly suggested that Palestinians in Gaza should be taken in by regional Arab nations such as Egypt and Jordan, an idea rejected by Arab states and by Palestinians. Trump's suggestion echoed long-standing Palestinian fears of being permanently driven from their homes.

Israeli airstrikes hit Hezbollah-linked sites in deep Lebanon	Attacks target weapons storage and newly established outposts. including in Bekaa; Lebanese social media circulates unverified footage claiming to show assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last September Israeli airstrikes targeted multiple Hezbollah-linked sites deep inside Lebanon on Thursday night, including the eastern city of Baalbek, as part of ongoing efforts to disrupt weapons transfers from Syria and terrorist entrenchment in the country, the IDF reported. An Israeli official confirmed the strikes, which reportedly hit weapons storage facilities and newly established Hezbollah outposts. This marks the second deep strike inside Lebanon within a week, following similar attacks in the Bekaa Valley targeting underground infrastructure used for arms production and smuggling routes. The airstrikes come amid an extended cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, brokered in late November and renewed last week until February 18.

When Israel moved 10,000 Gazans to Sinai—and terror attacks plumm...	In 1971, Israel relocated over 10,000 Gazans to northern Sinai under Ariel Sharon to curb terror attacks, which dropped sharply afterward; while some evacuees reported better housing, others struggled to adapt, and UNRWA protested the move as forced displacement In the summer of 1971, amid a surge in terror attacks in Gaza, Israel relocated more than 10,000 residents from the Jabaliya and Al-Shati refugee camps to northern Sinai. The move, carried out under the command of then-IDF Southern Command chief Ariel Sharon, was aimed at curbing terrorism. The number of attacks in Gaza fell from 445 in 1971 to just a few dozen the following year and remained low until the outbreak of the First Intifada in 1987. The relocation followed a series of deadly attacks, including the murder of Mark, 7, and Abigail, 5, Aroyo who were murdered when terrorists threw a grenade into their family’s car near Gaza City. Their parents were injured. In response, Sharon launched an extensive counterterrorism operation, with support from Meir Dagan, then commander of an IDF counterterror force. In July 1971, IDF forces entered the northern Gaza refugee camps, relocating about 10,500 residents to El-Arish in northern Sinai, with a few sent to the West Bank. Reports suggested the actual numbers were higher. At the time, Sinai was under Israeli control. According to Ynet's sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, some residents fled rather than accept housing in El-Arish, leaving behind their belongings. UNRWA employees protested the move and launched a strike. However, other reports indicated that many of those relocated were satisfied with their new homes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Then-defense minister Moshe Dayan visited El-Arish in late July, where, according to a published report, evacuees 'expressed satisfaction with the housing provided and the treatment they received from the military administration.' Some also said that they were able to continue working. The military administration offered jobs to those in need and attempted to help them resume their previous employment. The IDF supplied food and expressed hope that UNRWA would step in to assist. Meanwhile, Dayan visited Jabaliya, where homes had been demolished to clear space for a planned security road. Israeli officials noted that there were no security incidents in the ten days following the relocations. However, evacuees voiced complaints about unfair housing distribution, with smaller families receiving larger apartments than larger ones. Many also lamented being separated from relatives and struggling to integrate into El-Arish. Others reported water shortages in upper floors and difficulties adjusting to apartment living. Months later, journalist Tzvia Cohen visited El-Arish. Her report said that evacuees had been given three options — relocation to the West Bank, another area in Gaza or El-Arish. Compensation was provided for lost property. 'Every tree in the yard was included in the compensation,' said Lt. Col. Shmuel Liran, then-IDF spokesman for Gaza and northern Sinai. Mohammed Mustafa, a former photographer from Gaza, noted that his profession was not in demand in El-Arish, forcing him to seek work in Israel. 'I now earn 17 liras a day working in a dairy, compared to 5–6 liras before,' he said, adding that despite an improved standard of living, he still struggled to afford food and clothing. One woman brought her two sick children to a clinic where treatment was free. The local medical team included 6–8 nurses, a lab technician, an administrator and a technician, while Israeli doctors worked in rotations. Another evacuee, Wataha Hassan, lived in a two-room apartment with a balcony, kitchen and toilet. One room was empty except for a kerosene lamp and a light bulb. The other had mattresses stacked against the wall, a colorful tapestry, a family photo and a desk with books and notebooks. 'We have no stove or refrigerator,' one woman said. 'Or a washing machine,' added 12-year-old Fatma, who did not recognize the camera held by photographer Micha Bar-Am. When the journalist asked about their black headscarves, the women responded in unison: 'We wear black to mourn Palestine. When we win, we’ll wear white.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk4oo9gk1e	2025-02-06T13:10:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/rJmvH11fFyx/rJmvH11fFyx_50_215_654_369_0_small.jpg

Pam Bondi launches Joint Task Force October 7 (JTF 10-7) to prosecute Hamas operatives, disrupt terror financing and combat antisemitic crimes in US; task force will work with FBI, Treasury and Israel to pursue criminal charges, extraditions and sanctions U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi launched Joint Task Force October 7 (JTF 10-7) on Thursday to seek justice for victims of the October 7 Hamas attack in Israel, disrupt Hamas-linked financial networks and address rising antisemitic crimes in the United States. According to a Justice Department memorandum released Thursday, JTF 10-7 will pursue criminal charges, including capital crimes, against those responsible for the attack, assist victims and hostage families, investigate U.S.-based Hamas supporters and funders and collaborate with federal agencies and Israel to counter the terror group. The October 7, 2023, attack—which saw Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups launch a coordinated assault on southern Israel—resulted in approximately 1,200 deaths, including 47 U.S. citizens, and the abduction of more than 200 hostages, among them eight Americans. As part of its mission, JTF 10-7 will support Israeli efforts to hold Hamas accountable and seek the arrest and extradition of Hamas leaders, including those named in United States v.

Iran mulls policy shift as Trump sanctions stifle economy	With local currency plummeting on black market and growing public distrust, Iranians hoard $70 billion worth of gold and foreign reserves as inflation soars as Trump's 'maximum pressure' policy back in force U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a return to a 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran's economy via sanctions is taking a toll on Tehran’s markets. The Iranian rial hit an all-time low on the black market, trading at 858,000 rials per U.S. dollar. On Tuesday, shortly before meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump signed an executive order reimposing sanctions on Iran, particularly targeting its leading source of foreign reserves — oil exports. The Iranian government's official exchange rate doesn't reflect the real market value. The demand for U.S. dollars, seen in Iran as a safe haven, has surged since Trump was re-elected in early November, causing the rial to lose 25% against the dollar. Since his return to the White House last month, the rial has lost another 5.5%. Over the past year, which saw the Islamic Republic exchanging direct blows with Israel, setbacks in the Middle East (including the toppling of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria and Hezbollah's heavy losses in its war against Israel) and Trump's return, the rial has lost 55% of its value. The currency's collapse is fueling inflation. Iran does not regularly publish updated inflation figures, but its last reported rate stood at 40% — a number widely disputed by independent economists and the public amid frequent price hikes for food and other essentials. With expectations that the rial will continue to weaken under Trump's pressure campaign, inflation is expected to rise further. The currency's rapid depreciation is eroding Iranians' purchasing power, even among the middle class, increasing frustration over the regime's economic mismanagement. Corruption, negligence and the government's misplaced priorities have led many Iranians to lose faith in state institutions, particularly the banking system. Instead, they seek to safeguard their assets outside official financial channels. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghaddam, a member of Iran’s Expediency Discernment Council, claimed earlier this week that Iranians have hoarded $70 billion in gold and foreign reserves outside the economy. 'The state is seeking $5 billion in loans from international bodies, while $70 billion remains outside the economic system in private hands,' he said at a financial conference in Tehran. Iran's dilemma: negotiation or nuclear escalation? Tehran's leadership was already debating its response to the U.S. before Trump signed the latest sanctions order. Officials close to President Masoud Pezeshkian, considered a pragmatist, have expressed willingness to negotiate with the U.S. to avoid severe economic fallout. They argue that an agreement and sanctions relief are essential to rebuilding Iran’s economy. The country’s powerful ruling ultraconservative faction, however, sees the increased U.S. pressure as a reason to accelerate Iran's nuclear program as a deterrent. The final decision—whether to pursue negotiations or escalate nuclear activities—rests with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwdktmf1l	2025-02-06T10:49:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2014/11/30/5728297/5728297_0_16_1800_1013_0_small.jpg
Katz weighs allowing Gazans to leave via Israel amid Trump plan	Defense minister, in talks with top security officials, including IDF chief Herzi Halevi and successor Eyal Zamir, discusses allowing Gazans to leave via Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport—pending voluntary requests and strict security checks Defense Minister Israel Katz held high-level security talks Thursday on the feasibility of allowing Gaza residents to emigrate via Israel, through Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport, amid growing international scrutiny over the issue, officials said. The meeting, attended by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Defense Ministry Director-General and incoming IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, focused on voluntary emigration options for Gazans. Katz had earlier instructed the military to draft a plan facilitating departures by land, sea and air. While Israel has yet to formally adopt any such policy, Katz praised U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal for large-scale emigration from Gaza, saying it could offer 'thousands of Gazans a chance to relocate worldwide.' He accused Hamas of using residents as human shields, exploiting humanitarian aid and holding them hostage to its rule, asserting that 'every Gazan who wishes to leave should be able to.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, Katz’s remarks drew sharp condemnation from Egypt, which warned of 'catastrophic consequences' and accused Israel of violating international law and humanitarian norms. Cairo said the proposal could undermine cease-fire negotiations and destabilize the region. Katz also claimed that European nations critical of Israel’s military actions—such as Spain, Ireland and Norway—were obligated to accept Gazan migrants but said their 'hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse.' He suggested that countries like Canada, which has formal immigration programs, had previously shown willingness to take in Gazans and should now facilitate their relocation. Despite the controversy, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) is expected to oversee aspects of the plan, though the military is currently leading its initial formulation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1u2jfzy1x	2025-02-06T10:28:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/rJIqODfKke/rJIqODfKke_0_105_1280_721_0_small.jpg

October 6 mindset': New West Bank resorts near Israeli border wo...	Security officials warn construction near security barrier poses significant risk; activists call for stricter enforcement to prevent violations reminiscent of those that preceded the October 7 attack Three large Palestinian resort complexes, featuring pools and high-end guest rooms, have been built in recent years in the West Bank's Area C—under full Israeli control—raising concerns among local Jewish residents. The resorts are located on the outskirts of the Palestinian village of Al-Mudawwar near the West Bank barrier and close to several Israeli towns in the area. Security officials described the construction as a security threat. 'This is illegal construction very close to the border,' they said. 'Violations that led to the October 6 mindset in Israel must not be repeated. Illegal structures must be demolished, especially in Area C near the border.' The resorts are owned by Abdallah Odeh from Qalqilya and have gained popularity on social media, with thousands of followers on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Videos promoting the resorts to Palestinian visitors are widely shared. Pro-settler Israeli NGO Regavim sent an urgent letter to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, IDF Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox, and IDF Civil Administration head Brig. Gen. Hisham Ibrahim, demanding enforcement action. 'This illegal complex is yet another example of lawlessness. The offenders show no fear of legal consequences — not only do they operate the illegal resort, but they openly advertise it on social media,' the letter said. The security threat along the border is a major concern for nearby Jewish and Palestinian residents, fearing scenarios similar to the October 7 attack. According to Regavim, which monitors Palestinian construction inside and outside the Green Line, at least 19,000 illegal structures have been built within a kilometer of the border fence in recent years, despite much of the area being designated as military zones or state land. Shomron Regional Council head Yossi Dagan warned, 'This isn’t just a blatant legal violation — it’s a severe security risk that Israel cannot afford to ignore. We've been warning for years that illegal Palestinian construction in Area C, especially near the barrier, is not just about governance — it’s a direct threat to residents’ safety.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'If decisive action isn’t taken, we’ll face a dangerous reality that threatens not just Jewish communities but all Israelis,' he added. 'I expect security forces to immediately demolish these structures, investigate how illegal construction in such a strategic location was allowed to progress and prevent similar cases in the future.' Regavim's policy director Avraham Binyamin claimed the construction is part of a broader Palestinian effort to 'establish facts on the ground, seize land and encroach on state property — right next to Israeli communities and major highways. 'The border cannot be a no-man’s land. The state must restore deterrence and act decisively against this massive, violent takeover, which could quickly become an immediate and tangible threat to Israeli citizens.' 'For the past two years, Minister Smotrich has worked to change enforcement policy against illegal construction and Palestinian land grabs in Judea and Samaria. This includes staffing key positions, increasing enforcement resources and optimizing their use,' Smotrich's office said in a statement. 'During his tenure, illegal construction has decreased by about 50%, while demolitions have increased by 30% — and efforts continue. The minister thanks Regavim for aiding in identifying illegal construction and pressuring for stronger enforcement. The specific case will be referred to enforcement authorities for action according to priorities and professional discretion.' Oranit Council head Or Piron Zomer added, 'We take Palestinian illegal construction very seriously. The lack of enforcement leads to more and more buildings encroaching on state land near the fence, posing a real danger to our residents. These structures, along with illegal event halls in the area, regularly disrupt our residents' quality of life. 'We demand immediate enforcement and a continuous crackdown on these violations, which could enable further threats in the future. Over the past year, we’ve conducted site visits with all relevant authorities, from the IDF Civil Administration’s inspection unit to the Central Command chief. We trust our security forces but we insist on immediate and uncompromising enforcement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skfg2wgkyx	2025-02-06T09:43:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/Bkc7ugzt1g/Bkc7ugzt1g_0_114_640_361_0_small.jpg

Trump to impose sanctions on International Criminal Court	US president to sign executive order imposing financial and visa sanctions on individuals involved in ICC investigations targeting US and its allies, including Israel; court reportedly braces for US sanctions that could cripple its operations U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday to sanction the International Criminal Court (ICC) for targeting the United States and its allies, such as Israel, a White House official said. The order will place financial and visa sanctions on individuals and their family members who assist in ICC investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies, said the official. The move by Trump comes after U.S. Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to sanction the ICC in protest at its arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense chief Yoav Gallant over Israel's campaign in Gaza. Netanyahu is currently visiting Washington. The ICC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The court has taken measures to shield staff from possible U.S. sanctions, paying salaries three months in advance, as it braced for financial restrictions that could cripple the war crimes tribunal, sources told Reuters last month. In December, the court's president, Judge Tomoko Akane, warned that sanctions would 'rapidly undermine the Court's operations in all situations and cases, and jeopardise its very existence.' This is the second time the court has faced U.S. retaliation as a result of its work. During the first Trump administration in 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her top aides over the ICC's investigation into alleged war crimes by American troops in Afghanistan.

Israeli Navy successfully tests Gabriel 5 sea-to-sea missile, striking simulated enemy vessel with precision; officials say advanced naval strike system enhances Israel’s maritime superiority, providing crucial operational edge in combat scenarios The Israeli Navy, the Directorate of Defense Research & Development (DDR&D) in the Defense Ministry and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) successfully conducted an operational test of the Gabriel 5 sea-to-sea missile, the military reported on Thursday. As part of the drill, the missile was launched at a target vessel simulating an enemy warship, successfully completing detection, tracking and engagement processes under combat-like conditions. Defense officials called the test a key milestone in bolstering Israel’s maritime offensive capabilities. 'The successful launch provides the Israeli Navy with greater operational freedom and strengthens our maritime superiority,' said Brig. Gen. Yehuda Elmakias, head of the Research and Development Unit at DDR&D. He emphasized that the missile system enhances Israel’s ability to protect strategic assets, infrastructure and civilian security. The Gabriel 5 is one of the Israeli Navy’s most advanced naval strike systems, allowing for precise targeting of enemy vessels. Capt. A., head of the Israeli Navy’s Weapons Department, said the missile’s capabilities are already being applied in combat, providing a 'substantial operational advantage across all arenas.'

Smotrich: Israel has quietly discussed Gaza emigration plan for m...	Treasurer says kept discussions under wraps due to concerns about opposition from Biden administration, reaffirms plans to resume Gaza military operations after hostage deal and rejects any Palestinian recognition as part of Saudi normalization Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Thursday that Israel has been quietly discussing plans for the voluntary emigration of Gaza’s population for months, but refrained from openly addressing the issue due to concerns over the Biden administration’s opposition. In an interview on Ynet's Hebrew-language political podcast '120 and One,' Smotrich said discussions on Palestinian emigration were taking place under the radar before U.S. President Donald Trump publicly embraced the idea. He also reaffirmed that Israel will resume full-scale military operations after the initial phase of the hostage deal, rejected any national recognition of Palestinian sovereignty as part of a potential normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia and hinted at possible tensions with far-right leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has expressed interest in rejoining the government. Smotrich praised Trump’s backing of the Gaza resettlement proposal, saying it reflects an understanding of Gaza’s severe overpopulation and economic limitations. 'Before the war, every poll in Gaza showed overwhelming numbers of people wanting to emigrate but were blocked from leaving,' Smotrich claimed. 'Trump understands that the only way to ensure better lives for Gazans is outside of Gaza.' He confirmed reports that Israel had been examining emigration plans for months but avoided openly discussing them during President Joe Biden’s administration to prevent a diplomatic backlash. 'If we had gone public with this under Biden, it could have led to a UN Security Council resolution without an American veto, making it harder to implement,' Smotrich said. 'We have been preparing various options behind the scenes, and now that Trump has weighed in, his support carries enormous weight.' Smotrich suggested that with the U.S. president's backing, it would be feasible to relocate two million Gazans to other countries, calling it 'the only solution that would bring peace and security to Israel while improving economic conditions for Gazans.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Smotrich reiterated his strong opposition to any Palestinian political recognition as part of a potential Israel-Saudi normalization deal. 'There will be no national, sovereign or collective recognition of any entity other than the State of Israel,' he said. He dismissed speculation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was considering such a concession, claiming, 'I've had dozens of conversations with him on this. He is not going in that direction.' Smotrich insisted that Israel must resume military operations in Gaza after the first phase of the hostage deal, calling the agreement a dangerous precedent that incentivizes hostage-taking. 'The only way to fix this is by ensuring Hamas is destroyed—militarily, politically and as a governing entity,' he said. 'We must go back to war if Hamas does not surrender.' He also criticized the handling of humanitarian aid to Gaza, arguing that allowing Hamas to control aid distribution had strengthened the terrorist group financially. 'Hamas has received $1.3 billion during this war—it’s a failure,' he said, adding that Netanyahu should have forced the military to find alternative distribution mechanisms. Smotrich implicitly criticized Ben-Gvir, who recently left the government and has hinted at wanting to return. 'I think he made a mistake by leaving,' Smotrich said. 'You can’t just walk away to save face over a hostage deal and then try to return. If he wants back in, he must do so with responsibility, not as part of a perpetual campaign.' When asked about his future political alignment with Ben-Gvir, Smotrich said, 'I’m not comfortable discussing politics in the middle of a war.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byqbr8mt1e	2025-02-06T07:34:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/S1PSaH4GFkl/S1PSaH4GFkl_0_204_853_481_0_small.jpg
US imposes sanctions on global network shipping Iranian oil to Ch...	The United States has announced economic sanctions targeting an 'international network' facilitating the transfer of Iranian oil to China, allegedly funding Tehran’s military operations, the Treasury Department said Thursday. The move marks the first round of sanctions imposed under the new administration of President Donald Trump. In the statement, the Treasury Department said it was 'sanctioning an international network for facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).' The U.S. has long accused Iran of using oil revenues to finance its military and proxy forces across the region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1w8tizy1g	2025-02-06T07:04:52-08:00	
Was the fatal Gaza crane collapse preventable?	After 2 Golani soldiers killed, 8 others injured, probe focuses on why military crane wasn’t retracted despite storm warnings; one of victims rushed to fight on Oct. 7; another overcame health issues to serve in combat role Two IDF soldiers were killed and eight others injured when a military crane collapsed in the northern section of the newly established buffer zone inside Gaza overnight Thursday, the IDF said. The incident occurred during a cease-fire and is being investigated as a possible severe operational failure. The victims were identified as Sergeant First Class (res.) Nadav Cohen, 21, from Beit Hanan, and Staff Sgt. Nachman Refael Ben Ami, 20, from Eilat—both members of the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion. The collapse occurred as strong winds and stormy weather swept through the region, with one soldier remaining in critical condition. The soldiers were inside a tent when the operational crane, commonly used by the IDF to mount surveillance cameras and communication antennas, collapsed due to high winds. Despite advance warnings of severe weather, the military only halted the use of cranes in Gaza and nearby Israeli bases after the fatal accident. According to initial reports, the crane had been deployed at a temporary outpost in the buffer zone, several hundred yards from the Gaza-Israel border near Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Witnesses reported no prior signs of instability before a sudden gust of wind caused it to topple onto the soldiers’ tent. Unlike other outposts in the area, the soldiers were not housed in reinforced structures. The accident occurred around midnight, with winds recorded at approximately 60 km/h (37 mph) along the southern coastal plain, according to Israel’s meteorological service. While the IDF had taken weather precautions for its troops, the decision not to retract the cranes despite the risk of collapse is now a key focus of the investigation, along with how the equipment was secured. Military cranes play a crucial role in providing surveillance coverage for forces operating beyond the ridgeline in the buffer zone. A first responder at the scene described the effort to extract one of the fallen soldiers. 'We arrived at 12:10 a.m. after receiving reports of a soldier trapped under an overturned crane platform. When we got there, we realized he was likely already dead. The crane, which was extremely heavy, had crushed the soldiers’ tent. A military engineering vehicle was called in to lift it, and it took about five minutes to recover the body,' the rescuer told Ynet. 'We truly thought it was behind us' Nadav Cohen was laid to rest Thursday in the cemetery of Beit Hanan, the small moshav near Ness Ziona where he grew up. He is survived by his parents, Shai and Osnat, and his younger sisters, Roni and Maya. Cohen, who initially enlisted in the Egoz special forces unit before transferring to the Golani Brigade, completed his mandatory service just months ago and immediately volunteered for reserve duty. 'He had just finished his service with Golani, the brigade he loved so much,' his family said. 'Without hesitation, out of a deep sense of duty and values, he volunteered to continue serving in the reserves alongside his friends.' Family friend Zafrir Negbi recounted how Cohen had fought throughout the war, including during Hamas’ October 7 attack on southern Israel. That morning, Cohen was at home on leave but quickly mobilized with his battalion to Kibbutz Kisufim near the Gaza border. 'He was at home when he started getting messages about what was happening in the south,' Negbi said. Cohen joined his battalion commander, Lt. Col. Meir Ohayon, and together they drove to Kisufim. 'He fought there for hours and was hit by two bullets that stopped in his vest—he survived by a miracle.' Cohen later served on the Lebanese front before returning to Gaza in recent weeks. 'We thought things had calmed down with the cease-fire, and then came the devastating news—Nadav was killed by a falling crane,' Negbi said. 'He survived everything in this war. He thought it was finally over, that he could rest. And then, this tragic accident happened.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Cohen’s uncle, Amit Cohen, expressed the family’s grief in an interview with Ynet: 'This shouldn’t have happened. We thought we were past the worst. On October 7, we were with him in Gaza, then in Lebanon, then back in Gaza. We truly thought it was behind us. And then this happened. It’s unbearable. Our firstborn, the eldest of our family in Beit Hanan, the first child born here—and now we’ve lost him. There is no way to fill this void. We are shattered.' Family and friends described Cohen as a 'brave, deeply rooted young man, full of life, with a big heart and a unique sense of humor.' His friends called him 'the heart and soul of the group.' Cohen studied at Gan Raveh Elementary School in Ayanot and later attended the regional high school in Givat Brenner. He is the 13th fallen soldier from his high school since the war began. 'We lost an incredible young man, full of life, smart and kind-hearted,' said Negbi. Mira Ben Ari, head of the Gan Raveh Regional Council, also mourned his passing: 'The Beit Hanan community and the entire nation of Israel have lost one of their best sons today. Nadav was among our finest.' 'An angel, a symbol of heroism and devotion' Ben Ami was laid to rest Thursday in the military section of the Eilat cemetery. He is survived by his parents, Asaf and Orit, and four siblings, Asher, Yaakov, Adele and Sarah. Ben Ami was born in Safed and studied at the Belevav Shalem Yeshiva in Yeruham. His religious Zionist family moved to Eilat three years ago, after previously living in Arad for nearly a decade. Determined to join the Golani Brigade, Ben Ami concealed pre-existing medical conditions that could have disqualified him from combat service. He also chose not to request an exemption based on his mother's battle with cancer, insisting on serving in a meaningful frontline role. His family described him as a devoted son and brother, deeply committed to his faith and values. 'Nachman Refael was a pure soul with a warm and loving heart and kind eyes,' his sisters said. 'He never complained or sought to ease his own burden, but always did everything to make life easier for others.' The family had moved to Eilat to fulfill their dream of living by the sea, which Nachman Refael loved. 'Even in winter, he would go swimming,' they recalled. His sister Adele emphasized his deep dedication to family, saying, 'He wouldn’t want us to cry—he always ensured there was joy and positivity around him. He lived and walked like an angel.' Eilat Mayor Eli Lankri, who visited the family, praised Ben Ami as one of the city's finest sons. 'He grew up with Torah values alongside a love for his people and his land. He fought bravely for our right to live in security. A whole nation mourns with you, sharing in the immense grief over your son, brother and grandson—a symbol of heroism and devotion.' The Belevav Shalem Yeshiva in Yeruham, where Ben Ami studied before enlisting, also paid tribute to him. Yeshiva dean Rabbi Yair Yaakobi said Ben Ami had 'graduated with big dreams of living a meaningful life. He was loved by all, full of kindness, warmth and an enormous heart.' His former teacher, Rabbi Yoni Damest, described him as 'a pure soul with exceptional talent.' He added, 'His humility and kindness made space for everyone around him. He never pretended—his sincerity and deep inner peace radiated outward, along with his genuine joy for life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfsqlztkl	2025-02-06T06:49:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/HklkptZMt1x/HklkptZMt1x_0_92_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Russia says Trump's 'shocking' remarks on Gaza fuel Middle East t...	Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks about resettling the Palestinians from Gaza and establishing U.S. ownership of the enclave were shocking and would ramp up tensions in the Middle East. Trump said on Thursday that Israel would hand over Gaza to the United States after fighting was over and the enclave's population was already resettled elsewhere, which he said meant no U.S. troops would be needed on the ground. Earlier this week, Trump said he wanted to resettle Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan, demolish remaining buildings to make way for a Riviera-style development project and place the occupied territory under U.S. 'ownership'. 'The main thing now is to provide the necessary humanitarian assistance to all those in need,' Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters. 'We believe that the main task today is to ensure the implementation of agreements between Israel and Hamas.' 'Any populist, frivolous or shocking arguments about any other palliative measures at the present stage are counterproductive and do not contribute to solving the problem, but only fuel tension in the region and to all the already extremely aggravated problems,' Zakharova said of Trump's remarks.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ag11umfkl	2025-02-06T06:12:42-08:00

What has the IDF accomplished in Jenin so far?	Jenin operation echoes Ariel Sharon’s 1971 Gaza strategy, which included controversial but effective displacement—an approach that may interest figures like Trump; yet with the campaign ongoing, how can Israel prevent terror groups from regrouping? As we drive into the Jenin refugee camp, we pass a large public building. 'That’s the camp’s hospital,' says Col. A, the commander of the Menashe Territorial Brigade. With relative indifference, he adds, 'We know there are still terrorists hiding there, and we’ll find a way to get them out. It’s not urgent for now.' Unlike previous IDF operations in the Jenin refugee camp, this mission has no time constraints and no set end date. Unlike past operations in Jenin, Tulkarem, and the surrounding villages, this is not a swift counterterrorism raid where forces enter, neutralize a target, and withdraw. The current mission, or rather, Operation Iron Wall, is aimed at systematically dismantling terrorist strongholds in the northern West Bank. This requires manpower and time. Since the war began in October 2023, Col. A has led 45 counterterrorism operations inside the Jenin refugee camp, referred to in military shorthand as 'M.P.' (mahane plitim, Hebrew for refugee camp) These past operations, including Operation Home and Garden in the summer of 2023, lasted only a few days. Now, forces have been in the camp for more than two weeks, systematically targeting both human and physical terrorist infrastructure. Walking through the narrow alleys of the Jenin refugee camp, it becomes clear why it is considered the terrorism capital of the northern West Bank. One key reason is its strategic location in Area A, under full Palestinian Authority control, near Israeli and Arab towns such as Afula and Megiddo, and close to the Jordan Valley. Before the war, Jenin enjoyed economic prosperity while also benefiting from massive arms smuggling across the porous Jordanian border, just a few dozen kilometers away. However, the historical legacy embedded in the camp is just as crucial. The walls are covered in graffiti depicting terrorist narratives, indoctrinating residents from birth. 'Look at this depiction of the ‘key narrative,’' Col. A says, pointing to a mural. It features familiar symbols such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque and a map of Palestine, with a child carrying a massive key like a rifle. 'The key represents the claim of camp residents—even those of the third or fourth generation—to return to their ancestors' homes in Haifa and its surroundings,' he explains. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The camp's 12,000 residents are mostly descendants of Haifa-area refugees who fled in 1948, settling on the hills above Jenin. Only the lower section of the camp extends into the city’s outskirts. Most buildings cling to steep slopes, making the alleys difficult to navigate on foot and nearly impossible for vehicles. As part of Operation Iron Wall, one of the first things the Israeli military did was carve out wide roads to facilitate rapid troop movement, including tanks, armored personnel carriers, and bulldozers. The D9 bulldozers, crucial in urban warfare, played a decisive role in breaking through. The use of bulldozers to open combat routes is not new. In 1971, then-Southern Command head Ariel Sharon employed a similar tactic to suppress the first wave of Gaza terrorism, demolishing buildings and clearing roads in the Jabalia and Shati refugee camps. As part of that campaign, Sharon relocated 1,600 Palestinian families whose homes had been destroyed, offering them resettlement options in Gaza and El-Arish. The aim was to dilute both the refugee camp population and its terrorist elements—a move that proved successful. A Network of bombs and surveillance Currently, a brigade combat team under Col. A’s command is focused on dismantling Jenin’s terrorist infrastructure, specifically targeting the network of roadside bombs and command centers established by the Jenin Battalion to attack Israeli forces and launch terror strikes into Israel. These explosives, despite being mostly homemade, have grown increasingly sophisticated. Like in Gaza, these IEDs remain the deadliest threat to Israeli forces. But the bombs are just the tip of the iceberg. Behind them lies a well-coordinated command-and-control system operated from multiple war rooms, using surveillance cameras positioned throughout the camp. These cameras allow terrorists to track Israeli troops, detonate explosives remotely, and issue alerts in real time. As we walk through the camp, we see remnants of these cameras, neutralized by the IDF, as well as large tarps terrorists had stretched over the streets to block Israeli drones from spotting their bomb placements. Some of these roadside bombs contain hundreds of kilograms of explosives, requiring significant time and effort to bury beneath roadways and repave the surface. Several such devices have already detonated beneath Panther armored vehicles, causing casualties. In fact, IEDs have been the primary cause of Israeli troop casualties in Jenin. Given the camp's extensive fortifications, previous pinpoint operations based on precise intelligence allowed the IDF to eliminate terrorists and thwart attacks before they were carried out. However, the Jenin Battalion remained intact, continuing its operations alongside terrorist cells in Tulkarem and surrounding villages. Jenin remains the epicenter of Palestinian terrorism, home to a coalition of terrorist factions under the Jenin Battalion, primarily led by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Even the secular, Marxist-Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) follows PIJ’s command. They call themselves 'Abnaa al-Mukhayyam'—the Sons of the Camp. The reign of extremism The camp's walls are filled with graffiti mocking Yasser Arafat for signing the Oslo Accords, depicting him as a woman. One mural shows a woman holding a map of Palestine, telling Arafat, 'Palestine will be great, and you are small.' This extreme ideology has allowed Palestinian Islamic Jihad to organize an actual military unit with a structured chain of command. Years of limited IDF presence and a complete absence of Palestinian Authority security forces enabled the battalion to build a sophisticated command system, controlling the camp with an iron grip. Hezbollah recognized the battalion’s potential early on, securing Iranian funding and weapons for the group. These 'investments' have paid off, creating a well-equipped terrorist force that the IDF is now working to dismantle. 'We are targeting both the personnel and the infrastructure they built,' Col. A says. 'We don’t demolish buildings at random. Where there’s doubt, we hold back. But weapons labs and terrorist positions will not remain standing.' As we drive, we spot a team of four wearing red uniforms with Red Crescent emblems, riding all-terrain vehicles. These are Palestinian search-and-rescue workers, permitted by the IDF to look for survivors in buildings that were destroyed. 'They won’t find anyone,' Col. A says, 'because we thoroughly check buildings before demolishing them.' Memories of the fierce 2002 Battle of Jenin, the bloodiest fight of Operation Defensive Shield, flash through my mind. Back then, D9 bulldozers played a decisive role in breaking terrorist resistance. 'This is what they call ‘Death Alley,’' Col. A says as we arrive at a narrow passage. 'Here, 13 of our soldiers were killed in an ambush. The terrorists rebuilt the area exactly as it was, both to preserve their legacy and to hinder our movements.' Despite ongoing efforts, Col. A knows the mission will take time. The key to long-term stability, he says, is not just eliminating terrorists but blocking the weapons and funding that sustain them. Until then, the battle continues. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1extxmt1l	2025-02-06T05:49:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/r14WU8VMFyl/r14WU8VMFyl_0_127_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Arab American Trump supporters back away after his Gaza plan	Group changes name from Arab Americans for Trump to Arab Americans for Peace; reject the idea promoted by the US president to 'take control of Gaza' and say opposed to any transfer of Palestinians Arab Americans for Trump, a group that supported the election of U.S. President Donald Trump's race for the White House in 2024 and were instrumental in bringing him votes has begun distancing from the president in the wake of his plan to turn Gaza into a so-called Middle East Riviera, in part by removing Gazans from the coastal strip. The group has changed its name from Arab Americans for Trump and now goes by Arab Americans for Peace. It says it still believes the in the president's commitment to peace in the Middle East but it does take issue with his intention to 'take control of Gaza' and encourage Palestinians to leave the Strip. Trump repeated his plan on his social media platform on Thursday after he outlined the idea for the U.S. to 'take over' Gaza during a White House press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday and floated a proposal to relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries and redevelop the war-torn territory into a 'Riviera of the Middle East,' while not ruling out the deployment of U.S. troops. Although they were not an official part of the Trump presidential campaign, the group played a central role in communicating his messages among the American Arab community, especially in the swing states of Michigan and Arizona. Members of the group also arrange meetings with allies of the then-candidate including Richard Grenell, Trump's envoy for special missions, and Massad Boulos, Trump's in-law and a senior member of the campaign for Middle-East and the Arab world. Yahya Basha who founded Arab Americans for Trump, said he was not surprised by Trump's comments, given earlier statements by the president's Jewish son-in-law Jared Kushner about Gaza being a good site for a future resort, but remained skeptical that the U.S. would execute those plans.

'I hope we see positive signs in the future,' he said adding that he believed Trump's comments were often provocative rather than the basis of policy, citing his comments on buying Greenland or to make Canada the 51st state of the U.S.' Leaders in Michigan's Muslim community were outraged, some calling Trump crazy and his announcement 'total chaos.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjym57ftye	2025-02-06T04:50:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/HJUnZoix1x/HJUnZoix1x_0_302_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Israeli spyware Paragon scandal grows: Italian journalists, activ...	A new report reveals that Paragon, the Israeli firm behind the surveillance tool, has decided to cut ties with Italy while Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government denies any involvement in the espionage scandal The espionage scandal involving Israeli spyware firm Paragon is deepening as new details emerge about its use to surveil journalists and activists. In recent days, three individuals critical of Italy’s government –including its handling of antisemitism within the ruling party – were identified as targets. The revelation has sent shockwaves across Italy and Europe. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government has denied using spyware to monitor journalists and activists. Meanwhile, The Guardian reported Thursday that Paragon has decided to sever ties with the Italian government. Last week, Meta alleged that Paragon’s spyware, Graphite, was implanted in the smartphones of about 90 people across 20 countries – mostly journalists and human rights activists—via WhatsApp. The tech giant has issued a legal warning to Paragon, demanding it halt surveillance of its users. Sources told Ynet that Paragon is assessing its next steps and is prepared to challenge Meta in court if necessary. Reports by Reuters and The Guardian have identified three targets of the surveillance: Francesco Cancellato, editor-in-chief of investigative news site Fanpage; Libyan-born Swedish activist Husam El Gomati; and Luca Casarini, head of Mediterranea Saving Humans, an organization assisting migrants from Libya. Casarini is known for his outspoken criticism of Italy’s immigration policies. 'They spied on me just because I'm a journalist' In an exclusive interview with Ynet, Cancellato expressed deep concern over the surveillance. 'I was really worried. Being targeted by spyware is a big problem for me. I believe they spied on me just because I'm a journalist,' he said. Cancellato revealed that his phone is now undergoing forensic analysis by Citizen Lab, a Canadian research group specializing in spyware investigations, and that the findings will be published by his newspaper. He first learned of the breach when WhatsApp’s security team sent him a warning message, alerting him that spyware had been detected on his device. 'At first, I thought it was a scam or a joke,' he recalled. 'Then, Citizen Lab contacted me and confirmed that this was real. They told me that my phone was hacked using Paragon’s spyware and that I was one of 90 journalists and activists who were targeted. I felt very uneasy; it was a strange and unsettling realization.' Why do you think that out of 90 people, only your name and that of two others were exposed? 'My name was published because I’m a journalist. My work is public, and even if the story is about me, it will be reported. But I don't know why others haven’t come forward — maybe they’re afraid, or maybe their cases are still being verified.' A power struggle over press freedom Cancellato also noted that, in the months leading up to the revelation, his WhatsApp app frequently crashed without explanation. At the time, he dismissed it as a technical issue. 'I never suspected it was linked to spyware. Looking back, I can’t say for sure if those crashes were related, but now it certainly makes me wonder,' he said. As editor-in-chief of an investigative outlet, Cancellato is particularly concerned about the potential breach of sensitive information. 'This isn’t just about my phone, it’s about my entire newsroom. They didn’t just hack me; they hacked my newspaper,' he said. 'Paragon claims its spyware isn’t as invasive as Pegasus [the infamous spyware from Israeli firm NSO], but they could still extract any data they wanted from my device.' He emphasized the broader implications: 'The real issue here is that a government agency spied on a European journalist. Paragon says it only sells to democratic nations, but why would a democracy spy on a journalist?' Was his reporting on Meloni’s party the reason? Cancellato acknowledged that his investigative team had published a major exposé on Meloni’s party, Brothers of Italy, revealing antisemitic content shared by young party members. The report sparked controversy, particularly because Brothers of Italy positions itself as a pro-Israel party. 'Our investigation had a significant impact on the government, so maybe that’s why they targeted me,' he said. Still, he remains uncertain about who was behind the surveillance. 'I don’t know who spied on me or why,' he said. 'But I doubt they were interested in my vacation plans or dinner dates. They wanted information about my work, our investigations; that’s the only thing I’m certain about.' Paragon was founded in 2019 by Ehud Schneorson, a former commander of Israel’s elite cyber intelligence unit 8200, along with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and several other ex-8200 operatives. Last year, the company was acquired by U.S. private equity firm Eurazeo Equity in a deal valued at up to $900 million. While Italy has neither confirmed nor denied using Paragon’s spyware, the firm claims it only sells to 37 democratic countries—making it highly likely that Italy was one of them. Sources familiar with the matter told Ynet that if it is proven that Paragon’s tools were misused to spy on journalists with no links to criminal activity, the license of the offending entity will be revoked. Following the uproar, Paragon has now reportedly decided to terminate its contract with the Italian government. Cancellato: 'I expected more from my government' Cancellato expressed disappointment in how the Italian government has handled the scandal. 'If Italy is involved, I expected someone in the government to step forward and say, ‘Yes, we use Paragon’s tools, but only to catch criminals, not journalists. We will investigate whether anyone overstepped their authority.’ Or at least say, ‘It’s serious that a foreign government is spying on our journalists, and we will support you in finding out what happened.’ 'But none of that happened,' he said. Should spyware be banned in democracies? Cancellato says he believes spyware can have legitimate uses in law enforcement but warns that its power must be handled responsibly. 'When used against criminals, terrorists, and drug traffickers, these tools can be valuable. Criminal organizations have hacking capabilities too, so law enforcement needs the ability to counter them,' he said. 'But governments must be held accountable. It’s like in Spider-Man: with great power comes great responsibility. If you use these tools, you must do so ethically and in accordance with democratic principles.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkznzmtjl	2025-02-06T04:37:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/SyNrxjLuye/SyNrxjLuye_1_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Their interrogation revealed that they had planned to denote an explosive device that they would bring across the border into Israel. Some of the members were also involved in shooting attacks targeting troops on the West Bank in the past year.

Trump's Gaza plan was born after envoy Witkoff visit to Netzarim ...	The Mideast envoy's description reportedly was turning point leading U.S. president to float his plan during news conference; some administration officials hope this will die off slowly, say no discussions was held in advance of the announcement President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff's impressions of Gaza were what prompted Trump's dramatic plan for the Strip, which includes the United States removing its residents and turning it into a Middle Eastern Riviera, CNN reported Thursday. Witkoff visited the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer last week and returned with a bleak description of what he saw. 'It is the buildings that could tip over at any moment. There’s no utilities there whatsoever, no working water, electric, gas, nothing. God knows what kind of disease might be festering there,' Witkoff told reporters on Tuesday. 'So, when the president talks about cleaning it out, he talks about making it habitable. And this is a long-range plan.' Trump's envoy said that the president intends to make Gaza a livable place and, like him, estimated it would take 10 to 15 years to rebuild. According to CNN, Witkoff's accounts of what he had seen left a strong impression on the president, constituting a turning-point after Trump made it the central point in his agenda for the region. Other sources in the know said the that the idea to remove Gazans from the Strip was the president's and proof that, while traditional 'experts' develop their ideas slowly, Trump comes up with them quickly in his own mind. The New York Times cited two administration officials who said Trump discussed the idea of U.S. control of the Strip for a number of weeks and, after Witkoff's description of the reality on the ground, his plan picked up pace. They said that although the matter had been considered by him for a while, there had been no meetings on the subject with the State Department or Pentagon, or any preparations made. 'It was just an idea in the president's mind,' they said. There are some who wonder whether Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and another real estate investor who worked the Middle East portfolio in his first term, would play a part in the rebuilding of Gaza. He had previously spoken about the incredible development opportunities presented by the Gaza waterfront. The president also spoke publicly about that potential in a speech last month. While there has been wall to wall condemnation of the idea in the Arab world, officials told CNN that Trump complained that there were no alternatives being suggested by regional actors. 'He’s not seeing any realistic solutions on how those miles and miles and miles of debris are going to be cleared,' U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said. 'The fact that nobody has a realistic solution, and he puts some bold, fresh, new ideas on the table, I don’t think should be criticized in any way. I think it’s going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions if they don’t like Mr. Trump’s solutions.' But there are those in the administration who understand that there is little chance for the plan to proceed and that the White House has already begun backing away from central parts of the plan. Some officials told the New York Times that advisors to the president hope the plan dies out slowly and that he would understand in time, that it is unrealistic. Trump's announcement of the plan was kept secret from nay of the senior officials in Washington, but he did discuss it with close advisors ahead of his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Times said Witkoff and Walz spoke to Netanyahu about it on the Monday before the meeting, but the prime minister did not expect Trump's announcement in their press conference.

Sources told CNN that the Middle-East has been removed from Rubio's portfolio amid the involvement of Witkoff in regional matters. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by1brggkye	2025-02-06T02:31:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/SJMn3kMKyg/SJMn3kMKyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Too early to talk about Turkey-Syria defense pact, Turkish source...	Turkey's priority in Syria is achieving stability and security, and ridding the country of militants, but it is too early to talk about a pact that would see Ankara establish military bases there, a Turkish Defense Ministry source said on Thursday. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Turkey and the new Syrian administration were to discuss a joint defence pact during talks between their presidents this week, including establishing two Turkish airbases in Syria and training for its new army. Asked about the report, the source said a defense ministry delegation had travelled to Syria last week for talks and that both countries were in agreement about Syria's territorial integrity, stability, and the need to clear it of all militants. The pact could see Turkey establish new air bases in Syria, use Syrian airspace for military purposes, and take a lead role in training troops in Syria's new army, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a senior regional intelligence official, a Syrian security official and two Damascus-based foreign security sources.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk8rbfzt1g	2025-02-06T01:59:23-08:00

Iran launches 1st drone carrier for IRGC navy	Shahid Beheshti, a former container vessel, is equipped with a 180-metre (590-ft) runway and is able to operate without refuelling for up to one year, Iran's news agency Tasnim says Iran launched a new drone carrier vessel on Thursday, that will be added to its Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) naval force. This is the first of its kind in Iran and second to Turkey's navy. The new carrier is meant to help Iran launch drones from a relatively close distance toward its enemies and reduce the chances detection of the launch. The Shahid Beheshti, a former container vessel, is equipped with a 180-metre (590-ft) runway and is able to operate without refuelling for up to one year, Iran's news agency Tasnim said. The ship is different from previous Revolutionary Guards warships because it can launch and retrieve larger drones such as the Qaher, a miniaturised drone version of a local fighter jet as well as helicopters. Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had revealed in the past that Iran intended to transform merchant vessels for military use, which he said would be 'floating bases of terror.' In a speech he gave in May 2023, Gallant presented a photograph of the Shahid Beheshti. 'these vessels are of considerable size, ranging from tens to sometimes hundreds of thousands of tons,' he warned. 'They are intended to carry various types of combat capabilities, including aircraft, missiles, offensive systems and advanced intelligence, in order to serve as forward terror bases in areas located far from the Iranian border.' Iran's chief of military staff Mohammad Bagheri and the commander of the IRGC Hossein Salami participated in the launch. 'We do not threaten any nation but do not bend in the face of threats,' Salami said. 'Our achievements are an answer to any threat against Iran and the Muslim nations.' According to a report in Al Jazeera, the new IRGC vessel would be a possible answer for Iran to approach its enemies' territory including Israel.

Court orders seizure of 20 million shekels from PA over terror mu...	Jerusalem court grants request by parents of Rina Shnerb, who was murdered in a terrorist attack at a spring in the Binyamin region which seriously injured her father and brother; 'We will take the money that was meant for terror and use it to spread goodness in the world' family says The Jerusalem District Court has granted a request by the parents of Rina Shnerb, who was murdered in a terrorist attack at the age of 16, issuing a temporary order to seize 20 million shekels ($5.4 million) from Palestinian Authority funds held by the Israeli government. The attack occurred in August 2019 while the Shnerb family was on a hike near the Ein Bubin spring in the Binyamin region. According to the court petition, filed by Rina’s parents, Shira and Rabbi Eitan Shnerb, their eldest son, Dvir — who is also one of the plaintiffs — was seriously wounded in the attack, as was the father. Both sustained permanent disabilities as a result. The family's attorney, Asher Stub, stated in the petition to the court that the father and his two children arrived at the spring late Friday morning when a terrorist detonated an explosive device that had been planted along the access trail. The attacker, who had been watching them approach, set off the bomb as they stepped onto the path. Rina was killed instantly, while her father and brother were seriously injured. The lawsuit is based on the Victims of Terror Compensation Law, which took effect in June 2024. The law grants exemplary damages of 10 million shekels ($2.7 million) to the heirs of an individual killed in a terrorist attack and 5 million shekels ($1.35 million) to a victim who suffers permanent disability. The plaintiffs are seeking 20 million shekels in total from the Palestinian Authority, alleging it funds and legitimizes terrorism. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'This lawsuit was filed under the Victims of Terror Compensation Law, which we initiated last year,' said attorney Stub, founder of the organization Justice for Terror Victims, which represents the Shnerb family. 'It is part of a series of lawsuits we have filed to halt the flow of money to terrorists and instead direct those funds to those who truly need them—the victims of terror.' Rina’s parents, Eitan and Shira Shnerb, emphasized in a statement their commitment to turning tragedy into positive action. 'They came to kill and destroy. We will take the money that was meant for terror and use it for the exact opposite — to spread goodness, to do endless acts of kindness,' they said. 'We always choose to focus on the good and to uplift the spirit of the people of Israel. The legal process forces us to confront the darkness, but the support of the Justice for Terror Victims legal team allows us to entrust them with this fight while we focus on bringing light to the world. We want other families and survivors to know they, too, can take legal action and join the fight against funding terror,' they added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjb0fjgkyg	2025-02-06T00:13:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/08/23/9439465/9439465_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg

Iran's first drone carrier joins the Revolutionary Guards' fleet	Iran's Revolutionary Guards have taken delivery of the country's first ship capable of launching drones and helicopters at sea, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Thursday. Amid military exercises lasting from early January to early March, Iran's armed forces have unveiled new weaponry as Tehran braces for more friction with Israel and the United States under President Donald Trump. 'The Revolutionary Guards took action to transform a commercial ship ... into a mobile naval platform capable of carrying out drone and helicopter missions in the oceans,' said Navy Commander of the Revolutionary Guards Alireza Tangsiri. The Shahid Beheshti, a former container ship, is equipped with a 180-meter (590-ft) runway and can operate without refuelling for up to one year, Tasnim said. The ship is different from previous Revolutionary Guards warships because it can launch and retrieve larger drones such as the Qaher and Mohajer-6. 'The addition of this ship into our fleet is an important step in increasing the defence and deterrence capability of Iran in distant waters and in maintaining our national security interests,' Tangsiri added. Last month, Iran's navy received its first signals intelligence ship.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkk2lymy1l	2025-02-05T22:38:02-08:00	
Crane collapses in Gaza buffer zone killing 2 soldiers, injuring ...	Serious accident in the Gaza Strip, during the storm: Golani Battallion reserve soldier Nadav Cohen, 21, was killed overnight when a crane collapsed; second soldier also was killed; 8 others were injured, including one in serious condition. Winds were blowing at 60 km/h in the area Disaster in the buffer zone inside the Gaza Strip, during a storm : An operational crane collapsed overnight Thursday in the northern area of the new Gaza buffer zone and two soldiers who were inside a building at the outpost were killed. One of the fallen is reserve soldier Nadav Cohen, 21, from Moshav Beit Hanan, a soldier in the 51st Battalion, Golani Brigade. The name of the second soldier who was killed has not yet been released, but his family has been notified. Another soldier was seriously injured and seven others were lightly to moderately injured. The IDF stopped operating all cranes in the Gaza border area and at outposts in the Gaza Strip on the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors at least until the investigation is completed and the weather clears; according to initial assessments by the IDF, the collapse was caused by a sudden and particularly strong wind. Initial details indicate that the crane that collapsed is actually a lifting platform that the IDF has frequently used in Gaza since the beginning of the war, a crane that regularly lifts observation equipment such as cameras and radars at temporary outposts.

IDF ordered to prepare plan to allow Gazans to leave voluntarily	After Netanyahu expressed enthusiastic support for the Trump initiative, Defense Minister Israel Katz called it 'bold' and ordered the IDF to prepare a plan for Gazan's departure via sea and air; He said countries such as Spain, Ireland and Norway are obligated to allow Gazans to immigrate to them after their accusations against Israel: 'If they refuse, their hypocrisy will be exposed' After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed enthusiastic support for U.S. President Donald Trump's Gaza initiative, Defense Minister Israeli Katz on Thursday morning instructed the IDF 'to prepare a plan to allow voluntary departure for Gaza residents, including special arrangements for exit by sea and air,' although Israel has not yet officially adopted any such plan. 'I welcome U.S. President Trump's bold plan, which could allow a large population in Gaza to leave for various places in the world,' said Katz. 'Hamas used Gaza residents as human shields and built terror infrastructure in the heart of the population, and is now holding them hostage, extorting money from them by use of humanitarian aid, and preventing them from leaving Gaza.' 'I have instructed the IDF to prepare a plan that will allow any resident of Gaza who is interested to leave to any place in the world that agrees to accept them.' The Defense Ministry's Counter-Terrorism Unit is supposed to be responsible for this, but Katz turned his attention to the IDF and said that the plan he wanted to prepare should include 'exit options at land crossings as well as special arrangements for exit by sea and air.' Katz even detailed a list of countries that he claims are obligated to allow Gazans to immigrate to them: 'Countries like Spain, Ireland, Norway and others, which have made false accusations and plots against Israel due to its activities in Gaza, are obligated by law to allow every Gazan resident to enter their territory - and their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse to do so. There are countries like Canada, which has a regulated immigration program, that have expressed a desire in the past to absorb residents from Gaza. Gazans should be allowed to enjoy freedom of exit and immigration as is customary everywhere in the world.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Katz, 'U.S. President Trump's bold plan can create extensive possibilities for the departure of a population from Gaza who is interested in doing so, and also help them be optimally absorbed in the target countries, as well as enable the advancement of reconstruction plans in a demilitarized and threat-free Gaza in the post-Hamas era, which will last for many years.' During the press conference that Trump held with Netanyahu a little over a day ago, the U.S. president said: 'We'll take over Gaza, flatten it. We'll clear out bombs and destroyed houses, that's a great idea.' During the statement, Trump also reiterated his intention to complete the entire hostage deal, and threatened Hamas: 'If all the hostages are not released, we will be more violent.' Trump added that 'the Gaza Strip has been a source of destruction and so bad for the people, the lives of the residents there are miserable. They need to go to other places. There are many of them who want to go from there. 1.8 million Gazans need to leave. The rich countries in the region need to finance it. They can go to one area, or seven or 12. We will ensure that something amazing is done. We will have peace and they will not shoot, kill and destroy.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjk0fc11fyg	2025-02-05T22:06:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/H1Y8A8CI1e/H1Y8A8CI1e_0_132_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Australia passes tough hate crime laws to tackle rampant antisemi...	Bill includes minimum jail sentences between 12 months for less serious hate crimes, such as giving a Nazi salute in public, and six years for those found guilty of terrorism offences Australia passed tough anti-hate crime laws on Thursday, including mandatory minimum sentences for terror offences and displaying hate symbols, in a bid to tackle a recent surge in antisemitism. The laws will impose minimum jail sentences between 12 months for less serious hate crimes, such as giving a Nazi salute in public, and six years for those found guilty of terrorism offences. 'I want people who are engaged in antisemitism to be held to account, to be charged, to be incarcerated,' Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who had initially opposed mandatory minimum sentences for hate crimes, told Sky News. The government’s hate crimes bill was first introduced to parliament last year, creating new offences for threatening force or violence against people based on their race, religion, nationality, national or ethnic origin, political opinion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. Recent months have seen an escalation of attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars of Jewish community members across the country, including the discovery of a caravan laden with explosives with a list of Jewish targets in Sydney. Albanese has been criticised by the centre-right opposition party for being weak on crime and failing to address the rise in antisemitism. The Liberal-National coalition began calling for mandatory minimum sentences to be added to the hate crimes bill last month.

Here's how heritage sites play a role in October 7 recovery	Shahar Hermelin, spokesperson for SPIHS, joined ILTV in the studio on Wednesday to discuss the organization's work to ensure that Israel’s rich history remains accessible As Israel continues to face the impact of ongoing conflict, it’s critical to support not only the immediate needs of its people but also the deep-rooted connection to the history and pioneering spirit that have shaped the nation. Two organizations at the forefront of this effort are Jewish National Fund-USA and the Society for Preservation of Israel Heritage Sites (SPIHS), whose work is more essential now than ever. In addition to providing vital mental wellness programs for displaced families, they are also ensuring that Israel’s rich history remains accessible through engaging activities that strengthen resilience and the Zionist spirit. Shahar Hermelin, spokesperson for SPIHS, joined ILTV in the studio on Wednesday. ILTV: Can you tell us more about the 'We Come to You' program and how these heritage-based activities are helping displaced families? Hermelin: It started a few days into the war. We were forced to shut down all 200+ heritage sites we oversee. And in addition, we knew we had to do something to help hundreds of thousands of displaced brothers and sisters. So, because we couldn’t bring them to heritage sites at that point, we started sending our education teams and volunteers from closed sites to conduct activities at more than 50 evacuation centers across the country. The first organization that stepped up to help us was Jewish National Fund-USA. We've been working together for over 25 years, and we brought all kinds of lectures, games, and activities to the evacuation centers—engaging both kids and adults. It gave them a chance to take their minds off their situation while also learning about our heritage and history. ILTV: SPIHS is offering free guided tours at over 200 heritage sites to those most affected by the war. How do these tours go beyond simply teaching history, and what role do they play in bolstering national resilience? Hermelin: We are bringing many groups to heritage sites, and now, it's not just a history lesson. Ever since October 7, we’ve seen a much stronger connection to our history and heritage. People want to understand what their parents and grandparents went through to bring us to where we are today. We hear it from many visitors—after the tour, they come up to us and say, 'We get it now. We understand.' There is a powerful connection between the hardships endured during the War of Independence and what so many people—especially in the south—experienced on October 7. ILTV: How are you planning to renovate and preserve the heritage sites damaged in the war and update the displays to include a chapter about the heroics of October 7? Hermelin: Quite a few heritage sites, both in the south and north, were physically damaged during the war—either due to direct rocket hits or other destruction. First, we need to renovate or rebuild those buildings, and again, we’re doing it together with Jewish National Fund-USA as part of their 'Build Together' master plan. In addition, a new chapter needs to be told. The connection between the War of Independence and the events of October 7 is undeniable. Sites that once told only the story of the War of Independence must now also share the story of how communities once again had to defend themselves and their families. We will achieve this through modern exhibitions, photos, videos, and any available materials to accurately tell this new chapter in Israel’s history.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skjfd0wkyg	2025-02-05T21:36:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/BkDVd011Yye/BkDVd011Yye_0_2_455_257_0_small.jpg

Israelis react to Trump's Gaza plan	What would this actually entail? How would it impact Israelis? These are the pressing questions on people's minds Israelis woke up on Wednesday to U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest remarks about Gaza, in which he suggested that the United States should not only take over the territory but own the land inside Gaza. He even floated the idea of transforming it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' His comments have sparked widespread debate, prompting Israelis to consider what such a plan could mean for their future and the future of Gaza. What would this actually entail? How would it impact Israelis? These are the pressing questions on people's minds, with some critics calling Trump's proposal 'outlandish' or 'unrealistic.' Public Reactions Here’s what some had to say: 'If I understand Trump correctly, Gaza may become a new Miami Beach,' said Tel Aviv resident Mark Malavsky. 'If he can get any of these other countries to take these Gazan refugees and let them go someplace else, problem solved.' Tony Abrams took a different view, suggesting Trump’s approach could yield results. 'The end result is peace, one way or another,' he said. 'He's not like people in the past. Perhaps his ideas will bear some fruit. I mean, he's an extreme man, but he seems a lot more measured than he was last time—more organized and ready for this. So perhaps he's got a plan.' Others strongly opposed the idea. David Finn argued that it could harm Israel and complicate hostage negotiations. 'I'm not in favor of it at all,' he said. 'I think it would be bad for Israel … [and] unhelpful for the release of the hostages because I think Hamas is less likely to go along with negotiations if it means they have to withdraw and then Trump would follow up with his plan.' It remains unclear whether Trump’s proposal will have any impact on the ongoing negotiations in Doha, where discussions continue over the second phase of a hostage-for-ceasefire deal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjvfqr11t1g	2025-02-05T21:19:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/S1A4EAbtke/S1A4EAbtke_43_0_644_362_0_small.jpg
Former ambassador: U.S. takeover of Gaza could be feasible	Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon says there were six million Syrian refugees and there are only two million Gazans It remains unclear whether U.S. President Donald Trump is serious about America taking control of Gaza or if this is merely a negotiating tactic, according to former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon. 'We have seen this method before,' Ayalon told ILTV, referring to past negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and Panama. 'He sets a very high bar and then has much more room to maneuver and negotiate. This may be the case here, but quite frankly, if you take out the political argumentation or the political gist, it does make sense.' Ayalon explained that Gaza is essentially a demolition site, and Trump, with his extensive experience as a builder, understands how to handle large-scale reconstruction projects. He added that the U.S. could manage the effort, given its ability to bring in billions—if not tens of billions—of dollars, which could ultimately benefit the U.S. Treasury. 'This is out-of-the-box thinking, and we will see how it is received,' Ayalon said. So far, Arab countries and the Palestinians have rejected the plan. However, Ayalon noted that there is a significant stretch of empty land in Sinai, adjacent to Gaza. He also pointed out that six million Syrians left their country as refugees, whereas Gaza's population is only two million—suggesting that relocation should be feasible.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4lbcbfye	2025-02-05T21:08:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/HyB9svWWKkg/HyB9svWWKkg_0_180_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu says Trump plan to move Gazans '1st good idea I've hear...	Prime minister says Trump is Israel's greatest friend in the White House that has already done incredible things; says Israel single handedly changed the Middle East 'with some help from U.S.' but the arrival of Trump is a gamechanger Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday gave his full support for the idea proposed by U.S. President Trump to displace Palestinians from Gaza. 'I mean, what's wrong with that? They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back. But you have to rebuild Gaza,' In an interview with Fox News, Netanyahu said 'This is the first good idea that I've heard,' adding, 'It's a remarkable idea, and I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone.' He's the biggest friend Israel's ever had. Netanyahu said. 'Lood what he's done in the last few days. He's done remarkable things,' the prime minister said. 'He's released the ammunition we need to continue out march to victory, he's taken action against UNRWA and these other UN agencies that hate America and hate Israel, he's done enormous things and yes, he's the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.' Netanyahu said he did not think Trump meant to send troops into Gaza to destroy Hamas. 'That's our job, our commitment,' he said. Netanyahu was asked about the cease fire agreement with Hamas and the chances of all of the hostages being released and said that was one of the objectives of the war along with the elimination of Hamas's military power and ensuring Gaza can no longer pose a threat to Israel. He said not all of the military capability was destroyed, 'but we'll make sure that it is not there when this war ends. It can end very quickly,' he said. 'We're changing the Middle East,' he said 'It was basically an Iranian pawn,' he said adding Israel has single handedly changed the region with 'some help' from the U.S. but the arrival of Trump he said changed the equasion. On Iran Netanyahu said that there was no doubt that Iran was pursuing nuclear capability. He said most Arab countries have moved from regarding Israel as their greatest enemy to regarding Iran as such. 'But they recognize that Israel is the only country in the Middle East that fought Iran,' he said. 'In taking action against this we are not only doing it for our own survival but in the interest of many countries in the region and in the interest of the U.S. as well.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy870t11t1l	2025-02-05T21:05:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/SkgbH6WeYkx/SkgbH6WeYkx_0_0_3000_2002_0_small.jpg

After the destruction and the clashes, Hezbollah supporters 'quie...	After clashes with the IDF, Lebanon appears to have gotten the message, and now the residents of the southern villages are returning to their destroyed homes calmly and without provocation; Despite attempts to present a 'victory', Hezbollah brought destruction to the residents; A Lebanese woman recorded herself returning to the ruins, with crying heard in the background This is the second week that residents of southern Lebanon have been returning to their villages on the border, after months of being displaced by fighting. With the end of the first 60 days of the cease-fire, the return was initially accompanied by chaos, provocations and clashes with IDF forces, during which 24 Lebanese citizens were killed and 134 were wounded by gunfire, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. But now it seems that Lebanon has gotten the message, and in the past week things have looked different. The Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported Tuesday that the return of Lebanese civilians to villages in the south of the country last Sunday as part of what was they called the 'second Sunday of return,' passed peacefully, without clashes or deaths, unlike the previous week. This is reportedly due to an implicit agreement between Hezbollah, the Amal movement in Lebanon, and the municipalities in southern Lebanon to control the demonstrators in order to prevent bloodshed. Sources also told the newspaper that UNIFIL conveyed Israeli threats to the Lebanese, who wanted to avoid a repeat of the prior week's violent events. Lebanon closely monitors all IDF movements in the south of the country and consistently reports that it is still operating there, blowing up houses and flying drones in the country's skies. Al-Akhbar and the Al-Manar channel, which is also affiliated with Hezbollah, presented maps of the 'liberated' border villages to which the residents have returned and of the villages where the IDF is still operating. Although Hezbollah boasts about the return of residents of southern Lebanon, including its activists and supporters, and assures that the organization is still strong, the villages of the south have been completely destroyed. Despite attempts in Lebanon to present an image of 'victory' in documenting the return, Hezbollah brought destruction and devastation to the south of the country, destroying the villages it used as weapons depots, and operating and firing at Israel from those populated areas. Hezbollah also operated in other areas of Lebanon, such as Al-Baqa'a in the interior of the country and the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut, but the villages of the south were the main arena of fighting throughout the months of the war. The destruction and devastation in the area are visible every day in footage posted on social media. Alongside the residents' joy at their return, and the Hezbollah flags hoisted alongside pictures of the eliminated operatives, what can mainly be seen is the rubble. Residents of Al-Khaiam, north of Metula, for example, described in a video how they were organized in the field alongside a burning fire and food, but everything around them appears to be destroyed, and the Hezbollah flags placed on the rubble sharpen the question of who is to blame. One of the residents who returned to Al-Dahira in southern Lebanon photographed the ruins of the village, while walking among the fragments of collapsed houses, and said: 'Be careful where you step,' as the sounds of residents crying can be heard in the background.

Its warehouses, infrastructure and weapons were destroyed, its top leadership was eliminated, smuggling routes from Syria were blocked, especially after the overthrow of the Assad regime, and it appears that the organization is in need of extensive reconstruction – both internal and external. The Shiite terrorist organization also needs a lot of financial resources for the assistance it provides to the affected families. Behind the cries of joy of the residents of southern Lebanon these days and the entry into the villages together with the local army, lies great distress. Along with this, it is important to remember that the organization and its surroundings make it clear that they will rebuild everything on the border, and that they have not abandoned their path. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk11p7pbk1l	2025-02-05T13:51:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/S1M2TnXdye/S1M2TnXdye_0_347_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
US requested extradition of hacker who served his time in Israeli...	In 2021, Washington opposed the early release of the 'Ashkelon hacker' but agreed with Israel that he would serve his sentence there; Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s recent extradition request contradicts that agreement Despite a prior understanding, former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently requested the extradition of an Israeli citizen known as the 'Ashkelon hacker' after he was released from prison in Israel and later arrested in Oslo at Washington’s request. An internal document from U.S. prosecutors reveals that as early as 2021, Washington and Jerusalem had agreed that the hacker, now 25, would serve his sentence in Israel for crimes he committed when he was a minor. According to the document, U.S. authorities had opposed his early release but never requested or even considered his extradition without his attorney being informed of the agreement. The hacker, who made hoax bomb threats against Jewish community centers in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Israel ,as well as against several airlines, served seven years in an Israeli prison. The extradition request — particularly coming directly from Blinken – is unprecedented. The newly revealed document corroborates the claim by his attorney, Nir Yaslovitzh, that his client has already served his full sentence and that there is no legal justification for extradition. At this stage, Israeli prosecutors have refused to intervene or assist in securing his release from detention in Norway. The hacker, who has high-functioning autism and a brain tumor, has reportedly suffered a severe mental health decline after more than three months in custody. A letter he personally submitted to a Norwegian court raises concerns about his sanity. Meanwhile, a diplomatic cable from Israel’s Foreign Ministry to its counterpart in Oslo warns of serious risks to his life and well-being. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: These fears are compounded by the fact that he attempted suicide multiple times while incarcerated in Israel. His father and attorney have also criticized Israeli officials for failing to arrange a consular visit. Although the hacker signed a waiver declining such a visit, his family and lawyer argue that his fragile mental state should invalidate that decision. 'His life is in danger,' they stated. Attorney Nir Yaslovitzh condemned the Israeli prosecution's lack of action, saying that it 'is shameful that the International Department refuses to assist my client, even though the U.S. has pursued his extradition arbitrarily and outrageously. A formal document, sent in real-time to Israeli prosecutors, confirms that the U.S. agreed he would serve his sentence solely in Israel — yet nothing has been done to save him.' The case of the Ashkelon hacker first made headlines in 2017 when the FBI issued an unusual request to Israel’s cybercrime unit. Investigators alleged that an Israeli citizen had used false identities and hacked into computer systems at U.S. institutions — including airports, hospitals, and Jewish community centers — to make thousands of fake bomb threats. Some of his threats were so credible that planes were rerouted. Now, years after serving his time, his fate remains uncertain as legal and diplomatic battles continue over his extradition. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkbi6bbykl	2025-02-05T13:15:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/11/22/8898050/8898050_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg
Watch: Israel experiments with new drone interception systems	Nine Israeli defense companies conducted a test of prototype UAV interception systems in southern Israel, addressing the growing drone threat in the ongoing war; 'We will introduce new capabilities to the battlefield in the near future' Defense Minister Katz says Nine Israeli defense companies, including Elbit Systems, Rafael and Israel Aerospace Industries, conducted a live demonstration of drone interception technologies in southern Israel. The drill on Tuesday marked the culmination of a weeklong series of tests led by the Defense Ministry, aimed at evaluating Israel’s ability to counter the growing UAV threat – one that has particularly endangered northern communities in the current war. As part of the competition-style event, defense firms deployed prototype interception systems developed under the guidance of the Defense Ministry’s Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D). The systems were tested against UAVs of varying speeds, altitudes, and ranges. The ministry plans to fast-track select technologies for development and production, with the goal of deploying new operational capabilities in the near future. The closing event was attended by Defense Minister Israel Katz, and other senior officials. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The UAV threat is evolving across multiple fronts, driven by Iran and its proxies,' Katz said.

The Gazan journalist was hired by the network through an external production company to cover activities of the UN's mine clearance service and posted photos of himself with UN officials, sparking a diplomatic incident the UN and Israel, which accused the service of having ties to Hamas; Sky News said that when his problematic past became known, it severed ties with him and the external production company A Gazan journalist affiliated with Hamas, who documented the attack on October 7, was employed by the British Sky News network, sparking a diplomatic incident between Israel and UN peacekeeping forces. The journalist was hired as a photographer for an article about the activities of the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), and he posed for photos with its staff and uploaded the photos to social media. As a result, the Israeli embassy in Washington accused the UN body responsible for mine action of having ties to Hamas. Israeli officials called the event a 'serious scandal' and said that the incident proves once again that UN bodies employ people identified with terrorism. However, Ynet has learned that the journalist is not part of the UN team, but was working for Sky News and was sent to prepare an article about the mine clearance department following the appointment of Luke Irving as the new head of the mine clearance unit in the Palestinian territories. Irving's team is responsible for clearing explosive remnants from the war, to allow Palestinian refugees to return to their homes in Gaza. The network sent an independent camera crew that went with Irving and his team on a tour and interviews in the field. The article appeared on Sky on February 2. The team was unaware of the journalist's background and his ties to Hamas. A spokesman for the UN peacekeeping forces said that 'UNMAS has never had or has had any contact with this individual, and was not provided with any information about him before he came to film for Sky News. He is not an employee of UNMAS.' In a letter sent in recent days by Sky News to the UN and obtained by Ynet, the network apologized and admitted that he had been hired through an external production company. After his problematic past and ties to Hamas became known, contact with him and the production company that employed him was immediately terminated. The network added that they decided not to use the materials filmed by him as part of the article. 'This individual was booked as a camera operator by a third-party production company and was not known to Sky News,' a Sky News spokesperson told Ynet. 'When we were made aware that questions exist about the individual’s impartiality and alleged connections, we immediately made the decision not to air any of the content produced. We have now ended our relationship with the production company.' 'We are reviewing the relevant processes in Gaza and that work is underway internally,' the spokesperson told Ynet.

Israel claims that this is a recurring pattern in which news networks employ media personnel affiliated with Hamas without thoroughly checking their backgrounds. On the other hand, international media outlets claim that working in Gaza requires reliance on local freelancers, due to the difficulty of sending foreign teams to the region. Beyond the media implications, the incident led to further diplomatic tensions between Israel and the UN. In Israel, pressure was exerted on UNMAS to issue a public clarification on the issue and demanded that the organization conduct more rigorous background checks on media personnel who work with it. The Mine Action Service says that they had no knowledge or ability to obtain prior information about the past of employees of another body. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjhwqrztke	2025-02-05T12:15:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/11/S1eX1lOT00a/S1eX1lOT00a_0_94_1300_732_0_small.jpg

On that damned morning that changed all of our lives, Romi was severely shot in her right hand, which did not receive proper treatment in Gaza. She suffered (and still suffers) from unimaginable pain, significant damage to the function of her hand and her quality of life; it is a clear miracle that the hand is still there and that the doctors in our holy land see a prospect of improvement after proper treatment.' 'In the near future, Romi will undergo serious surgery, which will include a long rehabilitation. If you can stay with the group from time to time to pray for her health and complete and speedy recovery I would appreciate it with all my heart.

Trump has not committed to putting US troops in Gaza, White House...	White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt made it clear that the Republican president does not plan to use American tax dollars for his ambitious plan for the Gaza Strip; 'It's an outside-the-box idea,' she said, stressing: 'He is the best dealmaker in the universe' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday evening addressed the surprising statement made by U.S. President Donald Trump at his news conference the previous day with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, in which he spoke about a U.S. takeover of Gaza. President Trump did not commit to sending U.S. troops to Gaza, or to using U.S. taxpayer money to finance the reconstruction of the Strip, she told reporters.

'It’s been made very clear to the president that the United States needs to be involved in this rebuilding effort to ensure stability in the region for all people,' Leavitt said . 'That does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza. That does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort.' 'This is an out-of-the-box idea,' Leavitt added. 'That’s who President Trump is and this is why the American people elected him. His goal is lasting peace in the Middle East for all people in the region.' 'This doesn't mean troops in Gaza, this means that Trump, who is the best dealmaker in the universe, is going to close a deal with our partners in the region,' she said. When asked if she completely ruled out the entry of American troops into Gaza, she replied: 'I am saying that the president has not committed to that just yet. He has not made that commitment.' 'He has made it very clear, he's been very vocal, that he expects our partners in the region, particularly Egypt and Jordan, to accept Palestinian refugees temporarily so that we can rebuild their home,' Leavitt said, noting that he has already spoked with Egyptian President Sisi and will meet next week with King Abdullah of Jordan. 'The president has not committed to it, yet. The president has been thinking about it for a while, it is not a decision he makes lightly. He has already spoken with al-Sisi, he is meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan next week, and he was very clear that he expects them to accept Palestinian refugees temporarily so that we can build their home.

Prosecutor prepares new indictment for Istanbul mayor over critic...	Turkish prosecutors have issued a third indictment against Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu - a potential challenger to President Tayyip Erdogan - for remarks criticizing the city's prosecutor, according to the indictment and local media. The indictment, which seeks to jail Imamoglu and ban him from politics, follows his portrayal of earlier cases against him as part of a campaign of judicial harassment of opposition figures, something Erdogan's government denies. This time, prosecutors requested he be sentenced for threatening and insulting a public official, as well as targeting people involved in the fight against terrorism, the indictment, seen by Reuters, said. Imamoglu said the latest indictment, which seeks to jail him for seven years and four months, showed Erdogan did not have the courage to stand in front of voters in elections. Imamoglu also said Erdogan believed he would 'remain standing through desk-bound games'. Opposition politicians have faced a series of legal challenges in Turkey, where rights groups say judicial independence has eroded under Erdogan's two-decade rule.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhv00fwyyg	2025-02-05T07:59:34-08:00

Israeli professor resigns from Columbia University due to 'anti-I...	Professor Avi Friedman resigned in protest of the institution’s decisions, including the appointment of a pro-Hamas professor to teach a course on Zionism; 'I can no longer be associated with this institution,' Friedman says; The Palestinian professor in question has openly praised Hamas and described the October 7 massacre as 'stunning' and 'impressive' A prominent Israeli-American professor at Columbia University’s Business School has resigned, citing what he described as a 'systematic anti-Israel atmosphere' on campus. In his resignation letter to the university administration, Professor Avi Friedman said his decision stemmed from the university’s handling of events following the October 7 Hamas attack and its appointment of Professor Joseph Massad – who previously described the Hamas assault as 'an impressive achievement' – to teach a course on Zionism. Friedman clarified in an interview with Ynet that the business school itself 'was fine,' but that he took issue with the university’s broader decisions. 'The university has gone out of its way to make bad decisions. Unfortunately, I don’t see how things will change without government intervention. Maybe now, something will start shifting. I hope so,' he said. Friedman is not the first to protest Massad’s appointment. Before him, Professor Lawrence Rosenblatt, a former international relations lecturer at Columbia, also resigned in response to the course’s launch. 'Columbia has a responsibility to teach in an objective and fair manner,' Rosenblatt said. 'It is inconceivable that someone who supports genocide should be allowed to teach such a course. Columbia has lost not only its moral compass but also its intellectual integrity. I cannot remain.' Massad, a longtime professor of Middle Eastern studies at Columbia, has been a controversial figure for years due to his fierce opposition to Israel and Zionism. Born in Jordan to a Palestinian family, he has taught at Columbia since the 1990s, focusing on Arab world politics, Palestinian nationalism and Zionist thought. He has repeatedly argued that Zionism is a 'colonialist movement' and that Israel is an 'apartheid state.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His writings and lectures have drawn criticism from Jewish organizations, members of Congress, and fellow academics. However, Columbia has never taken disciplinary action against him. The latest uproar surrounding Massad erupted following his response to the October 7 Hamas attack. In an article for a pro-Palestinian publication, he praised Hamas for its 'remarkable achievements,' calling the assault 'stunning,' 'impressive' and 'wonderful.' Shortly after, Columbia assigned him to teach a course on Zionism — a decision widely perceived as a provocation against Jewish and Israeli students. Backlash and university response The move sparked outrage from Jewish faculty, alumni and donors, with some threatening to withdraw financial support. A group of pro-Israel Columbia alumni published an open letter to the administration, stating: 'This appointment is like assigning a white supremacist to teach a course on civil rights. How can we be expected to learn about Zionism from someone who does not recognize Israel’s legitimacy?' Despite public pressure, Columbia refused to revoke Massad’s appointment, citing the importance of protecting academic freedom. The university declined to comment when contacted about either Massad’s appointment or Friedman’s resignation, instead referring to a December statement: 'Professor Massad’s statements following the terrorist attack on October 7 created pain for many in our community and contributed to the deep controversy on our campus.

Trump envoy issues unusual threat to Iraqi PM demanding release o...	The US president's envoy for hostage affairs has issued an implicit threat to the Iraqi prime minister, calling for the release of the Israeli woman kidnapped in his country. 'Either he is incapable, or he is an accomplice in the kidnapping,' Adam Buehler said U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Buehler, called on Wednesday for the immediate release of the Israeli woman kidnapped in Iraq, Elizabeth Tsurkov. On behalf of the U.S. president, Buehler threatened Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani. 'If she doesn't come home, he is an accomplice,' he said. Buehler said that 'Elizabeth Tsurkov is a Princeton University student who is being held hostage in Iraq. The Iraqi prime minister consistently made false promises to the previous administration about her release, but now President Trump is on it. If Tsurkov doesn't come home now - either the Iraqi prime minister is unable to return her, then he should be fired, or he is complicit in this (kidnapping). Bring Elizabeth Tsurkov home now!' The coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen (res.) Gal Hirsch, met with Buehler in Washington on Tuesday night. The two discussed, among other things, the Gaza hostage deal. After the meeting, Hirsch posted on the X network that 'in the meeting we discussed the hostage deal and ways to return all of our hostages, both living and dead.' Tsurkov, 36, is an Israeli national with Russian citizenship who had been living in the United States while pursuing a Ph.D. at Princeton University. She was abducted in Baghdad on March 26, 2023, during a research trip. While Kataib Hezbollah is widely believed to be holding her, the militia has denied involvement in her abduction.

Three Iraqi sources close to the pro-Iranian militias in the country later denied the reports, claiming: 'There are no channels with the Israeli enemy.' They also claimed that they first heard about it through the media. The sources also denied previous reports that the Iraqi government was working to free her. One of the sources asked in response, 'Do they even know where she is? Who she is with? How could they act?' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkvisbbfkx	2025-02-05T07:26:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/06/rkkLYCXFh/rkkLYCXFh_0_194_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Buehler said that 'the Iraqi prime minister consistently made false promises to the previous U.S. administration regarding her release, but now Trump is handling it.'

Qatar says it is too early to talk about Palestinian displacement	Qatar, a mediator in Gaza cease-fire talks, said on Wednesday it was too early to talk about the resettlement of Palestinians from the enclave and Doha was busy trying to bring about the second phase of a deal to halt the war between Israel and Hamas. Asked by Fox News if Trump's proposal for a U.S. takeover of Gaza would help or hurt the ceasefire talks, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari said: 'I don't think it's a time now to start commenting on specific ideas. We know that there is a lot of trauma with the Palestinian side when it comes to displacement. However, again, it's too early to talk about this, because we don't know how this war will end.' Qatar, alongside the United States and Egypt, brokered a deal between Israel and Hamas that halted the 15-month-long war in the Palestinian enclave. Al-Ansari also said that Qatar is ready to mediate between the Trump administration and Iran for the stability of the whole region. 'We believe in President Trump as a deal maker,' Al-Ansari said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjgmu11zkyx	2025-02-05T06:50:09-08:00	
Evacuation of Greece's Santorini island continues as tremors pers...	Hundreds more people were expected to leave Greece's Santorini island on Wednesday as tremors shook the popular summer tourist destination for a sixth day. About 10,000 people have left on ferries and planes in recent days as hundreds of small quakes were registered in the surrounding sea, shaking buildings, kicking up dust on the island's rocky cliffs, and raising fears of a major earthquake. Authorities have introduced safety measures, including halting construction, shutting schools on Santorini and the nearby islands of Ios, Amorgos and Anafi, and ordering residents and hotels to empty their pools to reduce the burden on the ground. Government officials and seismologists who met on Wednesday to assess the situation pointed to a high risk of landslides, including near the island's main port Athinios which serves some 1.5 million passengers a year. Local authorities have restricted access to some high risk areas, while first responders, vessels and a helicopter were on alert in case of emergency. Seismologists estimate that the high seismic activity could take days or weeks to abate, although locals and government officials said the shaking had lessened on Wednesday	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkyhvbzy1e	2025-02-05T06:46:49-08:00	
Flowers and flags: Liri, Karina, Naama and Daniella go home; Thou...	The IDF field observers who were freed from Hamas captivity leave the hospital; Agam Berger will receive additional care elsewhere; For 477 days they faced hell in Hamas captivity in Gaza, and after receiving initial treatment at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva, on Wednesday Liri Albag , Karina Ariev , Naama Levy and Daniella Gilboa returned to their homes. 'We would like to thank the people of Israel for the warmth and love that the girls and we receive,' said a statement from the families of the observers who were kidnapped on October 7 from the Nahal Oz outpost. Agam Berger , who was released from Hamas captivity five days after her friends, was transferred for further treatment to the Maccabiah Village in Ramat Gan. In Moshav Yarhiv in ​​Sharon, hundreds welcomed Liri Albag. They had prepared bouquets of flowers and Israeli flags in advance and cheered Liri upon her arrival. Chani Duke and Yael Oz, who were waiting for Liri near her house, said: 'At one of the marches, we met Eli, Liri's father. We told him that we were all waiting and that we would welcome her here, and now the moment has come and Liri will soon be coming to us.' Einat Landis, principal of the Ami Assaf School in Beit Berl, where Liri studied, said: 'This is an exciting day for all of us. We prayed for the moment when Liri would return.' Eli Albag drove the car down the street slowly, and mother Shira, who was sitting next to Liri in the back, waved her hands. 'Thank you very much, everyone, you are amazing citizens,' said Eli. 'We have all been waiting for this moment, I love you very much. You have given me a lot of strength. Liri is home and that is the most important thing, but there is still a long way to go.' Liri's father added: 'We must press to bring all of the hostages, the living and the dead, we must return them all. Liri needs peace and that is important to her. We are protecting her, she now wants to fight for her friends who are still in captivity.' Shira Albag said: 'We must return all of the hostages. We were privileged to receive Liri, we need our peace to continue the rehabilitation. Thank you very much, people of Israel.' Liri herself waved from the car and entered her house in tears. Naama Levy arrived at her home in Raanana . Yoni, Naama's father, stopped the car in front of those gathered to greet her - and she smiled and waved at them. 'We are happy and excited to come home. Naama was very excited about everything that was done for her here,' Naama's father said after she entered her home. Efrat Brumer, one of the people who came out for Naama, said: 'I returned from the Navot school and saw all the people gathering and my heart was filled with happiness. I pulled the car over and decided to come and pay my respects to her on the occasion of her return. We are full of excitement and so happy and thank God that she is with us, healthy and safe. May you have nothing but success from now on.' Hundreds of people arrived near the apartment building in Petah Tikva where Daniella Gilboa lives to welcome her. Daniella made a heart sign with her hands and shouted from the vehicle in which she rode with her parents and sister. 'Am Yisrael Chai.' Adults, young people, secular and religious carried signs congratulating Daniella and waved Israeli flags. 'We are happy that Daniella is finally coming home,' said one of them. 'Despite the cold, the wind and the rain, we came to welcome her and maybe get to see her and her smile.' In Jerusalem, hundreds welcomed Karina Ariev. her sister, Sasha, said outside the house: 'Thank you to the people of Israel who came to accompany us here, to welcome Karina. I remind you that we have 79 more kidnapped people who must return. We will not stop fighting until the last of them returns to the land of Israel, to be here with us. The living for rehabilitation and the murdered for burial.' Sasha added: 'I want to thank our heroic soldiers who fought and continue to fight endlessly day and night, and thanks to them we stand here. They sacrificed their lives and we do not forget them. I want to tell the bereaved families, the injured and the wounded that we are with them and you are not alone. We thank the entire world that was with us and the beautiful people of Israel.' 'We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Beilinson Hospital and the staff who treated our daughters, the five female observers who were returned from Hamas captivity after 477 days, with admirable dedication,' the relatives of the female observers said. 'For the past 10 days since our daughters returned, the girls have been in a private, closed compound within Schneider Hospital, where they were treated professionally and sensitively, with the utmost consideration for their special situation.'

Amir Avivi, chairman of the Israel Defense And Security Forum, voiced on Wednesday support for U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to evacuate Gaza, arguing that many Gazans want to leave but have been prevented from doing so. Speaking at the Piecing Together the Fragments conference hosted by Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, Avivi claimed that even before the war, surveys showed 'staggering percentages' of Palestinians in Gaza wished to emigrate but were blocked from leaving. 'The borders were closed, they weren’t allowed to exit, and they were left trapped in a war zone,' he said. Avivi suggested that Trump’s role should be to insist that border crossings be opened, allowing those who seek a better life to leave. 'All President Trump needs to do is stand firm on opening the borders and giving people the opportunity for a better future,' he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj11kykztje	2025-02-05T04:35:25-08:00

The Palestinian people will never abandon their land': Palestini...	Palestinian leaders reject Trump’s Gaza evacuation plan as 'violation of international law' and attack on sovereignty; Egypt opposes move, ramping up reconstruction to prevent displacement, while Hamas warns it will further destabilize the region Palestinian leaders reacted with shock Wednesday to U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to evacuate Gaza’s population, rejecting the plan as an unacceptable violation of Palestinian rights. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 'categorically rejected calls for the takeover of Gaza and the forced displacement of Palestinians,' vowing that 'the Palestinian people will never abandon their land—Gaza is an inseparable part of it.' Abbas called Trump’s remarks 'a grave breach of international law' and reiterated that peace and stability in the region would not be possible 'without the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders.' A statement from Abbas’ office reaffirmed appreciation for 'the firm and consistent Arab positions against displacement and annexation' and emphasized that the creation of a Palestinian state remains 'a fundamental requirement for peace in the region.' Abbas traveled to Jordan on Thursday to discuss with King Abdullah ways to 'block Trump’s proposal.' Hussein al-Sheikh, Secretary-General of the PLO Executive Committee, echoed Abbas’ stance, saying 'a two-state solution under international legitimacy and law is the only path to security, stability and peace.' He dismissed any plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza, adding, 'We were born here, we have lived here and we reject all attempts to uproot us.' Hamas also strongly condemned Trump’s statements, calling them an attempt to 'occupy Gaza and expel its people.' A Hamas spokesperson said the remarks were 'hostile to the Palestinian cause and would only inflame the region.' Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri warned that Trump’s claim that Gazans 'have no choice but to leave' was 'a recipe for chaos in the Middle East.' Another senior Hamas figure, Izzat al-Rishq, vowed that Palestinians would resist any forced displacement, s, 'Oayingur people in Gaza have thwarted expulsion plans under bombardment for over 15 months. They are rooted in their land and will not allow any plan to remove them.' Israeli Arab lawmakers also denounced Trump’s proposal. MK Mansour Abbas of the United Arab List (Ra'am) dismissed it as 'not a policy but a racist fantasy that normalizes the unacceptable.' He warned, 'Forced transfer cannot happen without war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: MK Ahmad Tibi called Trump’s remarks 'dangerous delusions,' adding, 'Palestinians will remain in their homeland. Trump, like every president, will not remain in the White House forever.' Egypt, one of the strongest opponents of Trump’s plan, has been working to counter it by accelerating Gaza’s reconstruction. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel Ati met with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on Wednesday, urging 'fast-tracked humanitarian aid, debris removal and rehabilitation efforts—without displacing Palestinians from Gaza.' Abdel Ati reaffirmed Egypt’s full support for the Palestinian government and stressed the need to 'strengthen the Palestinian Authority politically and economically.' During a visit to Turkey, he and his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan called for intensified international efforts to 'ease suffering in Gaza while ensuring Palestinians remain on their land.' A weekend meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Egypt ended with a joint statement emphasizing 'rebuilding Gaza in a way that ensures Palestinians remain on their land.' The ministers declared, 'Palestinian displacement is rejected—under any circumstances.' Egypt has consistently opposed any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, citing security, economic and political concerns. Cairo fears that an influx of Palestinians into Sinai could pose a national security risk, particularly by allowing armed elements to infiltrate its territory. Additionally, Egypt’s struggling economy makes absorbing a large refugee population unsustainable. Despite this opposition, over 100,000 Palestinians have already entered Egypt since the start of the war. 'Trump can pave the sea' Many in Gaza have reacted coolly to Trump’s proposal, with some blaming Hamas for creating the conditions that led to the plan being discussed. Mustafa Ibrahim, a Palestinian writer from Gaza whose home was destroyed in the war, dismissed Trump’s idea outright. 'Far from Trump’s slogans and threats—he doesn’t recognize the Palestinian people or the injustices they have endured since 1967. But we are staying here. The people of Gaza will not leave,' he said. 'Trump can pave the sea if he wants—that’s all he has.' Dr. Samith Shataat, a school principal from Khan Younis, questioned Trump’s thinking. 'We can no longer understand this man’s personality,' he said. 'He thinks outside the box, sometimes too far. His ideas feel like pure fantasy—either dreams or explosions. All he sees is money, real estate, investments, stocks and markets. It’s time for us Arabs, especially Palestinians, to think carefully about how to confront this imminent danger. We must wake up before it’s too late.' Meanwhile, a Gazan now living in Europe—who fled after surviving an assassination attempt by Hamas due to his opposition to the group—suggested that Trump’s plan could work under certain conditions. 'If the Trump administration and Israel, along with countries like Belgium, Cyprus and Turkey—where there are large Palestinian communities—facilitate family reunifications, it could immediately remove nearly 300,000 people from Gaza,' he said. Prominent Gazan social media influencer Mohammed Al-Attar criticized Hamas for its role in the crisis. 'We were thinking about post-war reconstruction, and now we’re facing total displacement,' he said. 'Whoever drowned us in this ‘flood’ must be the one to pull us out of it—even if they sink themselves,' he added to the Hamas-given name to the October 7 attack—'al-Aqsa Flood.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkuhqkbkjl	2025-02-05T04:26:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/HkAKhngY1l/HkAKhngY1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Why the world can’t ignore Iran’s nuclear ambitions any longer	Avi Mayer: ‘I think it is certainly possible that they're going to fast-track a path to some kind of crude nuclear weapon’ The world should take seriously the possibility that Iran is fast-tracking the development of a crude nuclear weapon, which could give the regime leverage against the West, said Avi Mayer, former editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post and a regular Middle East analyst. Mayer told the ILTV News Podcast, 'I don't know that Iran has ever felt as cornered as it does now. Its proxy army has been decimated. Almost all of its proxies have been smashed to smithereens. It still has the Houthis, but they are relatively weak compared to the others. So, I wouldn't put it past them to say we need leverage, we need a strategic advantage, and that can only come in the form of a nuclear weapon.' His remarks came on the same day a report emerged indicating that U.S. officials believe Iran is accelerating its nuclear program, aiming to develop a weapon 'faster,' albeit in a 'cruder' form. 'I don't take those reports lightly,' Mayer said. 'I think it is certainly possible that they're going to fast-track a path to some kind of crude nuclear weapon to be able to say, ‘We are still a player to be reckoned with, and you have to take us seriously.’' While some analysts argue that the Iranian regime is more rational than it appears and that its threats are merely rhetorical, Mayer warned against underestimating the seriousness of Tehran’s ambitions. 'Whether or not they intend to use it, I have to assume that they will,' he said. 'We have to prevent them from reaching that capability.' Watch previous ILTV News Podcast episodes: MK Amit Halevi: Hostage deal will rehabilitate Nazi monster Hamas This country is the world's least antisemitic – can you guess where? Rising Antisemitism in the U.S. During the same discussion, Mayer also addressed the alarming rise in antisemitism, particularly in the United States. He noted that antisemitism surged during the first term of former U.S. President Donald Trump and has continued to escalate, particularly since the start of the October 7 war. 'Antisemitism tends to manifest itself at times of great polarization and, agree with him or disagree with him, that was one of the markings of President Trump's first term,' Mayer observed. 'It was a very polarizing period in American history, and I don't think that that is going to change in this term.' He added that antisemitic sentiments, which may have previously existed under the surface, have been emboldened in recent years. 'It has been given sort of a free rein,' he said. 'Now, with a 16-month war raging on seven fronts, many antisemites have used Israel’s response to October 7 and the war itself as a pretext to let their hate be more publicly known.' One of the most dangerous developments, Mayer stressed, is the growing politicization of antisemitism in the U.S. 'The worst thing that can happen in the fight against antisemitism is that it becomes a political issue,' he said. 'I think it should supersede politics. To the extent that Democrats, Republicans, and independents can come together to fight this scourge—not just in one another’s camps but in their own—that is absolutely critical.' Mayer expressed concern that both major political parties have failed to sufficiently address the issue within their ranks. 'I think we haven't seen enough of that,' he continued. 'It's very easy for Democrats to point at the Republican Party and say, ‘You have an antisemitism problem,’ and for Republicans to do the same to Democrats. I don't see nearly enough Republicans fighting antisemitism on their side of the political map, and I don't see nearly enough Democrats doing the same.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy4zhpxkke	2025-02-05T04:12:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/HJjDpzpOJg/HJjDpzpOJg_0_194_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Trump rejects Iran strike reports, pushes for new nuclear deal	Trump denies reports of US-Israel strike on Iran, saying he prefers 'verified nuclear peace agreement' to prevent nuclear arms while allowing Iran to prosper; despite pushing diplomacy, he reinstates tough sanctions, which Tehran calls failed policy U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday dismissed reports that Washington, in coordination with Israel, was planning a military strike on Iran, signaling instead his preference for a renewed nuclear agreement with Tehran. 'Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens, ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon... I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East! Trump’s comments follow his statement Tuesday that he was open to negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran and even willing to speak directly with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Such a move, if realized, would be highly unusual and reminiscent of the historic 2013 phone call between then-President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani—the first direct communication between U.S. and Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi responded Wednesday, saying Washington’s concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions were 'not complicated' and could be addressed. He reiterated Iran’s longstanding position that it does not seek nuclear weapons, pointing to the country’s membership in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and a fatwa issued by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei prohibiting nuclear weapons. Araghchi also criticized Trump’s decision to reinstate his 'maximum pressure' sanctions policy, arguing that it had already failed during Trump’s previous term. 'If this failed policy is pursued again, it is destined to fail once more,' he said. Despite signaling openness to diplomacy, Trump on Tuesday signed a presidential memorandum reinstating sweeping economic sanctions on Iran, aimed at crippling its economy and forcing Tehran to abandon any nuclear ambitions. The sanctions particularly target Iran’s oil revenues, a critical source of funding for the regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While signing the order, Trump acknowledged the severity of the measure, stating that he had deliberated extensively before reimposing the sanctions. Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani, when asked about Trump’s openness to talks with Pezeshkian, responded that Iran’s foreign policy has always been guided by 'principles of national honor, wisdom, and strategic interests.' Meanwhile, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Wednesday dismissed U.S. accusations that Tehran had plotted to assassinate Trump. Last year, U.S. security officials reported the arrests of several suspects allegedly linked to an Iranian plot targeting Trump. On Tuesday, Trump warned that he had instructed his team to 'destroy Iran' if such an attempt were successful. The Iranian spokesperson rejected the allegations as 'fabricated ideas spread by warmongers.' Israeli officials had been aware before Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump that the former U.S. president was hesitant to use military force against Iran, according to Israeli sources. Trump had repeatedly emphasized that he 'would not start new wars.' As a result, Israeli leaders focused their efforts on urging Trump to reinstate crippling sanctions on Tehran—a request he ultimately granted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1fkjaef1l	2025-02-05T03:45:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/B1ZxwpMeYyl/B1ZxwpMeYyl_0_68_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Settlers hail Trump’s Gaza plan as end of Palestinian statehood	US president's proposal to evacuate Gaza and promote Palestinian emigration embraced by settler leaders, who see it as a historic chance to advance Israeli sovereignty in West Bank The plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to empty Gaza of its residents and take control of the enclave was widely welcomed by right-wing politicians and local West Bank leaders. 'This is a rare moment for historic actions—to apply sovereignty in the West Bank,' said Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council. Yisrael Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council and chairman of the Yesha Council settler lobby, added: 'The Palestinian vision has come to an end.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and MK Itamar Ben-Gvir also quickly voiced their support. The settlers, for the most part, are less focused on the Gaza Strip itself and are instead setting their sights on what they consider a historic event—the application of Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank. Dagan argues that 'the new administration is acting strategically in the opposite way of the previous administration, and it will respect what the Israeli government defines as critical to Israel’s security.' 'I call on the prime minister: this is the time to apply sovereignty in the West Bank,' he further said. 'President Trump’s declaration is clear and exciting—both regarding the encouragement of emigration from Gaza and the strategic importance of the State of Israel. Such things have never been said in such a direct and transparent manner. The world is divided into two sides: good and evil, and Trump has chosen the right side of history.' Gantz also praised 'the great news that Trump is bringing to Israel and the entire world, standing alongside the Jewish people and its historic values.' He added, 'For the first time, a president is essentially declaring the end of the Palestinian dream to destroy Israel through Gaza or by establishing a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel. The Palestinian story, which aims to uproot the Jewish people from their land, is over.' 'The Israeli government must adopt Trump’s vision today and translate it into action,' he continued. 'Applying sovereignty over the West Bank is the necessary action now, completing Trump’s vision and turning it into reality. I urge Prime Minister Netanyahu to advance this immediately.' Shai Alon, head of the Beit El Council, also called on Netanyahu 'to promote immediate operational plans to apply sovereignty in the West Bank' and said, 'This is a moral obligation to the settlers, and it does not depend on other factors.' 'Residents of the West Bank are not second-class citizens in Israel,' he added. 'Their living conditions are no different than any other citizen in the country, and they cannot be treated as bargaining chips in such deals. Sovereignty over the West Bank should have been implemented 50 years ago and settlers should not have been left without equal status in Israel.' The heads of the Israel Lobby, MKs Yuli Edelstein, Limor Son Har-Melech and Simcha Rothman, said: 'President Trump once again proved his unwavering and courageous commitment to the Jewish people. His declaration is another significant step toward cutting off aspirations for a Palestinian terror state. The State of Israel has woken up this morning to a new and historic day.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also expressed his gratitude, saying: 'Then the nations said, ‘The Lord has done great things for them.’ The Lord has done great things for us; we were joyful.' In a post on his account on platform X, he quoted a popular Israeli song by Sasson Shaulov and wrote: 'And it will get better and better. Thank you, President Trump. Together, we will make the world great again.' Ben-Gvir took to social media to voice his support for Trump, writing, 'Donald, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' The Otzma Yehudit chief, who had resigned from the government following the hostage release deal, said that when he proposed encouraging the emigration of Palestinians, he was mocked. 'President Trump is saying very important things: the only solution for Gaza is encouraging the emigration of Gazans. When I repeatedly said during the war that this was the solution for Gaza, they mocked me.' He added, 'Now it’s clear—this is the only solution to the Gaza problem—this is the strategy for the 'day after.' I call on the prime minister to announce the adoption of the plan and begin advancing it immediately in a practical manner.' Later, Ben-Gvir told Galey Israel radio: 'I haven’t tailored a new ministerial suit yet, but there’s no doubt that the chances of Otzma Yehudit returning to the government have increased. The ball is now in the prime minister’s court. If he implements this plan, I’m fully on board. The moment steps are taken, and there’s intent to execute, I’m back. I don’t want to elaborate too much, but there are already plans in place.' Settlers now view the goal of sovereignty as their ultimate objective, alongside thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state by any means. With Trump’s entry into the White House, they outlined several objectives, including removing sanctions, significant leeway in settlement construction processes, sovereignty in the West Bank, and initiating settlement in northern Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1fhmteykl	2025-02-05T03:14:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/SylnchlYye/SylnchlYye_0_277_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Iran is ready to give the United States a chance to resolve disputes between the arch-foes, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump restored his 'maximum pressure' campaign on the country. The official said Tehran disagreed with 'any displacement of Gazans, but Iran-U.S. talks are a separate matter', referring to Trump's remarks that the U.S. would take over war-ravaged Gaza and create a 'Riviera of the Middle East' after resettling Palestinians elsewhere. 'Iran does not agree with any displacement of Palestinians and has communicated this through various channels. However, this issue and the path of Iran's nuclear agreement are two separate matters and should be pursued separately,' the official said. The official said Tehran wanted the United States to 'rein in Israel if Washington is seeking a deal' with the Islamic Republic.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkinopxkye	2025-02-05T02:28:55-08:00	
Trump kept Gaza relocation plan tightly under wraps, report says	Wall Street Journal reports officials outside Trump’s inner circle were unaware of Gaza relocation plan before meeting with Netanyahu; him calling Gaza 'the Riviera of the Middle East' harks back to failed 2018 real estate pitch to North Korea U.S. President Donald Trump kept his sweeping Gaza relocation plan tightly under wraps, sharing it only with his closest advisers before unveiling it publicly, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. According to two senior administration officials, the proposal for full U.S. control of Gaza and the removal of its population was kept in 'absolute secrecy' within Trump’s inner circle. The report also revealed that even some of Trump’s staunchest pro-Israel supporters were blindsided. A longtime donor who had fundraised for Trump for years was quoted as calling the idea 'crazy' and warned that it involved 'too many unpredictable factors.' During a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump doubled down on his vision, proposing a full-scale redevelopment of Gaza: 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too... We will be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, [for] get[ting] rid of the destroyed buildings, level[ing] it out, creat[ing] an economy development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing to the people of the area.' He did not rule out deploying U.S. troops, adding, 'As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that.' Trump further justified his plan by portraying Gaza as unlivable, saying: 'Gaza has been a source of destruction and misery. The people there should go elsewhere. Many of them want to leave. 1.8 million Gazans need to go.' He suggested wealthy regional nations should fund the relocation, saying, 'They can go to one place, or seven, or 12. We will make sure something incredible happens. There will be peace—no more rockets, no more killing, no more destruction.' CNN analysts noted similarities between Trump’s Gaza proposal and his 2018 pitch to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. At their summit, Trump had presented Kim with a promotional video showcasing a futuristic skyline and suggested that Pyongyang could trade its nuclear ambitions for real estate development. 'North Koreans have beautiful beaches,' Trump said at the time. 'Instead of testing missiles over the water, they could have the world’s best hotels.' That proposal was ultimately rejected, and U.S.-North Korea negotiations stalled. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gaza was also a point of discussion in March 2023 when Trump’s son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner suggested Israel relocate Gaza’s Palestinian population. 'Gaza’s coastline holds significant economic value,' Kushner had said at the time, sparking controversy. Palestinian leaders swiftly condemned Trump’s proposal. Hamas issued a statement saying, 'We strongly denounce the U.S. president’s remarks aimed at occupying Gaza and expelling our people. His statements are hostile and will only fuel instability in the region.' Hussein al-Sheikh, Secretary-General of the PLO Executive Committee, reaffirmed the Palestinian Authority’s rejection of any displacement plan. 'The leadership stands firm: a two-state solution under international legitimacy is the path to security, stability, and peace. We were born here, we live here, and we reject all attempts to uproot us.' Saudi Arabia, which has been central to reports of a broader regional normalization deal involving Israel, also distanced itself from Trump’s plan. Riyadh reaffirmed its longstanding stance, stating: 'Saudi Arabia will not establish relations with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state.' The kingdom also rejected Trump’s proposal to relocate Gaza’s population, declaring: 'We oppose any attempt to transfer Palestinians from their land. Our position on Palestinian rights is non-negotiable.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ignheyyx	2025-02-05T01:47:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/ByrOteulYyx/ByrOteulYyx_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Resurrected? Hamas shot-callers keep reappearing despite IDF clai...	Senior Hamas commanders previously declared eliminated by IDF reemerge, raising doubts about intelligence accuracy; 'Evaluating strike results is not always 100% accurate,' security official says On December 3, 2023, IDF announced the elimination of al-Shati Battalion commander Haytham al-Khawajri. However, this past Saturday, he appeared at the 'release ceremony' for Keith Siegel, photographed himself with 'his soldiers,' and roamed freely without attempting to conceal his identity. This marks at least the third instance where a senior Hamas commander, whom Israel had claimed to have eliminated, reappeared later. The IDF and Shin Bet admitted the embarrassing mistake, explaining that their earlier announcement was based on intelligence that has now been proven inaccurate. This incident follows footage from last month showing the commander of Hamas' Beit Hanoun Battalion, Hussein Fayyad, attending a funeral in northern Gaza. This occurred after IDF claimed he had been eliminated in Jabaliya in May. At the time, the IDF reported Fayyad was responsible for numerous anti-tank missile operations launched into Israeli territory during the war, as well as mortar fire targeting northern border communities. At the funeral, Fayyad spoke about 'Gaza’s victory over the IDF in the war.' His statements confirm the footage was recent and filmed after the cease-fire. The reappearance of the Beit Hanoun Battalion commander—one of Hamas’ weaker battalions—again forced the IDF and Shin Bet to admit they were mistaken and that the intelligence about his death in an Air Force strike was incorrect. A similar incident occurred with the commander of Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan neighborhood, Mahmoud Hamdan, who also served as a bodyguard for slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Hamdan was reportedly killed in a skirmish with IDF troops about 220 yards from the location where the Hamas leader himself was killed in September 2024. The IDF had announced that Hamdan and the rest of the Tel al-Sultan Battalion’s leadership were eliminated in an Air Force strike. However, following Sinwar’s elimination, it became clear that this intelligence was inaccurate, as Hamdan survived until he was killed in another confrontation later. 'There’s a chance we’ll see more Hamas commanders we thought we had eliminated suddenly reappear,' admit security officials. 'Sometimes even Hamas itself doesn’t know the outcome of an attack targeting one of their commanders, and the process of evaluating strike results is not always 100% accurate. Some were targeted inside tunnels or buildings that collapsed on their occupants.' The IDF officially announced throughout the war that over 100 senior Hamas commanders had been eliminated. These included company, battalion and brigade commanders, as well as top organizational leaders like Mohammed Deif, Marwan Issa and Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in a clash with Israeli infantry and armored forces in Rafah. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite the intelligence lapses revealed in the past month, Hamas still retains senior commanders across Gaza who play a key role in rebuilding the organization, which continues to rule Gaza in the absence of an alternative. Besides Mohammed Sinwar, who likely replaced his brother as Hamas leader, other prominent field commanders remain alive, including at least two brigade commanders: Mohammed Shabana of Rafah and Izz al-Din Haddad of Gaza City. It is reasonable to assume that the higher the rank of the commander, the more resources—including extensive bomb payloads and intelligence efforts—are invested to ensure their elimination. In this context, Israel has been cautious about immediately announcing the results of targeted strikes on senior Hamas or Hezbollah commanders. Often, days or even weeks pass before the verification process is complete, as both terror organizations deliberately delay confirming whether their commanders have been killed. At the same time, many IDF commanders criticized the seemingly astronomical numbers of terrorists, including field commanders, that security officials claimed had been eliminated during the war. 'The public was told that a brigade-level combat team eliminated around 60 terrorists in Beit Lahia within a week or 150 in Shijaiyah, for example, without full verification. Battalion and brigade commanders, when you speak with them, are honest enough to add a disclaimer: ‘Of those, X were confirmed killed by sight, and the rest are based on informed estimates,’' IDF sources recalled from the war. 'There were also cases of Gazans, including many unarmed civilians, running in the streets or in combat zones where civilians were not supposed to be. We fired at them, hit them and saw them fall from afar, assuming they were terrorists. These were added to the daily enemy casualty assessment under the ‘neutralized’ category—without anyone verifying who they were, or even whether they were killed or only wounded.' Regardless, Israeli officials acknowledge that by the time the cease-fire began, Hamas still had at least 10,000 armed operatives remaining out of the approximately 30,000 it had on October 7. Among them are commanders, in addition to the hundreds of new operatives who were hastily recruited and trained in recent weeks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1olycef1e	2025-02-05T00:23:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/yk14248891/yk14248891_0_58_572_323_0_small.jpg

'Trump's remarks about his desire to control Gaza are ridiculous and absurd, and any ideas of this kind are capable of igniting the region,' Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters. Joining him was Izzat al-Rishq, another senior Hamas official, who also sharply criticized Trump’s remarks. 'Our people in Gaza have thwarted displacement and expulsion plans under bombardment for more than 15 months. Our people are rooted in their land and will not allow any plan to remove them from it,' he said. Meanwhile, senior Hamas Politburo member Mousa Abu Marzouk told Russia's RIA state news agency that the group was 'ready for contact and talks with the Trump administration.' 'In the past, we did not object to contacts with the administration of (former U.S. President Joe) Biden, Trump or any other U.S. administration, and we are open to talks with all international parties.' It was not clear when RIA interviewed Marzouk, who was visiting Moscow on Monday for talks with the Russian foreign ministry. Marzouk told RIA that talks with the U.S. have become a kind of necessity for Hamas, considering that Washington is a key player in the Middle East.

US top diplomat Rubio backs Trump plan on US takeover of Gaza	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio late on Tuesday appeared to back President Donald Trump's plan for a U.S. takeover of Gaza, saying the Palestinian enclave must be free from Islamist group Hamas. Trump on Tuesday proposed a U.S. takeover of Gaza where Israel's military assault in the last 16 months has killed tens of thousands, after he earlier suggested that Palestinians in the enclave should be permanently displaced. The idea was condemned by experts and rights advocates. Trump's earlier comments that Palestinians should move to Egypt and Jordan were already rejected publicly by Palestinian leaders and leaders of the Arab world while being condemned by human rights advocates as amounting to a proposal of ethnic cleansing. 'Gaza MUST BE FREE from Hamas. As @POTUS shared today, the United States stands ready to lead and Make Gaza Beautiful Again,' Rubio said on X. 'Our pursuit is one of lasting peace in the region for all people.' While Trump had floated suggestions of Palestinian displacement since Jan. 25, statements issued since by Rubio's State Department on its websites after the top U.S. diplomat's subsequent calls with regional leaders did not explicitly mention Trump's suggestion. Trump did not offer much detail in his Tuesday proposal. Rubio's post also did not elaborate further.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/synkvoly1e	2025-02-04T20:29:03-08:00

Speaking on ILTV’s Insider, Wilf said, 'The prime minister has to accept that the whole operation in Gaza was mismanaged, that he failed, and that he needs to cut his losses.' She urged Netanyahu to 'ransom' the kidnapped individuals through the current hostage-for-ceasefire deal and get them out of Gaza. 'Enough with the drip, drip, week after week of operations,' Wilf said. Once the hostages are freed, she argued, Israel should shift focus to 'the actual war that should have been fought.' Watch previous episodes of Insider: Will Trump’s Return Rewrite Middle East History? Netanyahu or Hamas: Who’s Really to Blame for the Ceasefire Delays? Wilf explained that the October 7 attack was not just perpetrated by Hamas but 'the Palestinian ideology of no Jewish state.' She described Hamas as 'merely the executive arm' of this ideology and said Netanyahu must now fight 'the actual war that should have been waged 15 years ago' to dismantle the belief system preventing peace. While Iran is often viewed as Israel’s greatest existential threat, Wilf argued that it is only the most recent backer of Palestinianism. She pointed to past supporters, including the Nazis, pan-Arabists, and the Soviets. 'If Iran falls, Turkey or Qatar will take its place,' she warned. 'The Ayatollah regime will fall because all previous supporters of Palestinianism have always ended in the dustbin of history—unfortunately, not before causing a lot of damage to the Jewish people,' Wilf said. She criticized Netanyahu for avoiding the core issue. 'If you're not going to deal directly with the enemy and keep running away to projects that you feel are more appropriate to your station, you're not going to deal with the real threat,' she said. Jonathan Pollard: Iran is capable of anything However, during the same discussion, former American intelligence analyst Jonathan Pollard, now a vocal figure in Israeli affairs, argued that while Palestinianism may be the root issue, Iran’s immediate nuclear ambitions remain a top concern. A report released this week indicated that Iran is exploring a fast-track path to developing nuclear weapons. 'When you have a wounded totalitarian regime that understands it’s lost the support of its people, they’re capable of anything at that point,' Pollard told ILTV. 'The trick is to defuse their nuclear threat, bring down the government, and allow a popular uprising to occur without destroying the country.' He suggested that Israel has 'technical' capabilities to cripple Iran’s leadership. 'I've already been very public about our need to use a nuclear weapon—an electromagnetic pulse weapon,' Pollard said. An electromagnetic bomb detonated high in the air would short out all electronic systems, including those crucial to Iran’s nuclear program. 'Electronic centrifuges do not spin unless they have electricity, and once you've destroyed the regime’s ability to control their police, security services, and armies, a popular uprising can occur,' Pollard explained. Not everyone agrees with his approach. 'I think using a nuclear weapon is absolutely something of the absolute last resort,' stressed author and analyst Ilan Evyatar. He argued that before Israel takes action, it should give newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump a chance to impose sanctions and pressure the regime. However, he acknowledged that by then, if intelligence reports are correct, Iran may already have a nuclear weapon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rktwsuef1g	2025-02-04T18:43:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/BkllXXeFJe/BkllXXeFJe_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Trump says US will take ownership of Gaza; Netanyahu calls it 'A ...	U.S. president says he 'sees long-term ownership' of Gaza; 'We will be responsible for Gaza, we will remove the dangerous bombs and the destroyed houses, it's a great idea,' he said; Netanyahu says 'Israel will end the war by winning the war' Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a joint press conference at the White House Tuesday night, following their meeting that dealt with a variety of critical issues on the agenda – from the negotiations that have now opened on phase two of the hostage deal, through the Iranian threat and the question of a possible attack on its nuclear facilities, to the long-awaited normalization with Saudi Arabia. 'We had wonderful conversations,' Trump said at the beginning of his remarks. 'Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to visit our administration. Bibi, I want to say it is a great honor to host you. In the last four years, the alliance between our countries has been tested more than ever before in history, but the bond and affection between our peoples have been maintained for years and are unwavering. I am confident that under our leadership the alliance between our countries will soon be stronger than ever.' 'We have had great victories in the past - not in the last four years,' Trump said in a clear dig at his predecessor Joe Biden, and recited his achievements in his first term. 'During my tenure, I brought peace and stability to the Middle East that had not been seen in decades. We defeated ISIS, we withdrew from the nuclear agreement and imposed very harsh sanctions on the Iranian regime. We stopped Iran's proxies and deprived them of resources. I recognized the Golan Heights, in the historic Abraham Accords we achieved the most important peace agreement in the Middle East. I believe that many countries will join this wonderful peace and this economic peace. There will be many who will sign. Unfortunately, in the last four years, no one has signed.' 'The horrors of October 7th would not have happened if I had been president,' Trump repeated, something he has said many times before. 'Israel has endured aggression and murderous attacks on every front and fought back with great courage. This was a threat to the very existence of the Jewish state in its homeland. Israel stood strong against an enemy that kidnapped, raped and slaughtered innocent people, children and women, little babies. I want to salute the Israelis who stood with courage and determination. They were strong.' After thanking his team and asking those present to applaud Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump said: 'We will only be satisfied if all the problems are solved and we have the team to solve them. It will happen quickly. The Gaza Strip has been a source of destruction and so bad for the people, the lives of the residents there are miserable. They need to go to other places. There are many of them who want to go from there. 1.8 million Gazans need to leave. The rich countries of the region need to finance it. They can go to one area, or 12. We will ensure that something amazing is done. We will have peace and they will not be shot, killed and destroyed.' Trump stunned when he later said that 'the United States will take over the Gaza Strip, we will do work there. We will control it and neutralize all the bombs. We will clear Gaza and get rid of the destruction and carry out economic development that will provide endless jobs and housing. It is impossible to go back. If they go back, it will happen again.' Netanyahu supported the idea: 'A new future for the territory, it's worth paying attention to' Netanyahu, who issued a statement afterward, told Trump: 'You are the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House. Its policy is bringing our hostages home, including American citizens. You have resumed the transfer of weapons that were withheld from Israel during a seven-front war against our existence.' The prime minister said that the two 'see eye to eye on the Iranian issue. This is the same Iran that tried to kill both of us. It tried to assassinate itself and through a proxy to kill me.' At the end of his statement, he said that 'Israel will end the war by winning the war. Israel's victory will be the victory of the United States. We will work together and win in peace as well. With your leadership, we will create a great future for the region and bring our alliance to greater heights than ever.' In response to a question about a possible agreement with Saudi Arabia, Netanyahu replied: 'I believe that peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only possible but will happen. If you had continued in office, it would have happened. I think the Saudi leadership wants it.' Trump, for his part, said he was not sure the cease-fire would last. 'The Biden administration didn't help us, but we were able to get some hostages out and we'll get more out. We're dealing with problematic people. I hope we get more out, they'll come out very damaged. But they'll get better and be strong and have a good life and we hope to release as many as possible. We hope the cease-fire will last, but I'm not sure.' The American president said, further in his statement, that he 'sees long-term ownership of Gaza, it will bring stability to the Middle East. Everyone I've talked to loves the idea. Developing this area and creating thousands of jobs would be a great thing. Today you can't see it because you only see destruction. I've seen it from every angle and it's a dangerous area to be in and it's only going to get worse.' Asked whether he recognized Israel's sovereignty over the West Bank, also known as Judea and Samaria, Trump replied: 'We will discuss it with your representatives, we have not yet taken a position. We will issue a statement on this issue in the coming month.' He stated that he would visit Israel - as well as Gaza, Saudi Arabia and other regions: 'The Middle East is a wonderful place, one of the most beautiful places with wonderful people. A lot of bad leaders allowed this to happen in the Middle East, and that includes the American side. We should not have gone there in the first place, spent so much money and caused death.' At the beginning of the meeting, Trump spoke at length, essentially saying that his plan was to evacuate all residents of the Gaza Strip to seven or eight areas around the world- and forever. 'Who would want to go back there? There's nothing but death and destruction. We'll build them lovely cities,' he said. He had even said before that the Palestinians 'have no choice but to leave Gaza . ' The prime minister promised in the same statement at the beginning of the meeting not to give up any of the war's goals: 'Hamas will not remain in Gaza.' He did not commit that Israel would continue with Phase 2 of the hostage deal, only saying: 'We will try.' Before the press conference began, Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, said the meeting was 'strong and steady.' He said, 'Trump is a leader who will do amazing things.' When asked by reporters if there would be any surprises, he replied, 'Wait and see.' Israel's ambassador to the United States, Yechiel Leiter, said before the press conference: 'You can feel the change in the air. Everything has changed.'

Netanyahu, the first foreign leader Trump has hosted at the White House since his return to the presidency, met with the American president privately. A larger meeting with the two leaders' teams was then held in the Cabinet Room at the White House. After the press conference, the two were expected to continue for a joint dinner. The two discussed a variety of topics during their meeting, the first of which was the question of continuing the hostage deal. Trump and his people made it clear over and over again that they wanted to maintain the cease-fire and continue with the second phase – which would mean a permanent cease-fire and the end of the war. When Trump was asked at the beginning of the meeting if he believed the deal could be completed, he replied: 'Why not? Yes, of course. We can definitely complete the deal.' The issue of the Iranian threat was also discussed, with estimates before the meeting that Netanyahu would argue that this would also serve the interests of the Saudis and 'give time' to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip. Just before the meeting, Trump said that he intended to speak with the Iranian president, after repeatedly signaling his intention to promote a 'deal' - meaning a new nuclear agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjepzvgf1x	2025-02-04T15:59:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/H1Yy44gt1l/H1Yy44gt1l_0_0_3000_1997_0_small.jpg

Karina, Daniella, Naama, Agam and Liri were held in a hideout apartment in Gaza, where a senior Hamas military commander was also present; He provided them with food and ensured they could shower – while simultaneously manipulating them in an attempt to extract information about IDF activity in the days leading up to Oct. 7 For an extended period during their captivity, observers Daniella Gilboa, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, Agam Berger and Liri Albag were held in an apartment in Gaza where a senior Hamas military commander was also hiding. According to reports from Kan News, the commander used the hostages as human shields and was a 'dominant figure' in the hideout. The Hamas leader not only issued orders to terrorists but also attempted to manipulate the young women, coaxing them into revealing information about IDF activity near the Gaza border in the days leading up to the Oct. 7 terror attack. Some of the hostages only realized after their abduction that he was a high-ranking Hamas operative. This was not an isolated tactic. Several Hamas leaders deliberately stayed close to hostages to protect themselves. The treatment of the lookouts was largely similar to that of other captives, apart from the targeted efforts to extract intelligence from them. Throughout their captivity, Hamas terrorists frequently filmed the hostages, forcing them to deliver scripted messages. Some of these videos were later released in Israel. Many of those who returned had no idea what footage had been disseminated. Several freed hostages said they had little access to television or radio and remained unaware of their families' fates until their release. Others spent most of their time underground in Hamas tunnels and were unclear about how much time had passed. Testimonies from the observers revealed that Naama Levy was held alone for a long period before being reunited with her fellow captives. When she finally saw them again, she asked if what was happening was real and whether they were alive. The five women spent time both above and below ground, and in some cases, were held by families, forced to cook, clean, and care for children. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The four hostages who were released first tried to pass the time by exercising despite the harsh conditions and lack of food. Their captors forbade them from holding hands or crying, but they found ways to support each other. Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev, who had known each other from their base before the abduction, were held together for most of their time in captivity, strengthening their bond. One of the previously released hostages recounted that her Hamas captors dismissed reports of the assassination of Hamas’s military chief, Mohammed Deif — news that Hamas officially confirmed only recently, nearly six months later. The guards even laughed at the reports, while the hostages insisted that Al Jazeera was broadcasting 'false propaganda.' Based on her conversations with her captors, one of the freed hostages speculated that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was not viewed as a revered leader among them. She noted that there was a more pronounced sense of mourning when senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran. Many of the captives had limited knowledge of calendar dates, as they were only occasionally allowed to watch television. 'We didn't know when Passover was, but we knew when Yom Kippur was, and we fasted,' one released hostage said. Following Agam Berger’s return, new details emerged about her captivity alongside the other lookouts. She spent a significant period with Liri Albag, and the group refrained from eating leavened bread during Passover. Agam also observed Shabbat while in captivity and spoke about the faith that sustained her throughout the ordeal. Upon arriving at Rabin Medical Center, she wrote a message on a whiteboard that read: 'I chose the path of faith, and in the path of faith, I have returned.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by3mqmxyyx	2025-02-04T13:51:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/H1gd00Wtdyx/H1gd00Wtdyx_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg
Empty Gaza of all its residents and settle them around the world ...	The US president and the prime minister are now meeting in the Oval Office, in what could shape the face of the Middle East for years to come; Trump spoke about removing Palestinians from Gaza forever: 'Who would want to go back there? There is nothing but death and destruction'; Netanyahu on Israel's goals in the war: 'Hamas will not remain in Gaza' A fateful summit that could shape the face of the Middle East for years to come: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the White House Tuesday evening for a meeting with President Donald Trump that will address a variety of critical issues on the agenda - from the negotiations that have now opened on phase two of the hostage deal, through the Iranian threat and the question of a possible attack on its nuclear facilities, to the long-awaited normalization with Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu, the first foreign leader Trump has hosted at the White House since his return to the presidency, was supposed to arrive at the White House as early as 11:00 p.m. but was delayed by about 20 minutes. Trump waited for him at the entrance, shook his hand and raised his fist to reporters waiting outside. Before their meeting in the Oval Office they spoke to reporters inside the room and when asked if he thought the deal could be completed, Trump replied: 'Why not? Yes, of course. We can definitely finish the deal' - meaning continue with the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage return agreement. Trump also claimed that he deserved a Nobel Prize. 'But they won't give it to me. Everyone is demanding peace, we want people to stop getting killed,' he said. Netanyahu was asked if he supported the release of all the hostages, and he replied yes - but emphasized that he insisted on delivering 'all the war goals,' including the dismantling of Hamas and a promise that Gaza would never again become a threat to Israel. The prime minister was asked if he was optimistic about the possibility of reaching the second phase of the deal, and he replied: 'We will try, that's one of the things we will talk about. When Israel and the US work together, the chances increase - when we don't work together, it creates problems,' he said, appearing to be alluding to past tensions with the Biden administration. Later, President Trump was asked about his relocation plan for Gazans - and he again claimed that the Palestinians should be evacuated from the Strip, while unlike previous times he now called for 'resettlement' of them permanently outside the Strip. 'I don't think people should be going back,' Trump said. 'You can't live in Gaza right now. I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that's going to make people happy. You look over the decades, it's all death in Gaza. This has been happening for years. It's all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what's happening in Gaza.' He added that 'I hope we can do something nice, why would they want to go back? This place is hell, it's the worst place in the world.' He emphasized, however, that he does not support Israeli settlements in Gaza: 'I don't see it happening. It's too dangerous. Nobody would want to live there, soldiers don't want to be there, so how would people want to settle it? The best way is to get out, find nice, open places with sunlight, they (the Palestinians) wouldn't want to go back to Gaza.' Shortly after midnight, Trump and Netanyahu are scheduled to hold a press conference, and then continue to have a joint dinner. Netanyahu is accompanied on the visit by his wife Sara, who has been in Miami for the last 70 days and met with him after he landed in Washington on Sunday. First Lady Melania Trump will not accompany her husband to the meeting, since she is not currently in Washington. At the summit, the two leaders will discuss a variety of critical issues, not all of which they necessarily have compatible interests in. 'He came to meet with me, and I'm here to listen,' Trump said before the meeting. The most central and immediate issue is the question of continuing the hostage deal. Trump and his people have repeatedly made it clear that they want to maintain the cease-fire and continue with the second phase – which means a permanent cease-fire, and the end of the war – and although the American president admitted that there are 'no guarantees' that the agreement will last, ahead of the meeting a senior American official said that Trump is focused on releasing 'all the hostages ,' along with the need to prevent Hamas from returning to power in Gaza. Netanyahu is expected to present to Trump the demands that Israel will raise in negotiations on phase two – including the demilitarization of the Strip, the exile of the Hamas leadership, and the terrorist organization's non-involvement in the reconstruction of the Strip 'the day after.' Israel understands that the chances that Hamas will agree to this are slim, and that therefore there will be no escape from a return to fighting. Netanyahu will try to get Trump to ratify his promise that if an agreement on the second phase cannot be reached, Israel will be able to return to fighting. The issue of the deal is closely linked to another central issue that Trump and Netanyahu will discuss – the Iranian threat. Netanyahu is expected to try to convince Trump that in the order of priorities in the Middle East, it is better and right to start dealing with this threat. He will argue that this will also serve the interests of the Saudis and 'give time' to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip. His critics claim that the prime minister is actually hoping to torpedo phase two of the deal, in the shadow of the fear of the dissolution of his government with the 'red lines' of Minister Bezalel Smotrich in the background, who promises to withdraw from the coalition if fighting does not resume at the end of phase one. Trump did not rule out the possibility of an attack on the nuclear facilities, but he repeatedly signaled that he intended to promote a 'deal' – that is, a new nuclear agreement – ​​and noted that 'it would be nice' to resolve the crisis with Tehran without an Israeli attack. On Tuesday evening, Trump said that he intended to contact Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, adding that he was 'torn' while signing the tougher sanctions. 'I hope we don't have to use them a lot, I'm not happy about using them.' Shortly before the summit, Trump ordered a renewal of his 'maximum pressure' policy from his first term – meaning tougher sanctions on Iran than those already imposed. Trump warned that Iran was too close to a nuclear weapon, but said on the other hand that he was 'torn' about the move and expressed hope that it would not be necessary to implement it extensively, meaning to reach an agreement with Tehran. The possibility of normalization with Saudi Arabia will also be raised at the meeting, with estimates that such a move could be part of the 'inducement package' that Trump will offer Netanyahu to continue to Phase 2 - despite the political risk for him. However, there is a major obstacle in the way: Netanyahu refuses the condition set by the Saudis for such a deal - providing a 'political horizon' for the Palestinians, which Smotrich also set as a 'red line' for him. Other issues expected to be raised at the meeting include the arrest warrants against Netanyahu at the International Criminal Court in The Hague and sanctions on Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan and his team; the continuation of the cease-fire in Lebanon; the attitude toward the new government in Syria; and the beginning of discussions on the security memorandum of understanding between Israel and the U.S. The current memorandum is set to expire in 2028. Musk, Yair and the hotel for the weekend Netanyahu and his wife are staying at Blair House, the official White House guest house. Their son Yair is also there, and tonight he posted a photo of himself alongside his father and billionaire Elon Musk – a Trump confidante who wields immense power in the new administration. 'So grateful to be in the company of these two geniuses,' Yair wrote on Instagram. On Wednesday, the Netanyahus will leave Blair House and move a few hundred meters away – to the Willard Hotel – where they will spend the weekend. The entourage will return to Israel on Saturday night, and their stay at the Willard Hotel will be financed by taxpayer money.

Trump says he thinks he will wind down US humanitarian agency	U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he thinks he will wind down the U.S. Agency for International Development, in what would be a dramatic overhaul of how the world's largest single donor allocates foreign assistance. When a reporter said to Trump it sounded like he was going to 'wind down' the agency, Trump chuckled and said 'I think so.' Chaos has consumed the agency, which distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid around the world, since Trump ordered a freeze on most U.S. foreign aid hours after taking office and tasked billionaire Elon Musk, who has falsely accused USAID of being a 'criminal' organization, with scaling down the agency. 'He's done a great job. Look at all the fraud that he's found in this USAID ... radical left lunatics,' Trump said, without providing evidence of fraud.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjs0iwgk1x	2025-02-04T12:30:54-08:00

Trump signs tougher sanctions against Iran: 'If Iran tries to kil...	Trump signed a renewal of the tough sanctions policy on Tehran: 'Too close to a nuclear weapon, we will reduce its oil exports to zero'; Netanyahu will try to convince the president to focus on the Iranian threat, but an Israeli official admitted: 'There is no more talk of an attack, Trump has another goal - one that requires ending the war' About an hour before the White House meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the American president on Tuesday evening signed a renewal of the 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran, the name for the heavy sanctions policy he imposed on the Islamic Republic during his first term. Trump said that Iran is too close to a nuclear weapon, and warned that if Tehran decided to assassinate him in response, Iran would be 'obliterated.' He said he left 'instructions' to do so if Tehran did indeed assassinate him. The U.S. president was asked whether he intends to assist Netanyahu and give the green light to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. 'I don't know that he's going to ask for that. We'll have a long meeting, we'll talk about a lot of things. I'll update when the time comes, but I can't talk about it right now,' he responded Trump added: 'I would love to have a good relationship, but they must not have nuclear weapons. It will be very tough if they insist on that. A lot of people at the highest levels in Iran do not want nuclear weapons.' Before Trump's signing, a U.S. official said the goal is to deny Iran any way to obtain nuclear weapons and combat its 'malign influence' - and within the framework of the sanctions the hope is to reduce Iranian oil exports 'to zero.' The Iranian issue is expected to be central – perhaps the most central – issue at the White House meeting with Netanyahu. Trump and Netanyahu will discuss a host of issues that could determine the face of the Middle East in the coming years, including the transition to phase two of the hostage deal, a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia, and dealing with the Iranian threat. Netanyahu is expected to try to convince Trump that in the order of priorities in the Middle East, it is better and right to start dealing with this threat. He will argue that this will also serve the interests of the Saudis and 'give time' to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip. His critics claim that the prime minister is actually hoping to torpedo phase two of the deal, in the shadow of the fear of the dissolution of his government with the 'red lines' of Minister Bezalel Smotrich in the background, who promises to withdraw from the coalition if fighting does not resume at the end of phase one. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump did not rule out the possibility of an attack on the nuclear facilities, but he repeatedly signaled that he intended to promote a 'deal' – that is, a new nuclear agreement – ​​and noted that 'it would be nice' to resolve the crisis with Tehran without an Israeli attack. On Tuesday evening, Trump said that he intended to contact Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, adding that he was 'torn' while signing the tougher sanctions. 'I hope we don't have to use them a lot, I'm not happy about using them.' Sanctions are seen by Trump as a way to force Iran to compromise but, at least in the past, this policy has not worked. Former President Joe Biden left Trump’s sanctions in place – although some argue that his administration did not effectively enforce them – and failed to advance a new agreement or save the old one. Although Israel has talked in recent months about the possibility of an attack o Iran's nuclear facilities - against the backdrop of assessments that Tehran is weaker than ever, after the crushing of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, and the Israeli attack on Iran in October, which significantly damaged Iran's air defense capabilities - it seems that Jerusalem understands that the chances of such a move are now low. 'There is no talk of an attack on Iran,' an Israeli source told the Washington Post Monday night - noting that, after the October attack, Israel had formulated plans for a joint attack with the U.S. against the Iranian nuclear facilities. However, he said the new American administration has 'another goal' in the region, one that would demand an end to the fighting, when in fact he meant the idea of ​​a regional arrangement that would perhaps also include normalization with Saudi Arabia. 'Trump is interested in rebuilding Gaza through a regional agreement with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia,' he noted. 'Netanyahu will not go against Trump.' Either way, Israel hopes that, unlike Trump's first term, this time the new sanctions will be accompanied by a more credible military threat. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1r000llkkg	2025-02-04T12:11:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

FireAid benefit donations for Los Angeles top $100 million	The star-studded FireAid benefit concerts brought in more than $100 million for immediate relief efforts and long-term needs in Los Angeles, according to estimates from organizers on Tuesday.

Israel considered moving Palestinians from Gaza for rebuilding mo...	Ynet has learned that the issue has been under consideration for some time, and a green light has been given to a plan to encourage the migration of Gazans to a third country other than Egypt or Jordan Senior Israeli officials have been considering for several months a plan to encourage the migration of Gaza residents to a third country as part of efforts to rebuild the enclave, according to a report on Tuesday. Israel appears to be signaling a green light for preparing such a program, which would involve the relocation of Gaza residents to a country that, according to the discussions, would not be Egypt or Jordan. The idea surfaced about two months ago, even before U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a voluntary migration plan for Gazans to neighboring Arab states as part of a massive reconstruction effort. A source familiar with the matter said that Israeli government teams have been reviewing plans, including legal aspects, to facilitate migration from Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to publicly address the idea, which has drawn significant backlash in the Arab world. As a result, any discussion of the topic is being handled delicately. However, it is possible the issue will be raised during Netanyahu's meeting with Trump, or in subsequent talks with reporters. The Prime Minister's Office has not responded to requests for comment. Within the Israeli cabinet, right-wing ministers have pushed for the plan on multiple occasions, advocating for both encouraging migration from Gaza and establishing Israeli settlements in the enclave. Leading this effort is National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has been lobbying Netanyahu directly. Two months ago, Ben-Gvir said Netanyahu was beginning to show 'some openness' to the idea. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the Religious Zionism party, has also promoted the idea of settlements in Gaza. Trump to meet with Egyptian president Following Trump's statements that Egypt and Jordan should absorb Gazan migrants, Egyptian officials told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to visit Washington on Feb. 18 to discuss several issues, including Trump's proposed relocation of Gazan residents. According to the report, Sisi plans to discuss a cease-fire agreement in Gaza and long-term solutions for the Palestinian issue. The sources indicated that Egypt would propose a comprehensive reconstruction plan for Gaza that does not involve displacing its residents. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Egypt, along with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League, issued a joint statement on Saturday rejecting Trump's proposal. 'We affirm our categorical rejection of the forced displacement of Palestinians from their land for any reason,' the statement read. The declaration was released following a meeting in Cairo between several foreign ministers and Hussein al-Sheikh, the secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee. The statement also emphasized that Arab nations expect to work with the Trump administration toward a 'just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on a two-state solution.' The officials discussed efforts to support the Palestinian cause and maintain the cease-fire in Gaza. The meeting also addressed a potential 'mechanism' that would allow the Palestinian Authority to resume governance in the territory. Last week, Trump proposed that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinian residents from Gaza while the enclave undergoes a process of reconstruction and 'cleansing.' Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, he described Gaza as a massive wreckage site and suggested that relocating its residents to Egypt or Jordan might be a long-term solution rather than a temporary measure. 'You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, we just clean out that whole thing,' Trump said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjk2m0ytyx	2025-02-04T10:02:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/r1gyNt1K1x/r1gyNt1K1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Holocaust survivor Mordechai Ciechanower dies at 100: 'We were to...	Mordechai, who survived the gas chambers, immigrated to Israel with his father after the war and dedicated his life to Holocaust remembrance; He led IDF and school delegations to Poland, lectured worldwide about his personal story, and died two weeks before his 101st birthday Just weeks before his 101st birthday, Holocaust survivor Mordechai Ciechanower died at the age of 100. Ciechanower, who was laid to rest Tuesday morning, dedicated his life to Holocaust education. He led delegations of Israeli students and IDF officers on educational trips to Poland, lectured worldwide about his personal experiences, and authored an autobiography, 'A Star Gleams in the Distance,' which was translated into English, German and Polish. Ciechanover was born in 1924 in the Polish town of Maków Mazowiecki. To survive two years in Auschwitz, he worked as a roofer, repairing barracks in the camp. He was liberated from Bergen-Belsen on April 15, 1945, and later that year immigrated to Israel under a false identity, posing as a British soldier. He was laid to rest Tuesday in Yarkon Cemetery. Senior officials from the Shin Bet and Mossad, who had attended his lectures — including former Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai — helped carry his casket. Singer Yonatan Razel performed 'Shir Mispar,' a song he and Ciechanower had created together. Born to Meir Zvi Hirsch and Rachel, Ciechanower grew up in a family that made edible and industrial oils. He was educated at the Yavne religious school, where his primary language was Yiddish, though most subjects were taught in Hebrew. As a child, he studied the Talmud at night while listening to discussions among members of the Zionist youth movements Hashomer Hatzair and Betar. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When World War II broke out in September 1939, the Jews of Maków Mazowiecki were ordered to assemble in the town square. Ciechanower, along with hundreds of other young men, was sent to forced labor camps. By late 1940, the town’s Jewish residents were relocated to a designated Jewish quarter, and by the end of 1941, a ghetto was established. Ciechanower’s family shared a cramped room with two other families. 'The overcrowding was unbearable, and food was scarce,' he recalled in a 2018 Zikaron BaSalon testimony - a social initiative of informal gatherings in private homes where participants listen together to the testimonies of Holocaust survivors. 'I removed my yellow badge, approached Poles, and asked for bread – they gave it to me. I brought it home, and within 20 minutes, my family had devoured a whole kilogram of bread. For three years, from 1942 until the end of the war, I was constantly hungry. My greatest dream was simply to sit at a table full of bread and eat.' In November 1942, the ghetto was liquidated and Ciechanower was deported to the Mława Ghetto before being sent, along with his family, to Auschwitz a month later. Upon arrival, his mother, Rachel, and sisters, Rivka and Chana-Hadasa, were murdered in the gas chambers. Ciechanower and his father were selected for forced labor, surviving for three and a half months. 'The journey to Auschwitz — the largest Jewish cemetery in the world — was horrifying,' he recounted. 'A man who leaned on me throughout the trip died during the journey. I wept as I bid farewell to my mother and sister. I took one last look at them before entering the camp.' On his first night in Auschwitz, Ciechanower recalled the barracks overseer telling them: ‘The weak will be exterminated, the strong will work until they die. Look at the smoke rising from the chimney—those are your families.’ His father’s fingers froze in the bitter cold, and he was taken to the infirmary. A month later, Ciechanower was injured. During a selection process, he was loaded onto a truck bound for the crematorium, but a delay due to the arrival of a transport from Greece saved his life. Later, Ciechanower worked as a roofer in the camp and acted as a messenger for the Jewish underground inside Auschwitz. After the Sonderkommando uprising, he and 500 others were transferred to the Stutthof concentration camp in northern Poland. His journey of suffering continued, moving from camp to camp, and enduring brutal forced labor. At the end of the war, he was liberated from Bergen-Belsen. In Munich, he discovered that his father had survived. 'I took a train to see him. When he opened the door, we both fainted. I promised him we would never be separated again,' he said. Ciechanower and his father immigrated to Israel through Egypt, disguised as British soldiers. He served in the Alexandroni Brigade during the War of Independence and later married his wife, Deborah. Together, they raised two daughters. On the most recent Holocaust Remembrance Day, Ciechanower participated in Paskol Shlishi, a collaborative album by Galgalatz Radio and Zikaron BaSalon. The album featured songs inspired by personal testimonies, collective memory, and a shared future, created by Israeli musicians. The artists met with Ciechanower during the project and even celebrated his 100th birthday with him. 'Each of us held onto something from his story,' they said of the songwriting process. 'One remembered divine intervention, another recalled the search for his father, and a third was struck by the number tattooed on his arm. However, the most remarkable detail was the mandolin — a musical instrument that symbolized life before the war and resurfaced even in Auschwitz. That’s why, at the end of every verse, we let the mandolin play. The melody carries an old European Jewish essence, filled with sorrow yet unwavering optimism —j ust like Mordechai Ciechanower’s story.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sji3layfye	2025-02-04T09:00:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/04/17/Hylbdvqf3/Hylbdvqf3_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Hospital concert honors IDF field observers returned from captivi...	Liri Albag, who celebrated her previous birthday in Hamas captivity, was celebrating freedom Tuesday with her friends and family: 'The only wish I ask for - the return of all the hostages'; Watch the field observers join in singing at the concert to mark their return and as a tribute to violinist Agam Berger Liri's family just recently belatedly celebrated her 19th birthday. On Tuesday, the returned hostage and all her relatives are already celebrating her 20th birthday, and freedom. A little more than a week after she was released from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip, Liri Albag celebrated her 20th birthday Tuesday in the returnees' ward at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva. Shortly afterward, dozens of musicians gathered in the lobby of Schneider Hospital to play pieces of music for the returning observers - for Liri's birthday and as a tribute to Agam Berger, a violinist. The field observers themselves stood on one of the upper floors, excitedly watching the concert, clapping during Naomi Shemer's 'Lo Yehi' and Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah.' Agam even joined in singing. Her mother, Meirav Berger, delivered a speech: 'We will pray for those who are still there, we will not be silent until everyone returns.' She wished Liri a mazal tov and added: 'We can say that the music held Liri and Agam captive.' The national anthem 'Hatikva' was played to mark the end of the concert. The observers sang the anthem - and then they also sang Happy Birthday to Liri, and the orchestra joined in. In a post on Instagram, Liri wrote: 'Today I get to celebrate my 20th birthday with my loved ones. The only wish I asked for is for all the hostages to return.' Her sister Roni wrote in another post: 'Our Lirosh, our number 1. I dreamed of this moment countless times and here you are. Today you celebrate your 20th birthday at home, today you celebrate the life that was given to you again, our victory, our heart and the light of our home. I love you and am here for you forever and ever.' Shai, Liri's sister, also congratulated: 'Congratulations, my little sister, who is celebrating 20 and has returned to life. Always remember that everything is small for you and there is nothing you cannot do. I will take care of you for a better world.' Liri returned home exactly as her family and friends described her during the 15-month struggle for her return: brave, optimistic and with a smile that brightened everything. Her fellow observers who had been kidnapped with her from the Nahal Oz outpost - Daniella Gilboa, Karina Ariev, and Naama Levy - returned with her. Five days later, their friend, observer Agam Berger, was also released, and the five were reunited together in the returnees' department in Beilinson. Liri's friends said Monday that 'she is truly a special girl, full of energy - and that has not gone to waste. Today the family will celebrate her 20th birthday with her friends. Last year she celebrated her 19th birthday in captivity , now our Liri has been released, and she will celebrate today in a big way with cakes and balloons.' 'Liri is always smiling, she is optimistic, loves life and loves to spend time and be with friends a lot,' a friend described, echoing how her friends and family described Liri on many occasions during the arduous journey of their fight for her return.

When Hamas tried to humiliate them upon their release and put them on a stage, they showed that they were stronger than that,' said a family member. Her friends said that Liri and the girls were kept informed of what was happening, and Liri told her parents: 'You were my strength. I heard you so much. You are the only ones who gave me hope.' She told them that she even heard their birthday greetings in February, when she was in captivity and turned 19. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjuovt1fjg	2025-02-04T08:19:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/B1V22k9yYJx/B1V22k9yYJx_0_74_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen's family awaits his return, concerned fo...	Sagui's brother Itay Dekel-Chen, is urging a more nuanced perspective on the highly charged debate over the cease-fire and hostage release; 'We must bring everyone home, but at the same time, this comes at a heavy price,' he says, 'If we choose only one side, there won’t be much left here' As Israel prepares for the next phase of a hostage deal, Itay Dekel-Chen, the brother of Sagui-Dekel Chen – who is expected to soon be freed – expressed his anticipation while lamenting the growing divide over the negotiations. 'The stark polarization in the discourse surrounding the deal and the return of the hostages is troubling,' Itay said. 'Reality is more complex, and we need to approach it with a more clear-eyed perspective than what we hear in the usual debate. Both sides have a point. We must bring everyone home, but at the same time, this comes at a heavy price, with serious future security risks. There is the sanctity of life and the sanctity of our people and land. If we only choose one side, we won’t have much left here.' He added: 'If, as a people and a nation, we can find a way to secure the hostages’ release while maintaining strength and full trust in our security forces, perhaps we can emerge from this with a sense of victory. I’m not saying it’s easy – it requires deep and strategic thinking. I live in a world of both. I grew up in Kibbutz Nir Oz, and today I live in the religious moshav of Zimrat. I was raised in a kibbutz and now live in a moshav. We must find a middle path here as well. With the right discourse and effort, we can find common ground — maybe through dialogue with the Americans, maybe through long-term strategies —but alongside the fight to bring the hostages home, we must also avoid tearing our society apart or creating internal crises.' Alongside the fight to bring the hostages home, we must also avoid tearing our society apart or creating internal crises Sagui Dekel-Chen, who was abducted from Nir Oz on October 7, is also an American citizen. His family has worked tirelessly to advocate for his release, lobbying U.S. officials for intervention. His wife, Avital, recalled the horrifying moments before he was taken. 'Sagui was kidnapped from our home while I was in the safe room with our two daughters, seven months pregnant,' she told lawmakers at the Knesset. 'Before he was taken, he stepped into the safe room and said: ‘There’s no way out of this alive. The army isn’t coming.’ He didn’t want the girls to understand, so he said in English, ‘Milly, this is the end.’' Avital had hoped for a miracle — that Sagui would return in time to be by her side for the birth of their third child. But he never came home. Their daughter Shachar was born without a father. More than a year has passed, and Sagui has missed her first birthday, as well as the daily lives of his two other daughters, Bar and Gali, who wait for him at home.

Israel opens first embassy in Israel: 'After October 7 attack you...	Some 34 years after Jerusalem officially recognized Moldova's independence, an Israeli embassy opened in Chisinau. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said at the ceremony:'This is a historic moment that marks a milestone in relations between the countries'; Saar laid a wreath in memory of his family at the monument to the victims of the Chisinau ghetto Foreign Minister Gideon Saar inaugurated the Israeli embassy in Moldova Tuesday morning. 'This is a historic moment that marks a milestone in relations between the countries. Moldova is a friendly country to Israel, we are upgrading our relations today and we are doing so with great joy,' Saar said at a ceremony attended by Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mihai Popșoi. This is the first time Israel has opened an embassy in the Eastern European country. 'After the Hamas murderers attacked on October 7, the most serious attack on Jews since the Holocaust, Moldova stood by us,' Saar said at the ceremony. 'You condemned Hamas' evil barbarity, you clearly recognized Israel's fundamental right to self-defense.' The foreign minister added: 'We were also attacked by Hezbollah, the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen, which is 2,000 km from our border, by militias in Syria and Iraq, and finally by the head of the snake, Iran. But we managed to defeat them. This showed the world that Israel is an anchor of strength and stability in a very dangerous and unstable region.' Pro-Palestinian demonstrations took place outside the new embassy area. After the opening of the new embassy, ​​the foreign minister continued with his counterpart to the memorial to the victims of the Chisinau Ghetto. Saar laid a wreath in memory of his family and participated in the recitation of Kaddish in memory of the victims. Saar's grandfather, David Zerchansky, left Chisinau in 1908 and moved to Argentina. His three sisters, who decided to stay in Chisinau, were killed in the Holocaust. The wreath laid by Saar bears the names of the three sisters - Yocheved, Raizel and Rivka. In 1939, about 200,000 Jews lived in Serbia (most of which was in present-day Moldova). More than 100,000 of them were murdered in the Holocaust. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saar then met with Moldovan President Maia Sandu. The meeting dealt with the opening of the new embassy, ​​relations between the countries, the struggle against the Iranian axis, and the war in neighboring Ukraine. The foreign minister expressed appreciation for Sandu's words against antisemitism, and invited her to visit Israel. In his meeting with the president, Saar addressed the situation in Syria. 'The new government in Damascus is made up of jihadists and Islamists. It is currently focused on the economy, governance and legitimacy from the world, and therefore is currently speaking softly. This happened with many Islamist movements that came to power, including Khomeini's revolution in Iran in 1979. But it would be advisable to monitor its activities closely. 'What is clear is that Turkey has the greatest influence on it. The most important thing for us is maintaining our security. The Iranian threat is the most urgent. It is important to pay attention to Turkey's actions in the region. Turkey is currently the most dominant country in Syria, it aspires to be the leader of Sunni Islam in the region.' Israel officially recognized Moldova's independence in 1991. A year later, diplomatic relations between the countries were established and since 1994 Moldova has had an embassy in Israel. Over the years, Israel has had a non-resident ambassador to Moldova. In December, Saar made the decision to open an embassy in the country for the first time. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1c3h3yt1e	2025-02-04T07:38:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/SJKukiJtyl/SJKukiJtyl_0_44_1280_720_0_small.jpg

IDF: Soldiers fired at suspects who threatened troops in Gaza	IDF troops operated on Tuesday to distance suspects who posed a threat to them in different areas of the Gaza Strip, the IDF spokesperson said. In one incident, an Israeli Air Force aircraft fired a warning shot at a suspicious vehicle that was advancing northward from the central Gaza Strip along a non-approved inspection route, thus violating the terms of the agreement. In addition, the Israeli Navy observed vessels that were violating the security restrictions in the maritime area of the Gaza Strip and fired warning shots to distance them. The vessels did not retreat and additional shots were fired. The vessels returned to the shore. In the central Gaza Strip, two suspects posed a threat to IDF troops, and warning shots were fired to distance them. As the suspects did not retreat, IDF troops fired additional shots, and a hit was identified. Additionally, IDF troops operating in the area fired warning shots in several areas in the Gaza Strip, following suspects who were approaching the troops and posing a threat to them, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj9dknjyjg	2025-02-04T06:19:07-08:00

Trump 'focused on freeing all hostages,' insists on relocation of...	Hours before the 'fateful' meeting between the US president and Netanyahu, a senior American official said that the two would discuss 'preserving' the cease-fire and preventing Hamas from returning to power; 'Phase 2? There will be unity'; Trump insists on relocation for masses of Gazans; 'Rebuilding the Strip will take between 10-15 years, it is impossible to force people to live in land that is uninhabitable' A U.S. official said Tuesday afternoon, just hours before the scheduled meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump at the White House, that the two leaders will discuss 'preserving the cease-fire agreements' - apparently referring to both Gaza and Lebanon - and their commitment to freeing the hostages held by Hamas. 'Trump is focused on getting all the hostages out, and on ensuring that Hamas cannot return to control the Strip,' the source told Reuters. He added that at Tuesday evening's meeting, Trump and Netanyahu will also discuss the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, the initial talks on the terms of which have already begun indirectly, and that, according to him, there will be 'unity' in the way they want to pursue it. The possibility of normalization with Saudi Arabia will also come up in the talks, with estimates that such a deal will be part of the 'inducement package' that Trump will offer Netanyahu in order to continue with phase two of the deal - which means the release of all remaining hostages that are still living and an end to the war - despite the political risk for the prime minister. 'We hope that the Abraham Accords will expand and prosper,' the U.S. official said, referring to the peace agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco that were signed during Trump's first term. 'We see an opportunity to bring more countries into the Abraham Accords,' he added. Netanyahu himself said before his departure for Washington that he hoped to 'expand the circle of peace' - but so far he has refused the condition set by the Saudis for such a deal: providing a 'political horizon' for the Palestinians - that is, some progress, declarative or practical, in the process of establishing a Palestinian state. His partner, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, also set a 'red line' against such a move just on Monday. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The U.S. official added Tuesday afternoon that Trump is still insisting on his 'relocation' plan for hundreds of thousands of Gazans, in order to enable the reconstruction of Gaza - a process that, according to the source, Trump believes will require between 10 and 15 years.

Netanyahu has a chance to to fix mistakes in Trump meeting	Opinion: Following missteps and failures accrued throughout his political career culminating in Hamas' attack, prime minister has an option to return Israel to the right path during his U.S. visit Tuesday night could be Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s best chance to fix things. A man who has repeatedly proven his ability to rise from the ashes and overcome personal failures now stands before U.S. President Donald Trump with a chance to address national failures — many of which are deeply tied to his own political career. This night is set to be one of the most fateful in Israel’s history and certainly in Netanyahu’s own. At 11:00 p.m. local time, he will enter the Oval Office with some of Israel’s most pressing issues on the table — issues in which he has played a direct role in shaping the current reality. Netanyahu has the chance to correct historical missteps resting on his shoulders. He must push Trump with all his might toward military action against Iran’s nuclear program. Though he was the first to identify the threat, he has been the last to act. The failure of diplomatic agreements is evident — Iran is closer than ever to military nuclear capability. This must now be the top priority. Netanyahu must push Trump for the broadest possible military backing — an Israeli strike with U.S. support and likely direct American military involvement. On Gaza, Netanyahu himself voted for the 2005 disengagement and orchestrated the Gilad Shalit deal in 2011, setting the unbearable precedent of releasing over 1,000 terrorists — many of whom had murdered, not only attempted to do so — in exchange for a single IDF soldier. Under his leadership, Hamas thrived. Now, after these strategic failures, he has the opportunity to change course. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The change must be decisive: Hamas cannot remain standing. After carrying out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, it has shown fundamentalist Muslims across the region that kidnapping civilians from their beds is an effective tactic against Israel. Hamas and the hundreds of millions who surround us must see that there is no worse mistake than the October 7 massacre. Netanyahu, who enabled Hamas through Qatari funding, who may not have received a precise warning on the night of October 6 but knew full well the terror army’s capabilities and intentions, cannot cleanse himself of this stain in Jewish history unless he ensures Hamas is entirely dismantled as a governing and military entity in Gaza. Having voted for the disengagement, Netanyahu learned along with the rest of us that expelling Jews from Gaza brought terror to our doorstep. Now is the time to advance Trump’s plan for the voluntary relocation of Gazans — not by force, not through violence but with incentives and international cooperation. Countries could take them in exchange for American aid, even with Israeli financial support — this is better than paying for endless wars. Netanyahu must put forth a serious plan to relocate as many Gazans as possible. This could be a game-changer in our relationship with that cursed strip of land. Fate has brought these critical issues to tonight’s meeting — all challenges Netanyahu has faced before. Until now, he has consistently chosen the easy, wrong path. Maybe tonight, a shift will take place — a historic correction that can set Israel on the course it deserves. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byd5yyyf1l	2025-02-04T03:55:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BkxxMc3dyx/BkxxMc3dyx_0_0_1259_696_0_small.jpg

'You can tap into social media. You can tap into various sources and so on. 'How do you digest all of that information?' he continued. 'And most importantly, for the sake of news, how do you make sense of what is true and what is fake?

IDF confirms to IDF reserve soldiers killed in West Bank attack, ...	Sergeant Major (res.) Ofer Yung, 39, from Tel Aviv, a Squad Commander in the 8211th Battalion and another reserve soldier were killed in action after terrorist opened fire Two IDF reserve soldiers were killed in a shooting attack at the Taysir checkpoint in the West Bank after the terrorist entered the post and ambushed them, the IDF Spokesperson reported on Tuesday. Eight other soldiers were wounded, two seriously and the rest suffering minor injuries. One of the fallen soldiers was Sergeant Major (res.) Ofer Yung, 39, from Tel Aviv, a Squad Commander in the 8211th Battalion. The second soldier’s name has not yet been cleared for publication. The wounded were evacuated to Israeli hospitals. The checkpoint had 11 soldiers and a commander on duty. At dawn, as the checkpoint opened for inspections, the first soldier who stepped out of the guard post was ambushed by the attacker, who also targeted another soldier. A close-range firefight ensued, lasting several minutes. The soldiers fired from inside the rooms and the guard area, while the attacker shot from the entrance of the guard post. Rapid response teams were called in and a force led by a platoon commander fired at the terrorist from outside the post. He then tried to flee between buildings but was intercepted by another unit. After several minutes of gunfire, one soldier threw a grenade that hit the terrorist. He was neutralized and then eliminated by two other soldiers. A UAV tracked him from the air but he was ultimately taken down by ground forces. The IDF described the attack as 'a very serious incident' and said, 'Lessons will be learned.'

Syria's Sharaa to discuss defense pact with Turkey's Erdogan, sou...	Talks focus on air defense cooperation, training a new Syrian army and countering Kurdish fighters, with Turkey eyeing bases in the Badiyah region to secure Syria's airspace Syria's transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan are expected to discuss a joint defense pact in Ankara on Tuesday, including establishing Turkish airbases in central Syria and training for Syria's new army, four sources familiar with the matter said. NATO member Turkey has long backed Syria's armed and political opposition to ousted leader Bashar Assad, who was toppled in late December in a lightning offensive spearheaded by Sharaa's forces. Ankara is positioning itself to play a major role in the new Syria, filling a vacuum left by Assad's main regional backer Iran, in an expansion of Turkish sway that could spark rivalry with Gulf Arab states and put Israel on edge. The sources - a Syrian security official, two Damascus-based foreign security sources and a senior regional intelligence official - spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media about the meeting. This is the first time that elements of any strategic defense arrangement by Syria's new leaders, including details of additional Turkish bases, have come to light. The pact could see Turkey establish new air bases in Syria, use Syrian airspace for military purposes, and take a lead role in training troops in Syria's new army, the sources said. Syria's new leadership has dissolved the army and its various rebel factions and is working on integrating them into a new military command. Turkish air bases in Syria The regional intelligence official, the Syrian security official and one of the Damascus-based foreign security sources said the talks would include setting up two Turkish bases in Syria's vast central desert region, known as the Badiyah. An official in Syria's presidency said that Sharaa would discuss Turkey's 'training of the new Syrian army, as well as new areas of deployment and cooperation' with Erdogan, without specifying the deployment locations. The Turkish presidency and Syrian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue. The Turkish presidency's communications director Fahrettin Altun said on Monday that Erdogan and Sharaa would discuss the latest developments in Syria and possible joint measures to rebuild Syria's economy and achieve stability and security. A Turkish defense ministry official familiar with the talks between both defense ministries said he did not have information on Turkish bases in Syria and training for Syrian troops as part of a possible defense pact. Turkey's air defense role The senior regional intelligence official, the Syrian security official and one of the Damascus-based foreign security sources said the bases under discussion would allow Turkey to defend Syria's air space in case of any future attacks.

If these ties lead to a partnership 'on arming, training, air defense or other issues - we would welcome it,' Abu Qasra said, without mentioning Turkey. The regional intelligence official said the possible airbase locations were the Palmyra military airport and the Syrian army's T4 base, both in the province of Homs. Message to Kurdish fighters The official said Ankara was keen to set up bases there as a message to Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria, known as the People's Protection Units (YPG). Ankara views them as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and is deemed a terrorist group by both Turkey and the U.S. Turkey has threatened a military offensive against the YPG, but has held off as talks are underway to address the fate of the Kurdish forces. The Turkish defense ministry official said that Turkish and Syrian military delegations exchanged views last week on 'what can be done in defense and security matters, especially in the joint fight against terrorist organizations that pose a threat to both Syria and Turkey.' 'Our meetings will continue within the framework of the needs that will occur in coming period,' the official added. Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler said in December that Turkey was 'ready to provide the necessary support if the new (Syrian) administration requested it. Ankara may discuss and reevaluate the issue of Turkey's military presence in Syria with the new Syrian administration 'when necessary conditions arise,' Guler said at the time. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjzzvd1tjl	2025-02-04T02:20:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/B1dx2H008yl/B1dx2H008yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Snuck inside checkpoint and surprised soldiers: IDF probes deadly...	Investigation finds terrorist, armed with an M16 and two magazines, snuck in before dawn and opened fire on soldiers exiting post; at least 10 Israelis injured in attack The IDF's Initial findings from the investigation into the deadly shooting attack at the Tayasir checkpoint in the West Bank on Tuesday, in which at least 10 were injured with two in critical condition, revealed that the incident began inside the checkpoint's pillbox. According to the investigation, the terrorist approached on foot, wearing a military vest equipped with an M16 rifle and two magazines. He infiltrated the post overnight, ambushing soldiers at dawn, just before 06:00 a.m., as they prepared for inspections. The checkpoint, manned by 11 reservists and a commander, came under heavy fire. The first soldier exiting the pillbox was immediately opened fire at the entrance of the post, followed by another. A prolonged close-range gunfight ensued, with the terrorist firing from the pillbox entrance while soldiers returned fire from inside the rooms and guard posts.

I didn’t see sunlight': Freed Thai hostages recall harrowing Gaz...	Five Thai hostages freed after 482 days in captivity shared accounts of confinement, survival and hope; families, some traveling to Israel for emotional reunions, celebrated their release The five Thai hostages released from Hamas captivity during the third hostage handout in the cease-fire agreement with the terror group spoke to Thai media about their time in Gaza. Their family members, who waited 482 days for their return, began their journey to Israel on Monday to reunite with their loved ones. Pongsak Tanna recounted being abducted on the morning of October 7, together with Bannawat Seathao, who was also released in the deal. 'The two of us were together. We were kidnapped from different places but were put in the same vehicle. They brought two more people from elsewhere. We didn’t all meet. We were locked in a room the entire time, never went outside, didn’t see sunlight and didn’t see stars. 'Occasionally, we saw the light of a vehicle passing by the window. We showered once every four or five days and there was a guard with us 24 hours a day,' he said. He added that later, an Israeli hostage was also held with them in Gaza. In an interview with the Bangkok Post, Tanna described his release from captivity in Gaza as 'a rebirth.' He said that life in captivity was extremely difficult, but he never lost hope that he would one day be freed. He shared that thoughts of his family, especially his 15-year-old daughter whom he hadn’t seen for more than seven years, gave him the strength to survive. Seathao said, 'From the day I was kidnapped, I missed home in Thailand. We forced ourselves to eat just to survive and return home. We encouraged each other.' He expressed gratitude to the Thai people for not giving up, for continuing to care about them and for demanding their release. Thailand’s Labor Minister Phipat Ratchakitprakarn spoke from Bangkok with the freed hostages, who are currently being treated at Shamir Medical Center in Israel. He told Thai media the hostages are expected to be discharged from the hospital on February 11. He added that their return date to Thailand has not yet been set but promised to personally welcome them upon their arrival at the airport. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the freed hostages, during their captivity, they longed to eat 'Som Tam' salad with fish sauce — a dish made from strips of green papaya, sometimes served with shrimp and crabs. They have already managed to enjoy this popular Thai dish since their release. Wiwatchot, younger brother of Watchara Sriaoun, and Kami, the mother of Surasak Lamnau, left their home in Udon Thani province on Monday, heading to Bangkok and continuing on to Israel. The province’s deputy governor accompanied them to the capital, where they were issued passports and entry visas to visit their relatives who survived captivity in Gaza. Wiwatchot, whose brother was photographed after his release with injuries to his mouth and missing front teeth, said, 'The whole family is happy' that he is traveling to meet him. 'Our parents are waiting in Thailand for Watchara to come home,' he added. Lamnao’s mother shared how she waited for her son for over a year, expressing her longing for his return even as some claimed he had been killed. She continued to believe her son was alive. Thai media also reported that the Social Security Administration is expected to pay the freed hostages approximately $15,500. In addition, they will receive a monthly payment of around $780. This information was confirmed by the Thai Ministry of Labor. The five hostages came to Israel from rural provinces in northern and northeastern Thailand and had worked in border communities from which they were abducted. The five released Thai hostages are Sathian Suwannakham, Pongsak Thenna, Bannawat Seathao, Watchara Sriaoun and Surasak Lamnau. Despite their release, five other foreign hostages remain in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydtw81yyl	2025-02-04T01:13:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/rkE003pLyYye/rkE003pLyYye_0_20_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Elon Musk targets 'apocalyptic' closure of US humanitarian aid ag...	The move, supported by Trump and opposed by Democratic lawmakers, could disrupt billions in global aid with critics calling it illegal and dangerous U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said it would lock U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) workers out of their headquarters in downtown Washington DC for a second day on Tuesday as it moved to shutter the agency, prompting two Democratic senators to vow to block confirmations of State Department nominees in protest. Monday's lockout added to the chaos that has consumed the agency, which distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid around the world, since Trump ordered a freeze on most U.S. foreign aid hours after taking office on January 20. USAID has been targeted for closure by billionaire Elon Musk, who has been tasked by the president with downsizing the federal government. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was considering merging USAID into the State Department and had 'entrusted Elon to oversee the efficiency of this agency.' A group of Democratic lawmakers, cheered by dozens of furloughed agency employees and contractors, held a protest in front of the USAID headquarters, which was shut to the employees on Monday, according to an internal email. Another internal email went out late on Monday, telling employees at the agency's headquarters and a second site in Washington to work remotely again on Tuesday, adding to concerns voiced by staff members and lawmakers. 'We don't have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,' said U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin, speaking outside the building. Senators Brian Schatz and Chris Van Hollen said they would block confirmation of Trump's nominees for State Department positions under rules that allow them to hold up nominations even if the Republican majority of the chamber want them to move forward. 'We have control over the calendar for nominees,' said Van Hollen. 'We will do everything we can to block State Department nominees from going forward until this illegal action is reversed.' 'Against the law' Hundreds of USAID programs covering billions of dollars worth of lifesaving aid across the globe came to a grinding halt after Trump on January 20 ordered a freeze of most U.S. foreign aid, saying he wanted to ensure it is aligned with his 'America First' policy. If USAID were put under the State Department, it would likely have dramatic consequences for the distribution of aid from the United States, the world's largest single donor. Musk has been increasingly critical of USAID, calling it a left-wing agency unaccountable to the White House. Musk critics say his accusations are often lodged without evidence and may be ideologically driven. The rush of events has underlined Musk's powerful role in setting Trump's agenda. Last week, Musk's team at the Department of Government Efficiency gained access to the most sensitive payment systems at Treasury and locked some employees out of their agency's computers. At USAID, two senior security staff were put on leave after refusing to provide classified documents to DOGE employees on site over the weekend. Since then, dozens of USAID career staff have been put on leave. Three sources familiar with the matter said that USAID personal services contractors, who carry out the bulk of the work in the agency's humanitarian bureau, have also been locked out of their government accounts. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Some USAID staff waved signs as the lawmakers spoke, including one that read: 'USAID saves lives.' Democrats have argued that eliminating USAID's independence requires an act of Congress. Trump told reporters on Monday that he did not believe that was necessary. 'I love the concept (of USAID), but they turned out to be radical left lunatics,' Trump said. Rubio becomes acting USAID head U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting head of USAID, calling the agency 'completely unresponsive' and accusing the staff there of being 'unwilling to answer simple questions' about programs. 'If you go to mission after mission and embassy after embassy around the world, you will often find that in many cases, USAID is involved in programs that run counter to what we're trying to do in our national strategy with that country or with that region. That cannot continue,' Rubio said. He informed Congress in a letter of the looming reorganization of the agency, saying some parts of USAID might be absorbed by the State Department and the remainder may be abolished. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said she found Rubio's notification 'wholly insufficient on the law and devoid of any rationale for the drastic, abrupt action the administration has taken, with no prior notice to Congress.' In fiscal year 2023, the United States disbursed, partly via USAID, $72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024. And yet it is less than 1% of its total budget. The State Department issued worldwide stop-work directives after Trump's freeze order, with the exception of emergency food assistance. Experts warned that the move risks killing people. Since then, dozens of USAID career staff have been put on leave. Three sources familiar with the matter said that USAID personal services contractors, who carry out the bulk of the work in the agency's humanitarian bureau, have also been locked out of their government accounts. 'Without PSCs, there is no longer functionally a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance in USAID. The waivers from Secretary of State Rubio for emergency food and other urgent assistance are a smokescreen and farce if there is no one to make the awards happen,' a USAID official said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00tk8jkye	2025-02-04T00:46:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ByRmw30Oke/ByRmw30Oke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Will Netanyahu give in on the Palestinian state issue?	They say that Israel has to discuss a pathway to the creation of a Palestinian state... A pathway is a thing with gravel, it's not very significant Peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is once again on the table, but part of the Saudi criteria includes a pathway to a Palestinian state. Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren said this is something Israel could potentially agree to. 'They don't say that Israel has to discuss the creation of a Palestinian state,' Oren told ILTV. 'They say that Israel has to discuss a pathway to the creation of a Palestinian state. Now, if you ask me, a pathway is a thing with gravel, it's not very significant.' He noted that while Saudi Arabia is not a democratic government, it still has to consider public opinion. The kingdom must demonstrate to its people that, in exchange for making peace with Israel, it is taking action on the Palestinian issue. 'I think that Netanyahu would agree to discuss a pathway,' Oren said. 'He might even agree to some symbolic Palestinian Authority presence in Gaza on the day after, but his government won't, and he'll have a hard time—not only with the far-right wing of his government but perhaps with elements within his own Likud party.' However, Oren believes Netanyahu could return to his government and argue that the issue is important to Trump, whose support is crucial for Israel’s national security.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdxvujy1l	2025-02-04T00:01:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/08/19/HJyL5E9GD/HJyL5E9GD_0_38_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Despite the severe drought, desalination and water management efforts are preventing any immediate drinking water shortages. The last similar dry spell was in 2009. The Sea of Galilee, Israel’s main freshwater reservoir, barely rose this winter, and the Jordan River’s flow is at its lowest since 1960. The only significant rainfall came from one heavy downpour in the Carmel region, pushing local precipitation above average.

Iran working on secret 'shortcut' to nuclear bomb, report says	International outlet reports U.S. intelligence data delivered from Biden to Trump's administration suggests Iranian scientists working on clandestine plan to expedite development of a nuclear warhead Amid tensions between Tehran and Washington and former U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, 'We need to apply more pressure to Iran until they stop doing the activities that they’re doing.' In an interview with Fox News, he added, 'They’re [Iran] trying to ultimately get to a nuclear weapon.' Meanwhile, The New York Times reported on Tuesday that new intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program has convinced U.S. officials that a secret team of scientists in Tehran is exploring new development options. Sources said this intelligence was gathered in recent months under former U.S. president Joe Biden’s administration and passed to incumbent President Donal Trump's incoming national security team. The assessment warned that Iranian engineers and scientists are seeking a 'shortcut' to turn their growing stockpile of nuclear fuel into a functional weapon within months. U.S. officials still believe Iran, led by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, has not yet decided to build a nuclear weapon but suspect it may consider doing so as a deterrent against a potential U.S. or Israeli strike. According to the American outlet, Iran has the knowledge to develop a crude nuclear weapon using an outdated but faster method. Such a weapon wouldn’t be small enough for a ballistic missile and would likely be unreliable, making it less suitable for an immediate attack. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, officials warned that Iran could quickly develop a basic device, conduct a test and declare itself a nuclear power. While such a weapon might not be effective against Israel, it could serve as a deterrent. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump are set to discuss the Iranian threat in their meeting set for Tuesday. About a week and a half ago, Trump said 'it would be nice,' if the Iran issue could be resolved without Israel attacking its military facilities. When asked if he would support an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Trump said, 'I won’t answer that question.' In a previous Fox News interview, Trump stressed that Iran 'cannot have nuclear weapons.' The Financial Times recently reported that Trump was open to diplomatic solutions before increasing pressure on Tehran. A former senior Israeli official told the paper, 'I don’t see the Trump administration using force early on without at least trying other approaches. That doesn’t align with his stance that wars started under Biden and that he’s going to end them.' Iran has signaled its willingness to negotiate, though analysts believe any talks would be difficult for both sides. Iran’s Vice President Mohammad Mokhber recently said at the Davos Forum that he hopes Trump will be 'more serious, more focused and more realistic' in dealings with Tehran. He acknowledged the economic burden of sanctions but denied Tehran’s involvement in the activities of Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis, saying, 'We’ve never had proxies.'

After 15 months of captivity, Bibas family still awaits reunion	As Yarden reacclimates to life, his family have no answers to offer him about the fate of his wife Shiri and two sons, Kfir and Ariel; Members of the Bibas family now demand answers from the government On Monday evening, the Bibas family gave a statement to the press from Sheba Medical Center, two days after Yarden Bibas was released from Hamas captivity, while his wife Shiri and their children Ariel and Kfir remain in Gaza, with serious concerns for their safety. At the beginning of the statement, Yarden’s sister, Ofri Bibas Levy, said: 'We endured 484 days of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty, and now Yarden is home. Yarden is here and we’ve rediscovered what we already knew — how strong and amazing he is. 'We’ve learned how he survived hell with his sensitivity and humor, which are so characteristic of him. We look at him, hug him, and still can’t believe he’s here. He’s adjusting and learning about everything that happened. There’s a lot of information to process, some of it difficult to handle.' According to Ofri, 'Yarden says he was moved between many locations during his captivity, held in harsh conditions, with food often scarce and poor hygiene. He was exposed to little sunlight for long periods. Yarden also discovered that he and his family are no longer anonymous. He has realized how loved he and his family are. It moves him, but it’s not easy to cope with.' Ofri also referred to Shiri, Kfir and Ariel. She said, 'Yarden’s journey to recovery has only just begun, and it’s clear it won’t be complete until his family — Shiri, Ariel and Kfir — are home. My brother is back, but my sister-in-law and my nephews are not. 'Yarden asks about them, and I have no answers for him. I demand that the prime minister and the negotiation team provide us and him with answers. Our journey will not be complete until we have certainty about Shiri and the children’s fate and until all 79 captives are home.' Ofri also sent a message to Shiri and the children, who are still in captivity: 'We miss you so much and are waiting for you, now together with Yarden. I appeal to the prime minister and the ministers: you made the right decision in favor of the agreement. 'The price is heavy, but there is no price for life, freedom, and security. Today, negotiations for the next phase are supposed to begin. The challenges are great, but the commitment is clear—to bring everyone back, the living for recovery and the fallen for burial.' Later, Dana Silverman Seaton, Shiri’s sister, who rarely speaks out in public, also gave a statement. 'Two days ago, I finally managed to breathe a little after 15 months of hell in which I lost my parents, my friends, and my younger and only sister, Shiri, who was kidnapped along with my nephews Ariel and Kfir and her husband Yarden to Gaza,' she said. 'I am so happy I got to hug Yarden, hear his voice, and look into his eyes again,' she added. 'Yarden has only one question: Where are Shiri and the children? Three-quarters of our hearts are still held in captivity and until they return, we will remain incomplete. We will no longer accept uncertainty—we demand answers. We demand them back. It is the state’s duty to us after everything we’ve been through.' According to Dana, 'Shiri and her children were in their kibbutz, still wearing their pajamas, as the entire country and the world saw, and the state failed to protect them. It is the responsibility of the government and the state toward Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir, toward Yarden, toward me, toward our entire family, and toward every citizen who looks and asks whether the State of Israel knows how to protect its citizens. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I appeal to the Prime Minister and the members of the government: complete the deal in all its stages until the last captive is home. Do not let extreme voices derail the agreement,' she concluded. 'This is what distinguishes us from our enemies. Bring everyone back—the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial.' Earlier, relatives of Keith Siegel, who was released from captivity alongside Yarden and Ofer Kalderon on Saturday, also gave a statement. Keith’s daughter, Shir, said: '484 days of hell have passed for my father. A year and four months in the darkest, scariest place on earth. 'He says he was held in inhumane conditions by cruel terrorists who abused him mentally, physically, and emotionally. He barely saw daylight, was starved for long periods, and lost significant weight. He says he was held in harsh isolation conditions and sometimes lost hope of ever returning home.' After Shir spoke, Aviva, Keith’s wife, who was released in the previous deal in November 2023, also spoke. She thanked the Prime Minister and the negotiation team for their 'brave decisions,' as she put it, and added that Keith’s return highlights the urgency of bringing back all the captives. 'There are still 79 captives in Gaza. Everyone deserves to come home. All their families deserve to feel what we are feeling now.' Aviva thanked President Donald Trump for 'saving his life' and also thanked former U.S. president Joe Biden for 'supporting the family throughout the process.' After Yarden returned from captivity, the Bibas family said: 'Yarden is home. A quarter of our hearts has returned to us after 15 long months. Words cannot describe the relief of holding Yarden in our arms, hugging him, and hearing his voice. Yarden is home, but the home is incomplete.' 'Yarden is a father who left the shelter to protect his family, survived captivity heroically and returned to an unbearable reality. We continue to hope and call for the return of Shiri, the children, and all the captives. Please continue to amplify their voices and the urgency of their return. Help us echo this louder than ever. For Yarden and for everyone. We won’t stop until everyone is home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tzxscoye	2025-02-03T21:01:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/Bk5jGcs00Je/Bk5jGcs00Je_253_6_595_335_0_small.jpg

Terrorist opened toward Israelis near the Tayasir checkpoint, prompting forces in the area to engage before neutralizing him; two wounded in critical condition A terrorist opened fire at the Tayasir checkpoint in the West Bank on Tuesday, injuring at least seven Israelis, with two in critical condition according to the Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service. Security forces at the scene responded with gunfire, engaging the terrorist in a several-minute shootout before he was neutralized. Medical teams and additional forces were rushed to the area, nearby roads were blocked and the wounded were evacuated to hospitals by helicopter.

Gaza, the day after the war; four options for rule of the Strip	There is no doubt Hamas maintains its control over Gaza including policing, food distribution and more despite Israel's goal to remove it; some in Israel urge for mililtary control and settlements; PM must chose between ruling Gaza and normalization with Saudi Arabia The images of armed Hamas terrorists during the release of hostages in Gaza, leave little doubt. After a year and five months of war, Hamas, although weakened, is in full control of the Gaza Strip and the lives of its residents, despite Israel's declared goal to destroy the terror group and prevent it from ruling over the enclave. The future of Gaza will likely be discussed on Tuesday in the meeting of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump and may be connected to a larger deal that would include a normalization of ties with Saudi Arabia. For now, there are four possible options for who would rule Gaza after the war, each of them complex and critical for Israel and the civilians in Gaza. Hamas continues to rule the Strip Despite Israel's objections, Hamas may maintain its rule over Gaza. The terror group has thousands of armed members, a police force and a security agency. It also has local municipal workers already busy clearing some of the rubble from the destruction caused by the war. Until the cease-fire most of them avoided being affiliated with Hamas but since the truce was announced, they returned wearing their uniforms. Maintaining Hamas rule over Gaza may make rebuilding the strip more difficult. The mammoth task would require years and a flow of foreign donations. Hamas has been discussing the establishment of a civilian management committee run by Palestinian technocrats and members of the Palestinian Authority (PA) but refused any possible dissolution of its military wing. The terror group has been attempting to copy the Hezbollah model in Lebanon where the Iranian proxy was both a political party that had a seat at the cabinet table and also a military force. This would not be acceptable for the PA. A continued Hamas rule over Gaza poses a threat to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government because it had vowed to prevent any future that leaves Hamas the ruling power across the border. In fact, Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners have called for Israeli military control of the entire Strip and the establishment of settlements there. Israel conquers Gaza and established a military rule Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Israel to conquer Gaza. According to the cease-fire agreement, Israeli troops who are still deployed to the Netzarim Corridor in the center of the Strip and the Philadelphi Corridor to the south, will have to withdraw on day 22 of the deal from Netzarim and 20days later from Philadelphi. The release of all of the hostages named in the first phase of the deal relies on the pullback of troops. If Netanyahu decides not to move on to the second phase of the deal and orders the IDF to resume the war, he may also task the military with civilian matters such as the distribution of food and the collection of garbage. This would be detrimental to Netanyahu's efforts to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia and would require the backing of the United States, under the Trump administration. Trump said he wanted the war to end and all of the hostages to be returned. Palestinian Authority rule over Gaza The PA is considered the only alternative to a Hamas rule in the Strip but is opposed by Israel. Netanyahu has tried to avoid any Palestinian rule there and even denied that the PA had any role in the administration of the Rafah border crossing into Egypt, despite evidence to the contrary. The PA is weak in the West Bank and has failed in its military operations against Iran backed terror groups in Jenin and elsewhere. The PA insists they alone would rule the Strip after they were violently ousted by Hamas in 2007, but if they would be able to, remains in doubt. Israel tried to enlist local clans to take on the responsibilities of a civilian government but failed. The defense minister Yoav Gallant also tried to divide Gaza into several dozen sectors to be individually managed, but that has failed as well. According to a report in the New York Times, the role filled by the PA I Rafah could indicate that Netanyahu was backing down in his opposition under pressure from Trump and the Gulf states and may allow it to take on more responsibilities, perhaps in cooperation with international forces or 'contractors.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An international force American security contractors are already operating in the Netzarim corridor, conducting security checks for vehicles heading to the northern areas of the Strip to prevent Hamas from smuggling weapons and terrorists. Thus far there are only 100 people assigned to the job and other than Egypt and Qatar no other Arab county has chosen to participate. But in Israel there are those who are hoping and planning for an influx of foreign forces who would take control and fill governing positions. Israeli officials quoted in the New York Times said the use of foreign forces could expand, with the support of Saudi Arabia and the UAE but they would demand guarantees that a Palestinian state would be advanced or the agreement of the PA for their involvement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s18myacoyl	2025-02-03T13:30:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/BJlDkHodkg/BJlDkHodkg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Freed Palestinian terrorists go from jail to luxury hotel	The former prisoners now reside at Al Masa Hotel in Egypt’s new administrative capital, where they have access to a gym, café, and snooker rooms; As Egypt grapples with a severe economic crisis, some are asking: Who is footing the bill? On Jan. 25, following the release of four IDF lookouts—Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, and Daniella Gilboa—from Hamas captivity in Gaza, Egypt swiftly prepared to receive 70 Palestinian prisoners, many serving life sentences or lengthy prison terms, who were exiled as part of a ceasefire agreement. According to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Egyptian sources said some of the released prisoners would remain in Egypt for the duration of their exile, while others would later relocate to other destinations in the Arab world and Europe. However, based on images and footage of their accommodations, it is unclear why they would be in any hurry to leave Cairo. The prisoners were welcomed at the opulent Al-Massa Hotel ('The Diamond'), located in Egypt’s newly constructed administrative capital east of Cairo. Their reception was lavish, attended by senior figures from Hamas’ political bureau and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. According to Al Jazeera, hundreds of people gathered outside the hotel, chanting 'Allahu Akbar' in support of the released prisoners despite the heavy security presence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Reports suggest negotiations were ongoing to determine the prisoners’ long-term residences, with Cairo described as merely a 'transit point.' However, images and videos from the event at Al-Massa revealed a grand affair, with the prisoners wearing specially branded hats and scarves for the occasion. Several Arab media outlets also published footage of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal attending the celebration at the hotel. Since the initial reception, no further images have emerged from the hotel, but following the release of Israeli hostages Ofer Kalderon, Yarden Bibas, and Keith Siegel on Saturday, another group of deported Palestinian prisoners arrived in Egypt. The Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that the seven prisoners released that day were also taken to Al-Massa, which is effectively serving as their temporary residence. The paper published additional images and videos of the newly arrived prisoners. There have been claims that the released prisoners were unable to leave the hotel premises, but given the luxurious accommodations, it is unclear why they would want to. Al-Massa is far from a mere 'transit point'—it is a sprawling luxury complex featuring a grand lobby, elegantly designed rooms, restaurants, a large fitness center, a spa, and conference halls. The hotel also boasts a sports club, snooker rooms, a shooting range, a cinema, a café, and even a mosque. Previously managed by the Egyptian military’s engineering division, the hotel was later taken over by Marriott International and rebranded as The St. Regis Al-Massa. According to reports, it was the first hotel completed in Egypt’s new administrative capital. In recent days, social media users have questioned why this particular hotel was chosen to host the released prisoners. Another lingering question remains: who is funding their extended stay? Are Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups footing the bill, or is Egypt—grappling with its own severe economic crisis—covering the costs? >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjacaj0ukx	2025-02-03T12:28:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ryWQuwGCuye/ryWQuwGCuye_0_0_1280_694_0_small.jpg

Torturned, held in inhumane conditions, barely seeing sunlight' ...	Shir Siegal says her father was strengthened by knowledge that Israelis were fighting for he release but disheartened by the division and incitement in the country; says he chose to wrap himself with flag and walk despite pain and weakness Keith Siegal was tortured physically and emotionally, starved and held in inhuman conditions, his family said in a statement on Monday. Siegal who was released from Gaza on Saturday suffered extreme weight loss. Siegal barely saw sunlight, his daughter Shir, said. 'He was held in isolation and often lost hope of ever returning home. 'He was in the darkest and scariest place on earth,' she said. 'My father passed 484 days knowing each moment could be his last, and that the terrorists could execute him if the military pressure increased, as he knew had been the fate of others among the captives. He went through hell that no one would ever be able to understand. Shir said her father chose to wrap himself with an Israeli flag when he returned to Israel and was flown to the Soratzky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. 'He chose to walk, despite the pain and weakness but inside he was broken hearted over what happened to our community on Oct. 7 and what the people of Israel must still endure.' Siegal's daughter said her father drew strength from the public's fight for the release of hostages and from the military's efforts to find and rescue them. 'In contrast he was broken by the violence, the divide and the incitement among Israelis. One of his first questions to us was what could he do to help bring all of the hostages, home?' she said. Siegal asked about what had happened in Kfar Aza, his kibbutz and home from which he was abducted. 'We went over the cruel list of 64 deal and beloved people who were murdered. He could not believe how many of his friends and neighbors were massacred. People from our community who will never return. My father came back to life and is begging us not to miss any more opportunities to save the hostages who are alive and bring those who are dead, to burial.' Shir said she had feared she would never see the moment that her father returned and had often lost hope fearing the worse. She then turned her comments to the families of fallen soldiers who died in the war. 'I am sorry bereavement came to your door so that we receive life. I apologize to civilians, soldiers and members of the security forces who sacrificed their lives for us, for the country and the security of each and every citizen. I apologize and am grateful,' she said.

Trump's comments came ahead of his Tuesday meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House and as negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire deal were to begin. Netanyahu had not sent a delegation to the negotiations and was reportedly considering removing Mossad chief David Barnea as the head of Israel's negotiating team and replacing him with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.

Smotrich outlines Gaza, West Bank deal breakers before Trump-Neta...	Far-right finance minister says complete destruction of Hamas is a non-negotiable goal before any ceasefire; rejects concessions on the Philadelphi Corridor. stresses security concerns ahead of the Trump-Netanyahu meeting on Gaza and Saudi normalization Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday drew the red lines he would not allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cross ahead of his meeting on Tuesday with U.S. President Donald Trump and the start of negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. 'For example, leaving the Philadelphi Corridor is a red line for me,' Smotrich said at the start of the Religious Zionism faction meeting. 'The joy over the return of every hostage is immense and deeply moving for every Israeli and Jew. However, we cannot ignore the price we are paying and the harsh images we are witnessing in Gaza—scenes of Hamas asserting its rule and control, and the cruelty and bloodthirsty hatred of many Gazans who support Hamas.' Smotrich said the war cannot end before Hamas is completely destroyed. 'If, heaven forbid, we do not achieve this, it will only be a matter of time before they regroup and launch the next massacre. We are determined and are preparing for this.' Netanyahu far-right coalition partner threatened to bring down the government if the prime minister proceeds to the next phase of the deal. He said he woudl support a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations but 'they must be based on truth and not on lies, such as the notion that Arabs have national rights in the Land of Israel,' he said. 'Furthermore, they must not come at the expense of the security of Israeli citizens, which includes achieving the objectives of the war: destroying Hamas’ military and governmental power, removing the threat, and returning all the hostages.' Smotrich told his faction that an agreement with Saudi Arabia cannot, come alongside providing hope to the terror-supporting Palestinian Authority or to Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza for the establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the State of Israel.' Earlier, Itamar Ben-Gvir head of the Otzma Yehudit Party who resigned from the government after the cease-fire deal was agreed, calling it a catastrophe, also addressed the Netanyahu-Trump meeting during his faction’s meeting. 'Netanyahu must return with commitments to resume fighting and dismantle Hamas. Without returning to the fight and toppling Hamas’ rule, any other declaration he receives will not change the unfortunate fact that the war’s objective has not been achieved. As long as there is no government willing to dismantle Hamas’ rule, I do not see myself—and Otzma Yehudit will not return—to the government.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Before departing for Washington, Netanyahu told reporters that in his meetings with Trump and other senior officials in the new Republican administration, he would discuss 'the critical issues before us: defeating Hamas, returning our hostages, and confronting the Iranian axis in all its forms—an axis that threatens Israel’s security, the Middle East, and the entire world.' 'The decisions we made during the war, combined with the bravery of IDF soldiers, have already changed the face of the Middle East,' Netanyahu continued. 'They have changed it beyond recognition. I believe that through hard work with President Trump, we can change it even more for the better.' 'We can strengthen Israel’s security, expand the circle of peace even further, and bring about a wonderful era we never dreamed of—an era of prosperity, security, and peace through strength. The strength of our soldiers, the strength of our citizens, the strength of Israel, and the strength of the alliance between Israel and the United States,' Netanyahu concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byhibu000yl	2025-02-03T09:56:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/01/rkXCYv7lvR/rkXCYv7lvR_0_115_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Jordan faces regional pressures as King Abdullah prepares for Whi...	Controversial proposal to resettle Gazans outside their territory has drawn strong regional opposition, all while Jordan is dealing with domestic unrest and a strained economy Jordan’s King Abdullah II is set to visit the White House later this month for a high-stakes meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Jordanian royal palace announced Sunday. This will be their first face-to-face discussion since Trump returned to office and revived a controversial idea: relocating Gazans outside their territory, a proposal that has been met with strong opposition from Jordan, Egypt, and other regional actors. Jordan’s firm rejection of Gaza resettlement Trump recently revealed that he had spoken with Abdullah about the matter, urging Jordan to accept some of Gaza’s population. 'I’d love you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess,' he told reporters aboard Air Force One. He left open the question of whether such resettlement would be temporary or permanent, stating, 'Could be either.' Abdullah has strongly rejected the proposal, reiterating Jordan’s long-standing position that Palestinians must remain on their land and obtain their legitimate rights through a two-state solution. During a meeting with European officials in Brussels last week, the king emphasized that Jordan would not support any alternative homeland for Palestinians. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi echoed this stance, as did foreign ministers from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar during a recent meeting in Cairo. In a joint statement, they condemned any attempts to displace Palestinians, forcibly or otherwise. This latest dispute comes as Jordan navigates a complex and evolving regional landscape. Long considered a stabilizing force in the Middle East, the Hashemite Kingdom now finds itself at the center of multiple crises, including shifting US policies, security threats at its borders, and growing domestic discontent over economic conditions. This proposal has further intensified tensions, with critics condemning it as forced displacement. MENA political analyst Dr. Nicolai Due-Gundersen, author of Defending Dictatorships, told The Media Line that while Jordan has historically taken in refugees—including those from the 1948 and 1967 wars, the Gulf conflicts, and the Syrian civil war—it is now at a breaking point. 'Jordan may not be willing to receive further refugees at a time when it is already stretched thin,' he said, citing economic difficulties and high youth unemployment. Jordanian political analyst Amer Sabaileh raised additional concerns, warning that an influx of refugees from Gaza could introduce security risks. 'We have seen how radical groups can exploit refugee crises, and this is a scenario Jordan must be prepared to prevent,' he told The Media Line. He further warned that the pressure may not stop with Gaza. 'Now Jordan is pressured into taking people from Gaza as a first wave. Later, the Trump administration may demand Jordan take in refugees from the West Bank as well. This is simply not manageable.' The case of Ahlam al-Tamimi In a separate development, Hamas’ Al-Aqsa TV reported that Jordan had sought the deportation of Ahlam al-Tamimi, a Palestinian terrorist convicted for her role in the 2001 Sbarro pizzeria bombing in Jerusalem, which killed 16 people, including two US citizens. Tamimi has lived in Jordan since her 2011 release in a prisoner exchange. The United States has long sought her extradition and continues to offer a $5 million reward for information leading to her capture. In 2022, Interpol dropped its warrant for Tamimi’s arrest, but US authorities still consider her a high-priority target. Jordan has not publicly commented on the report from Hamas’ media wing, and it remains unclear whether the government has taken formal steps to extradite her. The Palestinian identity debate in Jordan With nearly 2.2 million registered Palestinian refugees, Jordan holds the largest Palestinian population outside Palestine. The question of Palestinian identity has long shaped Jordan’s domestic politics, but some analysts believe the monarchy has over-prioritized Palestinian advocacy at the expense of national interests. 'Jordan made a huge mistake promoting itself as more Palestinian than the Palestinians,' Sabaileh argued, contending that this approach has led to resentment among Jordanian citizens. Due-Gundersen noted that Jordan’s support for Palestine plays a role in maintaining stability, but warned that agreeing to Trump’s plan could backfire, feeding into the argument that 'Jordan is Palestine'—a narrative the monarchy vehemently opposes. At the same time, Abdullah must manage growing domestic frustrations over Israeli policies while maintaining Jordan’s security cooperation with Israel. 'The king will likely not wish to fully freeze relations with Israel for security and intelligence reasons,' Due-Gundersen explained. However, this balancing act has sparked public protests, particularly among Jordan’s Palestinian population. Security threats at Jordan’s borders Beyond the political ramifications of the Gaza issue, Jordan faces ongoing security threats, particularly from narcotrafficking along its borders. The smuggling of Captagon, an amphetamine widely produced in Syria, has become a growing concern for Jordanian authorities. 'The network of Captagon and weapons smuggling was centralized under [Syrian President Bashar] Assad,' Due-Gundersen explained. 'Weapons smuggling drew more on tribes and networks close to the Syria-Jordan border on both sides.' Jordanian security forces have intercepted nearly 17 million Captagon pills in 2023 alone, highlighting the scale of the problem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sabaileh emphasized the level of organization behind the drug trade. 'It’s not drug trading, it’s narcotrafficking. When we talk about narcotrafficking, it’s more organized, more sophisticated with local partners. Nobody sends a huge amount of drugs to the borders if you don’t have a local dealer.' Jordan’s next steps As Jordan prepares for King Abdullah’s meeting with Trump, the stakes are high. Abdullah must navigate US pressure while safeguarding Jordan’s national interests and security. The rejection of forced Palestinian resettlement remains a cornerstone of Jordanian policy, but the kingdom’s broader geopolitical and domestic challenges require careful maneuvering. Due-Gundersen predicted that Jordan will likely maintain its role as a buffer state while resisting the relocation of Gaza’s population. 'While it may refuse to take in refugees from Gaza, it still hosts Syrian refugees, and with uncertainty remaining over Syria’s transition, it is possible that aid will continue to flow from various donors to Amman.' Sabaileh, however, cautioned that Jordan cannot rely on external aid indefinitely. 'Nobody wants to see Jordan collapse, but ultimately, its stability depends on the actions of its own leadership and people. Without proactive internal reforms and strategic decision-making, external support alone will not be enough to safeguard the country’s future.' As Jordan charts its course in an increasingly unstable region, the coming weeks will test Abdullah’s leadership, diplomatic skills, and ability to balance competing domestic and international pressures.

Ofer was put through hell in captivity, up until the last moment,...	Calderon tells family of the physical and psychological terror the hostages endure in the hands of Hamas; Cousin says images of joy in first days and hours, misleading, says Ofer drew strength from seeing family members protesting for his release Ofer Calderon who was released by Hamas on Saturday after 484 days in captivity told family members that the hostages endured physical and psychological terror of the worse kind, up until they were released. He said those who remain captive in the hands of the terrorists are in under imminent threat of death, after 38 hostages had already died. Calderon said he was able to see Al Jazeera coverage of the protests demanding his and the other hostages' release and recognized some of his family members. 'It strengthened him. In captivity you hang onto little things and seeing the family fighting for him was everything,' his cousin Eyal told Ynet. 'These things are critical to their survival there,' he said. Calderon's two children Sahar and Erez who were released in the first exchange in November, 2023. His parting words to Sahar were 'Fight for me. I don't want to die in the tunnels.' Calderon was released along with Yarden Bibas and soon after, Keith Siegal was also freed. The three men arrived in Israel walking on their own feet and appearing strong. Eyal warned that the images of the hostages who were freed were misleading. 'We've become experienced after Erez and Sahar's return. At first there is so much joy but very quickly there is an understanding that things are more complex. These images of adrenaline in the first hours and days, do not reflect the real condition of the hostages,' he said. 'It's difficult to understand or describe his emotions. He was held by a terror group that could do whatever they wanted with him.' Eyal vowed that the family will continue the fight for the release of the remaining 79 Israelis still in Gaza. He said the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal must not be foiled. 'My fight was to bring Ofer home. Now I will go on fighting for all the others.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1gimprd1g	2025-02-03T06:50:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/S10k9Piukl/S10k9Piukl_167_98_1007_566_0_small.jpg

Set be to released from Hamas captivity, Eli Sharabi faces an exc...	After months in captivity, Eli Sharabi returns to a shattered life—his wife and daughters murdered, his brother gone; His family prepares to support him as he faces unimaginable grief and the challenge of rebuilding his life from scratch 'I'm going through endless, overwhelming days. For the first time, I feel like I understand what the hostages must be experiencing, counting the seconds in the tunnels. When will Eli finally walk out of there on his own two feet?' said Sharon Sharabi, the brother of Eli Sharabi, who is set to be released in the first stage of the deal, and of Yossi Sharabi, who was murdered while in captivity in Gaza. Eli’s wife, Lian, and their two daughters, Yahel and Noya, were murdered on October 7. 'When we found out Yossi was murdered, I said to myself: we failed. When Eli comes home, I’ll say we succeeded,' Sharon explained. 'It’s not just me—an entire nation feels the same way. It feels like all our hearts are bursting with excitement. But alongside that, there’s so much pain. Pain for October 7, for these past 16 months, for the brother Eli lost, for his wife and daughters who are no longer with us. After everything he’s been through, he’s coming back to a completely different reality—a nightmare. Without his wife and daughters, without a home. 'I don’t think there’s any chance he knows Yossi didn’t survive. Maybe he knows about Lian and the girls—maybe some terrorist told him—but not about Yossi. When he comes back and finds out, his world is going to shatter all over again,' Sharon added. 'I don’t know how you prepare for such an insane situation. How do we tell him? When? There are no words that can comfort him after such devastating news. All we can do is hug him, show him that we’re here for him, and never leave his side.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharon shared that the first thing he’ll do after Eli comes home is mourn. The second is to help Eli rebuild his life. 'These are my life’s missions,' he said. 'I’m full of faith and hope that Eli will find his way out of this loop of grief and hold on to life. I’ve been listening to testimonies, learning, and processing—it might be similar to what Eli is experiencing. I know I’ll need to be the strong person by his side. Strong, but also sensitive.' Their mother will wait for Eli in Kibbutz Re’im. 'She’s so eager to see her survivor,' Sharon said, adding that he plans to meet his brother at the hospital. 'But this immense excitement is accompanied by a sense of loss. I know Yossi could have been on that same helicopter. We failed as a country in a big way. They were there far too long, and there were opportunities to save lives. The hostages are coming home, and we’re grateful to the politicians who were involved, but the ones who truly paved the way to bring them home were the IDF soldiers who gave their lives, and the bereaved families whose loved ones were murdered by the terrorists now being released. They’re the ones who deserve our gratitude.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkel0b0uyx	2025-02-03T06:00:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/SyLWkDsV4ye/SyLWkDsV4ye_0_41_1280_721_0_small.jpg
IDF expands West Bank counter-terror operation, residents flee	Jenin mayor says forces duplicating their offensive on Gaza, warns his city will be abandoned; Tulkarm mayor says Israel changing refugee camps' demographics The IDF has been conducting a counter-terror operation in the northern West Bank for the past 13 days, concentrating on the cities of Jenin and Tulkarm and their surroundings and on the villages bordering with the Jordan Valley. The aim is to destroy terror infrastructure, clear explosive devices on main routes and kill or arrest terrorists. An explosive and weapon-production lab was found and destroyed in Tulkarm and five suspects were detained. At the same time, forces detained terror suspects in Jenin and prepared the surrounding for an extensive stay in the refugee camp. As of Sunday, security forces said 35 people were killed and Palestinian sources said 29 of them were in Jenin while dozens more were hurt. Tulkarm governor Abdullah Kamil said on Monday that half of the city's residents fled. 'Tow hospitals are under siege, soldiers are attacking civilians in their homes, vandalizing and burning houses and destroying furniture in some,' he said. 'Israel is changing the camps' demographics and fighting every Palestinian, not only in the refugee camps.' He accused Israel of taking advantage of the presence of armed militants in villages and towns and that 1,500 families have been displaced from the city. The IDF said it was evacuating uninvolved civilians from the fighting, for their safety. They are allowed to leave through passageways after security checks. Jenin mayor and the governor of Tubas called for international intervention. 'Half the city's neighborhoods have been cut off from water and electricity,' Jenin mayor Mohammed Jerar said. 'The Israeli operation is a repeat of what has happened in Gaza. The city will be abandoned if this goes on.'

Crime cell stole over a ton of medical cannabis from licensed far...	Officers in central Israel arrest group that moved over one ton of medical cannabis to criminal bodies throughout the country while masquerading as legal drug handlers; Health Ministry shuts down licensed farm The Israel Police recently uncovered the theft of over 1.2 tons of medical cannabis from a licensed farm to criminal groups in Israel and arrested four suspects who posed as security guards involved in the crime. The case emerged in early December when central Israel detectives stopped a suspicious vehicle carrying two men with fake security credentials and 300 kilograms (661 lbs) of medical cannabis. The four suspects were indicted and the farm was shut down. The investigation found that the suspects used a sophisticated scheme, posing as security personnel legally transporting the drug while actually delivering the stolen cannabis to a secret warehouse in Azaria, a moshav in central Israel near Ramle, where two other accomplices awaited. Police uncovered five such transfers, totaling 1.281 tons. Due to the severity of the case and public safety risks, Israel Police Central District Commander Deputy Commissioner Yair Hetsroni issued an administrative closure order for the farm, later upheld by the court. The district's legal advisor also contacted the Health Ministry’s medical cannabis unit, which immediately revoked the farm’s license. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following the investigation, prosecutors filed severe charges against the four suspects.

Hamas official tells Russia hostage Alexander Trupanov 'will be f...	During visit to Russia, Musa Abu Marzook says Trupanov, abducted from his home in Nir Oz on October 7, will be released 'despite being a soldier' as a gesture to Moscow Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzook, during a visit to Moscow on Sunday, told Russia's Sputnik network that hostage Alexander (Sasha) Trupanov would be released soon. 'He will be freed in the first stage despite being a soldier,' Marzook said, calling it a gesture to Russia for its stance on the Palestinian issue. Abu Marzook also addressed the case of hostage Maxim Herkin, a Donbas native, saying his release would be decided in the negotiations about the cease-fire deal’s second phase with Israel. 'Hamas is ready to make him a top priority,' he said. Abu Marzook, Hamas' deputy political leader, is leading the terror group's delegation in meetings with Russian officials as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the U.S. for talks on the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Russia's RIA news agency reported that the Hamas delegation was holding talks with senior Russian officials 'as part of Moscow's engagement with key Middle East players, including Israel, Iran, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.' Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov told the news channel Rossiya 24 two weeks ago that Hamas leadership gave Moscow a 'firm commitment' that Trupanov 'will be released alive and well.' He said that 'Alexander Trupanov could be freed from Gaza within three to four weeks,' referring to a framework in which he was among 33 hostages set for release in the first stage as part of the sick and wounded category slated for release. He added that Moscow had information that Trupanov was wounded in Gaza. A day earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered efforts to be intensified to secure the release of Herkin, 36, from Tirat Carmel, who is not on the list of 33 hostages set for release. The previous week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow 'expects the release of hostage Sasha Trupanov from Gaza as part of the deal.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Russia welcomed the agreement and had raised 'the issue of his swift return home in our ongoing contacts with Hamas representatives.' Russia sought obligations from Hamas that Trupanov would be included in the deal. Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov spoke with Abu Marzook and, days earlier, with Hamas' foreign leader Khaled Mashal. Russia said Palestinian officials expressed appreciation for Moscow's efforts to support Palestinian rights and its stance on the issue. The officials were also briefed on cease-fire talks, with Bogdanov urging Hamas to ensure Trupanov's release. Trupanov, 29, an Israeli resident who also holds Russian citizenship, was kidnapped on October 7 along with his mother, Yelena, grandmother, Irina and girlfriend, Sapir Cohen, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The three women were released in the first hostage deal in late November 2023 after 54 and 55 days in captivity. His father, Vitaly, was murdered by a Hamas terrorist. The Islamic Jihad terror group has released several videos of Trupanov in captivity, the most recent about two months ago. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ie0xaojx	2025-02-03T03:42:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/Sk24uZ2v1e/Sk24uZ2v1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Pilots on the ground in the West Bank: The Air Force's surprising...	Pilots joined soldiers in arrest operations in Operation Iron Wall as part of new program; 'The mission of assisting the ground forces has reached a very high level in Gaza and Lebanon - we will continue to train for effectiveness in all sectors,' said deputy squadron commander; Meanwhile, the IDF and Shin Bet plan to expand the use of airstrikes The Israeli Air Force has launched a new program, which is intended to strengthen cooperation between ground forces operating in Operation Iron Wall in the West Bank with pilots and air crew members. The program was initiated by Air Force Commander, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, and as part of it the deputy commander of the Operation Strike Squadron in the sector participates every few days in arrest operations with ground forces in West Bank villages and cities. The deputy commander of Squadron 109 last week joined a complex operation in the West Bank under the command of the reserve battalion of the 8109th Samaria Brigade. Over the course of a day, the deputy commander of the squadron spent time with the battalion's commanders and fighters, learning up close the combat methods, challenges and threats in the field, and gaining a new perspective on the needs of the ground forces. At the same time, the ground forces commanders were exposed to the depth of the Air Force's operational concept, which contributes to improving operational coordination. The program offers creative solutions to strengthen and deepen air-ground cooperation, drawing lessons from events in the Iron Swords War. 'I arrived at the Samaria Air Force Base to get to know the area and the missions up close, and in the future to better assist soldiers on the ground in any complex event that may develop in the sector,' said the deputy commander of Squadron 109, Major Y. 'The mission of assisting the ground forces has reached a very high level in Gaza and Lebanon, and we will continue to train and practice so that we are effective in all sectors, at all times.' Cooperation between ground forces and air forces has become an indispensable product in the war in various sectors. 'What would have taken hours a few months ago now happens in minutes. The battalion commander in the field knows what he wants to attack, and the target is attacked within minutes,' explains a security source. Operation Iron Wall, for example, began with an opening blow that included air strikes in the heart of the Jenin refugee camp. With the expansion of the operation to Tulkarm, the IDF has continued to use aircraft to attack terrorist cells from the air. In recent years, airstrikes have become a central tool in the West Bank, and are used to thwart fleeing terrorists, prevent attacks, neutralize IEDs, and even strike during ongoing attacks. The Shin Bet and the IDF plan to expand the use of this tool, and over the coming weeks pilots and squadron commanders will stay in various sectors in the West Bank each for 24 hours, in order to improve cooperation with ground forces. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Overnight between Saturday and Sunday, the IDF expanded its activity in the West Bank, alongside the release of Palestinian terrorists as part of the deal to release hostages, and announced the entry of the Bislah Brigade combat team forces into the Palestinian village of Tamun, where IED terrorism has recently begun to develop. On Sunday afternoon, the IDF announced that as part of the operation to thwart terrorism in the northern West Bank, the IDF destroyed buildings in Jenin that were used as terrorist infrastructure. Dramatic footage shows the moment the houses were blown up, and according to the Palestinians, nearly 20 buildings in the Jenin refugee camp were blown up. The operation in Tamun began with a ground maneuver by the forces, with the main focus of the operation being a rapid entry into the village for various purposes of locating, seizing, and entrenching. At the same time, the IDF attacked from the air with an opening strike, followed by the arrival of heavy equipment - excavators and bulldozers - which opened up traffic routes for the ground forces, so that they could begin searching for weapons and arresting suspects. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjp5pm0uyl	2025-02-03T02:19:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkGag81Tuyx/rkGag81Tuyx_0_204_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The 'Smurfs' who fought for Ofer Calderon's release	Members of cycling group that former hostage was a part of recall their efforts to keep him in their hearts and minds at all times and their short reunion before his arrival at the hospital As former hostage Ofer Calderon arrived at the hospital in Israel, he took a moment to ask the van to stop so he could wave to a group of longtime friends – members of 'The Smurfs' cycling group who had waited 15 months for his return. The group, active for over a decade, dedicated every ride in recent months to his safe return. Unable to stay home at the time of his release, they cycled to the closest point they could reach. 'We're a unique group from all over the country. We've been riding together for 13 years,' said Navit Hermesh, one of the group’s veteran members. 'We meet in small teams and take an annual trip abroad.' Attorney Shai Rave, known as 'Papa Smurf' among the riders, explained: 'During the week, we’re busy with work, but we ride together on Fridays. We have 30–40 members of all ages and we love riding in the Judean Desert, the Gaza border region and the Golan Heights. Our full name is 'The Smurfs: Riders, Reasonable and Mediocre.'' Since the October 7 attack and Calderon's abduction, the group remained focused on that day. 'It's been a troubling time,' Hermesh said. 'The worst part was losing Oren Goldin, the youngest in our group, who was murdered in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. He was the first to leave the gate, leaving behind a wife and twins.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We stay in touch with his family and held a memorial ride for him,' she added. 'When Ofer was kidnapped, it felt like the ground was pulled from under us. We barely rode for six months, focusing instead on keeping his memory alive. Seeing him again felt like our hearts began beating again.' 'We carried signs with Ofer’s name In every ride in Israel and abroad,' Rave added. 'We wrote his name on stones. He was always with us – at work, at home. I have a picture of him in my office. People talk about the families of the victims and hostages, but each of them also has close-knit circles of friends. We felt like Ofer’s family.' 'I had an 'Our heart is held captive' necklace, half of which symbolized Ofer,' Hermesh noted. 'It stayed with me through difficult times and I can't wait to give it to him when we meet.' Calderon was flown to the hospital by the son of a fellow Smurf. 'That’s how we got live updates about his flight,' Hermesh said. 'We planned to meet at a friend's house in Ramat Gan and ride to the hospital. When we arrived at the helipad, the security realized they had no choice but to let us follow the car taking him to the ward. 'When he stepped out of the car, he was only 10 meters away, waving and smiling. I couldn’t hold back — I lay down on the grass. We’re in a completely different place now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skgjll0d1e	2025-02-03T00:51:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rJd311T300yl/rJd311T300yl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Despite denials, Palestinian Authority is managing Gaza's Rafah C...	Senior officials confirm that Israel has given up its presence at the Rafah crossing, which contributed to delay of the hostage deal; The PA operates the crossing together with international parties, but the government hid this from the public The Rafah crossing has been operating for two days, managed in cooperation with Palestinian Authority officials, contrary to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements. Among the PA officials involved in running the crossing are senior Fatah official who manage it in cooperation with a special European force and with Egyptian security officials who assist in securing the place from Islamist Salafi terrorist elements. Israel is involved for the time being with approving those who cross it, and only in one direction: out of Gaza. Contrary to denials from Netanyahu's office, the official spokesman for the Palestinian Authority police, Louy Izriqat, told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth Sunday that Fares a-Rifi has been appointed to manage the police station at the Rafah Crossing, which opened Sunday. Rifi, a resident of Gaza City, was a police officer in the central governorates of the Gaza Strip on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, and holds a bachelor's degree in law and an advanced degree in police science from the Police College in Yemen. He is considered an active Fatah figure in the Gaza Strip. His brother congratulated him in a post: 'The legitimate Palestinian police are the ones who will control and maintain security at the Rafah crossing under the command of Fares a-Rifi.' The Palestinian force stationed there includes seven policemen and two policewomen, all of whom previously worked on behalf of the PA at the border crossings of the Gaza Strip, and are now returning to work in the same role. The political sensitivity of the issue in Israel is clear to everyone, which is why Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas asked his people not to be interviewed. However, Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth learned that for many weeks now PA officials, in cooperation with Egyptian intelligence, have been in feverish contact with IDF officials, the Civil Administration, the Coordinator of Government Activities, and the Shin Bet in Cairo to prepare the cooperation that led to the opening of the Rafah crossing. The Palestinian Authority began preparations to control the crossing over the past month. The head of the Palestinian Authority's crossings authority Nazmi Mohanna, a resident of Jericho, and the deputy director general of the PA's Ministry of Civil Affairs Ayman Qandil, a Ramallah resident, have been intensively attending meetings with security officials in Egypt in order to open and manage the Rafah crossing. Mahmoud al-Habbash, an adviser to Abbas, said that 'the Rafah crossing will be managed according to the 2005 agreement, that's all.' The 'crossings agreement' concluded between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 2005 stipulates that the Rafah crossing will be managed by the Palestinian Authority, in cooperation with Egypt, and under the supervision of a force from the European Union. According to a senior Palestinian official, the PA was instructed not to mention the new management and procedures at the Rafah crossing so as not to upset Israel. The obstacle to the deal The sensitivity of operating the crossing in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority is twofold, and stems from internal political reasons in Israel. This is one of the internal coalition reasons why the Israeli government and its leader delayed the deal for at least six months, and some argue since the collapse of the previous deal. The first reason: The IDF and security officials have claimed over the past year that there can be no military victory that does not include Israeli rule over all of Gaza, without creating an alternative to Hamas. The professional consensus was that a 'day after' solution must be promoted in the Strip to prevent Hamas rule and that it must include the PA, with international financial and manpower reinforcements. Netanyahu, whether this was his own opinion or fear of the coalition falling apart, claimed that he would not give the Palestinian Authority any foothold, thereby effectively thwarting discussions about the day after. The second reason: As part of the obstacles Netanyahu added to his demands in the deal after the parties were very close to an agreement, he demanded control of the Rafah crossing. 'I and one other minister (Ron Dermer) were the only ones in the war cabinet who prevented the Palestinian Authority from controlling the Rafah Crossing,' he said on one occasion. 'We will not allow the Palestinian Authority to control the Gaza Strip, and we are working to thwart any of its control.' In the hasty press conference he convened in September, after the murder of the six hostages in the Tel a-Sultan tunnel and to explain why he opposed the deal, Netanyahu called the Rafah Crossing and the Philadelphi Corridor 'Hamas' oxygen pipeline,' and declared that Israel would not withdraw from them. The Rafah crossing did not appear to interest Netanyahu until he raised it as one of the obstacles to the deal. On the morning of July 3, intelligence sources estimated that Hamas was going to give a relatively positive answer, though with many more difficulties and insistences. By the evening, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich already knew that 'I would not be surprised if suddenly, after months of refusal, Sinwar responds positively to the offer he received for the deal.' This is to say that everything must be done to prevent the deal, which Israel had proposed. The next day, Sinwar did give the same relatively positive answer that was received by large parts of the negotiating team who thought there was a chance of a breakthrough. Then, suddenly, on July 11, in Netanyahu's speech at the end of an officers' course at the 1st Battalion, nine months after the outbreak of the war, the Israeli presence at the crossing and at Netzarim is mentioned as a condition that Israel will not give up. 'We will not allow weapons smuggling to Hamas from Egypt, first and foremost through Israeli control of the Philadelphia route and the Rafah crossing,' he said. Six months passed, during which many hostages and soldiers died, and a deal was concluded in which Netanyahu withdrew from almost all of the conditions that had sabotaged the previous deal. On January 22, the Arabi-language, London-based Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported that an agreement had been reached on the mechanism for controlling the Rafah crossing - which the IDF took over in May. According to a source in the joint cease-fire monitoring team, 'the parties reached an agreement regarding the management of the crossing on the Palestinian side. It was agreed that it would be managed by the Palestinian Authority, under international supervision and monitoring by the UN.' The Prime Minister's Office denied this: 'The report is not true despite the Palestinian Authority's attempts to create a false impression that it controls the crossing. According to the agreement, IDF forces surround the crossing and no one passes through it without prior control, supervision and approval from the IDF and the Shin Bet.' The statement also said that the 'technical management within the crossing is carried out by non-Hamas Gazans, who are vetted by the Shin Bet, and who have been managing civil services in the Strip since the beginning of the war, such as electricity, water, and sewage. Their work is supervised by the international force EUBAM.' This formulation denies without actually denying the main point and the documents have not been made public. The agreement is vague The appendix to the main agreement states in Article 5 that 'the Rafah Crossing will be ready for the transfer of civilians and wounded after the release of all women (civilians and soldiers). Israel will work to prepare the crossing as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement.' The agreement explicitly states that the forces will only 'redeploy around the Rafah Crossing in accordance with the attached maps.' In other words, the IDF and Israel will not be present at the crossing itself. In addition, it was stated that '50 wounded fighters will be allowed to cross daily, accompanied by three people. Each crossing will require Israeli and Egyptian approval.' It also stated that 'the crossing will be activated in accordance with the discussions that took place with Egypt in August 2024.' The words '50 wounded fighters' refer to 50 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who will leave for Egypt daily, accompanied by three additional people who may also be Hamas members. The agreement stipulates that the lists of those who are to pass, provided by the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry, will be given the day before to Egypt and Israel, who will have to approve them. It is likely that Israel will not let senior Hamas figures leave, but will let everyone else. Fifty Hamas members a day is a lot, even if it is only for the first phase of the cease-fire. At the moment, this is a one-way passage: only from Gaza to Egypt, and not the other way around. Therefore, at least for now, from Israel's perspective a Hamas member who leaves cannot return according to a vague agreement. Israel says that this matter should be discussed as part of the second phase of the deal. It is still unclear how the mediating countries will approach the matter and whether they will also demand the opening of the other direction. The Rafah Crossing was destroyed and burned in the fighting that Israel waged when it entered it in early May. The crossing facilities are unusable, so the mediators, together with the PA, had to bring in several temporary structures to carry out the checks and procedures for leaving Gaza. All of this is happening in the meantime in a way that is hidden from the Israeli public due to political reasons, but as stated in the agreement between Israel and Hamas. But the big question is how long the agreement will last, and whether the parties will be able to reach an agreement on the second phase. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Negotiations regarding the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal are scheduled to begin no later than Sunday, 16 days after the cease-fire came into effect. Senior officials in Israel and the mediating countries expressed serious concern on Sunday that it will blow up. Some fear that in between two weeks and a month Israel will announce that the negotiations - within the framework of which the remaining living hostages are supposed to return and the IDF is supposed to withdraw from the Strip - have run aground and are in fact hopeless because Muhammad Sinwar is making unreasonable demands. These words were echoed over the weekend in a report through channels which says that 'an understanding has formed' in Israel that Hamas will not return the remaining live hostages and therefore Israel will be forced to return to war. Military sources, including those whose work is related to the negotiating team, said that Israel does not have such information. 'Basically, nothing is coming together,' says a senior Israeli official. 'To conclude and finalize the Saudi deal, which will also include an international solution for Gaza and allow Netanyahu to risk dissolving the government, it will take no less than four months. To sign a second phase of the deal in the immediate term, Netanyahu will have to take a risk and take it without all the 'goodies' of a Saudi normalization deal. And that, he will tell Trump, is too big a risk. That's why the deal is destined to explode.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkd00iz0o1l	2025-02-03T00:36:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/B1Je4Ppdyg/B1Je4Ppdyg_0_156_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Musk says shutting down USAID in government efficiency drive	Billionaire Elon Musk, who is heading U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to shrink the federal government, gave an update on the effort early Monday, saying they are working to shut down the U.S. foreign aid agency USAID.

Netanyahu in US as phase 2 hostage release negotiations begin: Th...	From humanitarian aid to the withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor: The prime minister is in Washington and will meet with Mideast envoy Witkoff to begin negotiations for phase two of the deal; Even after the opening of the Rafah crossing and the return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip, Israel still has leverage in case of future violations by Hamas; This is Netanyahu's schedule for the week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in Washington Sunday night for a week of meetings ahead of the fifth round of hostage releases on Saturday and looking ahead to phase two of the deal. On Monday the prime minister will meet with Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, in what will mark the opening of negotiations for phase two of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Netanyahu's meeting with Trump is scheduled for Tuesday evening (6:00 p.m. in Washington and 1 a.m. in Israel). The meeting was scheduled to take place a few hours earlier, but was postponed at the request of the White House. Sources who work with Witkoff said that watching the feature film about the October 7 massacre while he was in Israel seemed to have had a profound effect on him. He is very involved in the issue of the hostages, and his commitment to the issue is profound. Families of hostages asked to join the prime minister's flight to Washington, but they were refused. Several family members, including Einav Zangauker - the mother of Matan Zangauker - arrived in Washington on commercial flights. Netanyahu is also scheduled to meet with family members of hostages during his visit. On Wednesday, Netanyahu will visit the Pentagon and meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. In addition, Netanyahu will meet with Congressional and Senate leaders, evangelical leaders, and the designated U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, during the week. After, contrary to the agreements, Arbel Yehoud was not released in either of the first two rounds of hostage releases, Israel decided not to open the Netzarim Corridor to allow the movement of Gazans north. After the images of horror from the release of Arbel and Gadi Mozes, in the third round that was brought forward, the release of terrorists from Israeli prisons was delayed and angry messages were sent to the mediators in Israel. The question now is what leverage remains to continue the deal - with 79 hostages still in captivity, and 20 of them scheduled to return during Phase 1 of the deal. Those 20 hostages include 15 men (eight over the age of 50 and seven wounded and sick), the three members of the Bibas family, whose lives are in serious danger, and Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held captive in Gaza for a decade. Eight of those 20 hostages are no longer alive. Last week, after Hamas's violation of the agreement, preventing the return of the displaced and the updated agreement, Ynet security commentator Ron Ben Yishai wrote that the return of the displaced is not the only significant lever of pressure that Israel has at the present stage. There is the humanitarian aid - the pace of which Israel controls in the Gaza Strip, and if there are blatant violations of the agreement the IDF is still in a position where it can maneuver without difficulty wherever it is needed. After those horrific images in the southern Gaza Strip during the liberation of Arbel and Gadi, Israel sent a harsh message to Qatar and Egypt, announcing that 'it has a great many levers of pressure that it can immediately apply if the scenes are repeated - and not a hair on the head of the hostages will be harmed.' One of the levers of pressure is the Rafah crossing , which opened on Tuesday to allow the exit of wounded Palestinians - most of them from Hamas. Israel could close it in the event of future violations of the agreement. Hamas wanted very much to open the crossing, and this was also one of the reasons that led it to agree to two phases of releasing hostages within 48 hours. In a week, on the 22nd day of the deal, Israel is scheduled to withdraw from the center of the Gaza Strip - including the Netzarim Corridor - eastward to the area along the border. Hamas violations could lead to a change. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another lever of pressure is, of course, the release of the terrorists. For every adult or wounded hostage that Hamas releases Israel will release 30 adult and sick terrorists (who have up to 15 years left in prison). Alongside this, in addition to releasing the terrorists, Israel is also to release 1,000 Gazans who were arrested after the October 7 massacre. Some 111 of them were released on Saturday, and the rest will be released in the following rounds. The agreement stipulates additional clauses, from which Israel may also withdraw - at least partially - in the event of future violations of the agreement. These clauses include: the beginning of the rehabilitation of infrastructure (electricity, water, sewage, communications and roads) throughout the Gaza Strip, and the entry of an agreed amount of equipment necessary for civil defense; facilitating the entry of supplies for the settlement of the displaced - 60,000 caravans and 200,000 tents; and the beginning of the necessary arrangements and plans for the reconstruction of the houses , civilian facilities and civilian infrastructure destroyed during the war in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1lefapukg	2025-02-02T20:45:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/H13mrITu1e/H13mrITu1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Jewish schools see renewed interest after Hamas massacre, says Ya...	I would say that we see many more people everywhere going to Jewish schools, Jewish synagogues, and community spaces than ever before' The October 7 Hamas massacre brought many Jews closer to their faith, according to Chaya Yosovich, CEO of the Yael Foundation. In an interview with ILTV News, she explained how, following the attack, the Yael Foundation—which funds groundbreaking programs ranging from innovative curricula to educator training and scholarships—took swift action. Within three days, the organization ensured that all its programs had the necessary security measures in place to keep children and families safe. At the same time, while some parents chose not to send their children to Jewish schools out of fear for their safety, many others reconnected with their faith and community. 'I would say that we see many more people everywhere going to Jewish schools, Jewish synagogues, and community spaces than ever before,' Yosovich said. 'They do feel closer.

Will the U.S. take the lead in a future attack against Iran?	ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman says it is 'unlikely' that America will launch an attack against the Islamic regime Will the U.S. take the lead in a future attack against Iran? This is a question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely ask U.S. President Donald Trump during their meeting on Tuesday. However, according to ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman, it is 'unlikely' that America will launch an attack against the Islamic regime. 'In Trump's inauguration speech, he made it very clear that he wants to be a unifier and a pacifier. He said he wants to be remembered for the wars that America did not enter,' Hoffman explained. 'On the other hand, Trump approved the big bunker busters, the large bombs that Israel would need in order to carry out such an attack.' She said part of the discussion on Iran will need to focus on the timeline. How will Israel and the U.S. coordinate? If Israel is going to attack Iran, should it target nuclear facilities? Should it go after energy infrastructure, such as oil facilities? Or will Israel wait until the U.S. reimposes a series of sanctions against the Iranian regime, potentially empowering the people to rise up and overthrow it?

What happened to the hostages during more than 480 days of captiv...	The testimonies of the freed hostages so far are harrowing—ranging from prolonged isolation to immense physical and psychological abuse Four male hostages are officially home after their release on Saturday. The testimonies of the freed hostages so far are harrowing—ranging from prolonged isolation to immense physical and psychological abuse. Each hostage has their own story, experiences, and traumas. Ofer Calderon, Keith Siegel, and Yarden Bibas are the latest hostages to return home after more than 484 days in Hamas captivity. While all three men miraculously walked out of Gaza on their own two feet, their time in captivity tells a much darker story. According to Israeli media reports, all three men were held in harsh conditions, frequently moved to different locations, and had little food. Keith Siegel, 65, is the first American-Israeli hostage to be released in this deal. Kidnapped from Kfar Aza, reports indicate that Siegel was held in Gaza City with other hostages. He was occasionally kept in tunnels but spent most of his time locked in rooms inside various homes to avoid detection. With barely any food, Siegel—who is a vegetarian—was forced to eat meat to survive. Hamas released a propaganda video of Siegel last April. Reports state that Bibas and Calderon were held together at the beginning of their captivity, brutally beaten by terrorists, locked in cages, and subjected to both physical and psychological abuse. The men say they were held underground and in buildings, frequently relocated, and at times held with other hostages. At the time of Calderon’s release, Hamas dressed him in military clothing, treating him as if he were a reservist soldier. Yarden Bibas, 36, was taken from Nir Oz. He walked out of Hamas captivity without his wife, Shiri, and their two young children, Kfir and Ariel, who remain hostages. According to the framework of the deal, they were supposed to be released on the first day of the agreement, but they remain in captivity. Bibas said he was constantly relocated in Khan Younis and even learned Arabic. According to reports, he endured horrific psychological abuse, including being forced to make a video claiming his wife and children were killed in an IDF airstrike in November 2023. He said his captors constantly spoke about them to torment him. New details have also emerged about released hostage Gadi Moses, who was held alone for his entire 15 months in captivity. He reported that every five days, he was given a single bowl of water and a cup to shower. He lost 15 kilograms during his time in captivity. The five Thai nationals released said they were held in underground tunnels, where they struggled to breathe and were not always given food. Meanwhile, the mother of Emily Damari, who was freed in the first hostage release of this deal, revealed that her daughter was held in UNRWA facilities, where her captors refused to provide her with medical treatment. Damari lost two fingers in captivity after being shot on October 7. The Bibas family released a statement saying that 'a quarter of their heart' has returned home after 15 months, as Yarden comes back to an unbearable reality. They continue to call for the release of Shiri and the children.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1c00pstoyg	2025-02-02T17:24:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/B1yuXpj00yl/B1yuXpj00yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
State witness against Netanyahu files $1.6M lawsuit over alleged ...	Disturbing details: Shlomo Filber alleges severe abuse, including sexual assault and humiliation, during his detention and interrogation, claiming a coerced confession; The state's witness against Netanyahu is also suing over unlawful use of spyware on his phone Shlomo Filber, the state witness in the case against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday filed a lawsuit against senior officials in the law enforcement system. In the lawsuit, he claimed he endured 'abuse and humiliation' during the investigation. The following details might prove disturbing. Filber alleges that he was sexually assaulted during a search of his private areas conducted by a prison officer. The lawsuit, in which he demands over $1.6 million in compensation, was filed against several individuals, including former Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, former State Attorney Shai Nitzan, Deputy State Attorney Liat Ben-Ari, and the prosecutor in the case, Yehudit Tirosh. Filber’s attorneys detailed in the lawsuit: 'During his arrest and interrogation, particularly in the stages leading up to his signing of the state witness agreement, the defendants subjected Filber to seven circles of hell in a severe campaign of abuse. This culminated in a brutal act of sodomy committed by a prison officer at Hadarim Prison the night before he signed the agreement.' According to Filber's lawsuit, the assault, which he also testified about during Netanyahu’s trial, was 'the result of premeditated planning and was deliberately carried out with the involvement of all the defendants, aiming to crush his dignity, humiliate him, and break his spirit.'

They claimed that, during the search, 'he was ordered to completely undress as part of his admission to Hadarim Prison as a detainee. During this process, his naked body was groped by a prison officer, who then committed a brutal act of sodomy against him.' In July of last year, Filber filed a lawsuit for approximately $130,000 against the state and police, alleging invasion of privacy and violation of personal space in the spyware affair. The lawsuit stated: 'Police conducted a covert criminal investigation against Filber, during which they infiltrated his mobile phone using spyware.' Filber and his wife also sued the state, claiming the police used spyware to extract information from both his and his wife’s mobile phones. 'Under the guise of a wiretapping warrant, but in blatant and severe violation of that warrant and in clear breach of the law, the investigating unit used a hacking tool known as ‘The System’ (publicly identified as Pegasus spyware) to infiltrate Filber’s mobile phone and extract a significant amount of personal and private information,' according to the lawsuit. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1xkyd6ojl	2025-02-02T13:59:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/06/29/ryVmZyOFcc/ryVmZyOFcc_0_23_2784_1568_0_small.jpg
Australia hits right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' with sancti...	Australia on Monday imposed sanctions on extreme right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' as part of its efforts to combat a rise in antisemitism and online extremism, and after similar moves by Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government's move would make it a criminal offense to engage with 'Terrorgram' and it would also help prevent children from becoming caught up in far-right extremism. 'Terrorgram is an online network that promotes white supremacy and racially-motivated violence,' Wong said in a statement. 'It is the first time any Australian Government has imposed counterterrorism financing sanctions on an entity based entirely online.' Offenders will face up to 10 years in jail and heavy fines, she said. The Australian government has also re-listed and hit other right-wing groups with sanctions including the National Socialist Order, the Russian Imperial Movement, Sonnenkrieg Division and The Base for counterterrorism financing sanctions, Wong said. Australia has also seen an escalating series of attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023, sparking fear among Australia's nearly 115,000 Jewish citizens.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkjxr00tuyg	2025-02-02T13:45:19-08:00	
Emily Damari returns to the house in Kfar Aza from where she was ...	Damari returned to the house in Kfar Aza where she was kidnapped and posted on Instagram: 'I came back to my home, to the oxygen I nearly lost, to the place where my nightmares began 485 days ago – and I've closed only part of the circle I longed to complete' On a sofa bearing the sign 'From this home, Emily Tehila Damari was kidnapped,' the freed hostage, who returned to her home in Kfar Aza for the first time, posted on Instagram: 'I'm Back.' Accompanying her on the visit was freed hostage Romi Gonen, who later replied on Instagram: 'My sister from captivity.' Liekwise, IDF field observer Liri Albag, who was released after them wrote in response: 'We will fight for everyone through fire and water.' 'Today I returned to my home, to my apartment, to the oxygen I had that was nearly gone. I returned to the place where all my nightmares began, 485 days ago, and I have closed only part of the circle that I so longed to close,' Damari wrote, adding: 'Like me, there are 79 other hostages who need to complete the circle and are waiting to fill the missing pieces. We must not stop here; we must bring everyone back home – life for the survivors and honor for the fallen. I will feel my true victory only when they all return.' Tom, Emily’s brother, posted an Instagram photo of his sister with Romi Gonen during their visit to Kfar Aza, with a picture of Aviv Baram – a close friend of Emily’s killed on Oct. 7 – visible in the background. 'Emily came today to close a circle – to conquer her personal victory and return to the place where she was kidnapped by the monsters of Hamas. She returned there with her family and accompanied by someone who joined our family and became an inseparable part of it, Romi Gonen. Romi and Emily became one, and it’s so amazing to see,' he wrote. 'Their unspoken understanding, eye to eye – sometimes without uttering a word. There was a moment during this complicated day when my heart truly clenched. Emily and Romi sat on a bench beneath the olive trees by the arms depot, with Aviv Baram’s picture in front of them,' he continued, adding: 'This moment was so complete, yet at the same time so empty. That’s exactly how the prisoner swap agreement feels. It is a great joy to see our captives returning, and a sick feeling in my stomach to see buses of lowly murderers being released. I am so sorry for what you are going through and for the unimaginable loss; I truly hope that as a people we become worthy of them and of you.' Emily, a British citizen, was freed from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip during the first phase of the current swap along with Rumi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher. Immediately upon her release, she became a symbol of bravery after pushing one of the Hamas terrorists out of the vehicle that brought her to the Red Cross pickup point – and during a phone call, she shared a striking victory image with her brother by showing him her severed fingers. Until her release, Emily was the only British citizen held in Gaza and no sign of life was offered during her captivity. On the morning of Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists stormed her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, killed her dog and kidnapped her from the kibbutz young generation neighborhood. Her mother, Mandy, also hid when terrorists broke into their home — and survived after a bullet struck the door lock of the room where she was hiding, jamming it so the terrorists could not enter. About a week and a half before Emily’s release, her mother pleaded, 'Emily, Lolo, if somehow you can hear me, know that we all love you here to the moon and back. Not a second goes by without us thinking of you, praying for you, fighting so you can return home alive.' On Friday, Mandy revealed that her daughter was held at a facility run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. She said she spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, thanked him for his support and assistance, and added that 'Hamas held Emily at UNRWA facilities and denied her access to medical treatment after she was shot twice.' 'It’s a miracle that she survived.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjuyhlau1e	2025-02-02T13:35:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkdphm6Oke/rkdphm6Oke_0_308_1123_632_0_small.jpg
North Korea criticizes Rubio, says it will respond strongly to US...	North Korea on Monday criticized U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a 'rogue state' in a media interview, saying his comments do not help U.S. interests, state media KCNA said. North Korea's foreign ministry said the country will respond strongly to hostile U.S. provocations, KCNA reported. It is North Korea's first criticism of the Trump administration since President Donald Trump reentered the White House on Jan. 20, Yonhap news agency said. The ministry also condemned United States' new missile defense shield plan, saying that it makes it necessary for North Korea to strengthen its own military power, KCNA reported. Trump last week signed an order that 'mandated a process to develop an 'American Iron Dome,'' a next-generation U.S. missile defense shield against ballistic, hypersonic, cruise missile and other forms of aerial attack.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1rx2paojg	2025-02-02T13:06:34-08:00	
Incoming IDF Chief of Staff: '2025 will continue to be a year of ...	Eyal Zamir, set to become the 24th IDF chief of staff, said Israeli will produce its own weapons and emphasized the need to reduce reliance on foreign arms; He faces major challenges, including Gaza, Iran and integration of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military The day after his appointment as the next IDF Chief of Staff, Major General (Res.) Eyal Zamir, currently the director general of the Ministry of Defense, delivered his first speech following the announcement of his selection as the intended successor to Herzi Halevi. Despite cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon, 'the year 2025 will continue to be a year of combat,' said Zamir during the Ministry of Defense’s work plan conference. 'The war has proven that we must only rely on ourselves,' said Zamir, who is expected to assume the role of Chief of Staff on March 6. 'We were all raised on the principle that 'The State of Israel will defend itself by itself.' Now, I am telling you that Israel will also produce its own weapons independently, in the face of any threat or scenario. During the war, we restarted production lines that had been shut down, expanded existing production lines, and established new manufacturing capabilities. Reducing our dependence on the world benefits security, the economy and industry. This will also prove itself in defense exports.' The incoming IDF chief of staff added: 'We are in a global arms race – a technological race. In our region, there is no room for mercy. Our neighbors, from Iran to Gaza, from Yemen to Beirut and Damascus, misjudge us. The people of Israel and the IDF are strong. During moments of crisis, a fighting spirit emerges in our people. We must salute the IDF, its soldiers, and its commanders. They saved the State of Israel. The Ministry of Defense provided the IDF with the tools, support and safety net needed to complete its mission. 'During the war, the IDF rose from the depths. Enemies on all fronts were defeated, and their leaders are now buried beneath the rubble. But the campaign is not over, and challenges remain ahead. We must remember the heavy price we paid in lives lost and wounded. The year 2025 will continue to be a year of combat. The Ministry of Defense must continue to build strength and support IDF needs and national security missions.' 'In the coming days, I will conclude my role as director general of the Ministry of Defense,' Zamir said. 'I feel that I am leaving behind a strong, leading and powerful ministry that is focused on its primary mission, which I defined during the second day of the war – providing the military and the defense establishment with the breathing room they need.' He also expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to lead the IDF. 'I want to thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz for their trust in selecting me as the 24th IDF chief of staff,' he said. 'We will show our enemies that they face a determined, powerful, and victorious force, as it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'I will pursue my enemies and overtake them, and I will not turn back until they are destroyed.'' From tank commander to chief of staff Zamir’s appointment as chief of staff still requires approval from the Advisory Committee for Senior Appointments, and final government approval. Assuming these are secured, Zamir, who was already considered the leading candidate, is expected to assume his role next month, following the resignation of outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. With this appointment, Zamir will become the first tank officer to serve as Chief of Staff since David (Dado) Elazar in the 1970s. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Upon entering his new role, Zamir will face significant challenges alongside ongoing combat efforts. These include appointing a new Deputy Chief of Staff and a new commander for the Southern Command to replace Major General Yaron Finkelman, who has retired. Additionally, Zamir will need to oversee the integration of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the IDF, the potential military dismantling of Hamas in Gaza (if the war resumes), and possibly an unprecedented operation in Iran, with U.S. assistance. For quite a while, Zamir has been regarded as the leading candidate to succeed Halevi due to his experience, authority and professionalism, particularly his stance against downsizing the military. Having served for 38 years in various combat and senior command roles, Zamir at 59 will be the oldest chief of staff in IDF history. For comparison, Gadi Eizenkot and Dan Halutz concluded their terms at age 58. Among the roles he has held in the IDF, Zamir served as commander of the Southern Command. In his most recent position, from 2018 to 2021, he was deputy chief of staff under Aviv Kochavi. During this time, he oversaw the implementation of the multi-year Momentum plan and managed all military support for the civilian sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Before serving as deputy chief of wtaff, Zamir was the military secretary to the prime minister and also served as the chief of staff for the Ground Forces Command. Over the past year, Zamir has been heavily involved in building military capabilities and has maintained excellent relations with the Americans. Among other responsibilities, he oversaw unprecedented arms acquisitions from the United States, including deals for fighter jets and munitions, as well as expanded local production within Israel’s defense industries. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydw2s6001e	2025-02-02T12:58:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BJALMXpdyx/BJALMXpdyx_119_107_932_525_0_small.jpg

Iran secretly building nuclear weapons able to reach Europe based...	National Council of Resistance of Iran reports Tehran is covertly expanding its nuclear weapons program – with a missile range of 1,800 miles – using North Korean designs at facilities disguised as satellite launch sites Iran has allegedly been covertly developing nuclear weapons with a 1,800‑mile range that could reach Europe using North Korean designs, according to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). The Telegraph in Britain reported Sunday that details provided by the NCRI indicate that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is expanding its warhead program at two sites disguised as communication satellite launch facilities. The facilities, controlled by Iran’s nuclear weapons division – the Organisation for Advanced Defence Research (SPND) – are reportedly expediting missile production. Soona Samsami, a U.S. representative of the NCRI, told The Telegraph: 'For over two decades, they have used negotiations and the West's leniency as a means to advance their nuclear weapons program, threatening global peace and stability. Tehran has never been as weak and vulnerable as it is today. The desperate Iranian regime is thus speeding up the development of nuclear weapons. Now is the time to hold the regime accountable for internal killings, regional warmongering and nuclear weapons development.' According to the report, the first warhead base is located about 22 miles from the Iranian city of Shahrud. Experts from the SPND and the IRGC Aerospace Force have been working on a nuclear missile integrated into a Ghaem-100 rocket, capable of traveling 1,800 miles. This range would put targets in Europe –including Greece –and Israel within reach. The Telegraph noted that three rocket launches have already been successfully carried out, with tests for the more advanced Ghaem-105 rocket slated for the coming months. Past tests were masked as satellite launches to obscure their true purpose. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Satellite imagery reportedly shows a concrete platform used in the experiments, with nearby buildings believed to support related research. Another site, about 43 miles southeast of the city of Semnan, is said to be producing Simorgh missiles inspired by North Korean designs, similar to the 18‑meter-tall UNHA‑1 rocket. Much of the work at this site is conducted underground to evade intelligence surveillance, with six new constructions added since 2005. To further conceal the work, the regime has named the facility the Imam Khomeini site, ostensibly an homage to its space governing body, while it is reportedly being used for warhead tests. Images distributed by the NCRI showed extensive ground excavation in the northeastern part of the base in 2019, with concrete foundations installed afterward, while older photos revealed the structure covered in dirt. The NCRI claims that SPND experts have observed an increase in subterranean explosions linked to missile production. Although the press was once allowed on site – where IRGC soldiers in civilian clothing were seen – only a few photos were released, taken by regime workers. Security at both facilities is stringent. Workers arrive in private vehicles from surrounding cities, including Tehran, and are taken by bus from a checkpoint several miles from the main site by IRGC personnel as an additional security measure. Iran's Deputy Minister of Communications and Information Technology and head of the Iranian Space Organization, Hassan Salaria, said last week that Tehran would unveil a number of Iranian satellites and noted that 'by the end of the current Iranian year' two more important satellites would be launched (the Iranian year ends in March, according to the IRNA news agency). He said that Iran has so far launched 24 to 25 satellites into space of various categories. 'Currently, we are designing and building satellites that can operate with an imaging accuracy of up to about two meters, and this process is gradual,' he explained. The Iranian Space Agency on Sunday announced that during a ceremony marking National Space Technology Day, three satellites were unveiled: Nabouk 1, Fars 2, and an improved version of Fars 1. At the same time, as part of the 'Achievements of the Iranian Ministry of Defense' exhibition, and in the presence of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, the Atmad ballistic missile, which has a range of 1,700 kilometers, was unveiled on Sunday. The Iranian president said during the visit: 'Our defense capabilities are so advanced that they do not allow any country to attack Iran.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkmumsaukg	2025-02-02T12:03:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/SkGrpWTdkx/SkGrpWTdkx_0_266_2550_1435_0_small.jpg

With Trump back in White House, Saudi Arabia looks to be major pl...	Saudi Arabia hopes a stronger bond with the US will solidify its influence in the Middle East despite the challenges posed by its controversial standing in the region Now that President Donald Trump is back in the White House, Saudi Arabia hopes to play a greater role in the Middle East. The Gulf nation's leaders aim to restore its glory after four years of tense relations with the administration of former President Joe Biden. Soon after Trump took office, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud announced the kingdom’s intention to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over four years. That figure is higher than the $450 billion Saudi Arabia committed to investing in 2017. Trump told the media he would pressure Saudi Arabia to raise the intended investment to $1 trillion. Saudi Arabia may take him up on that offer if it means obtaining a green light from the U.S. regarding its intended geopolitical strategy. Analysts say Riyadh sees investing in the U.S. as a double opportunity, leading to both economic prosperity and unlimited support from the Trump administration. 'The deals that Saudi Arabia concludes with the United States are deals that benefit both countries,' according to Saudi political analyst Faisal Al-Kaam. 'The previous deal, which was concluded in 2017, led to the transfer of technology to Saudi Arabia and the issuance of special models of the famous F-15 fighter jet, which means that Saudi Arabia also benefited.' Al-Kaam rejected the notion that the investment was a form of tribute to be paid to the U.S. 'This economic and political relationship is long-standing, and the two countries continue to support each other,' he said. 'It is true that during President Joe Biden’s term, the relationship was a little tense, but it quickly returned to normal.' 'Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East regarding influence, size, and economy. It is now the fastest growing among the G20, and it is influential in all decisions in the region,' Al-Kaam continued, highlighting the mutual benefit resulting from a partnership between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Al-Kaam described cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. as 'a simple equation,' but some critics are more skeptical. 'The truth is that Saudi Arabia is paying bribes to the Donald Trump administration to keep them in power,' said Iraqi political analyst Haider Shaheen. 'Otherwise, he will impose sanctions on them or at least marginalize them.' Shaheen said that Saudi Arabia expects its investments to result in the U.S. suppressing those who oppose the kingdom, including the Houthis and the Iranian regime, 'in addition to keeping quiet about Saudi Arabia’s serious violations in the areas of human rights.' Saudi ties with Israel After nearly a year and a half of war, a cease-fire was declared earlier this month between Israel and Hamas. That deal brought conversations about establishing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia back to the surface. Trump has made it clear that he hopes to see the two countries establish ties. In his last term, his administration brokered the Abraham Accords, which established relations between Israel and four Arab nations. Saudi officials have consistently said that the kingdom will not establish peace with Israel until a Palestinian state is declared with East Jerusalem as its capital. 'Various U.S. administrations have tried to pressure Saudi Arabia to start relations with Israel, and the answer has always been that there must be a recognized Palestinian state, and then there will be Saudi-Israeli relations,' said former Saudi diplomat Hassan Barqi. 'This is the opinion that Saudi Arabia says, in secret and in public.' Barqi said that Saudi Arabia would stand firm on this condition, regardless of the October 7 attacks and Trump’s declared intention to resettle Palestinians in other countries. 'Now things are easier. Most of the Hamas leaders have been assassinated, Hamas has lost its power, and it may be easy to establish a Palestinian state according to the conditions of the international community. And there are more countries in the world that recognize Palestine as a state,' Barqi said. 'This is what paves the way for the establishment of a Palestinian state, and President Donald Trump has been convinced of this idea from the beginning.' On the other hand, Aisha Al-Sayed, an Egyptian journalist, dismissed Saudi Arabia’s conditions for normalization with Israel as 'a thing of the past.' 'Saudi Arabia sees that it does not benefit from the Palestinian issue, and its priorities have changed. It only looks at economic and social interests and the desire for development,' Al-Sayed said. 'As for fixed issues such as the Palestinian issue, it will not continue to defend them, and it will sign a peace agreement with Israel within the next four years.' Tense role in the Middle East Saudi Arabia’s relations with fellow Middle Eastern and Arab countries have caused controversy in recent years. When King Salman came to power in 2015, Saudi Arabia changed its regional strategy. Two months after Salman was crowned, Saudi Arabia declared war on the Houthis in Yemen. In 2022, after years of devastating fighting, Saudi Arabia recognized that it had failed to impose control over the Houthis and decided to appease the group. Saudi Arabia also signed a reconciliation agreement with Iran despite years of cold war between the two countries. During the long Saudi-Iranian conflict, a 'fifth column' of Iran-affiliated militias targeted Saudi interests several times, striking numerous military, oil and civilian targets in Saudi Arabia with thousands of ballistic missiles. Relations between Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates deteriorated after Riyadh made several economic decisions that harmed the interests of neighboring countries. Saudi Arabia banned companies without regional headquarters from working on government contracts, which led many companies to withdraw. The kingdom also significantly increased import tariffs from fellow Gulf countries, fanning tensions. For years, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been in conflict, with Saudi Arabia attempting to exert power over its neighbor to the east. In 2017, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, led by Saudi Arabia, all simultaneously cut off ties with Qatar. Less than four years later, the two countries reached an agreement that did not involve any of the concessions from Qatar that Saudi Arabia had insisted upon. Saudi Arabia failed to resolve the civil war in Sudan, and even after normalizing relations with Bashir Assad’s Syria, it was unable to protect the Syrian leader. Turkey managed to impose Ahmed al-Sharaa, head of the Turkish-aligned Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham group, as the new leader of Syria, and Saudi Arabia was forced to accept the fall of the Assad regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Having faced numerous regional challenges, Saudi Arabia is now working to expand its influence through economic interests. The kingdom has signed many economic agreements with Iraq, which is ruled by parties loyal to Iran. It also has economic agreements with Egypt and Oman. Upcoming agreements are expected with Lebanon and perhaps Syria. Saudi Arabia’s influence on African countries remains comparatively weak. 'Saudi Arabia may not appear in the picture, but it is working to solve the region’s problems through its extensive international relations, and this is the secret,' according to Mamdouh Al-Kharif, a Saudi political analyst. 'Its steps are taken in secret to solve the region’s problems and not increase them.' Al-Kharif said that many of the kingdom’s regional strategies will take a long time to come to fruition. 'Gulf relations are witnessing significant growth. There are no fundamental differences, but rather a redrawing of the relationship to be better and sustainable for the future, and so that the differences do not return,' he said. 'As for Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the Arab countries, it is for the growth of this region again and for it to be in a better economic state.' While asserting that 'compatibility' between Trump and the Saudi leadership would lead to the resolution of many issues in the Middle East, Al-Kharif insisted that Saudi Arabia’s role in the region is independent of the US. 'The change in the US administration has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia’s influence, as it had influence even under the administration of former President Joe Biden,' he said. 'Saudi Arabia does not rely on anyone for its influence, but rather on its internal strength, its great diplomacy and its extensive relations.'

Date set for Hassan Nasrallah's funeral, 5 months after assassina...	Hezbollah announces Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral will take place in three weeks, alongside his assassinated successor Hashem Safeddine; Amid internal criticism and weakening influence in Lebanon, the group faces scrutiny as it tries to maintain political power under mounting external and internal pressure The funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the former secretary-general of Hezbollah who was assassinated in September, will take place in three weeks. This announcement was made on Sunday by Hezbollah’s current Secretary-General Naim Qassem during a speech broadcast throughout the country. Alongside Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine, who was considered a potential successor to Nasrallah but was assassinated a week later, will also be buried. Qassem urged supporters 'not to fire into the air' during the funeral. The slogan for Nasrallah’s funeral, according to Qassem, will be: 'We are committed to the alliance.' Qassem accused Israel of violating the cease-fire and stated that Lebanon must act against it. 'The state of Lebanon is responsible for monitoring and demanding that the countries sponsoring the agreement ensure the enemy’s commitment to the cease-fire,' he said, adding: 'This is not just about violations but also about attacks. The state of Lebanon must act forcefully.' Regarding Hezbollah’s activities, Qassem justified the continuation of the fighting. 'Resistance is a path and a choice,' he said. 'We act according to our assessment at the appropriate time.' He also criticized Washington. 'Since the U.S. considers itself a sponsor, there must be pressure on it to adhere to the agreement,' he said. Qassem claimed there is an international campaign aimed at undermining Hezbollah’s position. 'There is a campaign against us, backed by the U.S., Israel and foreign states, accompanied by internal support, promoting defeat,' he said. He attempted to frame the fighting balance as positive for his organization, adding: 'We did not speak of total victory; this is a battle with gains and losses. Our people understand they won in some areas and lost in others. We speak of a victory tied to resilience, halting the Israeli invasion, and the enemy’s inability to eliminate the resistance.' Announcement of Nasrallah’s funeral date Hezbollah has faced significant internal criticism recently. After the 60-day cease-fire period expired, motorcycle convoys from the organization took to the streets to celebrate 'victory in the war.' They waved Hezbollah flags and chanted slogans in support of the group. This display was poorly received by the Lebanese public. The Amal Movement in Lebanon even prohibited its supporters from participating in the motorcycle convoys. On Friday, another incident occurred involving a Hezbollah motorcycle convoy when a young man struck Hezbollah motorcyclists participating in a funeral procession near the village of Sarafand, close to Sidon. Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed channel reported that it was unclear whether the act was intentional. Footage of the incident was widely shared on social media. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hezbollah’s weakened position within Lebanon has limited its ability to provoke, particularly as it seeks to maintain its political power during the formation of the new government. Lebanon’s new president, Joseph Aoun, and its prime minister-designate, Nawaf Salam, were not Hezbollah’s preferred candidates. All eyes in Lebanon are now on the organization, with some blaming it for the destruction of southern villages and its participation in the war for external motives. Qassem emphasized Hezbollah would continue its path and would not succumb to external pressures. 'The popular liberation is intertwined with the armed resistance and the Lebanese army. In southern Lebanon, they say there is no possibility for Israel to remain and occupy the area,' he said. 'Let everyone know that sacrifices will lead to the liberation of the land.

Trump invites King Abdullah of Jordan to formal White House visit	King Abdullah will meet with President Trump on Feb. 11, a week after he meets with Netanyahu; Trump’s controversial Gaza relocation plan faces strong opposition from Jordan, Egypt and other Arab nations, who reject displacing Palestinians as a solution to Gaza’s crisis Jordan’s King Abdullah II has received an invitation to meet with President Donald Trump on February 11. The announcement of the invitation coincided with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s departure for Washington aboard the government-owned Wing of Zion plane for his official visit. Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday. In recent days, President Trump has reiterated his proposal for neighboring countries of Israel, specifically Egypt and Jordan, to absorb residents of the Gaza Strip as part of his 'relocation' plan for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians. Both Cairo and Amman have rejected the idea, but Trump remains adamant: 'They will do it. We do a lot for them – they will do this.' Trump first raised the proposal last week following the second round of hostage releases of the first phase of the hostage deal. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, he described Gaza as a 'massive demolition site' and argued that rebuilding it would require relocating its residents to Jordan or Egypt. He suggested this could serve as a long-term solution rather than just a temporary measure. 'This involves moving 1.5 million people and simply clearing out the entire place,' Trump said. So far, despite early support for the idea among Israeli right-wing factions, strong opposition from Palestinians, as well as from Jordan and Egypt, has made the plan appear unfeasible. It is also unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the proposal, as even one of his closest allies, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, has expressed significant doubts about its viability. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Saturday, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League issued a joint statement opposing Trump’s push for the migration of Palestinians out of Gaza to neighboring countries – a proposal he has repeatedly mentioned over the past week. 'We emphasize that we reject the idea of displacing Palestinians from their land for any reason,' the statement read. It was released following a meeting in Cairo between foreign ministers of several nations and Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary-general of the PLO Executive Committee. The joint statement also expressed the countries’ willingness to work with the Trump administration 'to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, based on a two-state solution.' The representatives said they discussed efforts to support the Palestinian cause and maintain the cease-fire in Gaza. Among the issues raised was the 'mechanism' that would enable the Palestinian Authority to carry out its responsibilities in Gaza. Meanwhile, Qatar’s Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed diplomatic source, that 'Egypt’s task in confronting Trump’s plan will not be easy unless it receives Arab support, given Trump’s insistence on advancing his proposal.' The report also revealed that a senior Trump administration official visited Cairo last week to hold discussions about the plan. According to the report from Doha, Egyptian officials who met with the American representative expressed Cairo’s concerns and warned of potential consequences if Trump’s plan is implemented. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxs37p00jx	2025-02-02T10:48:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/06/25/8617894/8617894_0_0_1300_866_0_small.jpg

As Israel releases hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, debate rene...	Israel’s recent deal with Hamas, which releases hundreds of Palestinian prisoners - including convicted murderers - in exchange for Israeli hostages, has sparked controversy and renewed calls for capital punishment for terrorists amid fears of further attacks Israel has begun releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in recent weeks as part of a cease-fire deal with the Hamas terrorist organization. The scenes of jubilant prisoners receiving a hero’s welcome in Palestinian cities and towns have been received with mixed feelings by Israelis. On the one hand, Israeli hostages being held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, are also being released, but on the other hand, some of the prisoners have been sentenced to life for murdering Israelis, many of them vowing to continue to operate against Israel. The war and the deal between Hamas and Israel have rekindled a debate in the country about the death penalty for terrorists. Throughout the years, there have been several attempts to legislate a bill that would allow capital punishment for terrorist acts, including those committed in the West Bank, which Israel has control over since 1967 under a different legal system. Military law, which is applied to Palestinians in the West Bank, allows the death penalty for convicted murderers. It has never been used as prosecutors have never requested it. The current law in Israel allows for the death penalty on a narrow range of crimes, namely treason, genocide, crimes against humanity and crimes against the Jewish people during wartime. Those in favor of a wider use of capital punishment believe the persistence of terrorist attacks in recent decades can also partly be attributed to the avoidance of using the ultimate punishment. The death penalty was used in Israel twice throughout its history – against a Jew who was accused of treason only to be posthumously exonerated and against Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1962. 'Ideologically, the death penalty has not been handed out because there is no rehabilitation aspect to the punishment,' according to former Magistrate Court Judge Haran Feinstein. Legal experts in the country are divided on whether a specific law mandating capital punishment for terrorist acts would be without petitions to the Supreme Court. Public opinion in Israel is largely favorable toward using the death penalty for convicted terrorists. Some see it as a deterrent against future attacks, especially those intended to stop the kidnapping of Israelis in order to free Palestinian prisoners. There is also frustration among Israelis that their taxes are paying for lengthy prison sentences for Palestinians, including funding university degrees and advanced health care. 'When it will be clear to the murderers that they will be sentenced to death, they will think twice,' right-wing Israeli Knesset member Limor Son Har Melech said. 'Thousands of prisoners in Israeli jails now prove that the current deal proves that, if there was capital punishment, we wouldn’t have to face such embarrassing and disgraceful deals in which murderers of Jews are released.' Son Har Melech herself is a victim of a terrorist attack in 2003, during which her husband was murdered, and she was critically wounded. 'My husband’s murderer was sentenced to seven life sentences, and during the trial he said the sentence had no meaning to him, knowing he will be released,' she added. Khaled Najar was later released as part of a deal in which Israel released over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in return for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was taken into captivity by Hamas in 2011. Najar resumed his terrorist activities, killing more Israelis. Israeli soldiers killed him in Rafah during the latest war. 'There is fear and aversion among Israel’s leadership from the legislation of a death penalty law,' said Son Har Melech. 'Attempts to legislate such a law at the beginning of the war, when it was very clear to everyone that this needs to be corrected, the relatives of the hostages raised objections and even those in favor of the law got cold feet.' Families of hostages voiced their concern that instating the death penalty in the midst of the war, while Israeli hostages are at the mercy of Hamas captors, would lead to their execution. Some begged Knesset members to shoot down any proposals. According to Feinstein, also an adjunct lecturer at the Department of Criminology at Bar Ilan University, the current law allows for the death penalty but is not used only for ideological reasons by which modern countries do not employ capital punishment, barring a few states in the United States. 'When facing terrorists, there is concern that Israelis captured by them will be executed if Israel will employ the death penalty,' Feinstein said. 'Therefore, Israel shouldn’t use capital punishment because its enemies will abuse this.' 'I feel the contrary is true; capital punishment could be used as leverage that they will not have prisoners to release in return for our hostages,' Son Har Melech explained. 'This, of course, needs to be one part of the leverage against Hamas, added to limiting humanitarian aid to Gaza and intense fighting in order to create a new reality and deterrence against terrorists.' Even before the war, there were attempts to legislate capital punishment, including a bill currently stalled, waiting for a preliminary reading in the plenum of the Knesset. 'All our efforts at this point to complete the legislation have met closed doors,' Son Har Melech said. 'Not only do we not have deterrence without capital punishment, but we are also making murdering and massacring Jews lucrative. Our enemies need to know very clearly that prisoner release is off the table; this will change how the conflict is managed by Israel, making it more powerful with greater ability to face our enemies and subdue them.' As a former judge, Feinstein suggests sentencing convicted terrorists to death but not implementing it. 'Convicts should be held in similar conditions to those on death row in the U.S., with very minimal conditions, complete isolation and no option for parole,' he said. 'This could prevent future murders by deterrence.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The current deal between Israel and Hamas, which spans six weeks in which hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are slated to be released, has stirred controversy in the country. Memories of the Shalit deal are still fresh in the minds of many. One of the terrorists released as part of that deal was Yahya Sinwar, who then became the leader of Hamas and was the mastermind of the October 7 attack that stunned Israel and began the war. 'I am happy for each hostage that is freed from captivity,' said Son Har Melech. 'But we need to echo the great danger in releasing murderers and the unspeakable travesty of their release to the loved ones of the victims. This is also true for our soldiers, who I do not think fought and lost their lives for such pictures. This voice needs to be heard.' It is important to note that should the deal progress into its second stage next month, there is a possibility that terrorists who participated in the October 7 attack also will be released. Throughout its history, Israel has carried out many prisoner swaps at high prices, making this one no exception, likely leaving capital punishment off the table, even as emotions run high. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkspe4puye	2025-02-02T09:27:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/Bkq18BF00kx/Bkq18BF00kx_0_307_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US FAA pilot safety messaging system resumes operations	A key system that provides safety messages to pilots resumed operating on Sunday after an outage that began the previous night, the Federal Aviation Administration said, in the latest difficulty for the U.S. aviation system in the past week. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Sunday the FAA's 'Notice to Air Mission,' or NOTAM, system is old and needs an upgrade. The system went down late on Saturday, prompting the agency to set up a hotline to send notices every 30 minutes with updates to airlines. 'We are investigating the root cause of the outage,' the FAA said in a statement on Sunday. The NOTAM system provides pilots, flight crews and other users of U.S. airspace with critical safety notices. It could include items such as taxiway lights being out at an airport, nearby parachute activity or a specific runway being closed for construction.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkrtmn6okg	2025-02-02T09:04:58-08:00

Syria's transitional president in inaugural foreign trip visits S...	Ahmad al-Sharaa met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss rebuilding war-torn Syria; The visit signals a shift away from Iranian influence as Syria seeks Gulf investment and international support to restore diplomatic and economic ties On Sunday, Ahmad al-Sharaa, the new leader of Syria, visited Saudi Arabia. This was the country's interim president's first trip outside Syria since taking power in December, after rebel forces – led by the jihadist organization Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which he heads—overthrew the regime of Bashar Assad. During his visit, al-Sharaa met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Bin Salman is the second regional leader to meet with al-Sharaa since he assumed power, the first being the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who visited Damascus last month. After the meeting, al-Sharaa issued a statement describing the visit. 'I want to express my gratitude to my brother Mohammed bin Salman for the warm reception and hospitality. We held an extended meeting, during which I witnessed a genuine desire to support Syria, its future, its people, and its territorial integrity. We discussed numerous topics and took steps to strengthen cooperation,' according to the statement. The presidential office in Damascus reported that the two leaders discussed future plans for Syria in energy, technology, health and education. In January, al-Sharaa appointed himself as Syria’s interim president. Before his visit to Saudi Arabia, the presidential office in Damascus released a photo of al-Sharaa and his foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaybani, aboard a plane en route to Riyadh. Al-Sharaa’s visit to Saudi Arabia is widely viewed as a signal of the new Syrian regime distancing itself from Iran, which had been a significant ally of Assad. Since taking power, al-Sharaa has sought support from both Muslim and Western leaders, working to restore Syria’s ties with nations that severed relations during the civil war, which began in 2011 and ended in December. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi Arabia and Iran announced the restoration of diplomatic relations in 2023 after a seven-year freeze. However, regional tensions and disagreements, particularly regarding Syria, persist between the two powers. In late December, al-Sharaa gave an interview to the Saudi network Al-Arabiya, stating that Riyadh 'will definitely play an important role' in Syria’s future while highlighting the 'great investment opportunities' in his country. Damascus is hopeful that Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf nations will assist in rebuilding the war-torn country. Last month, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan visited Damascus and pledged Saudi support in efforts to lift the international sanctions imposed during Assad’s war against the rebels. During his visit, bin Farhan said Riyadh is engaged in dialogue with all relevant nations and entities, including the United States and the European Union.

Electronics, food and alcohol: This is how Trump's tariffs will a...	Trump's sweeping tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China ignite a trade war, sparking swift retaliation, economic uncertainty, and fears of rising inflation United States President Donald Trump fulfilled his election promise and announced that he would impose high tariffs on America's three largest trading partners - Mexico, Canada, and China - citing a national emergency due to the entry of illegal immigrants and fentanyl drugs into the country's borders. On Saturday he signed an order to impose the stiff tariffs on imports drawing swift retaliation and an undeniable sense of betrayal from the country’s North American neighbors as a trade war erupted among the longtime allies. The Republican president posted on social media that the tariffs were necessary 'to protect Americans,' pressing the three nations to do more to curb the manufacture and export of illicit fentanyl and for Canada and Mexico to reduce illegal immigration into the U.S. The products coming from those countries are among the most common and essential items used by Americans, including fruits and vegetables, meat, gasoline, cars, electronics, toys, clothing, lumber, beer and other alcoholic beverages. The tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to significantly worsen, threatening the trust that many voters placed in Trump to lower the prices of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos, and other goods as he promised. They also risked throwing the global economy and Trump’s political mandate into turmoil just two weeks into his second term. Trump declared an economic emergency to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10% rate. Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates charged by the U.S. against retaliation by other countries, raising the specter of an even more severe economic disruption. 'The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a somber tone as he announced that his country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports, including alcohol and fruit. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He channeled the betrayal that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina. 'We were always there standing with you, grieving with you, the American people,' he said. Mexico’s president also ordered retaliatory tariffs. 'We categorically reject the White House’s slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory,' Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote in a post on X while saying she had instructed her economy secretary to implement a response that includes retaliatory tariffs and other measures in defense of Mexico’s interests. 'If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do, and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population. The premier of the Canadian province of British Columbia, David Eby, specifically called on residents to stop buying liquor from U.S. 'red' states and said it was removing American alcohol brands from government store shelves as a response to the tariffs. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country’s government 'firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.' China began regulating fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances in 2019 and conducted 'counternarcotics cooperation with the U.S.,' the ministry said, calling on the U.S. government to correct what it considers wrongful actions. The Ministry of Commerce in China said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for the 'wrongful practices of the U.S.' and take measures to safeguard its rights and interests. The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, setting up a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth. A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale University laid out the possible damage to the U.S. economy, saying the average household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes. Economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen, and the situation could be even worse with retaliation from other countries. Democrats were quick to warn that any inflation going forward was the result of Trump’s actions. 'You’re worried about grocery prices. Don’s raising prices with his tariffs,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote in a series of posts on X. 'You’re worried about tomato prices. Wait till Trump’s Mexico tariffs raise your tomato prices,' read another. 'You’re worried about car prices. Wait till Trump’s Canada tariffs raise your car prices,' read another. A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize disruptive increases in the price of gasoline or utilities. That’s a sign White House officials understand the gamble they’re taking on inflation. Price spikes under former President Joe Biden led to voter frustration that helped return Trump to the White House. The order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries. The official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addiction. The order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties. 'It doesn’t make much economic sense,’’ said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. trade official. 'Historically, most of our tariffs on raw materials have been low because we want to get cheaper materials so our manufacturers will be competitive ... Now, what’s he talking about? He’s talking about tariffs on raw materials. I don’t get the economics of it.’’ With the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics. The president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil, and natural gas, as well as copper, pharmaceutical drugs, and imports from the European Union — moves that could essentially pit the U.S. against much of the global economy. Trudeau warned of economic pain as the tariffs take effect and encouraged Canadians to 'choose Canadian products and services rather than American ones.' But he also voiced optimism about the enduring relationship between the two countries. 'It is going to have real consequences for people, for workers on both sides of our border. We don’t want to be here. We didn’t ask for this, but we will not back down in standing up both for Canadians and for the incredibly successful relationship between Canada and the United States,' Trudeau said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycbxmt00ye	2025-02-02T08:15:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/r1IwhjhOJg/r1IwhjhOJg_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

He has lost weight, but feels good and his physical condition is normal.' Among the 79 hostages that remain in Gaza are his wife, Shiri, and children, Kfir and Ariel - and the fear for their lives is great; 'Respect our privacy, allow us the time and peace we need' In a statement released a day after Yarden Bibas returned from captivity - and while his wife Shiri and children Ariel and Kfir are still in Gaza and there is great fear for their fate - the Bibas family expressed their gratitude to the people of Israel. 'The amazing people of Israel, thank you for being excited with us, caring and embracing Yarden from afar,' they said in their statement, a day after-some 484 days in Hamas captivity Yarden Bibas was released alongside Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegel. 'Your support is felt and appreciated. Yarden is here and finally air is entering his lungs.' The Bibas family said that 'Yarden has lost a lot of weight, but he feels good, his physical condition is normal. He is strong and amazing.' They emphasized that 'along with acclimatization and the beginning of Yarden's rehabilitation journey, we continue to fight for Shiri, Ariel and Kfir, and all the other 76 hostages who must not be left behind. Tomorrow evening we will make a statement to the media. Until then, we ask that our privacy be respected and that we be allowed the time and peace that we need.' On Saturday afternoon, after he returned from captivity, his family announced that 'Yarden is home. A quarter of his heart has returned to us after 15 long months. There are no words to describe the feeling of relief to hold Yarden in our hands, hug him and hear his voice. Yarden is back home, but home is missing.

IDF expands operations in the West Bank, raiding Tamun village to dismantle arms smuggling and terrorist havens; Counterterrorism efforts also intensified in Jenin and Tulkarm, with troops demolishing terror infrastructure, and confiscating weapons to suppress growing threats Alongside the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of the hostage deal, the IDF expanded its operations in the West Bank early Sunday, announcing its entry into the Palestinian village of Tamun, which has recently become a hub for explosive-related terrorism. Later in the afternoon, the IDF announced that, as part of its counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank, it had demolished buildings in Jenin used as terror infrastructure. Dramatic footage captured the moment of the explosions, and Palestinian sources reported that close to 20 buildings had been destroyed in Jenin's refugee camp. The demolitions followed a mapping process of buildings where terror infrastructures, explosives labs, and surveillance tools – such as closed-circuit cameras – were discovered. Among the destroyed buildings was the one where Haruv Reconnaissance Unit soldier First Sergeant Liam Hazi from Rosh HaAyin was killed. So far, IDF troops have conducted searches of more than 1,000 buildings during this operation in the West Bank. A joint statement by IDF and Shin Bet revealed that, to date, the counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank has resulted in the elimination of over 35 terrorists and the arrest of more than 100 wanted individuals. Additionally, preemptive airstrikes have killed more than 15. Troops have confiscated dozens of weapons, destroyed hundreds of explosives, and neutralized dozens more planted along roads to target soldiers. Tamun operations The operation in Tamun began before dawn with ground maneuvers focused on a rapid entry into the village for searches, arrests and fortification. Heavy equipment, including bulldozers and excavators, was used to clear paths for ground troops, who began searching for weapons and detaining suspects. Tamun is part of the 'Five Villages' area, which also includes Tubas, Tayasir, Far'a, and Aqaba. In recent months, terrorism originating from these villages has intensified, including planting roadside bombs and using smuggled weapons for attacks. The proximity of Tamun and Tubas to Israel's eastern border has made them key points for arms smuggling by terror groups such as Iran and Hamas. Many arms dealers, including criminal elements, frequent the border area to collect weapons smuggled from Jordan. The villages have also become a haven for terrorists fleeing security forces. Many retreat to these villages before continuing on to Jenin or Tulkarm. Now, with the operation expanded to include Tamun, IDF is operating in three key locations in the eastern West Bank: the refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarm, and the village of Tamun. The goal is to maintain aggressive and sustained pressure on the terror groups that have grown in the area in recent years. Another goal, following the hostage deal, is to prevent celebrations by released prisoners in cities and villages. Due to the military presence, such celebrations have significantly decreased, and no large armed parades have been reported so far.

The IDF is also investigating an incident in which a 73-year-old man, reportedly shot by Israeli forces, was killed. Initial assessments indicate that the deceased, Walid Lahlooh, was in an isolated area where no civilians were expected to be present. Troops who identified him followed standard arrest procedures, which ended with him being shot in the lower body. An IDF announcement regarding the raid stated: 'During the operation, the forces located and confiscated dozens of weapons, destroyed hundreds of explosive devices, and neutralized dozens of additional explosives that had been planted along routes to target our forces.' As part of the broader operation that began nearly two weeks ago, soldiers have been scanning buildings in the hostile Jenin camp, which spans no more than 1.5 square kilometers, arresting and eliminating militants. Last week, Staff Sergeant Liam Hazi, a soldier from the Haruv Reconnaissance Unit, was killed during clashes in Jenin. Four other soldiers sustained light to moderate injuries, while one soldier was seriously wounded. More recently, IDF launched similar operations in the Nur al-Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm. In both Jenin and Tulkarm, checkpoints have been established to inspect Palestinians trying to leave the area, ensuring that no terrorists attempt to flee. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4p911toyg	2025-02-02T07:28:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/B17VMZWaukg/B17VMZWaukg_0_0_1600_1067_0_small.jpg
The world needs to hear the children's voices': Israel's 'spokes...	Meet 9-year-old Ben Carasso, Israel's youngest spokesperson; He tells Ynetnews about his drive, efforts and future ambitions while defending the country on the international stage With Israel facing worldwide criticism and scrutiny over its war against Hamas following the terror group’s massacre on October 7, 2023, many within the country and across the world have taken part in advocating for Israel's actions and its right to defend itself on the international stage. One of the most surprising speakers for Israel is 9-year-old Ben Carasso of Tel Aviv, a third-generation to Holocaust survivors, who decided to embark on a mission to be the voice of Israeli children during the war. Speaking with Ynetnews, he explained the motivation behind his fight for Israel all over the world: 'Children got hurt in this war. If they were scared of the alarms, if they were kidnapped, if they were evacuated from their homes. I felt that the world needs to hear the children's voices, because if we can't do nothing about it, at least let us speak about it.' Ben also discussed his initial steps into advocacy for the country. 'I saw how important it was from October 7. There are no words to describe what happened here. I saw how important it is. So I started really from the start.' When asked about when he began studying English, Ben replied, 'I learned from the age of three.' He also discussed why he decided to involve advocacy in his daily life alongside his days in school and activities as a regular child in Israel. 'I'm advocating because it’s important. And sometimes I do it with my friends, like every regular child. My family supports me and so do my friends. But I'm just a regular child that wants the world to hear what they feel,' he told Ynetnews. When asked where his advocacy efforts took him around the world, he answered: 'I was in London for poster hangings. I was in schools, universities and media outlets. I did almost everything I could to release the hostages and now I’m so happy to see we have hostages back.' Ben also talked about his connection with released hostage Romi Gonen: 'I have two friends whose family members were kidnapped, one is Romi Gonen who’s a cousin of my friend Mika. And another one, Hanan Yablonka, who was kidnapped and murdered. I went to his funeral. He's the father of my best friend from kindergarten. I also have a friend that's evacuated from their home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked about facing challenges during his advocacy abroad, Ben said that 'sometimes they just won't want to hear me. But I think one situation is that they don't understand that we're not committing genocide and we just want to help the Palestinians.' He added that he tries to face negative comments head-on. 'If there are negative reactions, I know I said something good because they don't want the world to hear the truth.' Ben shared about his role models working to defend Israel around the world. 'I think whoever is doing advocacy and helping Israel is really instrumental,' he said. ' I'm so happy that we have other people like Hayley Ace. She's a Christian and she's helping us. There are many more out there and I'm so happy we have them and every single spokesperson that helps Israel.' When asked about his ambitions for the future, Ben said: 'I really don't know, but advocacy will always be a part of my life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byqg3h200yx	2025-02-02T07:13:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/By44R32uke/By44R32uke_56_0_341_192_0_small.jpg
Former hostage Daniella Gilboa reflects on captivity and return: ...	Freed hostage Daniella Gilboa recounts the terror of October 7 and her months in captivity, describing the moment of her abduction and the faith that kept her going Daniella Gilboa, who was released in the second round of the first phase of the hostage deal, shared a heartfelt post on Instagram Sunday morning about her time in captivity and her return home. 'What a surreal year I've had –I don’t even know where to begin,' she wrote. 'First and foremost, I want to thank the people who stood by my family for a year and three months, who never gave up, never lost hope.' A widely shared video shows Gilboa and fellow female IDF lookouts singing 'Am Yisrael Chai' in a meeting with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 'We want to say thank you, to you and President Trump for everything,' Liri Albag told him. Witkoff responded: 'The people of the United States stand with you, the president stands with you. We have a common goal – to bring everybody home.' Hamas, in a psychological warfare tactic against the hostages’ families, previously released a video showing Gilboa’s tattoo in an attempt to falsely claim she had died in captivity. Addressing the incident, she wrote: 'Thank you for waiting for me, for not believing the horrific rumors, for continuing to pray for me throughout this entire time. That was my last request before I was taken.' Gilboa then described the moment of her abduction from a reinforced shelter in Nahal Oz. 'I refused to despair or say goodbye. Instead, I prayed and believed with all my heart that my story wouldn’t end in that shelter,' she recounted. 'For half an hour, I prayed for every girl with me because I felt there was nothing more powerful I could do at that moment. I couldn't rely on the army coming to protect me, or on the shelter itself – it wasn’t just about missiles this time. Even the few armed girls with us weren’t enough to make me feel safe.' 'I knew the only thing that could save us was faith' On Saturday morning, she and fellow hostages Karina, Naama, Liri and Agam recited the Birkat HaGomel prayer in synagogue, a prayer of thanksgiving after surviving a life-endangering situation – a moment she had long awaited. 'From the day I survived October 7, I was waiting for this – to thank God for saving us against all odds,' she wrote. 'Eight days ago, after 477 days in captivity, I was finally reunited with my loved ones – the family I thought about and worried for more than I worried about myself. The people who were with me, not physically, but in spirit, who never gave up and did everything to bring me home. They strengthened me even without knowing it. 'Thank you, my dear family. Thank you, my beloved friends who fought for me until I returned.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gilboa also expressed gratitude to her boyfriend, writing: 'Thank you, Roiko, my love, for giving me so much strength from afar. You appeared in my dreams, in my thoughts every hour of the day. For over a year, we were together in heart and soul. I love you.' She then praised the soldiers who risked their lives in the fight to bring the hostages home. 'Thank you to the heroic soldiers who fought with immense bravery and to those who gave their lives with one goal in mind – to find us and bring us back. Each and every one of us. I appreciate and love you so much. Stay strong, you are incredible.' 'With God’s help, very soon we will see all the hostages – both the living and those we lost – back home with their families and loved ones. We cannot give up now. This isn’t over – there are still people who need to come home. And if anyone understands that, it’s you, the people of Israel, who are fighting with all your might and giving them a sliver of hope in the darkness.' Gilboa ended her message with a vow to honor the memory of her fallen friends. 'I am deeply grateful for the incredible chance I was given – to live and to commemorate all the friends who were brutally murdered in the command center and in Nahal Oz. May their memory be a blessing. I will never stop until the end of my days.' 'I love you all so much,' she concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bye11jg6oje	2025-02-02T06:56:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BJxDE11ChOJx/BJxDE11ChOJx_24_174_415_234_0_small.jpg

More Hamas cruelty: The 'thank you' letter Keith Siegel was force...	Not just 'gift bags' and 'release certificates': In a letter circulated online, the hostage released from captivity yesterday allegedly confessed to Hamas; 'Those guarding me during this period took care of all my needs,' it read; But the Hostages and Missing Families Forum clarified: 'The terrorists who held him forced him to write them a detailed letter of thanks, this is another example of Hamas' cruelty' In a letter distributed online by Hamas, Keith Siegel - who was released Saturday from captivity in Gaza - allegedly thanked the terrorists who held him for 484 days. 'I was treated well by them,' he allegedly wrote. But a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum clarified that 'the Hamas terrorists who held Keith forced him to write them a detailed letter of thanks. This is one example of many of the cruel and cynical conduct of the Hamas terrorist organization and the urgency of returning all the hostages to Israel.' 'To the Qassam fighters, my name is Keith Siegel and I am from Kfar Aza. I was a prisoner in Gaza from October 7, 2023 until January 2025,' the letter began. The release date was not specified, and it is possible that the letter was dictated by the terrorists a few days before - when it was not yet clear when Siegel would be released. According to the letter that Siegel was ordered to write: 'My guards during this period took care of all my needs, food and drink, medicine, vitamins, eye drops, a blood pressure measuring device and more. They also made sure I got a doctor's checkup when I felt unwell for a long time. The guards considered my needs and responded to my requests regarding nutrition, eating habits and more. They made sure I had food that suited my health needs.'

I wish and hope for peace soon. To the fighters who guarded me during this period, I would like to say thank you,' the letter also said. Siegel said upon his return that he was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian, and that he ate it when it was given to him since he received very little food. The last time he ate before he was released was Friday afternoon. This letter joins the cynical 'release certificates' that Hamas distributes to released hostages as a kind of receipt for the prisoners, including murderers, who are being released from Israeli prisons in the cease-fire and hostage return deal. To all those released so far, Hamas has distributed so-called 'gift bags,' which in some cases also included a map of the Gaza Strip; Siegel was given an additional 'gift bag' to pass on to his wife, Aviva Sigal, who was released in the deal more than a year ago. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h12orwtdjl	2025-02-02T06:21:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/H1LbTgp00kx/H1LbTgp00kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Award winning violinst Miri Ben-Ari talks with Ynet about her special connection to former hostage due to their shared instrument and an upcoming show featuring the two All of Israel is closely following the advance of the second hostage deal with Hamas, currently in its first phase, as many celebrate the return of captives held in Gaza since the terror group’s attack on Israel on October 7 nearly a year and a half ago. One of the recent hostages to be released was IDF lookout Agam Berger who was abducted from her post in Nahal Oz. Berger is also a talented violinist recognized in the country and had many local and foreign musicians follow her release from Gaza. One of them, Grammy Award-winning American-Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari, told Ynet she felt a deep connection to Berger: 'She's a violinist, I am a violinist. We both enjoy playing violin and once you relate to someone on that level it becomes a part of your story.' Ben-Ari recalled hearing Berger’s violin playing while she was still in captivity. 'I heard her playing 'Hallelujah' and I said that once she's out, I’ll invite her to come to New York and play violin with me. 'I also spoke to this terrific organization, the Israeli American Council, that has organized so many protests and demonstrations all over America for the hostages and they would facilitate this performance. This is official. I'm putting it out. And I'm so looking forward to meeting her,' she said. Ben-Ari added she believed the power of music and playing the violin could help Berger face her trauma in a way akin to therapy. 'I think the violin could become extremely therapeutic. It's something she knows. You don't forget how to play the violin. And it's like an extension of your soul,' she said. 'You get to express yourself to sometimes say things beyond words. The violin comes from your soul. I recommend everyone who is going through a healing journey and especially Agam, who is a violinist, to pick up her violin again and try and create some music. Hopefully with me.' 'I think that music is the very universal language. It is the best vehicle to show unity, to show how harmony should look like, to be proud, to have a voice, not to be afraid,' she added. 'Music and violin could become anything that you want.' 'In my journey, it was hip hop music, which has been my career. I've been the hip hop violinist from the Apollo stage to the White House to my many collaborations. And I hope that with music, we'll be able to make a whole different statement that is going to have a really good and positive impact.'

Hamas prisoners deported in hostage deal remain stranded in Cairo...	Dozens of Hamas terrorists freed in hostage deal remain stuck in Cairo as host countries delay acceptance; Palestinian official describes their situation as moving 'from an Israeli prison to an Egyptian prison' Seventy Hamas terrorists released from Israeli prisons and deported to Egypt as part of the hostage deal remain confined to a hotel in Cairo, as the countries expected to take them in have yet to formally approve their entry. 'Not a single Arab country has agreed to accept even one deported Palestinian prisoner,' a Palestinian Prisoners' Authority official told Ynet. He added that Turkey has agreed to take in the Jerusalemite deportees but will first review their backgrounds. According to the official, all released prisoners are housed in a hotel and are not allowed to leave. He described their situation as moving 'from an Israeli prison to an Egyptian prison,' noting that Hamas leadership has so far remained silent and has not publicly pressured nations like Qatar and Turkey to expedite their acceptance. The official also claimed that the former prisoners spent an extended period wearing Israeli prison uniforms and slippers, adding, 'The Egyptians are not treating them warmly.' Meanwhile, 23 additional prisoners who were set to be deported abroad remain stranded in Gaza. Besides Egypt, other countries mentioned as potential hosts for the deported prisoners include Algeria, Turkey, Tunisia and Qatar. In a joint statement, Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s foreign minister said they are willing to accept some of the released prisoners but did not specify a number. Separately, Palestinian sources reported two airstrikes in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. The second strike reportedly killed three people and wounded others. The strikes targeted vehicles traveling along the Al-Rashid coastal road, designated for pedestrian movement northward.

Held for over 15 months in tunnels, safe houses and UNRWA facilities—some in isolation—hostages endured starvation, injuries and psychological terror; some were locked in cages, others forced to work; many learned Arabic, some managed to read, write and observe Shabbat Gadi Mozes, 80, maintained a morning walking routine and kept a journal, while the IDF lookouts refrained from eating leavened food on Passover and fasted on Yom Kippur. Keith Siegel, a vegetarian, was forced to eat meat due to food shortages. Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon were held in cages during their first days in captivity, while Emily Damari, after being shot twice, was transferred to a UNRWA facility without medical care. These are some of the first testimonies emerging after the release of 13 Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals, who spent over 15 months in Hamas captivity. Siegel was held in Gaza City for 484 days, frequently moved between safe houses and tunnels. Terrorists locked him in separate rooms to prevent him from being found if anyone entered. According to reports by public broadcaster Kan, Siegel initially believed his son, Shai, had been killed, until he heard his voice on the radio and realized he had survived. He described the severe food shortages, recounting that he had to eat meat despite being vegetarian and that his last meal was a full day before his release. Bibas and Calderon, who were violently abducted, were reportedly held in cages together in their first days in captivity. Terrorists mistakenly assumed Calderon was an IDF reservist, which is why he was released in a military uniform. Both men were kept in tunnels and various buildings alongside other hostages, enduring psychological terror. One of the most harrowing moments was the brutal video in which Bibas was filmed after being falsely told that his wife, Shiri, and their sons, Ariel and Kfir, had died—an assertion that Israeli authorities have been unable to confirm or refute. Eyal Calderon, who has yet to reunite with his cousin Ofer, said he learned from Ofer’s children that, until a few weeks ago, Ofer did not know his son Rotem was alive. 'He was in a state of complete uncertainty, and then he found out through a media interview that his son had survived,' he said. 'What he endured is unimaginable. There’s still a long road ahead—his recovery will be long, with ups and downs.' Jimmy Pacheco, the caregiver of Amitai Ben-Tzvi, who was murdered on October 7, was kidnapped and later released in a previous deal. He had previously recounted being held in tunnels with Bibas and Calderon, developing a close bond with them. 'When I cried, they comforted me and assured me that the Israeli government was helping. We sang together, we laughed and I even taught Yarden my language,' he told Army Radio. Isolation, faith and forced labor Newly released hostages are sharing harrowing accounts of their time in Hamas captivity, detailing extreme isolation, forced labor and the small routines that helped them survive. Gadi Mozes, 80, structured his days in captivity to maintain both his physical and mental well-being. He walked in circles, counting tiles to track his distance, and solved math problems to stay mentally sharp. For most of his 484 days in captivity, he was alone. The first hostage he met was 29-year-old Arbel Yehoud, just before her release. Mozes, who speaks Arabic, used his language skills to communicate with his captors, who eventually provided him with English books. He kept a daily journal, writing a few lines each day, though it was confiscated before his release. He had limited access to outside information, but glimpses of his family on TV reassured him that they were fighting for his freedom. When asked what kept him going, he said the thought of reuniting with his loved ones was his main motivation, though he also experienced moments of betrayal, wondering why he and the others were still in captivity. Arbel Yehoud spent nearly 16 months in total isolation, unaware of the full extent of the October 7 attack on her kibbutz, Nir Oz, where one in four residents was either killed or kidnapped. Mozes was the first Israeli she encountered in captivity, meeting him just hours before she was freed. After her release, her father, Yechiel, said, 'She returned in relatively good health, considering the hell she endured. She survived heroically until the very last moment.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF lookouts who were taken hostage on October 7 spent their 477 days in captivity in both apartments and tunnels, some held together, others alone. Naama Levy was kept in isolation for a long period before being reunited with fellow captives Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev, who had known each other from their service on base. Despite strict prohibitions against physical contact or crying, they found ways to support each other, exercised despite the extreme conditions and food shortages, and were often forced to cook, clean and care for the children of their captors. The hostages tried to preserve their identities and faith even under duress. They refused to eat leavened bread during Passover, attempted to fast on Yom Kippur, and Agam Berger, the last lookout to be released, even observed the Sabbath. Liri Albag, another captive, relied on her charisma to navigate captivity and managed to avoid being held in tunnels for most of her time in Gaza. The two were separated shortly before their release, with Albag taken to film a propaganda video while Berger remained alone. As she was freed, Berger said, 'I chose the path of faith, and in faith, I returned.' Naama Levy, who was freed in an earlier exchange, was initially held alone for a long time before being reunited with her fellow hostages. When they finally met, she asked if the moment was real and whether they were still alive. Many of the lookouts recounted being forced to perform household chores for their captors. In an interview with Kol BaRama radio, Yafa Deri, who met with the released soldiers, said they had fasted on Yom Kippur and observed Passover customs, with Daniella even requesting traditional sfenj (North African doughnuts) for Mimouna at the end of the holiday. 'There were bombings, and they had to move from place to place, so there were no sfenj, but they are so sweet and knew their role, which is incredible,' she said. She added that Agam Berger refused to accept a Quran from her captors and instead prayed from a Hebrew prayer book she found, possibly left behind by Israeli soldiers. Mandy Damari, mother of Emily Damari, who was freed after 471 days in Hamas captivity, revealed that her daughter was held in facilities operated by UNRWA. 'Hamas held Emily in UNRWA facilities and denied her access to medical treatment after she was shot twice,' she said. 'It’s a miracle she’s alive.' Emily was released during the first phase of the current hostage deal alongside Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher. She was seen pushing a Hamas terrorist out of the vehicle that brought her to the Red Cross transfer point. Due to her injuries, two of her fingers had to be amputated. Eitan Gonen, father of Romi, told Ynet that the freed hostages supported each other in captivity. 'Romi needed permission from the terrorists for everything, even just to move right or left,' he said. He described the deep bond formed between Romi, Emily and Doron, who were held together. 'They were each other’s entire world in captivity. They talked, helped and took care of one another—like a mother, a father, a sister. Now that they’re back, they do everything together. They go out to eat, visit each other’s rooms and are inseparable. I look at them and see three superheroes.' In a video message played at a rally for the hostages in Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square, Doron said, 'I’m okay. The moment I can, I’ll be out there holding a sign,' signaling her commitment to continuing the fight to bring the remaining hostages home. Over the weekend, five Thai nationals abducted by Hamas on October 7 were also released in Khan Younis as part of a separate deal brokered by the Thai government. It remains unclear whether any concessions were made for their release. The freed hostages—Sathian Suwannakham, 34; Pongsak Thenna, 35; Bannawat Seathao, 27; Watchara Sriaoun, 32; and Surasak Lamnau, 30—spoke of prolonged periods of hunger, difficulty breathing in underground tunnels and being held in dark rooms. They were kept in two separate groups, with two in one location and three in another. During their captivity, they learned to communicate in Arabic with their captors. Despite the harsh conditions, their medical condition was reported as stable upon release. One more Thai hostage remains in captivity, along with a Nepalese citizen. Two Thai nationals and one Tanzanian citizen are believed to have been killed in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjbm6a3ukx	2025-02-02T02:15:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkWevT3001g/rkWevT3001g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israeli forces detained Lebanese fisherman, reports claim	Lebanese media claim Israeli Navy detained fisherman near Naqoura as Hezbollah supporters push for new border march despite IDF presence; Hezbollah-affiliated network alleges Israeli sniper shot at camera near Yaroun, releasing footage of incident Lebanese media reported Sunday that Israeli forces detained a fisherman near the coastal town of Naqoura, close to the Israel-Lebanon border, amid ongoing tensions as residents attempt to return to villages in southern Lebanon despite Israeli warnings. A video circulating online purportedly shows the moment of the arrest, with a voice in the background exclaiming, 'Look, he’s raising his hands. I swear to God, he raised his hands!' According to reports, the detained fisherman was identified as Mohammad Jahir. Lebanon’s state-run news agency claimed he was apprehended by an 'enemy Israeli boat' while fishing with his brother, who was left behind. The IDF said it was aware of the reports and the incident was under review. The alleged arrest comes amid renewed calls for Lebanese civilians to participate in 'marches of return' to southern villages still under Israeli military presence. Organizers have dubbed it the 'Second Sunday of Return,' marking a week since violent clashes erupted as thousands of Lebanese demonstrators, many waving Hezbollah flags, attempted to re-enter border villages following the expiration of the initial cease-fire agreement. According to Lebanese sources, at least 22 people, including a Lebanese soldier, were killed in those clashes, with over 100 others wounded. Although the cease-fire was extended until February 18 under U.S. mediation, Hezbollah and its affiliates continue urging civilians to push back into the disputed areas. Calls circulated Saturday night urging residents to gather at village entrances and 'stand alongside the families and the army in defense of the homeland.' By Sunday morning, small groups of Lebanese were seen assembling near border villages, including Meiss El Jabal and Hula, again carrying Hezbollah flags. Despite the mobilization efforts, participation appeared lower than last week, and no major confrontations had been reported. However, in the village of Yaroun, Hezbollah-affiliated network Al Mayadeen claimed an Israeli sniper shot at one of its cameras positioned at the northern entrance of the town. The news outlet shared footage allegedly showing the camera falling from its tripod, though no gunfire was heard in the video. Israeli officials have defended their continued military presence in parts of southern Lebanon, citing the Lebanese army’s failure to deploy effectively in Hezbollah-controlled areas south of the Litani River. Israeli assessments suggest that last week's border confrontations were orchestrated by Hezbollah to provoke clashes with IDF forces, reinforcing Israel’s justification for maintaining a presence in the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although the cease-fire remains in effect, it is unclear whether the IDF will complete its withdrawal by the February 18 deadline. A senior Israeli military official told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth last week that 'until the Lebanese army fully assumes its responsibilities and demonstrates sufficient control over the area, we will not recommend transferring authority to them.' Tensions have also flared in recent days, with the IDF intercepting a suspicious aerial target over the northern border town of Zar'it on Friday. A day earlier, Israeli fighter jets downed a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone—the first such incident since the cease-fire extension. The IDF also conducted a rare airstrike deep in southern Lebanon, targeting a truck and another vehicle suspected of smuggling Hezbollah weaponry in violation of the cease-fire terms. On Thursday night, the Israeli Air Force carried out additional strikes in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, hitting multiple Hezbollah positions. According to the IDF, the sites targeted included an underground weapons production facility and cross-border smuggling routes used by Hezbollah to transfer arms from Syria into Lebanon. The military said the strikes were intended to neutralize threats to Israeli forces and civilian areas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4aka3okl	2025-02-02T01:42:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/By11qfAihOyg/By11qfAihOyg_0_221_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israeli forces push into another West Bank terrorist stronghold	After operations in Tulkarm and Jenin, IDF forces enter Tamun overnight, where 10 terrorists killed in airstrike last week; troops launch ground maneuver at dawn, uncovering weapons and explosives as part of counterterror efforts The IDF announced Sunday the expansion of its Iron Wall counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank, confirming that combat teams from the Bislach Brigade have begun operating in the Palestinian village of Tamun. According to the IDF, forces entered Tamun overnight and uncovered weapons, including an M-16 rifle and ammunition magazines. This marks the latest expansion of the nearly two-week-old operation, which now includes brigade-level combat teams operating simultaneously in three locations: the Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps, and now Tamun. 'Security forces continue the operation to thwart terrorism in northern Samaria while ensuring the safety of Israeli civilians,' the IDF said. Since the start of the operation, IDF troops have been conducting raids in the hostile urban terrain of Jenin, a densely packed area of approximately 1.5 square kilometers, arresting and eliminating terrorists. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last week, Staff Sgt. Liam Hazi of the Haruv Reconnaissance Battalion was killed in an encounter with Palestinian gunmen in Jenin, where four other soldiers were lightly to moderately wounded, and another was seriously injured. The IDF has recently extended its operation to Tulkarm's Nur Shams refugee camp, implementing checkpoints to screen residents for potential terrorist activity in both Jenin and Tulkarm. On Saturday, Israeli aircraft struck two groups of armed terrorists near the Jenin refugee camp, with confirmed hits, according to the military. Later, the IDF targeted a vehicle carrying terrorists in Kabatiya, south of Jenin, killing three individuals. Palestinian sources identified one of the dead as Abd al-Hadi Kamil, a Hamas operative who was released from Israeli prison in the first hostage deal in November 2023. Tamun, the latest focus of IDF operations, was targeted in an Israeli airstrike last Wednesday that killed at least 10 terrorists, including Omar Basharat and Montaser Bani Odeh, who were involved in a roadside bomb attack that killed IDF reservist Sgt. First Class (res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda. The two were also linked to additional shooting and bombing attacks. In early January, the IDF confirmed another airstrike in Tamun targeting a group of terrorists. Palestinian reports claimed three people were killed, including two children aged 8 and 10. The IDF claimed that those killed were confirmed as terrorists actively planting explosives near Israeli forces. Prior to that, two armed Palestinians who opened fire at Israeli troops were killed in a drone strike. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjqnmhhu1l	2025-02-02T00:02:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BkHuBq3Oyl/BkHuBq3Oyl_0_534_1200_676_0_small.jpg

Three Iraqi sources close to pro-Iranian militias denied reports of negotiations to secure the release of Israeli hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov, insisting there are 'no channels of communication with the Israeli enemy.'

However, on Friday, sources in Baghdad and Beirut told the British-based news outlet Amwaj that a proposal had been raised for a potential prisoner exchange. Under the suggested deal, Israel would release Hezbollah operatives and the captain of a Lebanese vessel—whom the IDF identified as a senior Hezbollah figure—in return for Tsurkov’s freedom. According to the report, her captors from the pro-Iranian Kataib Hezbollah militia expressed willingness to proceed with the exchange, but Israel had yet to approve the deal.

Prison issues warning bracelets to terrorists freed in hostage de...	Palestinian prisoners set for release under hostage deal given bracelets inscribed with Bible verse in Arabic and overview of Gaza’s destruction, aimed at deterring them from returning to terrorism Palestinian prisoners released in the third and fourth rounds of the hostage deal’s first phase received bracelets from the Israel Prison Service (IPS) with an Arabic inscription from the Book of Psalms, reading: 'The eternal nation does not forget; I will pursue my enemies and overtake them.' Signs with the same message were displayed in IPS detention facilities as part of a psychological campaign alongside the prisoner releases. The translation on the bracelets was written in formal Arabic, which many prisoners struggled to understand. 'No matter what they write, will it change anything?' a Palestinian Prisoners’ Affairs official said. 'It’s a gesture of provocation and threat, but beyond that, it has no meaning. All the prisoners removed IPS-issued clothing, including the bracelet meant to insult them.' The International Red Cross criticized the IPS, arguing that the method of shackling and the use of the bracelets harmed the prisoners. During the release process, one prisoner felt unwell and was treated by IPS medical staff. Ynet has learned that the prisoners were briefed on the destruction in Gaza to deter them from returning to terrorism. Israel released 183 prisoners on Saturday — 143 were transferred from Ketziot Prison in the Negev to Gaza, eight were deported to Egypt and 32 were released to the West Bank from Ofer Prison, after which celebrations were held in Ramallah.

We can expand the circle of peace': PM says talks will focus on Saudi normalization, next phase of hostage deal and countering Iranian threat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed for Washington on Sunday for his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump since the latter’s return to office. Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the White House, underscoring the strong ties between the two allies. Before boarding his flight, Netanyahu said the meeting was of 'great significance' for Israel, highlighting the deep bond between the two nations and his personal relationship with Trump. 'This connection has already yielded great achievements, including the historic Abraham Accords,' he said, referring to normalization agreements with four Arab nations brokered during Trump’s previous term. 'We can strengthen Israel’s security, expand the circle of peace even further and usher in a remarkable era beyond our imagination—an era of prosperity, security and peace through strength. The strength of our soldiers, our citizens, Israel and the alliance between Israel and the United States,' Netanyahu concluded. During the visit, Netanyahu is expected to discuss key issues, including the ongoing hostage deal negotiations, post-war governance in Gaza and broader regional stability. Talks will also address Iran’s nuclear ambitions and potential normalization with Saudi Arabia—though Riyadh has conditioned any agreement on a political pathway for the Palestinians, a demand Netanyahu has so far resisted. Netanyahu’s delegation includes Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, hostage coordinator Gal Hirsch and newly appointed communications advisor Caroline Glick. Also on board was Netanyahu’s personal physician, following his recent prostate surgery. The visit comes as Trump’s administration is still shaping its Middle East policy.

The negotiations, led by Qatari, Egyptian and U.S. mediators, are expected to resume Monday. Netanyahu has thus far refused to send Israeli negotiators to Doha or Cairo, opting instead for indirect talks via U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. Iran is expected to be a central focus of discussions, with Israel seeking clarity on whether the U.S. plans to engage diplomatically with Tehran on a new nuclear deal. Israeli officials stress that Washington’s broader regional commitments—particularly to Saudi Arabia and the UAE—are closely tied to its Iran strategy. Netanyahu is likely to urge Trump to prioritize countering Iran before addressing Palestinian-related demands from the Saudis. During the visit, Netanyahu will reunite with his wife, Sara, who has been in Miami for the past 70 days.

These are the 20 hostages set to be freed ahead of fifth hostage ...	3 hostages will be released each week in deal's first phase, followed by expected release of 11 more captives before negotiations begin on next stage Despite challenges, Israel’s hostage deal with Hamas remains intact and the terror group appears intent on maintaining it at least until day 42, the final day of the agreement’s first phase. Following the release of hostages Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon and Yarden Bibas on Saturday, the number of hostages returned to Israel under the deal has reached 18, including five Thai nationals freed on Thursday. Seventy-nine hostages remain in Gaza, a third of the 251 taken on October 7, 2023, in Hamas’ massacre, 35 of whom are considered deceased. The deal’s first phase, set to return 33 Israelis, is expected to bring back 20 more, including the remaining members of the Bibas family —mother Shiri and children Ariel and Kfir. The IDF warned there was a 'grave concern for their lives.'

New IDF chief faces tough task of rebuilding military amid war	Architect of Israel’s wartime arms race now faces new battle—balancing draft exemption debate as combat units lack troops and reserve turnout drops; with war dragging past 16 months, Eyal Zamir must brace for fresh rounds against Hamas The Israeli government has named Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir as the next chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), replacing Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Zamir, a former deputy chief of staff and director-general of the Defense Ministry, was the leading candidate for the position since the early days of the war, following Halevi’s acceptance of responsibility for the failures of October 7. Zamir, who previously served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s military secretary, was widely seen as the most experienced and suitable choice. His appointment marks the second time in recent history that a defense ministry director-general has transitioned directly into the IDF’s top position, following Lt. Gen. (res.) Gabi Ashkenazi’s appointment in 2007 after the failures of the Second Lebanon War. As chief of staff, Zamir will face the immense challenge of rebuilding the IDF after months of intense combat, implementing a long-term restructuring plan and preparing the military for multi-front conflicts rather than the traditional two-front model. He will also have to navigate the political and military complexities surrounding the draft exemption for ultra-Orthodox men, a contentious issue that has placed strain on the IDF’s manpower needs. During his tenure as defense ministry director-general, Zamir played a key role in securing military aid, orchestrating air and sea supply lines that brought critical weapons shipments to Israel amid increasing international pressure and embargoes. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, he is expected to benefit from renewed U.S. military support, including the delivery of thousands of precision-guided munitions previously frozen by the Biden administration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zamir’s immediate priorities will include overseeing fragile cease-fires in both Gaza and Lebanon. While a temporary truce with Hezbollah is in place until at least February 18 under U.S. mediation, tensions remain high, and Hamas’s agreement with Israel is also on shaky ground. If fighting resumes in Gaza, Zamir will be responsible for executing further military operations against Hamas while securing an expanded buffer zone along the border. The lack of a long-term governance plan for Gaza presents another significant challenge. With Hamas still exerting civilian control over the enclave’s population, military gains from months of operations risk being eroded. Zamir may be forced to revert to a policy he knows well from his time as head of the Southern Command: frequent, limited engagements with Hamas to maintain deterrence, but this time with stronger defensive measures aimed at preventing another October 7-style attack. The new chief of staff will also have to address growing fatigue among Israel’s active-duty and reserve forces. Many reservists have served between six months and a year in the ongoing war, and enlistment rates are declining. With the government keeping forces deployed in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, Zamir will need to push the political leadership to establish clearer military priorities and address troop shortages in combat units. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1sjufnukx	2025-02-01T20:59:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/07/11/HJUG3cOpu/HJUG3cOpu_0_91_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The IDF said Sunday that three Palestinian terrorists were killed in three separate airstrikes overnight in Jenin and Qabatiya in the northern West Bank. According to the IDF, an Israeli aircraft struck a terrorist cell in Qabatiya that was en route to carry out an imminent attack.

In Jenin, Israeli aircraft targeted two armed terrorist squads, the military said. No further details on the casualties were provided.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rymfryho1e	2025-02-01T20:41:33-08:00

Saudi Arabia, Iran and 'the day after': Netanyahu heads to crucia...	The prime minister will meet with the U.S. president, with the goal of influencing American policy that is still being formed; At least one fateful decision will be made during the visit - which will likely affect both the fate of the hostage deal and the Netanyahu government The Iranian issue, 'the day after' and normalization with Saudi Arabia are on the table as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes off Sunday morning for a significant visit to Washington, with the aim of influencing the new administration's policy priorities. The most important part of the trip will be Netanyahu's personal meeting with the new-old U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House, during which the two will try to piece together the complex puzzle of the Middle East and set priorities on all the burning issues on the agenda. In focus: the hostage deal , the Gaza Strip, Hamas, 'the day after' and the entire issue of reconstruction. Netanyahu is the first foreign leader invited to meet with Trump, who will roll out the red carpet for him, host him at the official Blair House guest house, and invite him to a gala dinner at the White House. Israel attaches great importance to the visit, and believes that the prime minister will be able to influence the way Trump shapes his administration's policy regarding the Middle East - along with the understanding that the U.S. president also has his own instincts and interests. Trump talked about the Middle East before his inauguration on January 20, but on many issues he has not yet made decisions. Netanyahu is interested in influencing this process, and an Israeli official even said that 'only after his meeting with Trump will it be possible to formulate a policy. Until then, there is not much room to move forward.' Trump's ambitions for the 'relocation' of Gazans in favor of rebuilding the Strip are no joke, and his statements are also consistent with his statements about deporting immigrants to Mexico. Even if there is currently no Arab country willing to accept the Palestinians, Trump continues to bring it up again and again - perhaps also for internal American considerations. In his view, it would be impossible to rehabilitate Gaza without evacuating the population - the land is contaminated, uninhabitable, and it would take years to clear the rubble and clean it up. The Iranian issue: Agreement or military operation After some hoped that the U.S., led by Trump, would cooperate with an attack on Iran, Israel is expecting to hear what the new president's plan is on the subject - and whether he intends to enter into a diplomatic dialogue with Tehran to reach a new nuclear agreement. Israel understands that the Iranian issue fits into the American perspective in the regional architecture, as there are other countries in the Middle East for which this issue is important - such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Therefore, the U.S. has obligations on this issue not only in the Israeli context. Trump's goal is for Iran to not have a nuclear bomb, and the two options he faces are either an agreement or military action against Iran, Israeli or joint. Until one of these outcomes is achieved, Israel would like to see the U.S. impose crippling sanctions on Iran, alongside a credible military threat to deter it. Trump, as has already been understood based on his statements and the statements of his deputy, will not initiate military action against Iran. He does not want to start wars and Iran is not his war, but there are certainly wars of others in which he can help. In doing so, Trump is effectively resolving for himself the contradiction between the desire to be a peacemaker and the ability to help Israel win on various fronts. In addition to the president, Netanyahu is also expected to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz , House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Senator Lindsey Graham. In the meetings he will hold, the parties will also discuss the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court in The Hague against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and the imposition of sanctions on ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan and his team. In addition, they will talk about the continued transfer of weapons from the U.S. to Israel, the maintenance of the cease-fire in Lebanon, the attitude toward the new regime in Syria, and the beginning of discussions on the security memorandum of understanding between the countries, with the current memorandum set to expire in 2028. During his visit, Netanyahu will meet with his wife Sara, who is expected to join him from Miami after not seeing each other for 70 days. This is the first time Netanyahu has flown abroad since the arrest warrant was issued against him, and Sara said she will return to Israel with him on the Wing of Zion official airplane after extending her stay in the U.S. several times. Phase 2 of the cease-fire and hostage deal Negotiations on the second phase of the hostage deal and the cease-fire, which have actually already begun behind closed doors but not formally, are scheduled to begin on Monday - on the 16th day after the cease-fire in the Gaza Strip comes into effect, as stipulated in the agreement. But on Saturday night Netanyahu announced that he will not send a team to Doha or Cairo, and right now it appears that the talks will be conducted in dialogues through envoy Steve Witkoff. Netanyahu holds onto promises from former President Joe Biden (in writing) and President Trump (oral), which state that Israel will be able to return to fighting in the Gaza Strip without it being considered a 'violation' as long as no agreements are reached in negotiations. But, it is clear to everyone that it is much more complex. The Americans are busy building pillars for strategic policy, and Trump is likely to ask - and even demand - the prime minister for more time, and not to return to fighting. From the statements made this week by Donald Trump's Middle East envoy , Steve Witkoff, it can also be understood that the administration does not want to see a return to fighting so quickly - and demands that the negotiations be exhausted to the end. However, voices can be heard in the administration expressing doubt about the ability to fully implement the agreement. As part of the negotiations on phase two of the deal, the parties are also supposed to discuss the issue of 'the day after' in Gaza, which is related to a crucial decision that may be made at the Netanyahu-Trump meeting - the answer to the question of what comes first: dealing with the Iranian threat or normalization with Saudi Arabia . The U.S. and Israel know that the Saudis will not come to the table unless there is a permanent cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and a 'political horizon' for the Palestinians, and it is still unclear as to what exactly it will demand from Israel in general and Netanyahu in particular on a practical or declarative level. It is not impossible that Netanyahu will try to convince Trump during their meeting to deal with the Iranian threat first. He will argue that this will also serve the interests of the Saudis and will give them time, without pressure, to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: If Trump prefers to start with Saudi Arabia, it could put Netanyahu's government to the test. In such a scenario, Trump could tell the prime minister: Before Iran, first end the war and return all the hostages. If you don't do this, you will get nothing - neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran. Therefore, if Netanyahu fails to convince Trump, and the American president insists on continuing the deal, he may in effect set a date for early elections in Israel. Either way, the prime minister plans to stay in the U.S. over next weekend - during the next round of the hostages' release. Netanyahu's intention is evident from the fact that, in a referendum on filling his position in his absence that was brought to the government, the ministers were asked to confirm that Netanyahu would stay in the U.S. between February 2 and February 9. His place will be filled by Minister Yariv Levin, and the cabinet meetings will be chaired by Defense Minister Israel Katz. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1liv73dkg	2025-02-01T14:32:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/23/ryxHzeETdC/ryxHzeETdC_0_68_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Ariev stated that 'I was held captive by Hamas for a year and five months. Today, thank God, I am home, in Israel, with my family and my people.

Keith thought his son had been murdered, then heard his voice on ...	The three hostages released Saturday spoke of appalling conditions including lack of food and frequent moves to new hiding places; Keith was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian; and Yarden Bibas, who learned Arabic in captivity, was imprisoned in a cage with Ofer Calderon and was subjected to physical and mental abuse. Keith Siegel, Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon returned to Israel Saturday morning after 484 days in captivity, during which they were held in very difficult conditions. Upon their return, they said they suffered from a lack of food and often were moved from place to place by Hamas terrorists. Keith was held in Gaza City, where he stayed with other hostages and moved between safe houses and tunnels. The terrorists locked him in a room each time, so that he could not be found if anyone broke in. Keith, according to a report on the public broadcaster, Kan, recalls the days of his captivity in detail - and said that he thought his son Shai had been murdered until he heard his voice on the radio and realized that he was alive. His wife, Aviva, did not know what had happened to her son until the day she was released from captivity in the previous hostage deal and saw him. Keith also described how he was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian, and that he ate it when it was given to him since he received very little food. The last time he ate before he was released was Friday afternoon. In addition, the public broadcaster reported that Yarden Bibas learned Arabic in captivity, and that the terrorists treated Ofer Calderon as a military reservist - which is why he was released in a military uniform. Yarden and Ofer said that during their first days of captivity in Khan Younis the terrorists beat them and locked them in cages - as described by the hostages who were with them and who were released in the previous deal. The two were subjected to severe physical and mental abuse, and were held in tunnels and buildings alongside other hostages. Among other things, the cruel video in which Yarden was filmed while the terrorists informed him of the death of his wife Shiri and his children Ariel and Kfir is particularly memorable - a statement that Israel has so far been unable to verify or discount. When Ofer arrived at the collection point with the IDF on Saturday, he asked the soldiers for a beer - but because of he was weak and just out of captivity he was told that it could only be done gradually. All three of the hostages who returned Saturday testified that they were exposed to the media, especially Al Jazeera, and that they saw the demonstrations for their release. According to them, the protests gave them strength and hope that they would eventually be reunited with their families. At Ichilov Hospital, where Keith Siegel was taken, Deputy Director General Professor Gil Fire said this evening that 'an initial assessment of his condition revealed that his condition is overall fine and stable, allowing him to spend time with his family, both to rest and to process the experiences of the last few days and the entire period. We will continue to accompany Keith and Mr. Gadi Mozes and examine in more depth the effects of the captivity. We will provide them with everything they need, including ancillary services. We will continue to keep them in the hospital as long as their medical condition requires and also provide additional tests, according to their wishes and those of their families.'

We must ensure that the rounds of release continue and move on to phase two of the deal as quickly as possible. We are there for my father, hugging him, and asking to maintain the privacy of my father and the family.' The other hostages who were returned in the current deal also spoke of food shortages, being moved from place to place and even being forced to stay in tunnels. Two of them - Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, who were held by Islamic Jihad - said they were alone for the entire period, and in fact the first time they saw an Israeli was when they met each other before they were released. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjewsw200yl	2025-02-01T12:01:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/B1yuXpj00yl/B1yuXpj00yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

It will be Sharaa's first official visit abroad since he assumed power after leading a rebel campaign that ousted Bashar al-Assad in December. Sharaa, an Islamist who was once an affiliate of al Qaeda, has been trying to gain support from Arab and Western leaders since former Syrian President Assad was toppled.

The Palestinian Red Crescent later confirmed that two were killed in the attack. One of them is Abed Alauna, who was released from prison in Israel as part of the first hostage deal in November 2023. Since the beginning of the operation, the Palestinians have reported 20 deaths in the area of the Jenin camp. On Saturday evening, the IDF announced that an air force aircraft, directed by the Shin Bet, attacked a vehicle carrying terrorists in Qabatia, south of Jenin. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, two were killed and a third passenger was injured. The IDF has not yet added details about the attack. The attack was carried out as part of the IDF's Iron Wall operation in the northern West Bank. On Thursday, a soldier from the Haruv Reconnaissance Battalion, Sergeant Liam Hazi , 20, was killed in an encounter with terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp . Alongside Hazi, another soldier was seriously injured, and four others were lightly to moderately wounded. Hours later, patrol soldiers and a force from the Shin Bet located the terrorists responsible inside a building and eliminated them. As part of the operation in the northern West Bank, soldiers on the ground are scanning buildings in the hostile camp in Jenin, which is no larger than a square kilometer, and arresting and eliminating terrorists. From the air, Israeli Air Force aircraft are carrying out targeted assassinations of relatively senior terrorists, and of armed terrorists who pose a threat to the forces.

Israel's next IDF chief of staff: Eyal Zamir	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have chosen Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, director general of the Defense Ministry, to be the first Chief of Staff to come from the Armored Corps since David (Dado) Elazar in the early 1970s; Next month, he will replace Herzi Halevi, who congratulated Zamir: 'I am sure he will lead the IDF forward' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have selected Eyal Zamir, a retired major general and director general of the Defense Ministry, to be the next IDFchief of staff. His appointment still requires the approval of the advisory committee for senior appointments - the Grunis Committee - and the official and final approval of the government. Assuming he passes successfully, Zamir - who was previously identified as the leading candidate for the position - is expected to take office on March 6, upon the resignation of outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. In doing so, Zamir will be the first chief of staff to come from the Armored Corps since David (Dado) Elazar in the 1970s. Zamir, 59, has been considered the leading candidate to succeed Halevi due to his experience, authority and professionalism, and mainly due to his views that opposed a small army. He is also considered a leading candidate by Netanyahu. At the 2021 Deputy Chief of Staff exchange ceremony, Zamir sounded a warning, stating that 'in the face of a multi-threat campaign, the IDF needs a critical mass of quality and quantity.' Senior political figures said of his candidacy that 'Zamir is the leading candidate for the position of the next Chief of Staff. He is accepted by the top brass of the country, and the right man to bring about healing to the army after the October 7 debacle.' Zamir, the former deputy chief of staff, is also considered very popular with many army officers. He has been involved in force building over the past year and has had excellent relations with the Americans. Since the beginning of the Iron Swords war, Zamir has been involved in an unprecedented purchase of weapons from the United States, including purchase deals for fighter jets and armaments, and also in increasing local production in Israel in the defense industries. As soon as he takes office, he will face major challenges: the immediate appointment of a deputy chief of staff, and a new commander of the Southern Command to replace Major General Yaron Finkelman, who retired. Zamir served in the IDF for 38 years in a variety of senior combat and command positions, including commander of the Southern Command and commander of the Ga'ash Division. In his last position in the army, which he held between 2018 and 2021, he served as Deputy Chief of Staff under Aviv Kochavi. During this period, he coordinated the headquarters' work to implement the multi-year Tnufa (Momentum) plan, and managed all military assistance to the civilian sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and during Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Before becoming Deputy Chief of Staff, Zamir served as Commander of the Southern Command and as the Prime Minister's Military Secretary. Before that, he was also IDF Ground Forces Chief.

In the coming weeks, we will complete a professional and high-quality transfer of command of the IDF.'

Freed hostage Doron Steinbrecher speaks for 1st time: 'I am here ...	Freed hostage released nearly two weeks ago promised to fight for those left behind in a video message at the weekly rally in Hostage Square; 'I will do everything, until everyone returns home. We are together until the end ' Doron Steinbrecher , who was released from Hamas captivity in the first phase of the current deal, sent her first video message to the participants of the rally in Hostages' Square Saturday evening. 'The last time I sat like this with a camera pointed at me, it was in captivity, and this whole thing sends me back to all the videos of captivity that I filmed and saw,' she began. 'But this time I'm sitting comfortably on a couch, in a warm and cozy place, with my family looking at me - and no matter how difficult it is, it was important to me to film this video.' Steinbrecher said that 'I want you to see me, that I'm okay, and that it will take more time and it's a process that doesn't end in a week or two - but I'm here thanks to you. Thank you to all the people who embraced my family and are embracing me now, people who don't even know me. It's important for me to also say thank you to all the soldiers and security forces. I sit here to see and contemplate everything that was here in this crazy year - and I see what an important and huge part they played both on October 7 and after.' Steinbrecher then addressed the families of the hostages who remained in captivity: 'You are not alone, and we continue to fight for you. We will do everything, I will do everything, until everyone returns home and until you can close the circle. We are together until the end. The first second I can leave here, I will be there with a sign in my hand.' At the end, she addressed the citizens of Israel with a smile and a message: 'I understand that everyone knows me from the terrible recording 'Help me, help me,' or as the blonde wearing pink, 31 years old from the Kfar Aza. But I am no longer a blonde and I will no longer wear pink. I am Doron, 31 years old, and I am no longer a prisoner of Hamas. I am in my own home.'

I feel the missing, the silent cry of those who are waiting for their return. We cannot let go. We must not stop! I ask you, don't stop! Be there, continue with all your strength!' Doron's sister, Yamit Ashkenazi, also spoke: 'She is no longer a hostage. How I waited to say this. And how afraid I was to imagine this moment. 471 days of a long journey, in which optimism cracked time and time again, but hope – it always remained there, burning within us.

Trump says he ordered airstrikes on Islamic State in Somalia	U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered military airstrikes on Saturday targeting a senior Islamic State attack planner and others from the organization in Somalia. 'These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. 'The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.' Saturday's strikes were carried out in the Golis Mountains, said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who added that an initial assessment indicated multiple operatives were killed. He said no civilians were harmed. An official in the Somali president's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the strikes and said Somalia's government welcomed the move. 'Somalia cannot be a safe haven for terrorists,' said the official, adding that the impact of the strikes was still being assessed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syzqu13d1x	2025-02-01T09:32:36-08:00	
Defense minister threatens released terrorist Zubeidi: ' One mist...	Israel Katz sent a message to the former commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, saying that 'We will not accept support for terrorism'; Zakaria Zubeidi has complained since his release about torture in prison Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened released terrorist prisoner Zakaria Zubeidi, who was released on Thursday as part of the hostage deal, saying on Saturday evening that: 'We will not accept support for terrorism. One mistake and you’re going to meet old friends.' Zubeidi, a symbol of terrorism in Jenin who was formerly the commander of Fatah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in the Palestinian city in northern Samaria, was welcomed as a hero during celebrations in Ramallah on Thursday, making a V-shaped sign of victory and saying: 'Thanks be to Allah who blessed me with liberation today. May God have mercy on the martyrs in Gaza.' When asked about reports that Israel would not allow him to return to the Jenin refugee camp, where he was born and raised and where the IDF's major Operation Iron Wall is currently underway, he promised that he would eventually return. 'The dragon is the owner of the land and the hunter is an invader – and he must leave,' replied Zubeidi, referring to the nickname he was given in Jenin, and to Israel by 'the hunter.' The origin of these nicknames is the thesis he prepared for his master's degree at Birzeit University, titled 'The Hunter and the Dragon: Being Wanted in the Palestinian Experience 1968-2018.' Zubeidi, as he defines it, embodies the character of 'the dragon,' which originates from an ancient legend in which the dragon overcomes the hunter, after a long and difficult chase, referring to his personal experience with Israel. In an interview with the Turkish news agency Anadolu, Zubeidi claimed that he suffered torture in prison. 'I was beaten in Israeli prisons and remained handcuffed until the last day,' he alleged. 'For three and a half years I was in solitary confinement under torture in Israeli prisons. Gaza returned me to my family and we must unite to rebuild it.' In an interview with the British Sky News network on Saturday, Zubeidi said: 'My life is worth nothing without freedom, and freedom has no price - but the world has ignored my freedom - especially Britain, France and the U.S. They must return what they took from me and my children. They are the ones who were wrong about us - and they need to think about repairing the pain they caused me and my children.' Zubeidi, 49, began his career as a police officer in the Palestinian Authority, but became a terrorist whose main activity took place after Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, which brought about the end of the Second Intifada. He then became a very well-known figure in Israel, mainly due to his ties with Israeli left-wing activist Tali Fahima, who aided Palestinian terrorists, which attracted a lot of media attention. He is one of the senior terrorist operatives in the West Bank and is among the terrorists included in the 'wanted persons agreement' that was formulated in 2007 after the intifada, at which time he ceased to be wanted. Zubeidi was appointed as the representative of the Prisoners' Office in the Jenin refugee camp, and later also served as a member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council. In early 2019, he was arrested and imprisoned following several shooting attacks in the Beit El area. In 2021, he managed to escape from Gilboa prison, along with five other terrorists, and was only captured after a five-day extensive manhunt. Zubeidi had previously spent many years in an Israeli prison, for being the commander of Fatah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Jenin.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byl0acsoke	2025-02-01T09:30:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/SkSLePKuye/SkSLePKuye_0_163_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Dad, you’re a hero!': Keith Siegel's emotional homecoming from G...	Wrapped in Israeli flag, Siegel returns to Israel after 484 days in Hamas captivity, waving to supporters at hospital; his wife Aviva tearfully exclaims, 'He looks good!' His daughter Shir calls him a 'champion' Israeli American hostage Keith Siegel returned to Israel on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity, reuniting with his family in an emotional meeting at Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. Siegel, who was released at Gaza’s seaport, was transferred to Israeli security forces and documented smiling and waving before crossing into Israel. After undergoing an initial medical evaluation at a reception center near Gaza, he was flown by helicopter to the hospital, where he walked out wrapped in an Israeli flag alongside his wife, Aviva, who was freed in a previous hostage release deal. Ignoring a wheelchair offered to him, Siegel waved to the crowd as Aviva tearfully exclaimed, 'He looks good!' Their daughter, Shir, shared a celebratory message on social media: 'Our dad is home!!!' In video footage from the hospital, Siegel’s children embraced him, saying, 'Dad, you made it! You're amazing for surviving!' to which he replied, 'You are the amazing ones.' Family members described their relief and gratitude. 'Finally, we can breathe again,' said Siegel’s nephew Gil. 'It feels like a dream. We’re waiting for the hug we’ve missed for so long.' The family prepared Siegel’s favorite meal—pancakes—for his return. 'This will be his first treat, but the real gift is the huge hug from all of us,' Gil added. The family also vowed to keep fighting for those still held in Gaza. 'This is not over until the last hostage comes home,' said Siegel’s nephew, Itay, who noted that another relative, Elia Cohen, remains in captivity. Former hostage Emily Damari, who was freed last month, watched Siegel’s release with Shir, writing on Instagram: 'What a moment of true joy. We won’t stop until Gali, Ziv and all the hostages are home,' referring to Gali and Ziv Berman, who were abducted from Kfar Aza. Siegel was abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7 and was released quietly compared to the chaotic handover of hostages in previous days. He was briefly placed on a stage at the transfer site, where he waved while wearing a cap. Hamas handed him two plastic bags, with reports suggesting one contained belongings for his wife, Aviva. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a statement, the Siegel family expressed overwhelming gratitude. 'At this moment, our father sets foot on Israeli soil, and we are overwhelmed with indescribable emotion. After 484 long, terrifying days filled with immense worry, we can finally breathe. We thank the Israeli and U.S. governments for making this deal happen—one that prioritizes human life and Jewish and Israeli values.' The statement also called for continued efforts to bring back all remaining hostages. 'Our father was cruelly taken from his home, and today he returns. As citizens, it is our duty to ensure that every hostage is brought back—those still alive to their families and those murdered to be laid to rest on Israeli soil.' Ahead of his release, Aviva Siegel was visibly emotional as she prepared to reunite with her husband for the first time since her own release. 'The big day has arrived! I’m so happy, happier than I could ever be,' she told her daughter Shir in a video message. 'I’m ready with everything. I’m going!' Shir responded with excitement: 'See you with Dad!' The hostages’ reception center at Re’im saw another emotional reunion earlier in the day when Jordan Bibas and Ofer Calderon were also freed. Israel is set to release 183 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages under the fourth phase of the cease-fire deal. 'Words can’t describe the joy we feel' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Office welcomed the release of Siegel from Hamas captivity, saying, 'The Israeli government embraces the return of Keith Siegel. His family has been informed by the relevant authorities that he has joined our forces. The government, along with all security agencies, will continue to support him and his family.' Friends from Kibbutz Kfar Aza gathered to watch Siegel’s release. Mor Yitzhak (Pitsu), one of his longtime friends, recalled, 'We met at Ruhama’s clubhouse and watched Keith’s release together—it was incredibly emotional. Keith had pre-existing medical conditions, so Aviva was worried about whether he would survive without proper treatment. We’ve known Keith since he moved to the kibbutz—he’s a quiet, introverted person. We were closer to Aviva because our daughter used to work with her after school and admired her as a caregiver.' Yitzhak noted that Siegel appeared to be in relatively good condition. 'Keith has always been thin, and I didn’t notice anything unusual,' he said. 'He looked pale, unshaven and unkempt, which is unlike him—he was a salesman and always well-groomed. I was afraid I’d see him in worse shape. Words can’t describe the joy we feel. But for the Kfar Aza community, we’re still waiting for Gali and Ziv. Over 70 people remain in Hamas captivity, and every passing day makes their situation worse.' Hagai Horowitz, another resident of Kfar Aza, described the relief of seeing the helicopters arriving in the morning. 'So much happiness for the Siegel family. Keith is a dear man returning home. Now, our hearts are with Gali and Ziv—we must do everything to bring them back.' Two of Siegel’s friends, Hila Sagiv and Ora Lavi, prepared a welcome sign and waited for his arrival near Re’im. 'We’re here for Keith, so that even for a moment, he sees us and feels the warmth—that he knows we’ve been waiting for him,' they said. 'We imagine our first reunion and going back to our favorite restaurant. We know recovery will take time.' Ora added, 'When Aviva came back, I made signs and got ready, but I missed the moment. Today, I’ve been here since 8 a.m.—I won’t miss it this time.' Keith Siegel, 65, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza alongside his wife, Aviva. She was freed in November 2023 after 51 days in captivity. Following her release, Aviva recalled that during their time in captivity, when Hamas filmed them, Keith told her not to cry so their children would see her as strong. However, in April 2024, Hamas released a video showing Siegel alongside fellow hostage Omri Miran, visibly distressed and crying. His daughter Shir explained, 'I felt like this was his way of showing us how much he was struggling and asking us to get him out already.' On Friday, Shir posted an emotional video embracing her mother. 'Dad is on the list—he's coming home!' she exclaimed. Keith Siegel immigrated to Israel from the United States at the age of 21 and worked as an occupational therapist. In December 2024, while he was still held captive in Gaza, his mother passed away. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpkecsuyg	2025-02-01T08:10:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/By2zb3jdyl/By2zb3jdyl_0_0_1426_951_0_small.jpg

The fall of Assad: A predetermined outcome	Syrian rebels toppled Bashar Assad’s regime in just 11 days, seizing Damascus after years of internal dissent; expert Dr. Mordechai Kedar says Assad’s fall was inevitable due to his regime’s lack of legitimacy On November 27, 2024, the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect, and within mere days, the long-awaited rebellion in Syria exploded into action. In just 11 days, Syrian rebels seized the opportunity to overthrow Bashar Assad’s regime. By the time the dust settled, Syria was under the control of a coalition of rebels, Damascus was in their hands, and Assad had fled to Russia. The speed and intensity of the collapse of Syria has shocked the world, but for Lt. Col. (res.) Dr. Mordechai Kedar, a member of the 'Securityists' movement and a prominent expert on the Middle East, it was not unexpected. Dr. Kedar, whose writings on the legitimacy of the Assad regime date back decades, argues that the collapse of Syria was foreseeable. 'Syria is a hollow country,' Kedar states, as 'the people never believed in the regime, and the army was unwilling to die for it.' His 2005 book Asad in Search of Legitimacy chronicles the Baathist regime's fruitless efforts to establish itself as a legitimate governing force in Syria. In his view, the Assad family never earned the legitimacy of their people, ruling instead through force and repression. This lack of legitimacy, Dr. Kedar explains, can be traced back to 1966, when the minority Alawite regime took over Syria. To the Sunni Muslim majority, the Alawites were considered infidels. The Alawite rulers, recognizing the lack of public support for their regime, understood the necessity of establishing an iron-fisted dictatorship instead to secure their grip on power. The suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1980s, including the infamous Hama Massacre in 1982, solidified the Assad family’s reputation for merciless repression. However, Kedar argues that this strategy was always destined to fail. The regime’s foundation was inherently unstable because it never had popular support. The regime’s inevitable collapse of the regime was a consequence of this lack of legitimacy. Still, the speed at which the rebels took control was aided by more than just internal dissent. The timing was also crucial. The weakened state of the Assad regime, following Hezbollah’s war against Israel, had left it vulnerable. The opposition forces, many of whom had been exiled to Idlib for years, were then poised to strike the moment the regime’s attention wavered. Rebel groups, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, linked to Al-Qaeda), then launched a surprise offensive that quickly gained momentum. Their rapid victories in Aleppo, Hama, and Homs were followed by uprisings from Druze and Bedouin populations in the south, culminating in the fall of Damascus. Despite their ideological differences, the rebels managed to unite to overthrow Assad. Yet, not all rebel groups share the same agenda. Some moderate groups even express a willingness to work with Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One rebel leader even declared that the true victory would be when Israeli flags fly over the Iranian embassies in Damascus and Amman. This sentiment reveals an interesting dynamic in the rebellion: the desire to eliminate Iranian and Hezbollah influence in the region. However, while the fall of the Assad regime may seem like a victory for freedom and democracy, the future of Syria is uncertain. Syria remains a deeply divided country, with ethnic, religious, and tribal groups historically at odds. For this reason, if Syria falls into the hands of Islamist groups, it could disintegrate into chaos. However, such a scenario may be preferable to a unified Iran-backed Syria under Assad. Israel is preparing for any outcome following the regime collapse, including the rise of extremist groups. The IDF has concentrated forces in the strategically vital Golan Heights and strengthened its positions on the Syrian border in anticipation of potential fallout. The uncertainty surrounding Syria’s future has already prompted Israel to take preventative measures as Israel would prefer to deal with ISIS-style militias over the strategic threat posed by an Iran-backed regime. Israel cannot afford to be caught unprepared, as it was on October 7, 2023, when a surprise attack from Hezbollah put the country on high alert. While the outcome of the rebellion in Syria is yet to be determined, the fall of the Assad regime was almost inevitable. Syria's lack of national unity, its sectarian divisions, and the regime’s lack of legitimacy created a powder keg that only needed the right spark to ignite. What follows, however, remains unpredictable. Whether Syria will emerge as a modern, liberal state or a failed, fragmented one remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that the collapse of the Assad regime marks a turning point in Middle East security, with significant implications for the broader region. Jennifer Teale is a researcher at the Israel Defense and Security Forum. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkaiu2s001l	2025-02-01T06:23:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/BJky9lGBye/BJky9lGBye_0_55_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Yarden Bibas returns to ‘unbearable reality,’ says family – Insid...	Freed hostage Yarden Bibas arrives at Sheba Medical Center, where he saw his mother for the first time; amid fears for his wife and sons still in captivity, his family urges: 'A quarter of our heart is back—respect his privacy' Yarden Bibas arrived at Sheba Medical Center on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity, where medical staff are preparing for intensive psychological and physical care. Footage from his release highlighted the emotional toll he endured, and medical teams are bracing for the possibility that his psychological recovery will be even more challenging than the physical rehabilitation. His family—parents Pnina and Eli and sister Ofri—have remained by his side, staying in his hospital room and requesting privacy. In their first statement, the Bibas family expressed relief and heartbreak: 'Yarden is home. A quarter of our heart has returned after 15 long months. Words cannot describe the relief of holding him again, hearing his voice. But the home is incomplete. Yarden is a father who left his shelter to protect his family, survived captivity with immense bravery and has now returned to a unbearable reality.' The family urged the public to respect Yarden’s need for privacy. 'Please give him the space he needs for his body and soul to begin healing. Thank you to our incredible people, to our soldiers and to those who sacrificed their lives to make this day possible. We will take time to reunite with Yarden, but our fight continues. Shiri, Ariel and Kfir must come home, along with all the hostages. Please amplify their voices, now more than ever. For Yarden, for all of them—we will not stop until they are home.' Medical staff, initially concerned by his condition upon release, were encouraged to see Yarden smiling after reuniting with his loved ones. Aboard the military helicopter transporting him to Sheba, he posed with his sister and father, holding a board on which he wrote: 'I want to thank the people of Israel for their support. I heard from my family how you fought for me, and I deeply appreciate it. It’s not taken for granted.' He also sent birthday wishes to his grandfather Yechiel, writing, 'Happy 90th, Grandpa!' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Bibas family had prepared for the possibility that Yarden would be released before his wife Shiri and their young sons, Kfir and Ariel. In recent weeks, Israeli officials demanded clear answers from Hamas regarding their fate, as they were supposed to be among the first hostages released under the terms of the deal. So far, no new information has emerged, intensifying fears for their well-being. Speaking to Ynet earlier this week, Ofri Bibas-Levi said the family was bracing for another wave of uncertainty. 'We aren’t making preparations—at most, we are thinking practically about logistics. But there’s no home to return to. One phase ends, another begins, filled with unknowns. That’s terrifying,' she said. 'I know we are heading into another storm. Life will turn upside down again, and I have no way to prepare.' Jimmy Miller, Shiri's cousin, spoke this week in an interview with Ynet, expressing the family’s anguish over the lack of information. 'What will we tell Yarden if he is freed before his wife and children?' Miller asked. 'What will we say to him? We have no words. These are difficult times—our worst nightmare.' On October 7, Hamas terrorists brutally abducted Yarden from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Video footage showed him being beaten and dragged into Gaza, his face covered in blood. A later Hamas propaganda video depicted him speaking about his wife and children, who were kidnapped separately, likely under duress with words dictated by his captors. He turned 35 in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj4bghio1e	2025-02-01T05:48:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/rygiPZ5oOyl/rygiPZ5oOyl_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

In a statement representatives of Egypt, Jordan, Saud Arabia, UAE say the Trump plan would threaten regional stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine prospects for peace Powerful Arab nations on Saturday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League released a joint statement rejecting any plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the West Bank. The statement warned that such plans 'threaten the region’s stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples.' The statement followed a meeting in Cairo of top diplomats from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as Hussein al-Sheikh — a senior Palestinian official who serves as the main liaison with Israel — and Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday rejected the idea that Egypt would facilitate the displacement of Gazans and said Egyptians would take to the streets to express their disapproval. He told a news conference that the transfer of Palestinians 'can’t ever be tolerated or allowed.' 'The solution to this issue is the two-state solution. It is the establishment of a Palestinian state,' he said. 'The solution is not to remove the Palestinian people from their place. No.' However, on Thursday, Trump reiterated the idea, saying: 'We do a lot for them, and they are going to do it,' in apparent reference to abundant U.S. aid, including military assistance, to both Egypt and Jordan. told a news conference that the transfer of Palestinians 'can’t ever be tolerated or allowed.' The representatives who met in Cairo said they discussed the need to maintain the cease-fire in Gaza and the options for the mechanism to enable the Palestinian Authority (PA)to play a role in ruling the Strip.

The statement warned that such plans 'threaten the region's stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjjbj9o00kl	2025-02-01T04:01:50-08:00

Keith Siegal who was released from Hamas captivity on Saturday arrived at the Soratzky Medical Center in Tel Aviv in an IDF chopper.

Rafah crossing, Gaza's gateway to the world opens	50 sick and wounded children, likely from families of senior Hamas members and 61 escorts crossed the Rafah border into Egypt from Gaza under the eye of PA officials as part of the cease-fire deal On Saturday and for the first time since the IDF took control of the Rafah border with Egypt last May, 50 Gazans who were sick or injured, and 61 people who accompanied them, left the Gaza Strip through the border crossing dubbed Gaza's gateway to the world. According to the cease-fire and hostage exchange deal, some 200 people, including 50 in need of medical treatment and three people to accompany each of them, are to leave Gaza for Egypt, daily. Most of those who were taken through the border crossing on Saturday were children although Hamas was to transfer the wounded among its terror force. But the families of members of the terror group were also among the injured. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office (PMO) that Israel had oversight of the crossings and the authority to block any if that were decided. Netanyahu had previously insisted that the border must remain under IDF control to prevent Hamas for rebuilding its military strength. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas had smuggled some of its weaponry through the crossing before the war began after the Oct. 7 massacre and after it started, trucks carrying humanitarian aid came across the border into the Strip. But in the deal, Israel agreed that its troops would not be present at the Rafah border crossing but would maintain a presence on the Philadelphi Corridor. Netanyahu also vowed that there would be no Palestinian Authority involvement there but today, PA officials were on hand to ensure the border's operations. 'The involvement of the Palestinian Authority is limited to stamping passports, in keeping with the existing international order,' officials in his office said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjwvl9i00yx	2025-02-01T03:51:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/ByhBRds00Jg/ByhBRds00Jg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
IDF admits being wrong when announcing Hamas battalion commander ...	Military says relied on erroneouse intelligence last December when it announced the death of the Shati camp commander Hitham Khawajari after a similar revalation last month The IDF said on Saturday that it was wrong to announce the death of a Hamas commander who was seen in the release of Keith Siegal on the shores of Gaza. Hitham Khawajari,who was commander of the Shati refugee camp battalion for Hamas was announced to have been killed last December in an air force strike. 'After the strike it was determined with high probability that he was killed,' the IDF said. Further investigation revealed the intelligence information our assumption was based on in the military intelligence and the Shin Bet was wrong.'

After completion of the release of Israeli Yarden Bibas, Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegal, Israel will free 18 terrorists sentenced to life behind bars and over 100 Gazans detained after the Oct. 7 massacre The Prison Authority on Saturday said that a prisoner who was to be released from Ktziot Prison as part of the release of terrorists in exchange for Israeli hostages, felt unwell and was taken to the prison health clinic. After the release from Hamas captivity of Yarden Bibas, Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegal on Saturday, Israel will begin to release 183 Palestinian prisoners, 143 of which will leave the Ktziot Prison in the South and be transferred by the Red Cross to Gaza. There are 18 men who have been sentenced to life in prison, among those being freed. Hamas said on Friday that 54 prisoners given life sentences and 111 residents of Gaza who were detained by Israeli forces after the October massacre, will be released. According to the cease-fire agreement, 1,000 Gazans in total, all of whom had not participated in the atrocities but were detained after them, will be freed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An official for the prison authorities said preparations for the release of the Palestinian prisoners began overnight. 'They were given medical examinations, were seen by the Red Cross and we are now awaiting the order to release them from jail,' he said. Hamas named among those to be freed, Shadi Amori who was sentenced to 17 years in jail for participating in the acquisition and preparation of a car bomb that exploded in the Megiddo junction, killing 17 people, Ashraf Abu Sror, who was found guilty in the fatal shooting of an IDF soldier near Bethlehem in 2000 and Ahmed Salim, from the Fatah movement who was involved in the murder of Avi and Avital Walensky in a West Bank terror attack in 2002. After completion of the release on Saturday, Israel would have freed 583 Palestinians from its jails. At the end of the first phase of the deal, Israel will have freed 290 prisoners sentenced to life out of a total of 2,000. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj6p0vodyx	2025-02-01T02:26:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/ryrdOGMdJe/ryrdOGMdJe_0_96_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Tears of joy: Ofer sees his kids, Yarden hugs his father and Keit...	Ofer Calderon lands at Sheba Medical Center, greeted by cheering friends and family; Yarden Bibas reunites with his father and sister in emotional embrace; Keith Siegel returns to Israel as his wife watches his release: 'He looks good!' Israeli hostages Ofer Calderon, Yarden Bibas and Keith Siegel returned to Israel on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity. Calderon arrived by military helicopter at Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer, where friends greeted him with cheers and sang, 'How good it is that you came home.' Bibas, whose wife Shiri and two young sons remain in captivity, reunited with his father and sister at the Re’im reception center near the Gaza border. Siegel, released separately from Gaza’s port area, was transferred to Israeli forces before crossing into Israel. His daughter, Shira, shared her joy on social media, writing: 'Our dad is home!' Aviva Siegel, Keith’s wife, who was freed in a previous hostage deal, tearfully watched his release, exclaiming, 'There he is! He looks good!' Bibas also arrived by helicopter at Sheba Medical Center, where medical teams were prepared to provide physical and psychological care. 'These are incredibly sensitive moments for the returning hostages and their families,' the Health Ministry said, urging privacy. President Isaac Herzog described Bibas’s reunion with his family as 'heartbreaking' and reiterated the nation’s deep concern for the fate of Shiri and the children, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who remain in Hamas captivity. 'All of Israel stands with Yarden and his family in worry and prayer,' Herzog said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Unlike previous releases, where chaos erupted as hostages were handed over, Saturday’s transfer of Calderon and Bibas from Hamas to the Red Cross in Khan Younis was relatively smooth. Siegel, released about two hours later from Gaza’s port area, was briefly paraded before Hamas gunmen before being handed over. According to reports from Gaza, Hamas also gave him two bags—one reportedly intended for his wife, Aviva Siegel. Following the traumatic scenes during Thursday’s hostage release in Khan Younis, Israeli officials had expressed deep concerns over the security of the hostages and protested to mediators. Hamas appeared to heed the message, avoiding large crowds at Saturday’s handover. As part of the ongoing hostage deal, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners, including 18 serving life sentences. Most—143 prisoners—will be transferred to Gaza. The Israel Prison Service (IPS) reported an unusual incident during the prisoner selection process at Ketziot Prison, reporting that 'one prisoner felt unwell and was treated by an IPS doctor at a designated medical facility.' The Hamas-run Ministry for Prisoners' Affairs in Gaza published a list of those expected to be released, which includes 54 convicted of serious offenses and 111 detainees arrested after October 7. According to the terms of the deal, Israel has agreed to release approximately 1,000 Palestinian detainees from Gaza who were arrested after the October 7 massacre but were not directly involved in the attack. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj9glujoje	2025-02-01T01:33:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/B1uwYwjOJl/B1uwYwjOJl_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

Family vows to keep fighting for Shiri Bibas and her two sons amid growing fears for their fate, while pledging full support for Yarden’s long road to recovery After 484 days in Hamas captivity, Yarden Bibas returned to Israel on Saturday, but his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons remain unaccounted for. Their fate remains unknown, deepening the anguish surrounding his homecoming. 'We have mixed emotions that are difficult to put into words,' said his cousin, Oria Bibas. 'There’s immense relief, but the struggle is far from over. We are grateful to see Yarden standing on his own two feet and will do everything to support and help him heal.' She added that the family was also grappling with the difficult answers they would eventually have to provide him about his wife and children. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I hope we’ll soon be able to have a barbecue with the kind of good meat Yarden loves, when he’s ready, and maybe catch a rock concert—some music for the soul,' she said. 'But the fight isn’t over. We must hold on to hope and faith for Shiri and the boys.' Friends of Bibas gathered outside the Re’im military base, where he arrived after his release, holding signs and flags. 'It’s a moment of relief, but clearly, the road to recovery is long,' said Inbal Luzon. 'We will continue the fight for Shiri, the boys, and all the hostages still held in Gaza.' Danielle Aloni, who was held captive with Bibas before her release in the 2023 hostage deal, described him as strong, noble and a devoted father. She noted that both Bibas and fellow hostage Ofer Calderon, also freed on Saturday, were subjected to harsh treatment by Hamas, as their captors suspected them of having military ties—though she declined to provide further details. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b15p0uidye	2025-02-01T00:31:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/SkxRsNIj00yl/SkxRsNIj00yl_0_98_1140_642_0_small.jpg
Under pressure: Hamas avoids chaos in latest hostage releases aft...	After Israeli outrage, Saturday hostage releases proceed smoothly with Gaza crowds kept at bay; Yarden Bibas, Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegel are back in Israel After Israel expressed outrage over chaotic hostage releases earlier in the week, Hamas conducted a more orderly transfer of Israeli hostages Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon on Saturday. Unlike previous releases, there were fewer armed Hamas operatives on stage, and the ceremony was brief. Both hostages were made to wave at the cameras, but within minutes, the transfer to the Red Cross was complete. Israeli officials said they were satisfied with the smoother process, noting that it adhered to the agreed-upon plan. Hamas-affiliated media reported that the terror group had reduced the number of civilians allowed to attend the event at the request of cease-fire mediators. Reports also indicated that Hamas timed the release earlier in the day to prevent large crowds from gathering and to facilitate the opening of the Rafah border crossing, allowing wounded Palestinians to receive medical treatment in Egypt. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As part of the negotiated deal, 50 wounded Palestinians are to be transferred out of Gaza daily, each accompanied by three escorts, with a total of 200 people crossing into Egypt per day, pending Israeli and Egyptian security vetting. The agreement also allows for the transfer of additional children, subject to Israeli approval. Bibas and Calderon entered Israel quickly following 484 days in captivity. Israeli officials credited diplomatic pressure for the improved conditions of the transfer. 'Israeli pressure worked,' one official said. 'Communication with the mediators is crucial, and it is proving effective.' According to Israeli estimates, 79 hostages remain in Gaza. Under the current agreement, 20 are set to be released in the first phase, with 12 believed to be alive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkqrsus00je	2025-01-31T23:49:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/Hkmc2Lju1l/Hkmc2Lju1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The returning hostages: Yarden alone, Ofer’s fight for his life a...	Yarden returns without his family, Ofer asked his daughter to fight for him, Keith will finally be united with his wife Aviva; these are their stories Yarden Bibas is returning home on Saturday without his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, who remain captive in Gaza. On Thursday, Israel demanded that Hamas disclose their fate after the terror group claimed early in the war that they had been killed, though it provided no proof. They were supposed to be released in the earlier hostage exchanges, before the IDF lookouts, but when that did not happen, concerns for their fate grew. 'Our Yarden is supposed to return tomorrow, and we are all so excited,' his family said in a statement on Friday. 'But Shiri and the kids have not come back. Our feelings are mixed, and we have complex days ahead of us,' they added, calling on the public to 'please respect Yarden's privacy and that of the family' in the coming days. Last Saturday, the IDF said that there was grave concern for the lives of Shiri and the two boys, who became symbols of Hamas atrocities when their abduction was filmed and spread worldwide by the terrorists in social media posts. Yarden’s abduction was also filmed, showing him being brutally beaten, blood streaming from head wounds as he was dragged into Gaza. In a video later released by Hamas as part of its psychological terror campaign, he spoke about his wife and children, who had been abducted separately. He was clearly reading from a dictated script. He turned 35 while in captivity. His sister, Ofri Bibas-Levi, said at the time that she did not know if Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were alive or where they were being held. 'Dodjy,' she said, using her affectionate nickname for her brother, 'we all love you very much. We miss you and can only hope that you are freed and returned to us.' She expressed hope that he would one day reunite with his wife and children to celebrate his next birthday, 'and before that, be here with us, have air to breathe, freedom, daylight – all those basic things that should be so obvious. If only he could have that,' she said. 'Thank God, what a perfect morning,' Ofer Calderon's daughter, Sahar, posted upon learning that her father would be returning home on Saturday. She and her brother, Erez, were also taken hostage and released after 52 days in captivity. Now, 432 days later, she and her father will finally reunite. 'The last words Ofer said to his children were for them to fight for his release,' his cousin Eyal told Ynet. 'He said he did not want to die in the tunnels.' Eyal said the family learned from freed hostages that Ofer had helped others stay hopeful. 'Just days after Sahar and Erez were released, Shani Goren was brought to the tunnels where Ofer was being held. He seemed optimistic and told her he would prepare food for her with whatever ingredients were available. He was sure he would be out within days.' Ofer and his two children were abducted from their home during the Hamas massacre. 'We thank President Trump for ensuring the deal and call on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli delegation not to delay the next phase of the agreement for even a minute and to ensure all the hostages—both the living and the dead—are returned,' Ofer's family said. Keith Siegel was abducted from his home with his wife, Aviva, during the massacre. Before she was released in 2023, Hamas filmed the couple. Aviva said Keith told her not to cry so that the children would see how strong they both were. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, in a later Hamas propaganda video, Keith appeared alongside fellow hostage Omri Miran, visibly crying. His daughter, Shira, said that was his way of signaling to the family that he was struggling and needed them to get him out. Shira posted a video of herself hugging her mother when she learned of his release. 'Daddy is on the list. He is coming,' she said. Keith immigrated to Israel from the United States at 21 and worked as an occupational therapist. His six-year-old grandson sent him a message: 'I love you and am waiting for you to come back.' Keith’s mother passed away last December while he was still in captivity. 'When I landed at the hospital and met our sweet children, I could not believe I was there without you,' Aviva wrote in a message to her husband. 'I was in shock for weeks before I could even understand that we had been torn apart and I was here without you.' Aviva recalled the small room in Gaza where she was told she had to leave him behind. 'I looked at you and saw the fear in your eyes, and you couldn’t say a word. I looked at you and said I would be strong for you, and I asked you to be strong for me. I swore to you, Keith, that this is all I think about every day and every night.' 'I stay strong for you so that you can survive and stay strong for me, for the kids, and for the grandkids. I hope you can survive there. I remember the tunnel we were taken into and left alone. Do you remember how hard it was to breathe? I remember looking at you, barely able to speak, and you said you couldn’t breathe,' she wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byp1g8ioyl	2025-01-31T22:52:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/Bk979M9d1l/Bk979M9d1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Calderon and Bibas released after 484 days in Gaza captivity; Keith Siegel to be freed in separate event Hamas once again set up a staged platform, as seen in previous releases Israeli hostages Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon were transferred by Hamas to Red Cross teams in Khan Younis on Saturday morning after 484 days in captivity. They are expected to join IDF forces in Gaza before heading back to Israeli territory. A third hostage, Keith Siegel, is expected to be released later in the day from the Gaza port area, according to reports. A security official said that the IDF is preparing for the transfer and safe return of the three hostages, but cautioned that the timeline remains subject to change. Following the chaotic and distressing images from the last hostage release in Khan Younis—when freed hostages Arbel Yehoud, Gadi Mozes and five Thai nationals were swarmed by crowds—Israel conveyed strong concerns to mediators, demanding better security measures. Similar incidents occurred in the first exchange, when released hostages Doron Steinbrecher, Emily Damari and Romi Gonen were surrounded by mobs in Gaza City. However, Israeli officials believe Hamas has adjusted its procedures after facing international backlash and does not plan a repeat of these scenes on Saturday. White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt reaffirmed U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to securing the release of all remaining hostages, saying, 'The president remains steadfast in his efforts to bring home every hostage who should never have been taken by the brutal terrorist organization Hamas. The White House welcomes the release of the eight additional hostages yesterday, thanks to a deal brokered by President Trump. They are finally reuniting with their families after enduring more than 15 months of inhumane captivity.'

Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon, and Yarden Bibas will likely be released from Gaza City and Khan Younis early in the morning after 484 days in captivity; The Rafah crossing is expected to open to allow the evacuation of wounded Palestinians The fourth phase of the hostage release deal is expected to take place early Saturday morning, with Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon, and Yarden Bibas set to be freed after 484 days in captivity. The three, abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza and Kibbutz Nir Oz, will likely be released from two different locations in Gaza—one from Gaza City and the other from Khan Younis. Bibas' wife, Shiri, and their two children, Kfir and Ariel, remain in captivity. Israeli officials have demanded a clear answer from Hamas regarding their status after they were not released in the initial phases of the deal, which prioritized women and children. Their absence has intensified fears about their condition, but no new information has been provided. After an initial medical assessment, the released hostages will be transported to Sourasky Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center. Barzilai Medical Center and Soroka Medical Center are on standby for emergency care if needed. As in previous releases, IDF forces will escort the hostages out of Gaza, bringing them to the reception center in Re’im, where they will receive preliminary treatment and reunite with their families before being transferred to hospitals for further evaluation. As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel will release 90 Palestinian prisoners—nine serving life sentences and 81 others with long-term sentences. However, Hamas’ Prisoners Affairs Office in Gaza has published a list of 183 names, including 18 life-sentence prisoners, 54 inmates serving lengthy terms, and 111 Gazan detainees arrested after October 7. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Among the notable names are Shadi Amouri, serving 17 life sentences for orchestrating the 2002 Megiddo Junction car bombing that killed 17 people; Ashraf Abu Srour, convicted of fatally shooting Israeli soldier Shahar Vekret near Rachel’s Tomb in 2000; and Ahmed Salim, a Fatah militant involved in the 2002 murder of Israeli couple Avi and Avital Wolanski in the West Bank. According to the list, 150 prisoners will be sent to Gaza, including seven lifers to be deported there, while 32 will be released to the West Bank. One prisoner, an Egyptian national, will be repatriated to Egypt. Israeli security forces are preparing for the release, aiming to prevent celebratory gatherings in the West Bank. For example, Border Police forces intervened in Abu Dis on Friday night after reports of planned festivities for a life-sentenced prisoner’s release. Meanwhile, the Rafah border crossing is expected to open on Saturday to allow the evacuation of wounded Palestinians—mostly Hamas operatives—to Egypt. Reports suggest up to 50 wounded individuals will be transferred daily, each accompanied by three escorts, totaling 200 people per day. Transfers will require approval from Israeli security agencies and Egyptian authorities. The deal also allows for additional Palestinian children to be evacuated if approved by Israel, which is unlikely to oppose such requests. As of now, 82 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, 23 of whom are expected to be freed in upcoming exchanges under the first phase of the agreement. Of those, 15 are alive, while eight are deceased. The remains of the fallen hostages are scheduled to be returned in the final two stages of the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bypu63cokx	2025-01-31T12:59:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/Bk979M9d1l/Bk979M9d1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Some testimonies we collect come with a trigger warning'	Award-winning director Talya Tibbon discusses her unique methodology recording October 7 testimonies, the harrowing accounts collected and the contrast between the comfortable life abroad and the horrors she documents What is a historical narrative? Who gets to shape it and who decides how we remember a particular event, especially when it comes to a pivotal moment like October 7? Talya Tibbon is an award-winning documentary filmmaker who divides her time between London and New York. Her films have been featured on Netflix, Amazon, National Geographic and other major platforms. She transitioned to documentary filmmaking after a decade of working at CNN. Not an interviewer, but a listener Throughout her career, she has filmed on four continents—from the halls of the White House and the Pentagon to brothels in Mexico and remote villages in Laos, Nigeria, and Lapland. She has had the opportunity to meet and interview war refugees, drug dealers, trafficked women, senior CIA officials, and Native American tribal elders. All of this likely prepared her for what she has been doing for the past year as a volunteer with the Edut (Hebrew for testimony) 710 project, where she is part of the organization’s leadership and coordinates the research and English translation teams. 'I'm also learning new things because this is a different form of documentation than what I'm familiar with,' she says. 'The philosophy of Edut 710 essentially states that all the power lies with the witness, the interviewee. The interviewer is there as a Listener. The witness chooses what to focus on, what to talk about, and what not to talk about. We never push for more, never ask for additional information, and never direct the conversation. We are there only to listen.' 'There are three or four initial questions to start the conversation, and from there, all the power lies with the witness, including the decision whether to publish their testimony, given the highly sensitive nature of the situation.' The approach is based on the work of Professor Dori Laub, a psychiatrist who was the first to document on camera the testimonies of Holocaust survivors. Laub's therapeutic approach empowers the witness, allowing them to reclaim the narrative. 'Imagine a state of helplessness when uncontrollable things are happening around you,' Tibbon explains. 'You’re hiding behind a bush in the Nova festival or locked up in a safe room. When you talk about the experience, you’re reclaiming the story. You are no longer helpless; you’re building your narrative and your resilience.' What does it do to you as a listener? 'I find this fascinating. When people are allowed to lead the story, their thoughts surface, their emotions surface, and as a listener you receive a deeply personal account of the event: what the person felt, what they were afraid of, what the fear aroused in them. 'This openness, during which I just listen, brings about the realization that we are touching on places that are almost sacred. It’s a privilege to be there and to listen to these stories.' 'This testimony broke me' In the interview with Tibbon, she recounts filming the testimony of an American pathologist who volunteered to come to Israel and assist in identifying bodies. As someone who worked at some of the most severe murder scenes in Philadelphia and had identified 9/11 victims, she thought she had seen it all. But the extreme sights (of October 7 attack victims) she was exposed to at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, led her to call the institute’s director and make it clear that these were unequivocally war crimes. 'They brought her a lump of coal and she had to figure out what it was, and then she realized it was an adult and a child together. It was very important for her to give her testimony, and it wasn't easy, nor was it easy for me as a listener. These are things that are incredibly difficult to hear' 'She identified a case of someone who had been tied up with their hands behind their back and shot in the back of the head at close range. That's a war crime. That's an execution. She was the first to identify it, and being able to think in such a way in that situation is incredible.' 'They brought her a lump of coal and she had to figure out what it was, and then she realized it was an adult and a child together,' she adds. 'It was very important for her to give her testimony, and it wasn't easy, nor was it easy for me as a listener. These are things that are incredibly difficult to hear, which is why our testimonies come with a trigger warning.' Was there a testimony that particularly moved you? There are many. I choose to share the testimony of Amos Epstein from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, who lost his wife, his son-in-law and two grandchildren on October 7. He’s well into his 80s, one of the founders of the Western Negev communities. He gave his testimony with a choked voice in the face of the general and personal devastation, and while speaking, he relived the murder of his wife and family. That testimony broke me.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: I can hear that it's still difficult for you. I'm in a profession where I’ve learned to both feel and protect myself emotionally, but confronting the stories of October 7 was difficult, because even though I haven’t lived in Israel for many years, I am Israeli, and anyone who was hurt could have been my friend or a member of my family. 'Day-to-day it's strange for me to be abroad. Now, for instance ( we’re speaking in December) when everyone on the street is busy with Christmas, and I'm collecting testimonies. We're making an effort to reach as many witnesses as possible, and to build a digital archive that will document the event from every possible angle. For example, we're currently documenting, in the context of October 7, the medical staff at Soroka Medical Center, the Bedouin community, new immigrants, and Holocaust survivors who experienced the attacks.' Why is it important to divide testimonies into sub-groups? 'To hear perspectives from a wide variety of angles, including those that haven’t yet been part of the narrative. For example, we documented a group of medics, who shared experiences we hadn’t heard before, as well as joint testimonies from members of the local civilian emergency response teams. While many of those we’ve been collecting testimony from recount what they experienced inside their homes, their safe rooms, these are two groups that operated outside, in the line of fire, and the idea is to hear all the different narratives without judgment or a hierarchy of testimonies.' What is the difference between a testimony of a native-born Israeli and that of an immigrant? In the testimony of someone who grew up in the Western Negev, there’s an inherent understanding that they live in an amazing place, and that there is this terrible threat in the background. On the other hand, in the testimony of a new immigrant couple who fell in love with the Negev and brought their children there, we heard how living under these conditions and developing trauma is not a decision they take for granted at all. They are grappling with the question of how to build a future for their children within this reality, that they may feel deeply connected to, but for them, moving their family to this area wasn’t an obvious decision. 'The testimonies of Holocaust survivors are also fascinating because for those who survived the atrocities of World War II at the age of six or seven, and then experienced October 7, we can only guess what it had evoked in them. So the idea is to get as many perspectives as possible to preserve a memory that is as broad and inclusive as possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bjzy029001x	2025-01-31T12:36:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/SJ6mXMRU1x/SJ6mXMRU1x_0_259_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Freed Thai hostages talk about Hamas captivity: 'Struggled to bre...	A day after arriving in Israel following more than 15 months in Hamas captivity, five Thai nationals freed from Gaza described enduring relentless bombings and frequent hunger; 'Sometimes there was food, sometimes there wasn’t' one of them says A day after arriving in Israel following more than 15 months in Hamas captivity, five Thai nationals freed from Gaza are sharing new details about their time in captivity. In a meeting Friday with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, the former hostages described enduring relentless bombings and frequent hunger. 'Sometimes there was food, sometimes there wasn’t,' one of them said. The men—Sathian Suwannakham, 34; Pongsak Thenna, 35; Bannawat Seathao, 27; Watchara Sriaoun, 32; and Surasak Lamnau, 30—confirmed they were held underground in tunnels for the entire 482 days of their captivity. They struggled to breathe in the cramped conditions and were separated into two groups—two held together and the other three elsewhere. They said they communicated with their captors mainly in English but also learned some Arabic during their imprisonment. Since their release, they have spent hours on the phone reconnecting with their families in Thailand, who are expected to arrive in Israel soon at the government’s expense. Sa’ar praised their resilience, telling them, 'You are strong. I wish you and your families good health, freedom, and a good life.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Thailand’s ambassador to Israel, Pannabha Chandraramya, who accompanied Sa’ar on the visit, called their release 'the happiest day of my life,' adding, 'This is a day of good news for me, my country, and the world.' Dr. Osnat Levtzion-Korach, director of the hospital where the men are receiving care, said their condition is stable despite the severe hardships they endured. 'They suffered from extreme hunger, spending long periods with little to no food. Some were held in tunnels, while others were kept in dark rooms above ground,' she said. 'Our main goal now is to help them regain control over their lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1zjws9o1x	2025-01-31T11:55:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/H1kl7zYO1l/H1kl7zYO1l_1_81_800_451_0_small.jpg

Mishel Gerzig on balancing work, family while advocating for Isra...	The Israeli model made a brief visit to Israel and shared her advocacy efforts abroad for the country, the significance of wearing the yellow pin at international events, and also revealed what language she and her husband, Belgian Real Madrid star Thibaut Courtois, speak to their infant daughter Since model Mishel Gerzig and her husband, Belgian footballer Thibaut Courtois, welcomed their first daughter, Eli, Gerzig has rarely visited Israel. Despite missing it, traveling with a 10-month-old baby or leaving her at home in Madrid has been a challenge for the Israeli model. This week, however, she visited Israel alone for a short but busy two-day work trip. Gerzig stars in a new fashion shoot for Michael Kors at Factory 54, photographed in a luxurious location in Jaffa. She also spoke about her continued advocacy for Israel globally, even as hostages return home, the significance of wearing a yellow pin at events abroad, and her thoughts on Gal Gadot’s handling of the issue. How is it to come to Israel during this time? 'First of all, coming home is a dream. I haven’t been able to visit much since I had Ellie, and now it’s a whirlwind of emotions—excitement, worry, anticipation. The hostages are coming home, and seeing the videos of their reunions with their families is incredibly emotional.' How is it to experience this from afar? 'A lot of people we know are asking about it and showing interest, which is great. I think it might make people reconsider their views. I hope, and I want to believe it’s having an impact. From what we’re seeing, it seems to be making a difference. Anyone who isn’t affected by it is likely inhuman, because it’s impossible not to be moved by all the videos we’re seeing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When you attend events abroad, is wearing the yellow pin important to you? 'I’ve worn it at every event over the past year. Together with jewelry designers, we made a large ring with the symbol for one event, and a gold necklace with the symbol for another. But I think the most important thing is explaining with words and sharing. Unfortunately, not many people understand the symbol, and worldwide, it’s not always connected to the hostages. Ultimately, what matters is showing up, explaining, and speaking out.' Gal Gadot received criticism for not wearing the pin at the Golden Globes. 'I think Gal is doing amazing things, and what she shares on Instagram, as well as her involvement in events, is very important. In my view, it’s even more important than wearing the pin. It creates more of an impact, and people understand it better in the end.' Is it harder to come to Israel for work now that you’re a mom? 'It’s the hardest thing in the world. There are no words. That’s why I came for a short visit, because Ellie isn’t here with me, and I want to get back to her as soon as possible. It’s tough to say goodbye like this, but it’s also really important to balance my work. That’s why I travel.' She’s 10 months old now. What is she up to at this stage? 'She’s started standing, crawling, and babbling—it’s fun, it’s like she’s going crazy in a cute way, it’s awesome.' What languages will she speak? 'I have no idea what she’ll pick up, but for now, we speak to her in Hebrew, English, Spanish, Flemish, and French. It may be a lot, but that’s just how it is, the house is full of languages. I’m really curious to hear her first sentence, which will probably mix all those languages.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rk37yoc001e	2025-01-31T10:24:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/rkbczTOUO1x/rkbczTOUO1x_0_122_720_405_0_small.jpg

Abbas Araqchi warns that a military strike by Israel and the US on Iranian nuclear facilities would be 'one of the biggest historical mistakes the US could make' Iran will respond immediately and decisively if its nuclear sites are attacked which would lead to an 'all-out war in the region,' Tehran's foreign minister told Al Jazeera TV in an interview aired on Friday. Israel and the U.S. launching a military attack on Iranian nuclear facilities would be 'one of the biggest historical mistakes the U.S. could make,' Abbas Araqchi said through a translator. Concerns have grown among Iran's top decision-makers that U.S. President Donald Trump might in his second term empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its oil industry. Those concerns, coupled with mounting anger within Iran over economic conditions, could drive Tehran toward engaging in negotiations with the Trump administration over the fate of its fast-advancing nuclear program. Araqchi suggested that the United States could free blocked Iranian funds as a first confidence-building step between the two hostile countries.

In 2018, then-President Trump reneged on the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and a group of world powers and re-imposed harsh U.S. sanctions as part of his 'maximum pressure' policy against the country. In response, Tehran breached the deal in several ways including by accelerating its uranium enrichment. Trump has vowed to return to the policy he pursued in his previous term that sought to use economic pressure to force the country to negotiate a deal on its nuclear program, ballistic missile program and regional activities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byn1jqqu1x	2025-01-31T09:56:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/SyZncxZhlyl/SyZncxZhlyl_0_75_720_405_0_small.jpg

This is the true victory needed for the country's revival and its citizens.' He also expressed gratitude to the German government, Chancellor, and ambassadors for their support.

She told him that she was held in some United Nations facilities belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) but was denied access to medical care even though she was shot twice on October 7. During the call with her mother, Mandy, Emily told Starmer she had been held for some time in the UNRWA facilities but was denied any medical treatment despite losing two fingers on her left hand and suffering an unhealed leg wound, adding that the only medical aid she received was an expired bottle of medication. Emily and her mother urged Starmer to apply maximum pressure on Hamas and UNRWA to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to the 82 hostages still held in Gaza. After the phone call, her mother Mandy Damari wrote on X: 'Hamas held Emily in UNRWA facilities and denied her access to medical treatment after shooting her twice. It's a miracle that she survived, and we need to get aid to remaining hostages now.' Emily Damari was released from Hamas captivity in Gaza last Sunday, as part of the first wave of hostage releases under the current deal. She was freed alongside Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbacher.

The family also urged the public to respect their privacy during this challenging time. 'Please, take care of Yarden’s heart and honor his and our privacy in the coming days,' they said. Israel has demanded clear answers from Hamas regarding Shiri and the children, who were supposed to be among the first hostages released under the deal prioritizing women and children.

Terror group seeks Hezbollah prisoner swap for Elizabeth Tsurkov,...	Iraqi and Lebanese sources say Kata’ib Hezbollah offers Israel to release terror group operatives and ship captain for Israeli researcher's return two years after her abduction Iraqi and Lebanese sources told UK-based outlet Amwaj Media on Friday that a proposal has been issued for Israel to release Hezbollah terrorists and a Lebanese ship captain — described by the IDF as a senior Hezbollah operative — in exchange for Elizabeth Tsurkov, a 36-year-old Israeli-Russian academic kidnapped in Baghdad in March 2023. Pro-Iranian militia Kata’ib Hezbollah, which holds Tsurkov, has reportedly expressed willingness to proceed, but Israel has not yet greenlit the deal, per sources close to the Shia militia. Under the terms, Israel would release seven Hezbollah members captured between September 27 and November 27, along with naval captain Imad Amhaz, seized during a rare IDF commando raid in Batroun, northern Lebanon—100 miles (160 km) from the border. The IDF previously called Amhaz a 'senior Hezbollah operative with maritime expertise.' Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed outlet reported the 4-minute raid involved 20 troops. 'Efforts to secure Tsurkov’s release are ongoing through various channels,' an Israeli official said following the report. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Tsurkov, a Princeton doctoral student residing in the U.S., was abducted in Baghdad on March 26, 2023. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein confirmed she was alive last week, adding that Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani is working to free her. This followed a senior Israeli official telling The Washington Post that Israel recently intensified efforts with allies to secure her release.

We’re drawing strength from our incredible dad': Gadi Mozes' fam...	After being released from Hamas captivity, former hostage's family says they couldn't process the elation of his return and reunion with children and grandchildren Gadi Mozes returned to Israel after nearly 16 months in Hamas captivity on Thursday. 'There's no one happier than us,' His family said. 'Light has returned to our lives thanks to a life-saving hostage deal.' In a video posted online, his son, Yair Mozes, was seen shaving the beard he grew throughout his father’s captivity — as he had promised to do upon his return. Mozes, who will soon turn 81, said, ' I will do everything in my power to restore Nir Oz,' the kibbutz from which he was abducted. 'We were granted a miracle and got our father and grandfather, Gadi, back safe and sound after a year and four months of an uncompromising struggle filled with fear, terror, despair, worry and breathlessness,' his family said. 'Everything is filled with life again and we’re drawing strength from our incredible and extraordinary Gadi,' they added. 'We’re continuing this long and important struggle because every hostage family and all of Israel deserve to reach this moment.' Shai, Gadi’s nephew, added, 'We still don't know how aware he was of the scale of the disaster in Nir Oz. There were things he was exposed to before he was abducted. He knew about Efrat (his murdered partner), but I’m not sure he knew about the other kidnappings. He says he was alone the entire time — Arbel Yehud was the first hostage he met.' 'He made sure to take walks in the mornings, counting tiles to measure his distance,' his nephew said. 'He did various math exercises to keep his mind sharp, calculating how much he was walking. He managed to get a few books from his captors and read a little in English. He already knew Arabic, so he spoke with them in Arabic which helped him. Gadi is a people person — he knows how to communicate well.' 'They let him write, he kept a journal and counted the days — just a few lines each day — but they took it away before his release. Gadi is on his feet, lost some weight but he’s still the Gadi we know. He told us that he saw me on TV. He saw other family members too, so he was exposed to the outside but in a very limited way. That’s how he knew that we weren’t stopping the fight for him.' 'We're waiting for all restrictions to be lifted so we can really raise a glass with him,' Shai said. 'He hasn't had a chance to speak with the people from Nir Oz yet and we haven’t talked to him about the horrific moments during the release. 'I can only imagine how terrifying it was — those were 90 dreadful minutes. His son Yair explained that he had vowed not to shave and Gadi was happy to see his son had fought for him.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His daughter-in-law, Einav, posted a photo of Mozes with his family, all raising a glass in celebration. 'Over the past year, I told myself that if Gadi returns and immediately asks for a drink, I’ll be at peace because I’ll know our Gadi is back. And it happened just so. We were fortunate and we’ll keep fighting so that everyone gets to experience this moment.' In a conversation with Ynet, Einav said, 'It's hard to process everything that happened, it’s not easy to switch your mindset in an instant. This is a harsh reality. Understanding that he’s here with us, alive and on his feet — it just doesn’t register. 'We sat around him and he was talking and telling stories — and I couldn’t process it. But at the same time, it feels like he left yesterday and came back today because it’s so natural for him to be with us.' 'He came back as the Gadi we know. We were afraid of how we would receive him, how he would return mentally and physically. Of course, there are effects, and it’s too early to know their full extent, but he seems to have held on to who he is. The kids got their grandpa back just as they knew him.' 'We asked him, 'What kept you going in there?' and he answered, 'I thought about you. The desire to be with you again, to reunite and be together — that’s what kept me going,' she added. 'He said he kept repeating to himself, 'You have to hold on for the kids.' One of the things that really broke his spirit was the feeling of betrayal by the state. He said he kept asking himself, 'How is it possible that we’re still here?' And yet, he still believes in the country and told himself, ‘I'm sure they'll do everything to bring me back.’' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj4z11s5ukg	2025-01-31T04:05:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/rJ92hgq001e/rJ92hgq001e_0_177_675_380_0_small.jpg
Meet the oldest hostage in Gaza: Shlomo Masour	Woman pays tribute to her grandfather, who is being held in captivity in Gaza If words could capture the last 15 months for Noam Safir, they are the ones you hear: the pain, the confusion, the memories—each brought to life with every stroke of the piano keys. 'My grandfather, Shlomo Mansour, is the oldest hostage in captivity, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor,' Safir told ILTV, as she played a song she wrote in his honor. Her grandfather survived a violent pogrom in Iraq as a little boy. Now, decades later, he is trapped in captivity by Hamas. On October 7, more than a handful of terrorists broke into his house. Safir’s grandmother ran into the bathroom. The terrorists took Mansour out, slapped his face, and beat him. Then they handcuffed him and took him away. Eventually, they took his wife, Mazal, too. The couple had been married for 60 years. Hamas terrorists led Shlomo and Mazal out of their home, but Mazal managed to break away. Shlomo, weighing only 57 kilograms and without his hearing aids, was then kidnapped into Gaza in his own car. But the psychological torture for the family had only just begun. 'They didn’t leave my grandmother alone. They tried calling her, pretending to be Shlomo. They tried setting the house on fire,' Safir recalled. Just one kilometer from the border, Kissufim had once been a safe haven for Safir—a place filled with childhood memories of her grandfather. But the home she knew was now destroyed, and since that day, there has been no sign of life from Mansour. 'I decided that my mission is to be his voice, as long as he can't speak for himself,' Safir said. 'He was always wearing a smile on his face. He always welcomed us with the widest smile and the biggest hug, just waiting to spend time with us.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rynethcdyx	2025-01-31T04:01:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/S14strqu1g/S14strqu1g_0_0_519_294_0_small.jpg
Who are the 110 prisoners released from Israeli jails on Thursday...	Thirty-three of the prisoners were serving life sentences, many for the murder of Israelis At the same time that Israel celebrates the return of Israeli hostages, the nation is also aware that their freedom means the release of convicted Palestinian security prisoners. Following the release of the three Israeli hostages on Thursday, 110 terrorists were set free from Israeli prisons. Thirty-three of the prisoners were serving life sentences, many for the murder of Israelis. The terrorists were released from Ofer and Ketziot prisons and were received by thousands of rejoicing Hamas supporters in their hometowns in Judea and Samaria. Through the first phase, Israel is committed to releasing 1,904 prisoners in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages, eight of whom are dead. Before Thursday, 290 Palestinian prisoners were released, including 121 serving life sentences. Israel is not freeing prisoners for the five Thai hostages that were released because the deal was arranged directly with the Thai government. Talks are due to begin on the second stage of the deal with Hamas. In that phase, Hamas would release male hostages, including soldiers, and demands for the release of the most prominent and dangerous terrorists are certain. Three notorious prisoners were released on Thursday. They include Zakaria Zubeidi, Mahmoud Atallah, and Ahmed Barghouti. Zubeidi, who returned to Samaria, organized dozens of attacks during the Second Intifada while heading the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Jenin. He was one of six prisoners who briefly escaped from Gilboa Prison in 2021 before being recaptured. Atallah was released to Nablus. He was indicted in September for repeatedly sexually assaulting female guards at Gilboa Prison. Barghouti, a senior military official in Fatah, received 13 life sentences for carrying out a series of terror attacks during the Second Intifada that killed 12 Israelis. He was deported abroad. All prisoners that are released are transported to two main reception points, Ofer and Ketziot prisons, before being released home or deported.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkgxqb9dyg	2025-01-31T03:39:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/yk14243535/yk14243535_0_76_490_276_0_small.jpg
Who is released hostage Gadi Moses?	Gadi Moses was released from captivity on Thursday. He was the oldest hostage and the first man to be released as part of this ceasefire hostage deal More than 480 days after he was kidnapped outside his home on Kibbutz Nir Oz, hostage Gadi Moses was released from captivity on Thursday. He was the oldest hostage and the first man to be released as part of this ceasefire hostage deal. A day from hell on October 7 for his family—upon release, Moses learned the fate of his partner, Efrat Katz, who was murdered on that day. Katz’s daughter and her two grandchildren were kidnapped with Moses’s ex-wife, Margalit, and all three were released in the hostage deal in November 2023. Moses is known for working as a peace activist who advocated for Palestinian rights and peace. On October 7, Moses even tried to bargain with terrorists as they demanded money from him and the keys to his car before they abducted him. Moses is a potato expert and renowned agronomist who frequently lectured on agriculture. He is a founding member of the kibbutz’s vineyard and helped maintain its community vegetable garden. In December 2023, Islamic Jihad released a propaganda video of Moses, who pleaded in the video for the government to make a deal to release him. Known for his sociable and kind nature and belief in coexistence, the 80-year-old reached his milestone birthday while in captivity last March.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syaewhcoyl	2025-01-31T03:30:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/r1xW4UQ9dkg/r1xW4UQ9dkg_1_245_720_406_0_small.jpg

$10,000 for Iron Dome video: Court charges two reservists for spy...	Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev face significant espionage charges with intent to harm national security; details reveal close cooperation with Iranian handler Two IDF reservists Yuri Eliasfov, 22, and Georgi Andreyev, 21, were charged on Friday with collaborating with an Iranian foreign agent known as 'Boaz' and carrying out actions intended to harm Israel’s national security. Eliasfov is accused of aiding an enemy in war, providing information that could benefit the enemy, contact with a foreign agent, aggravated forgery and other offenses. Andreyev is charged with contact with a foreign agent, vandalism and tampering with evidence. Neither has a previous criminal record. According to the indictment filed in Haifa District Court, Eliasfov served as a technician in the Iron Dome air defense system and later during his reserve service, while Andreyev was a technician at the Israeli Air Force's operations center and also served in reserves. The two have been friends for years. The two spray-painted pro-Iranian graffiti in public places across Israel in exchange for $100 in cryptocurrency, photographed the creation and sent the images to 'Boaz' before erasing part of the text. Eliasfov allegedly sent 'Boaz' blurred images of sites he claimed were military locations, receiving payment. He later offered to sell him weapons. Between November 1-3 last year, while on reserve duty, Eliasfov recorded the Iron Dome radar screen, capturing classified data on the system’s location. He sent 'Boaz' an edited clip containing highly classified information and offered the full video for $10,000, demanding an $800 advance payment. During his compulsory service, Eliasfov allegedly took eight photos of Iron Dome’s computer systems containing classified data and stored them on his phone, knowing they were highly confidential. 'Boaz' reportedly believed Eliasfov was a commander in the IDF’s elite Egoz unit with military connections. The Iranian agent expressed interest in Israeli Air Force bases, aircraft and specifically Nevatim Airbase, targeted in an Iranian attack last October. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Eliasfov falsely claimed he knew a soldier at Nevatim and could obtain information. 'Boaz' asked him to verify how many aircraft were damaged in the attack, photograph the base and obtain flight speed and altitude data. Eliasfov agreed, knowing 'Boaz' was an Iranian agent. He asked a reservist friend about Israeli Air Force flight times to Iran and damage from the attack. The friend, unaware, directed him to search online. Eliasfov later found public data, calculated flight times, and sent 'Boaz' the results. Unable to confirm Nevatim’s damage, he fabricated information and received $146 in cryptocurrency. He also sent blurred images, falsely claiming they were of Nevatim, for which he received $94. Eliasfov further claimed to know a female soldier who had access to classified information. He then forged a document with the IDF emblem and 'classified' label, making it appear to be a summary of a planned ground incursion into Lebanon last November. He received $296 and another $90 in cryptocurrency for it. He also sent 'Boaz' images of a drone and the IDF’s headquarters base in Tel Aviv, downloaded from the internet. Additionally, he offered to sell 'Boaz' an M16 rifle, three magazines and 50 rounds but the agent declined. The prosecution has requested the court extend their detention until the end of legal proceedings against them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryc11k4q00yg	2025-01-31T03:01:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/HJNQ55M5001x/HJNQ55M5001x_1216_530_1393_784_0_small.jpg

Israel approves Hamas' list for the fourth hostage handover set to take place Saturday; Yarden Bibas first of his family to return from captivity After 484 days in Hamas captivity, Israeli hostages Keith Siegel, 65, Ofer Calderon, 54, and Yarden Bibas, 35, are set to be released tomorrow in the fourth handover of Israel’s deal with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that Hamas provided the list to Qatari and Egyptian mediators and was then approved by Israel after the hostages’ families were notified. Hamas is still holding 82 hostages, 23 of whom are set for release in the next handovers of the deal’s first phase. Of these, 15 are alive and eight are deceased. The living hostages will be freed first. Before Saturday’s release, the Rafah crossing is expected to open on Friday for the evacuation of wounded Palestinians to Egypt, most of them being Hamas terrorists.

Minute by minute: Hamas' relentless attack on Nahal Oz base on Oc...	IDF seeks to complete probe into one of the worst battles in Hamas' assault and may ask released IDF lookouts to testify in order to advance conclusions While the IDF’s investigation into the battle at Nahal Oz base is nearing completion, testimonies of IDF lookouts recently released from captivity as part of the cease-fire deal with Hamas could aid intelligence efforts to track down the Nukhba terrorists who took part in the attack and assist in finalizing one of the war’s key inquiries. The battle was the deadliest among the numerous attacks on IDF bases near the Gaza border. The probe found that the terrorists had precise intelligence on the base, located 1–2 km from Gaza’s Shuja'iyya neighborhood. Timeline of the battle: 6:45 a.m.: Around 60 Nukhba terrorists storm the Nahal Oz base from land and by motorized paragliders under cover of heavy mortar and rocket fire. 7:05 a.m.: Terrorists reach the base’s command center and officers’ quarters. Most of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion was outside securing nearby Israeli communities. 7:50 a.m.: An Israeli Air Force drone strikes inside the base despite the chaos and risk of friendly fire, as some terrorists wear IDF uniforms. 8:30 a.m.: Hamas takes full control of the base, moving through shelters. 9:00 a.m.: A second wave of 50 terrorists enters, setting fires. Kidnappings proceed unimpeded, with terrorists using IDF jeeps. 10:00 a.m.: Terrorists roam freely; a third wave of 100 Hamas operatives arrives. 12:00 p.m.: The base’s central command post is overrun and burned. First reinforcements arrive and engage in combat. 1:00 p.m.: The tide turns as IDF forces begin clearing the base. From 7:30 a.m., attack helicopters and drones circled overhead, struggling to differentiate between soldiers and terrorists. Targeting was hampered by limited guidance from burning command posts and distant bases. The probe also found that some terrorists mistaken for soldiers were spared. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Inside a female barracks shelter, 15 soldiers hid. When terrorists approached, they fled in separate directions. Four were killed in a nearby building. Eleven others locked themselves inside another structure as terrorists tried to break in. An Air Force drone operator launched a precise missile strike nearby despite incomplete identification of the attackers. The blast forced the terrorists to flee, saving the soldiers. Survivors recalled hearing the door handle rattling before the explosion shattered all windows and silenced the attackers. The Air Force carried out 14 drone strikes inside the base, the first at 7:50 a.m., along with six helicopter strikes and 150 Apache cannon rounds. Nearby, drones executed 77 strikes, helicopters 36, and artillery fired over 1,600 shells, with 10 additional fighter jet strikes. According to the IDF’s investigation, around 60 terrorists were killed from the air in and around Nahal Oz on October 7. Some 53 IDF soldiers were killed in the battle to defend the base. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkritzc00kl	2025-01-31T00:57:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/r1IOgXK00Jg/r1IOgXK00Jg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Is Al Jazeera a mouthpiece for Hamas?	Video aired by Al Jazeera showing the staged release of three Israeli hostages has intensified allegations that the network acts as a platform for Hamas propaganda Video capturing the return of three Israeli hostages on Thursday — Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and Gadi Mozes —has reignited the debate over Al Jazeera’s role in reporting on Hamas and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The footage, aired by Al Jazeera, shows the carefully staged release of these hostages, a moment that Hamas has framed as a public relations victory. As the images unfold, masked gunmen are seen escorting the captives in a manner that critics say is designed to reinforce Hamas’ narrative of strength and control. The Qatari-owned network has long been at the center of controversy, accused by Israel and several Arab nations of serving as a propaganda platform for Hamas. While Al Jazeera maintains that it provides independent and balanced journalism, many argue that its editorial decisions and financial ties to Qatar align it with Hamas’ messaging. The video, which captures the handover of the hostages, is emblematic of these concerns. The carefully orchestrated scene, presented without critical context, has led many to question whether Al Jazeera is reporting news or amplifying Hamas’ narrative. The network’s critics point to numerous examples in which Al Jazeera’s coverage appears to favor Hamas while suppressing alternative perspectives. One such instance occurred when an Al Jazeera reporter abruptly cut off an interview with a wounded Gazan man after he criticized Hamas for using civilians as human shields. Saudi journalist Faisal Ibrahim Alshammeri commented on the incident, stating, 'Al Jazeera trades in the blood of the people of Gaza. When a Palestinian man criticized Hamas, the reporter didn’t like it [and cut him off].' Similarly, Saudi businessman Monther Aal Sheikh Mubarak called attention to the same event, arguing that Al Jazeera deliberately censors criticism of Hamas. 'An elderly Gazan wondered why the resistance [Hamas] hides among civilians. … The Al Jazeera reporter cut the interview short and walked away, because that is not what the man was supposed [to say] in the interview,' Mubarak remarked. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The network’s alleged bias is often linked to Qatar’s close ties with Hamas. Reports indicate that Qatar has provided over $1 billion in aid to Gaza in recent years, with significant portions of this funding allegedly benefiting Hamas. Al Jazeera’s Arabic-language broadcasts have frequently featured unchallenged statements from Hamas leaders, reinforcing the perception that it serves as the group’s media arm. Furthermore, its framing of events—such as referring to Hamas-led attacks as 'resistance operations' rather than acts of terrorism—has drawn condemnation from both Israeli and Arab commentators. In May 2024, Israel’s cabinet unanimously voted to shut down Al Jazeera’s operations within the country, citing national security concerns. This decision led to the immediate closure of the network’s offices and a ban on its broadcasts. In December 2024, the Palestinian Authority (PA) accused Al Jazeera of broadcasting misleading reports and stoking divisions, leading to a ban on the network’s operations in the West Bank. Subsequently, in January 2025, the PA temporarily suspended Al Jazeera’s broadcasts across the West Bank, citing concerns over 'inciting material.' Despite the widespread criticism, Al Jazeera denies allegations of bias, insisting that it provides a counterbalance to Western media narratives. The network argues that its coverage amplifies Palestinian voices that might otherwise be ignored and that accusations of pro-Hamas bias stem from political agendas rather than journalistic shortcomings. Al Jazeera supporters claim that it has been unfairly targeted by governments seeking to suppress independent reporting on human rights abuses in Gaza and the broader Middle East. Yet, even among those who value Al Jazeera’s reporting, there is acknowledgment that its editorial stance leans heavily toward Hamas’ perspective. The network’s decision to prominently feature Hamas spokespeople, air highly produced footage from hostage releases, and rarely challenge Hamas’ governance of Gaza has fueled the perception that it operates as more than just a neutral observer. The latest video showcasing the hostage release only adds to the growing body of evidence that Al Jazeera’s coverage often aligns with Hamas’ strategic messaging. While the network asserts its commitment to journalism, its editorial choices, financial ties to Qatar and repeated controversies suggest a pattern of reporting that favors Hamas’ perspective. Whether this alignment is a conscious editorial decision or the byproduct of Qatar’s geopolitical positioning remains a subject of intense debate. However, the criticism levied by both Israeli and Arab figures suggests that concerns over Al Jazeera’s role as a mouthpiece for Hamas are not without merit.

Israel readies for fourth hostage release in deal's first phase	Next handover will prioritize men over 50, injured or ill individuals, Avera Mengistu, Hisham al-Sayed, Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas alongside Keith Siegel; three men expected to be released Saturday Israel and Hamas concluded the third hostage release in the cease-fire agreement on Thursday with the return of Agam Berger, Arbel Yehud, Gadi Mozes, and five Thai nationals from Gaza. Subsequently, 110 Palestinian prisoners were released after Israel secured commitments from mediators for safer hostage releases in future releases — following chaotic scenes in Khan Younis. Some 82 hostages — 23 slated for release in subsequent handovers — remain in Hamas captivity. The next release, set for Saturday, will prioritize men over 50, injured or ill individuals, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed and Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas, whose condition remains unknown. Israel anticipates the release of U.S.-Israeli citizen Keith Siegel, 63, Saturday, with Yarden Bibas potentially added to the list. Berger was transferred from Jabaliya to the International Red Cross and then to Israeli forces. The handover of Yehud, Mozes, and five Thai nationals was delayed in Khan Younis as crowds surrounded their vehicle. Israel issued sharp warnings to Qatar and Egypt, demanding guarantees for safer future releases and warning of 'immediate pressure' if protocols are violated. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the scenes, saying, 'I view the appalling images during our hostages’ release with grave seriousness — further proof of Hamas’ unfathomable brutality.' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed mediators received Israel’s demands, securing commitments for safer transfers in upcoming handovers. The Palestinian prisoner release was delayed until Thursday afternoon, per Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz’s orders. The eight freed hostages were hospitalized at various Israeli medical facilities, reuniting with families. Mozes pledged to 'rebuild Nir Oz,' his kibbutz devastated on October 7 by terrorists. After the release, Thailand's Ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said: 'I can barely breathe. Thailand’s citizens, government and people eagerly await our five hostages’ return.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under the hostage deal's first phase, three hostages will be released weekly, prioritizing the injured, Mengistu, al-Sayed and the Bibas family. Parallel talks on the second phase — a permanent cease-fire and full hostage release — will begin Monday, with implementation slated for early March — 42 days after the deal’s start. U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, visiting Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, affirmed his commitment to 'bring everyone home, living and deceased.' He expressed hope for a lasting cease-fire, adding, 'President Trump and I will do everything to return them all… American citizens are a top priority.' Security officials warned talks on the second phase could collapse, jeopardizing the deal's first phase. 'If Hamas realizes the second phase won’t happen, they’ll have no incentive to complete the first phase or reach day 42 of the cease-fire,' a source said, criticizing Netanyahu for 'contradictory pledges' on IDF troop withdrawals. Conversely, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer’s circle believes a 'historic mega-deal' is possible, linking normalization with Saudi Arabia, a multinational Gaza force to fend off Hamas’ return and reconstruction funding. This 'New Abraham Accords' framework is expected to dominate Netanyahu’s upcoming meeting with Trump in the U.S. next week. Hamas still holds 82 hostages, living and deceased, including 59 men under 50 — soldiers, civilians and five foreign nationals. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byct00kcuyg	2025-01-30T22:01:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/S1k11HSY00yx/S1k11HSY00yx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

A message from home and Passover in Gaza: Freed hostages share sn...	Arbel Yehoud was unaware of the scope of the massacre in her kibbutz, Nir Oz; Gadi Mozes vows to rebuild his beloved kibbutz after returning home; IDF lookouts held below and above ground and observed holidays Eight Israeli hostages were released from Gaza as part of the deal with Hamas on Thursday, including Israelis Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and Gadi Mozes, along with five Thai nationals. Yehoud, 29, was held alone since October 7 and met another Israeli for the first time only hours before her release — Mozes, 80. The Islamic Jihad released a video of them embracing before being handed over. Both were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where one in four residents was either kidnapped or killed in the October 7 attack. Yehoud was unaware of the full extent of the massacre. Mozes told his children he had seen their relatives interviewed on TV, including Al Jazeera. 'I once heard your mother speaking on the radio,' he told them upon their reunion at an IDF reception center. ' I will do everything in my power to restore Nir Oz.' Berger, 20, was the last of the female IDF lookouts from the Nahal Oz base to remain in captivity. She spent much of her time with fellow hostage Liri Albag. The lookouts avoided eating leavened bread during Passover and tried to fast on Yom Kippur. Berger also observed the Sabbath. On her way to the hospital, she wrote a message on a board: 'I chose the path of faith, and in faith I returned.' The five lookouts were held both above and below ground. Naama Levy, released in a previous exchange, was kept alone for a long period before being reunited with her comrades. 'Is this real? Are you alive?' she asked them. In many cases, they were housed with families, where they were made to cook, clean and care for children. They exercised to pass the time, despite poor conditions and little food. Their captors forbade them from holding hands or crying but they found ways to support each other. Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev, longtime friends from their shared service, were held together most of the time. Mozes, Berger and Yehoud were released in the third exchange of the hostage deal after Hamas delayed Yehoud's release, despite her civilian status making her eligible for an earlier phase. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas continued to stage the hostage transfers as public spectacles — Berger was released in devastated Jabaliya and forced onto a platform, while Mozes and Yehoud were led through a crowd near the ruins of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s home in Khan Younis The five Thai hostages— Sathian Suwannakham, 34, Pongsak Thaenna, 35, Bannawat Saethao, 27, Watchara Sriaoun, 32, and Surasak Lamnao, 30 — were freed as part of a separate deal between Thailand and Hamas, though it remains unclear if a price was paid for their freedom. One more Thai hostage remains in captivity, along with two who were killed in the attack. A Nepali citizen is also held, while a Tanzanian captive was killed by terrorists. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad struggled to maintain order during the Khan Younis handover, as Yehoud and Mozes were forced through an angry crowd. In response, Israel delayed the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners, with prison buses ordered to turn back. A later agreement was reached after mediators assured Israel of 'safe passage' for future hostages. The prisoners were then released, including 30 serving life sentences. After the latest exchange, 82 hostages remain in Gaza, 35 of whom Israel has declared dead. In the coming weeks, 23 more hostages are expected to be released, including an estimated eight deceased. Hamas is set to release three men on Saturday, with their names to be confirmed Friday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by3ghvtdke	2025-01-30T14:48:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/S1k11HSY00yx/S1k11HSY00yx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Cease-fire deal and Iran: Marks for Netanyahu and Trump's meeting	Israel sees great importance in prime minister's upcoming visit to Washington next week in which he'll discuss Tehran, Gaza and possible normalization with Saudi Arabia Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to leave Israel for the U.S. on Sunday for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss Iran and Gaza's future. Israel sees the meeting as an opportunity to shape regional policy, as key decisions have yet to be made by Trump's administration. Israel’s top priority is Iran, while Trump sees Iran's role fits into a broader regional strategy. Israel wishes for crippling U.S. sanctions alongside a credible military threat against Tehran. During his previous term, Trump imposed tough sanctions but did not back them with military action. His position remains that Iran will not obtain nuclear weapons, though the strategy to ensure that is still in question. While he is unlikely to initiate military action by the U.S., Trump could support Israeli operations against Iran and its proxies. Israel seeks clarity on whether Trump plans diplomatic talks for a new nuclear deal. The Iran issue is also tied to U.S. efforts to expand the Abraham Accords, with Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, visiting Saudi Arabia last week. Another key topic is the Israeli hostages and Gaza's future. The hostage issue is urgent, but resolving Gaza’s situation will take longer than the 19-day negotiation window for the second phase of the hostage deal agreed with Hamas. Witkoff has yet to take a firm position on the matter and the U.S. insists Gaza must not become a terrorist haven while also prioritizing hostage recovery. Trump and Netanyahu will seek to balance these goals. Both outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and Trump assured Netanyahu that resuming military action if negotiations fail would not be considered a violation of the cease-fire. However, the U.S. is working on a broader strategic framework where each issue connects to others. Trump may ask Netanyahu to delay further military action. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel was surprised by Trump’s suggestion to relocate half of Gaza’s population to Jordan or Egypt for the Strip’s reconstruction. The idea has never been seriously considered in Israel and it’s unclear if Trump sees it as realistic or a trial balloon. The proposal has been met with strong opposition in the Arab world. Trump is expected to ask Netanyahu directly: 'What are your plans?' Saudi Arabia has informed Israel normalization won't progress without a cease-fire. With a fragile truce in place, Saudi officials warn renewed fighting could derail the process. Israel hopes to learn from Trump where normalization efforts stand, though Israeli officials doubt a deal can be finalized before the first phase of the hostage agreement ends. Trump and Netanyahu will also discuss the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants against the prime minister and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, potential U.S. sanctions on ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, continued U.S. arms delivery to Israel, the Lebanon cease-fire and Syria’s new government. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skyjh8koyl	2025-01-30T12:30:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SJb7A72vJe/SJb7A72vJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Palestinian Authority and EU to operate Rafah Crossing in Februar...	Critical border crossing to Egypt set to open, with EU sending local force to oversee Palestinians leaving enclave; Netanyahu says PA's role at border symbolic Hundreds of thousands of Gazans began returning to northern Gaza via the Netzarim Corridor on Monday, with a U.S. security firm responsible for preventing weapons smuggling using vehicles. The firm consists of about 100 former elite unit members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, security measures are being prepared at the Rafah crossing, set to reopen in February, to prevent terrorists and weapons from being smuggled into Egypt. EU foreign ministers agreed to redeploy a European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) mission at the Rafah Crossing in February. Under the cease-fire agreement with Hamas, 200 Palestinians —mostly wounded individuals and their escorts — will leave Gaza daily through the crossing. EUBAM was established in 2005 as an EU civilian mission to assist the Palestinian Authority (PA) in managing Rafah. In 2007, after Hamas seized Gaza, the mission was suspended, relocating first to Ashkelon and later to Ramat Gan. A senior EU official said Israel recently asked how the EU could help reestablish EUBAM, with the request coming from Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) and the Foreign Ministry. 'The European force will play an important role in the cease-fire,' he said. 'The idea is to reopen the crossing during the first phase to allow people to leave Gaza.' Talks on redeployment involved Egypt and the U.S. 'From Israel, Egypt and the U.S. perspective, the EU force is a reliable body to oversee that terrorists and weapons don't pass through,' the official said. 'The EU wants to reestablish the mission to show support for the cease-fire and cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Israel wants a trustworthy partner to work with,' he added. The Rafah crossing will reopen in February, with Palestinians vetted by Shin Bet. The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement last week that these individuals will not be affiliated with the PA. However, a senior EU official said, 'The PA will provide mission personnel. European border officers from several countries will oversee operations. The crossing will be managed by PA border officers, while the IDF remains stationed around the perimeter.' Upon arrival, Palestinians will undergo security checks, including ID verification and weapons screening, before entering Egypt. The EU is expected to deploy up to 100 border officers with security arrangements in place. Most of those crossing will be wounded individuals, children and critically ill patients seeking treatment abroad. EUBAM has begun recruiting personnel ahead of redeployment. 'There's good cooperation and mutual interest going on with Israel,' the EU official said. 'Israel wants a trusted presence at the crossing.' 'The PA is trying to create a false impression that it controls the crossing. Under the agreement, the IDF secures the crossing, and no one passes without its supervision and prior approval from the IDF and Shin Bet,' The Prime Minister’s Office stated last week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The technical operation inside the crossing is handled by non-Hamas Gazans vetted by Shin Bet who have been managing essential services in Gaza since the war began. EUBAM oversees their work. The PA’s only practical role is stamping passports, as it is the internationally recognized authority for Palestinian travel documentation. This arrangement applies to the first phase of the hostage deal and will be reviewed at a later date.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjsyahkoyx	2025-01-30T11:22:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/19/Hkgk7FFvVT/Hkgk7FFvVT_0_30_1564_880_0_small.jpg
US security firm in Gaza stops fake UN vehicle at checkpoint	American security personnel at Netzarim Corridor stop Palestinian vehicle disguised as UN car, conducting X-ray scans and manual inspections; source says US team thorough and won’t allow UNRWA or others to game the system A U.S. security firm overseeing inspections at the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza intercepted a Palestinian car attempting to disguise itself as a United Nations vehicle, officials said Thursday. Despite bearing 'UN' markings, security personnel immediately identified the vehicle as fraudulent and conducted a thorough inspection, including X-ray scanning and manual searches of all bags inside. No weapons or explosives were found. The U.S. security team, staffed by former elite military personnel, including ex-CIA operatives, is tasked with preventing weapons smuggling into northern Gaza. They operate state-of-the-art scanning systems provided by Leidos, using AI-enhanced technology to examine vehicles from multiple angles simultaneously. All images are stored in a secured system. Sources familiar with the process said the American team is rigorous in its screening, adding, 'They are taking no risks, especially with UNRWA, and won’t tolerate any deception.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under the hostage release and cease-fire agreement, only vehicles heading north are subject to inspection, with no checks for individuals crossing on foot. The U.S. security personnel, numbering around 100 contractors, operate under a mandate from the mediators—the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, who also finance the operation. The Egyptian security company stationed at the outer perimeter conducts initial screenings and interviews with Gazans approaching the crossing. Meanwhile, Israeli engineering units and bomb-sniffing dogs sweep the area for unexploded ordnance. The security oversight is managed by a multinational consortium comprising strategic and logistics planning firm Safe Reach Solutions (SRS), global integrated security solutions provider UG Solutions and an Egyptian security and screening company. The consortium was selected by mediators to ensure vehicle screenings and facilitate the safe return of Gazans to northern Gaza. With extensive experience in high-risk zones and counterterrorism operations, the security firms dismissed concerns that 100 personnel were insufficient for the mission, emphasizing that security measures and staffing levels were carefully evaluated in response to potential threats. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rydopufdke	2025-01-30T11:20:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/rkoc0GYd1g/rkoc0GYd1g_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg

Freed hostage, 80, vows to rebuild his kibbutz	Gadi Mozes returns to Israel in third release of hostage deal and says will 'do everything in my power to restore his community of Nir Oz, ravaged by Hamas terrorists on October 7 Former hostage Gadi Mozes, 80, shared his first message upon release after 482 days in captivity in Gaza. 'I will do everything in my power to restore Nir Oz,' he said, referencing the southern Israeli kibbutz devastated in Hamas’ October 7 attack. Earlier, a photo circulated from the reunification center in Kibbutz Re’im showed Mozes embracing his three children — Moran, Oded and Yair — who had waited for his return to shave off beards grown since the war began. His daughter was heard urging him, 'Sit down, Dad.' Mozes told his children, 'I once heard your mother speaking on the radio.' Shailee, Mozes’ granddaughter, posted on Instagram: 'I have no words except *thank God* for this day, and thanks to everyone who cared for us, supported us and fought with us through this long, exhausting journey to victory — to have my grandfather back #BringThemAllHome.' Margalit Mozes, Gadi's ex-partner, said: 'A stone has been lifted from my heart. I am elated, especially for the children who suffered so much and for all of us. This was a very difficult period. Today is a crucial step toward healing.' His son Yair, who had vowed not to shave until his father’s return, shared an emotional reunion photo on Instagram: 'Dad is back!!!' Orna Pauker, Mozes’ partner, added: 'There’s great joy that Arbel [Yehoud] and Gadi returned but also worry for the rest of the hostages and grief for the tragedy we endured. It’s not easy.'

Terror group officially acknowledges death of October 7 attack mastermind and architect of Hamas' military capabilities; group also confirms elimination of Deif’s deputy Rafa Salama along with 5 other senior operatives Hamas officially confirmed Thursday that its military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed during the war, nearly six months after the IDF announced his elimination. Hamas spokesperson Abu Ubaida also confirmed the deaths of Deif’s deputy, Khan Younis Brigade commander Rafa Salama, as well as senior operatives Marwan Issa, Ghazi Abu Tama’a, Raad Thabet, Ahmed Ghandour and Ayman Nofal. Deif, the architect of Hamas' military capabilities and mastermind behind the October 7 attacks, was killed in an airstrike in Khan Younis on July 13, according to an earlier IDF statement. For weeks after the strike, Israeli intelligence gathered evidence to confirm his death before publicly announcing it in early August.

Liam Hazi, 20, from Rosh HaAyin, killed and 5 others wounded, one seriously, in ambush inside Jenin refugee camp building; terrorists open fire at close range before escaping; manhunt underway An Israeli soldier was killed and five others wounded during an IDF raid in the Jenin refugee camp, the military said Thursday, marking the first fatality in Israel's week-long counterterrorism crackdown across the West Bank, condemned Operation Iron Wall. The fallen soldier, Staff Sgt. Liam Hazi, 20, from Rosh HaAyin, was a combat fighter in the Haruv Reconnaissance Battalion. The IDF said four soldiers sustained mild to moderate injuries, while one remains in serious condition. A preliminary IDF investigation revealed that Haruv forces entered a building in the refugee camp for routine searches when terrorists hiding inside one of the rooms ambushed them, opening fire at close range. Staff Sgt. Hazi was killed in the firefight, while the attackers managed to escape.

Thai military doctor arrives in Israel to assist 5 Thai nationals freed from Hamas captivity; medical staff prepares Thai-language signs, flags and private rooms; Sriaoun’s mother weeps upon hearing news Five Thai nationals held hostage in Gaza since October 7 were released on Thursday and transferred to Israel under a behind-the-scenes agreement between Thailand, Hamas and Iran, Thai officials confirmed. The freed hostages—Sathian Suwannakham, 34, Pongsak Thenna, 35, Bannawat Seathao, 27, Watchara Sriaoun, 32, and Surasak Lamnau, 30—were handed over to the Red Cross before being transported to Shamir Medical Center in Be’er Ya’akov. In Thailand, Sriaoun’s mother, Wiwiyao, broke into tears upon seeing the footage of her son’s release after 482 days in captivity. Shamir Medical Center prepared a dedicated reception area for the Thai hostages, where they will receive medical and psychological care. A Thai military doctor, sent by the Royal Thai Army, met them at the reception center and accompanied them to the hospital. Each survivor was assigned a private room with two beds, following a request made during a previous prisoner exchange in November 2023, where Thai hostages preferred to stay together. Hospital staff placed signs in both Hebrew and Thai, and medical personnel wore name tags in both languages. To mark their arrival, hospital workers prepared a ceremonial display of Thai flags. 'Their return is an emotional moment for all of us,' said Dr. Yuval Levy, head of Israel’s public hospital division at the Health Ministry. 'The fate of these hostages has been intertwined with ours. They are now undergoing initial medical assessments, and we are fully prepared for any situation. This is a complex event, not just for their families but for all of Israel. We hope to see the safe return of all remaining hostages.' Following the release, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed relief and joy, while Thailand’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement welcoming the hostages’ return and confirming their safe arrival in Israel. 'Thailand thanks Israel and all involved parties for facilitating the release of the Thai hostages from Gaza,' the statement read. 'We extend our heartfelt congratulations to their families and express deep appreciation to Qatar, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, the United States and other friendly nations, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross, for their instrumental roles in securing their release.' The ministry also called for the immediate release of all remaining hostages, including one Thai national, Pinta Nattapong, still held in Gaza.

Peng Ruwikit Grossi, director at the Thai employment company Nima, said, 'This is a deeply emotional day for the Thai community in Israel. It is a moment of joy for them and for all Thai workers in the country.' However, she acknowledged the pain endured by hostage families throughout the ordeal. 'Our happiness is mixed with sorrow,' she said. 'Beyond their release, we know how difficult it was for their families to wait so long, receiving updates only from afar. The extensive coverage in Thailand is not just about their personal stories, but also a message to the entire Thai community—reminding them that there are people in Israel who care for them beyond their work.' Grossi emphasized that Nima, which serves over 60% of Thailand’s migrant workers in Israel, sees its role as extending beyond employment. 'This is not just about work; it’s about family, trust, support, and a real community that we’ve built here,' she said. 'Today, we are overjoyed to welcome our friends back.' Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar spoke with his Thai counterpart, Maris Sangiampongsa, following the release, assuring him that 'their condition is good.' 'Minister Sa’ar updated the Thai foreign minister on the details of their release, their current medical status—which is classified as good following initial assessments—and the plan to transport them shortly by helicopter to a hospital,' the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. Sa’ar thanked Thailand for its cooperation in negotiations and noted that the two ministers had spoken two weeks earlier regarding the hostages. They agreed to meet in Israel this weekend when Sangiampongsa visits. Before the hostages’ release, Thai Ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya expressed overwhelming emotion at the prospect of seeing them freed. 'This is a day of great news for me, for my country, and for the entire world,' she said. 'I have waited so long for this moment. I can barely breathe. Thai citizens, our government—everyone has been anxiously waiting to see our five hostages again. I want to thank Israel for taking care of them.' However, she urged continued efforts to secure the release of Nattapong. Two other Thai hostages, Sudthisak Rinthalak, 43, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, 30, have been declared by Israel to be dead, with their bodies held captive. On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists killed 49 Thai workers in Israel, including 11 murdered at Kibbutz Nir Oz, where five others were kidnapped. Two of them were freed in a previous exchange deal in November, which saw the release of 24 foreign hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skhxjmyuyl	2025-01-30T08:16:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/H1kl7zYO1l/H1kl7zYO1l_1_60_800_451_0_small.jpg

Israel resumes release of Palestinian prisoners after temporary h...	Israeli leaders suspend release of Palestinian prisoners after freed hostages swarmed by Gaza crowds during transfer; following talks with mediators, officials agreed to proceed with exchange under stricter security measures Israel resumed the release of Palestinian prisoners Thursday evening, following a temporary suspension ordered by the government in response to chaotic scenes during the handover of Israeli hostages in Khan Younis. The third phase of the prisoner exchange began with buses carrying prisoners departing from Ofer and Ketziot prisons. However, violent clashes erupted in Beitunia in the West Bank as demonstrators protested the transfer. Earlier, Israeli authorities had halted the scheduled release of 110 Palestinian prisoners, after a Gazan crowd blocked the path of vehicles carrying freed hostages to their handover point in Khan Younis. The hostages were forced to walk through the crowd to reach Red Cross vehicles, leading Israel to issue a strong protest to mediators. Following the incident, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the Israel Prison Service (IPS) to halt the prisoner release until assurances were received that future hostage transfers would occur safely. 'The prime minister, alongside the defense minister, has ordered a delay in the release of prisoners until the safe passage of our hostages is guaranteed in the upcoming phases,' Netanyahu’s spokesperson, Omer Dostri, said. 'Israel demands that mediators secure these guarantees.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich added: 'I support the prime minister and call on him to halt the release of terrorists until assurances are received that the disturbing, degrading scenes from Gaza and the abuse of our hostages before their return will not happen again.' Buses carrying prisoners were instructed to stop and return to the prisons, while Hamas and other Palestinian factions condemned Israel’s move. Senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said, 'We demand that Israel be held accountable for implementing the terms of the agreement.' After negotiations, Israel agreed to resume the releases following a commitment from mediators ensuring that future hostage transfers would be handled securely. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Following Prime Minister Netanyahu’s demand, mediators have provided assurances that hostages in upcoming phases will be transferred safely,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. 'Israel insists that lessons be learned, and that future handovers are conducted under strict security measures.' Prisoners were freed from Ketziot Prison in southern Israel and Ofer Prison near Givat Ze’ev. Of the 110 inmates released, about 30 were deported, while the rest were transferred to Gaza and the West Bank. Among the notable prisoners freed was Zakaria Zubeidi, a high-profile terrorist involved in multiple shooting attacks. In exchange for the release of Israeli hostage Agam Berger, Israel freed 30 prisoners serving life sentences and 20 prisoners with varying sentences; for Arbel Yehoud’s release, Israel freed 30 minors and women; and for Gadi Mozes' release, Israel freed 30 prisoners, including 27 serving various sentences and three serving life terms. The IDF dropped leaflets near Ofer Prison reading: 'We will not allow demonstrations in support of terrorism.' IPS Central District commander Shlomi Sagi said: 'We've been preparing the prisoners for release since last night. We'll load them onto buses and transfer them. The International Red Cross has conducted all necessary checks. There have been no unusual incidents; order and discipline are being maintained. We will ensure discipline to the end — no celebrations will be allowed.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1grwfkdyg	2025-01-30T07:14:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/rkBWWgFO1x/rkBWWgFO1x_0_82_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Freed Nahal Oz lookout Agam Berger reunites with family, joins fe...	Aboard the helicopter to the hospital, Agam told that Karina, Naama, Daniella and Liri, freed earlier, chose to stay with her another week; Her response: 'Perfect!' Watch the emotional reunion Agam Berger, the last of five female IDF lookouts abducted from Nahal Oz on October 7, was released from Hamas captivity on Thursday, marking an emotional reunion with her family and fellow soldiers in Israel. After 482 days in captivity, Berger was transferred to the IDF reception center at the Gaza border, where she reunited with her parents. 'We are here, we will never leave you, forever. A promise from your mother,' her mother, Merav, told her. From there, she was airlifted by an Israeli Air Force helicopter to Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, where she was greeted by the four other freed Nahal Oz lookouts—Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, Daniella Gilboa and Liri Albag, who were released in the previous phase of the deal last week. Upon seeing her fellow lookouts at the hospital, Berger ran toward them and embraced them tightly. She also reunited with her relatives, including her brother, whom she greeted with laughter and tears. 'How are you this tall? You're as tall as Dad!' she said emotionally. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Albag’s father, Eli, expressed his joy at Berger’s return, saying, 'They have closed the circle. Now, there is still a soldier from Nahal Oz who needs to be freed, along with all the other hostages—urgently.' The four released lookouts had prepared welcome signs for Berger’s arrival. In return, during her helicopter flight, she held up a handwritten message reading, 'We love you, Am Yisrael Chai.' Her parents also wrote a note to her during the flight, informing her that her fellow lookouts had decided to stay at the hospital for another week to be with her, to which she responded, 'Perfect!' Berger was handed over to Israeli security forces inside Gaza by Red Cross personnel after a staged release ceremony by Hamas in Jabaliya. According to Israeli officials, Hamas forced her to stand on a stage amid the ruins of destroyed homes, smile and wave as part of a psychological manipulation tactic. Alongside Berger, two Israeli civilians—Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80, both kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz—were also released near the ruins of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s home in Khan Younis. Additionally, five Thai nationals—Pongsak Thainna, 35, Sathin Suwankham, 34, Sariyaon Watchara, 32, Saitiao Banawat, 27, and Romano Surasak, 30—were freed as part of the exchange. As Berger’s helicopter landed at Rabin Medical Center, crowds gathered to cheer and welcome her home, marking another milestone in the ongoing efforts to bring back the remaining hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjl000mku1g	2025-01-30T06:32:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/B1AP00bYdyx/B1AP00bYdyx_0_0_2048_1364_0_small.jpg

Salwan Momika, 38, staged several burnings and desecrations of Islam's holy book in Sweden in 2023. Videos of the Quran burnings got worldwide publicity and raised anger and criticism in several Muslim nations, leading to riots and unrest in many places. The Stockholm District Court said a verdict scheduled Thursday in a trial in which Momika was a defendant was postponed because one of the defendants had died. A judge at the court confirmed that the deceased was Momika. He said he didn't have any information on when or how Momika died.

Meirav and Shlomi Berger met their daughter on Gaza border; From there, Agam and her parents were transferred by an Israeli Air Force helicopter to Rabin Medical Center, where she will reunite with four of her IDF lookout team who were released from Gaza on Saturday After 482 days in captivity, the long-awaited moment finally arrived. Agam Berger, a 20-year-old IDF lookout kidnapped from her post in Nahal Oz on Oct. 7, was reunited with her family on Thursday afternoon after being released by Hamas. The IDF released footage of Berger’s handover to IDF forces and the emotional reunion with her parents, Meirav and Shlomi, at a forward reception point. From there, she was flown by an Israeli Air Force helicopter to Rabin Medical Center, where she will join four fellow female soldiers who were freed from Hamas captivity on Saturday. Elite IDF forces and Israel’s Shin Bet security agency received Berger inside Gaza from Red Cross personnel after yet another orchestrated release ceremony staged by Hamas in the Jabaliya refugee camp. She was led out of the ruins of destroyed buildings toward a platform set up for the event, where she was seen walking on her own, smiling and even waving. Her family expressed their relief in a statement: 'Thank God we have reached this moment. Our hero, Agam, has returned to us after 482 days in enemy hands. Our daughter is strong, full of faith, and courageous. We want to thank the security forces and all of Israel for the support and prayers. Now, Agam and our family can begin the healing process – but the recovery will not be complete until all the hostages return home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office also released a statement: 'The Government of Israel embraces IDF soldier Agam Berger. Her family has been updated by the responsible authorities that she is with our forces. The Government, together with all of the security officials, will accompany her and her family. The Government of Israel is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing. 'And I will return the captivity of My people Israel.' (Amos 9:14).' Dr. Lena Koren Feldman, director of Beilinson Hospital, where Agam Berger arrived, said the four fellow observers who were freed on Saturday erupted in joy upon hearing the news of her release. 'Her return is part of their healing process,' Koren Feldman said. In Holon, dozens of friends and family members gathered outside Berger’s home, reciting Psalms and carrying a Torah scroll in celebration. 'I didn’t sleep all night,' one of her friends admitted. When Berger was seen emerging from the ruins in Jabaliya, her friends shouted, 'This is it—it’s happening.' Friends who watched footage of Berger being led by Hamas fighters onto the stage prepared for her release reacted with relief. 'Our champion. She looks okay. That’s her—that’s exactly her,' they said. 'Our hero, our fighter, we are so proud of her. The nightmare is over.

Hezbollah provocations persist: IDF intercepts reconnaissance dro...	IDF intercepted a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone as provocations increase during an extended cease-fire; Senior officials stress that security remains Israel's responsibility, with operations underway to dismantle terror strongholds and recover hidden munitions along the border For the first time since the cease-fire in the north took effect on November 27 last year, the IDF intercepted an unmanned aerial vehicle launched toward Israel. 'The Air Force intercepted a reconnaissance UAV belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization,' IDF spokesperson said on Thursday, adding: 'We will not allow Hezbollah’s terrorist activities in Lebanon and will act to eliminate any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens.' The original cease-fire agreement stipulated that IDF troops would withdraw from southern Lebanon after 60 days. However, on Sunday, the White House announced that the agreement had been extended until February 18, allowing IDF troops to remain in Lebanese territory until that date. The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, closely associated with Hezbollah, reported this week that the terrorist organization was not a party to the negotiations for extending the cease-fire in Lebanon and even rejected requests to prolong the deadline. During the additional three weeks in which, according to the agreement, IDF troops will remain in southern Lebanon, the military plans to carry out a range of operations to destroy terrorist strongholds and retrieve weapons hidden by Hezbollah, especially in the eastern sector bordering the Upper Galilee region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier this week, after the original 60-day period ended, Hezbollah attempted to provoke confrontations by sending hundreds of operatives waving the organization’s flags to nearby villages along the border, trying to engage with IDF soldiers. A senior military official, still operating with his troops in southern Lebanon, told Ynet this week: 'Until the Lebanese army fulfills its responsibilities and demonstrates sufficient control over the area, we will not recommend transferring control to them.' He added: 'In villages not adjacent to the border in the western and central sectors of southern Lebanon, we have returned control to the Lebanese army. But in villages near us and in the border fence area along its entire length, we are still present.' He emphasized that no one in the Israeli military trusts the Lebanese forces to ensure the safety of the residents who have already started returning northward. 'The responsibility for the security of our residents lies with Israeli forces, certainly not with the Lebanese army or any other foreign force,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkx75auuyg	2025-01-30T02:45:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/HkxEUCpO00ke/HkxEUCpO00ke_149_11_1076_605_0_small.jpg

Major Kyiv mall reopens following destruction from Russian attack...	Retroville shopping mall in Kyiv, destroyed in a deadly Russian missile attack, was rebuilt and partially reopened in just four months; Its reopening symbolizes Ukraine’s resilience, with visitors now exceeding pre-war levels by 25% This was one of the deadliest Russian attacks against Ukraine at the beginning of the war. A Russian missile struck the Retroville shopping mall, one of the largest shopping centers in Kyiv, obliterating it. Eight were killed, and many were injured. Yedioth Ahronoth correspondent Ronen Bergman, together with photographer Ziv Koren, were among the first to arrive at the scene at the time of the attack. They documented immense destruction, with the entire commercial center turned into 'ashes and dust.' This week, we returned to the mall, which has unwillingly become one of the symbols of Ukraine's fight for independence. Nothing in the massive shopping center – featuring 3,000 parking spaces and offering a range of international brands like H&M, McDonald’s, Timberland, and Samsung – hints at the tragedy that occurred there three years ago. Customers stroll around with shopping bags, and the restaurants and cafes are full. Retroville is also a favorite spot for the Israeli community in Ukraine's capital due to its affordable prices and ample parking. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The mall's CEO, Renata Jakubcioniene, is among those responsible for the rapid reconstruction of the shopping center. At a time when Israel is also facing the damages of war, it is fascinating to hear how Ukraine is trying to recover and return to a normal life of commerce and economy. \ 'The mall was rebuilt and partially reopened within four months,' says the CEO. 'We managed to do this thanks to a strong team and quick solutions. We created a strategy to reopen the mall in phases.' Perhaps due to its symbolic significance, foot traffic in the mall has increased by 25% compared to pre-war levels. 'Retroville attracts about one million visitors a month. Almost all the tenants who were affected decided to reopen.' Did you receive assistance from insurance companies, Kyiv municipality, or donors? 'We received a lot of attention and sympathy from the authorities and the media, but there was no real financial support. The reconstruction work was carried out entirely from our internal resources. There was also a desire here to show that we are stronger than the enemy's attacks. This gave us the strength to reopen faster.' 'A short time after the attack, I arrived at the site and saw that they had struck the center of the mall,' recounts Vlada Molchanova, founder of the Lithuanian group Stolitsa, which owns Retroville. 'We made the decision not to give up and to reopen. This is symbolic not only for Ukraine itself but also for many people who have faced hardships because of the war. The message is: don’t give up.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqxbpoujg	2025-01-30T02:02:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/rkohdkOdkl/rkohdkOdkl_245_38_1139_641_0_small.jpg

Mother of slain soldier whose murderers are freed: 'He would have...	Tzila Pikholtz's son Yaron was killed while serving in the IDF in 2001, and his Palestinian murderers are being released as part of the deal to bring the hostages home, but this does not change her mind about the worthiness of the arrangement; 'If Yaron were alive, he would have blessed this deal and hugged them' 'If bringing home living people is possible, life must take precedence over death,' says Tzila Pikholtz, mother of the Staff Sergeant Yaron Pikholtz, who was killed while serving in the IDF in 2001 and whose murderers are among those being released in the hostage exchange deal. Did the state inform you about the imminent release of your son's murderers? 'No. My daughter Chen's friend called her on Saturday at 8 a.m. and said there was a list of Hamas prisoners being released on Ynet, and that Yaron's murderers were on the list. We immediately got organized and drove to my other daughter, Ayala, who is religious, because we didn’t know how she would react and wanted her to hear it from us. Only on Saturday night did the casualty officer call us. It’s outrageous that we had to find this out through the media.' How did you feel when you first heard the news? 'Accelerated heartbeat, trembling and immense pain. It dragged us backward, as if we were reliving the day Yaron was murdered. But, to be honest, this past year has already brought us back to those moments. We experience every 'cleared for publication' personally, because we know what awaits those families. I was moved to see the girls who were released. They were born after Yaron was killed, and if he were alive, he would have blessed this deal and embraced them.' What is your opinion on the deal? 'If bringing home living people is possible, life must take precedence over death. We can't bring Yaron back, and, overall, these vile murderers have already served quite a long time – 21 years. Of course, there’s the fear they’ll return to terrorism and kill again, but the hostages are people who need to be saved. I was deeply moved to see the girls who were freed in the last two weeks. They were born after Yaron was killed – young girls with pure hearts who had just joined the army and didn’t know anything yet about life. If Yaron were alive, he would have blessed this deal and hugged them.' How did Yaron die? 'Yaron was a squad commander in the Engineering Corps, and was killed on November 29, 2001, during an encounter with an Islamic Jihad terrorist cell near Baqa al-Sharqiyya. The terrorists arrived at a checkpoint in a car with Israeli license plates. Yaron approached to inspect them and was shot at close range. He was airlifted to Hillel Yaffe Medical Center but died of his wounds en route. He was 20 years and nine months old.' When were the attackers caught? 'One of them was killed during operational activity. The other two, Jasser Radad and Basel Makhlouf, from the Tulkarm area, were caught two and a half months later. During the operation to capture them, Lt. Col. Eyal Weiss, from the Duvdevan Unit, was killed.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: How did you learn of Yaron's death? 'I was at an art class, and at the exact moment he was killed, all my yellow paint – his favorite color because he was a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan – spilled. I went home with a beautiful painting, feeling euphoric, with no bad feelings at all. That morning, he had returned to base after a weekend at home. At 4 p.m., he called to tell me that the soldiers loved the cookies I had baked for him and sent their thanks. I was so happy because he sounded happy, and it was such a good conversation. I had no idea that within an hour and a half, he would no longer be alive.' Did you follow the trial of his murderers? 'No. We were shattered and didn’t engage with it. It was a coping mechanism. I had two young daughters at home, and I wanted so badly to rebuild our lives and keep going that I chose not to invest energy in it.' Even now, you choose to work rather than retire. 'I’m a social worker by trade, and even though I’m of retirement age, I still work in elder care. In recent years, I’ve studied group facilitation and now volunteer by leading groups of bereaved mothers. A few years ago, my husband Amos and I established a memorial project for Yaron, where we distribute teddy bears to children with special needs. Over the years, we’ve donated thousands of teddy bears, and now we’re starting to give them to new war orphans. Sadly, there are far too many this past year.' Who funds this initiative? 'It’s our own money. Amos said that as long as we’re working and have the means, we’ll continue memorializing Yaron, so as many people as possible can come to know him.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hk2th2u001x	2025-01-30T00:15:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/04/11/rk9MQsxLd/rk9MQsxLd_0_21_1192_672_0_small.jpg

Gadi Mozes, 80, Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20, and 5 foreign workers are being released Thursday morning from captivity in Gaza; Watch the hostage release live After 482 days, Gadi Mozes, 80, Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20, and 5 foreign workers are being released Thursday morning from captivity in Gaza. Ynetnews is broadcasting their return live. Agam Berger emerges from an Islamic Jihad vehicle on her feet and mounts a stage in Jabaliya after Red Cross vehicles arrive at the collection point. Earlier, Islamic Jihad organization released a short video of Gadi Mozes and Arbel Yehoud, two of the Israeli hostages expected to be released, in which they embrace prior to their release from captivity. The exact date of the recording is unclear, but the organization noted that it was filmed 'during the final procedures for their handover.' Mozes was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, where his partner, Efrat Katz, was murdered. His ex-wife, Margalit Mozes, was also kidnapped but was freed in the first hostage release in November 2023. Born in Hadera, Mozes moved to Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza Strip about 60 years ago as part of a youth movement program. He worked in agriculture, eventually becoming a renowned agronomist who trained generations of farmers in the kibbutz and taught irrigation and crop cultivation courses worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Berger, a resident of Holon, was abducted from the Nahal Oz outpost just two months after enlisting in the IDF, where she served as a military lookout.In footage from the October 7 attack, Berger is seen with blood-stained face, though it remains unclear whether she was injured or if the blood belonged to fellow soldiers who were murdered in the shelter beside her. She is the last Nahal Oz lookout still in captivity, following the November 2023 rescue of Ori Magidish and the recovery of Noa Marciano’s body, after she was executed by her captors. This past Saturday, four additional lookouts—Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Daniella Gilboa—were freed Yehoud was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz along with her partner, Ariel Cunio, during the October 7 attack. Her brother, Dolev, left his home that morning to help treat the wounded. After eight months of uncertainty, his body was finally discovered in the kibbutz. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under the original terms of the hostage deal, the first groups to be released were female civilian captives. Yehoud was initially slated to be freed in the first or second phase, but due to what Hamas called 'technical issues,' her release was postponed. Instead, Hamas prioritized the release of the four female military lookouts. In response, Israel refused to open the Netzarim Corridor for humanitarian movement. Following mediation efforts, an agreement was reached to secure Yehoud’s release on Thursday. As part of the deal, the Netzarim Corridor was reopened, allowing hundreds of thousands of Gazans to return to northern Gaza. The freed hostages will have a basic medical examination at the border before being taken to one of four Israeli hospitals. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1b9yoddjx	2025-01-29T22:49:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/S1G5D6vuke/S1G5D6vuke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Trump signs executive order to revoke visas of foreign students supporting Hamas, intensifies antisemitism crackdown and targets campus extremism; The order mandates investigations, deportations and restrictions on federal funding for institutions promoting anti-American or antisemitic ideologies President Trump fulfilled another of his campaign promises on Wednesday night by signing an executive order to revoke visas for all foreign 'Hamas supporters' studying on U.S. campuses and deport them. The order also directs the Justice Department to intensify efforts to combat antisemitism, stating it must 'aggressively pursue indictments for terrorist threats, arson, vandalism, and violence against Jewish Americans.' The order pledges to 'investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist and anti-American colleges and universities' and instructs government agencies to identify and utilize all available legal tools against antisemitic attackers and harassers within 60 days. In an explanatory document attached to the order, Trump states: 'To all foreign nationals who participated in pro-jihadist demonstrations, consider yourselves warned – in 2025, we will find you and deport you.' He further adds, 'I will act swiftly to revoke the visas of Hamas-supporting students on campuses, where extremism has become more rampant than ever.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The order specifically targets foreign nationals who violated the law during protests that have erupted on U.S. campuses since the October 7 massacre, which sparked demonstrations against Israel's war in Gaza. Trump also instructed government agencies to submit recommendations on the matter to the White House within 60 days. The Justice Department is reportedly tasked with investigating incidents such as graffiti slogans supporting Hamas. During his election campaign, Trump vowed to expel 'Hamas supporters' from U.S. universities. At a rally in May, he declared: 'When I am president, we will not allow violent extremists to take over our campuses. If you came here from another country and tried to bring jihadism, anti-Americanism, or antisemitism to our campuses – we will deport you immediately.' During the campaign, Trump also promised to prioritize addressing discrimination on campuses, particularly antisemitism, as well as policies like affirmative action and diversity programs (DEI) related to gender identity and racial equality. These programs were already ordered removed from all branches of the U.S. government during his first days in office. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt announced Wednesday night that Trump plans to sign another executive order addressing the education system. Among other measures, it will block federal funding for institutions that promote curricula accusing the U.S. of institutional racism. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aoa5uoyg	2025-01-29T22:09:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/09/rJ63Ithbkg/rJ63Ithbkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Mother of hostage Segev Kalfon: 'You will return. Stay strong. We...	Gailt urges Segev to hold on just a little longer, as she believes with all her heart he’ll be home soon; 'Segev, if you’re listening, know there's a deal, and hostages are returning, Dad is doing everything he can, we know you will come home' As hostages are gradually released under the ongoing deal, Segev Kalfon's mother, Galit, is determined to send him a message of strength and hope. 'I want my son to know that we are strong, thinking of him constantly, and working behind the scenes for his return,' she said Wednesday. Segev was kidnapped on Oct. 7 from the Nova music festival. 'He's a kind-hearted young man who wins people over,' Galit said. 'He has so many friends. I never liked him going to parties like Nova, and on Oct. 7, I woke up in a panic when I saw he wasn't home. I called him, and he reassured me, but I could hear chaos in the background. He sounded anxious and said he had abandoned his car.' 'Later, we spoke again and asked him to send his location. That’s when I realized he was exactly where I feared most. The call disconnected, and I understood he had been taken – around 8:20 a.m. A friend of his, who hid in the bushes, later told me Segev wasn’t injured when he was kidnapped. We know he's alive, but I can’t share more than that. We're just waiting for him to come home.' Galit expressed frustration over how long the ordeal has dragged on. 'Everyone should have been home by now. It’s unreal that this is taking so long,' she said. 'This sends a message for generations to come –that if civilians are kidnapped, the country stands behind them.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She also called for more open support from politicians. 'We have an assigned officer who stays in touch, and we meet with Knesset members – mostly those who support us. But I want them to be more vocal, to go on record saying they stand behind Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in bringing the hostages home.' Since Segev’s abduction, the Kalfon family's life has been at a standstill. 'I haven’t gone back to work. My husband works, but he’s barely functioning. Our son, Shai, is keeping the family business running. My daughter studies from home so I won’t be alone,' Galit shared. 'Our lives have changed. My faith has strengthened, and prayers are what keep me going. I just want us to be a family again – to have our Friday night dinners that Segev loves so much.' Galit knows some of the families whose loved ones have already been released but said they had no new information about her son. 'I want to be in that place already,' she said, and addressed Segev directly: 'I heard that some hostages can listen to the radio. If you hear me now, know that I am strong. I’m sensitive and emotional, but strong. Hold on just a little longer – I believe with all my heart that soon you’ll be home. Segev, if you’re listening, know that there’s a deal in place, and hostages are coming back. You will return. Stay strong. We believe in you. Dad is doing everything he can. Every second, we’re praying. We know – without a doubt – you will come home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj3x8fooje	2025-01-29T21:16:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/07/SJ7MMNduT/SJ7MMNduT_0_256_591_333_0_small.jpg

Israel faces new security concerns as Palestinians return to nort...	As thousands return to their homes in northern Gaza, Israeli security officials debate the potential risks of Hamas regrouping and the challenges of maintaining long-term security Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza on Tuesday after the IDF withdrew from a key crossing that had previously blocked their movement during the war. The withdrawal was part of a cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel earlier this month. Despite agreeing to the cease-fire, the Israeli government has vowed to resume military operations once the first stage of the deal is completed. At the start of the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to dismantle Hamas’s military infrastructure and remove it from power in Gaza. As this objective remains unfulfilled, Israel has committed to continuing the war. Although negotiations to extend the cease-fire are set to begin next week, deep distrust between the two sides leaves little hope that it will last beyond its initial phase, which is scheduled to end in early March. The sight of refugees carrying their belongings on foot was both emotional for Palestinians and concerning for Israelis, who fear the security implications of a repopulated northern Gaza. With Israeli forces no longer present in the area, there are growing concerns that Hamas could regain control and pose a renewed threat to Israel. Before the war, northern Gaza was home to approximately one million people and borders Israeli communities known as the 'Gaza Envelope.' These areas have been targeted by Hamas for over two decades, particularly since Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. The Palestinian cities of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahiya previously served as Hamas’s strongholds and were the launch sites for its October 7, 2023, terrorist attack—one of the deadliest conflicts in the region in recent years. Critics of the cease-fire argue that allowing Palestinians to return to these areas endangers Israel. They advocate for maintaining an unpopulated buffer zone along the border. 'Everything is reversible,' Dr. Harel Chorev of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University said. 'If there will be an operational need, the population can be moved again.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Brig. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Nuriel, former director of the Counter-Terrorism Bureau at the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, warned that allowing Palestinian residents to return would severely limit Israel’s ability to carry out future military operations. 'Any future evacuation will likely be for a much more limited time period and not see residents heading all the way to southern Gaza,' Nuriel said. 'It will also limit Israel’s ability to use firepower and undertake ground operations during the presence of a civilian population. The simple rules of engagement will become much more complicated.' The cease-fire was reached after more than 15 months of war. Hamas’ surprise offensive resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 Israelis, thousands of injuries, and the capture of approximately 250 hostages. Of those, 90 remain in captivity. Some hostages have already been released or are set for release as part of the current ceasefire, while others, whose fate remains uncertain, may be freed in a second phase of negotiations. Israel responded with a large-scale military operation in Gaza, aiming to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and remove it from power. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, over 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, and approximately 110,000 have been injured. Many areas in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, with UN figures indicating that over 90% of housing units have been destroyed and nearly 70% of all structures either damaged or obliterated. The large-scale destruction drew international calls for Israel to halt the war and agree to a cease-fire months before it was finally reached. 'Israel now has much more operational freedom than it would have had if it had agreed to a ceasefire at the beginning of 2024,' said Chorev, addressing concerns that Israel may not be able to resume fighting if the ceasefire fails. 'This freedom has been reached by the killing of approximately 20,000 Hamas terrorists and significant damage to military infrastructure, including tunnels and manufacturing workshops.' According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), approximately 200,000 people returned to northern Gaza from the south on Monday. The UN estimates that nearly two million Palestinians were displaced during the war as the Israeli military advanced through the Gaza Strip. While some followed Israeli evacuation orders, others fled in fear of the massive air and ground offensive. 'The area does not look like what it used to, this is clear,' said Nuriel. 'But the operational infrastructure that the army will face means it will essentially be starting from scratch, and this is a significant challenge.' The cease-fire has facilitated the return of residents. As part of the deal, Hamas has begun releasing Israeli hostages, and Israeli forces have withdrawn from most of Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are also set to be released from Israeli jails as part of the agreement. When the details of the deal emerged, some within the Netanyahu government criticized the withdrawal from northern Gaza, arguing that it would allow Hamas to regroup. 'There is no doubt that Hamas will take advantage of this time to reconstruct tunnels and train new recruits,' Chorev said. The war in Gaza quickly expanded into a broader regional conflict. The Lebanese-based terrorist group Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels joined Hamas in attacking Israel. During the war, Israel and Iran engaged in direct strikes for the first time after decades of a shadow conflict. Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah severely weakened the Iran-backed group, which also contributed to the collapse of the Bashar Assad regime in Syria. Hamas cannot ignore this regional fallout, even as it gains temporary respite through the ceasefire. 'Hamas is currently limited in the resources it needs in order to recover,' Chorev added. 'They are dependent on supplies from outside Gaza, and those supply lines have been damaged by Israel’s extensive attacks on the ‘resistance axis’ from Syria to Lebanon. Hamas now faces significant challenges in smuggling weapons.' Israeli forces still control the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza, a narrow strip of land bordering Egypt that has long served as a key supply route for Hamas. Hamas is unlikely to accept an ongoing Israeli presence there in future negotiations. 'Looking at the situation rationally, Hamas has suffered a significant blow and lacks the means to rebuild,' said Nuriel. 'There is room for some optimism, but real optimism can only come if the government makes meaningful decisions about Gaza’s future and who will govern it after Hamas.' This is a question that Netanyahu’s government has largely avoided for political reasons. The far-right coalition refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, to assume control of Gaza, arguing that it also supports terrorism. Israeli media has reported that Egyptian and American security contractors have set up roadblocks leading to northern Gaza to monitor traffic and prevent terrorists from moving arms into the area. 'The likelihood of preventing small arms is very slim,' said Nuriel. 'However, the intention of these roadblocks is to prevent the transfer of large rockets or missiles—those can be detected by these companies.' As the fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas holds, Israel faces not only military challenges but also political ones. A government that pledged to dismantle Hamas will face immense pressure, both domestically and internationally, should it decide to resume military operations in Gaza. That pressure may prove to be an even greater challenge than the war itself.

3 Israelis, 5 Thais: This is what the hostage release will look l...	After 482 days, Arbel Yehud, Agam Berger, Gadi Mozes and 5 foreign workers are expected to leave this morning for freedom. Israel estimates: Hamas is interested in completing the next two phases, Thursday and Saturday, because of the importance of opening the Rafah crossing Eight hostages are spending thier last hours in the hell of Gaza. Arbel Yehoud , who was supposed to be released in one of the first two waves; Agam Berger, the last IDF observer left in the Strip; and Gadi Mozes , who celebrated his 80th birthday in captivity are the three Israeli hostages on the list of those to be released later Thursday morning, along with five abductees from Thailand, and according to Israeli estimates they will be released between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. However, preparations were made to receive them from early morning, in case Hamas decides to advance the release process. It is estimated that the release will take place from two different locations simultaneously. The assessment in Israel is that Hamas has an interest in completing the next two phases - Thursday and the one on Saturday, when three men are supposed to be released from captivity alive - because of the importance for them of opening the Rafah Crossing, which is supposed to open between Friday and Saturday, from the 14th day of the cease-fire. This crossing is supposed to allow 50 wounded Palestinians to pass through every day, in addition to three companions for each wounded person - and a total of 200 people every day, subject to approvals from the Shin Bet and Egypt. The agreement includes a clause stating that if Hamas wants to transfer children beyond this number, it will be possible to do so subject to Israeli approval - and it is estimated that Israel will not object. The Ministry of Health reported that the hostages who will be released today will arrive, after an initial medical assessment, at Ichilov, Sheba, Assaf Harofeh, and Beilinson hospitals. Barzilai and Soroka hospitals will be prepared to provide a response if there is a medical need for a non-emergency response. Agam Berger is expected to arrive at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva, where her four fellow observers who were released in the second phase of the deal were transferred. Gadi Mozes will likely be admitted to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv, and Arbel Yehoud to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer. The five Thais who will be released will arrive at Assaf Harofeh-Shamir Hospital in Tzirifin. The format for the releases is expected to be similar to the previous one: Hamas will inform the Red Cross representatives at the last minute of where to arrive and pick up the hostages in a way that will be recorded live by Arab television networks, in order to garner political, image, internal and international capital. The hostages will then be transferred from the Red Cross to special unit fighters in the area where the IDF remains on the Netzarim Corridor, and from there to the initial absorption facility in the Re'im camp in the center of the Gaza Strip for a basic medical examination. At the base, the hostages will be able to reunite with their immediate families, but their remaining relatives will wait for them in the hospitals to which they will be flown by Air Force helicopter for further examinations and treatment if necessary. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Medical Corps is preparing to provide Gadi Mozes with advanced treatment already at the Re'im camp, mainly due to his advanced age and in light of the fact that he survived a year and four months in harsh captivity conditions, which are certainly more evident on his body than in other hostages. Hamas did not announce the names of the five Thais who will be released, apparently due to concerns about mistaken identification, and their identities will only be announced at the crossing point. The Ethnic Restaurants Organization, together with the Abductees' Directorate at the Prime Minister's Office, will ensure that Thai food is sent for the Thai abductees who will be released today to the embassy staff who will accompany them. Ten of the 90 abductees still being held captive in the Gaza Strip are foreign citizens who were kidnapped from the surrounding kibbutzim. Eight of them are Thai citizens, most of whom came to Israel to support their families. Two more arrived in Israel from Nepal and Tanzania. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjo3yydu1g	2025-01-29T20:48:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/S1G5D6vuke/S1G5D6vuke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Qatar's Emir to visit Damascus on Thursday, Al Jazeera says	Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani will visit Damascus on Thursday, Qatar's Al Jazeera reported, as Syria's new interim government begins a political transition after Islamist rebels ousted the Assad regime last year. Qatar's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Qatar, a longtime supporter of the armed uprising against former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, had been lobbying Washington to issue a sanctions exemption allowing it to provide funding through official channels, the U.S. official and diplomat said. Earlier in January, Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani visited Damascus. Qatar will supply Syria with 200 megawatts of electricity, and plans to gradually increase supply, Thani said in a press conference in Damascus on Thursday. In December, Qatar said it would reopen its embassy in Damascus after more than 13 years, a week after Assad was removed from power. Qatar shut its embassy in July 2011 after withdrawing its ambassador in protest against Assad's deadly crackdown on demonstrators, violence that spiraled into a 13-year-long civil war.

CBS reported that 18 bodies were recovered from the Potomac River, where an American Airlines plane crashed after colliding with a military Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1yk0fdujg	2025-01-29T20:28:18-08:00	
Passenger plane carrying 64 crashes after colliding with an Army ...	American Airlines plane crashed into the Potomac River; Multiple bodies pulled from the water but no survivors had so far been found; 3 soldiers were in the Black Hawk helicopter which was on a training mission A jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided Wednesday with an Army helicopter while landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, prompting a large search-and-rescue operation in the nearby Potomac River. The Washington Post, citing sources, said multiple bodies had been pulled from the water. No survivors had so far been found, the newspaper reported. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on social media that 'we know there are fatalities,' though he did not say how many. Watch the footage of the collision, and the resulting fireball: All takeoffs and landings from the airport were halted as helicopters from law enforcement agencies across the region flew over the scene in search of survivors. Inflatable rescue boats were launched into the Potomac River from a point along the George Washington Parkway, just north of the airport, and first responders set up light towers from the shore to illuminate the area near the site of the collision. President Donald Trump said he had been 'fully briefed on this terrible accident' and, referring to the passengers, added, 'May God Bless their souls.' Some friends, family and relatives of passengers gathered at Reagan Washington National seeking more information. Police said multiple agencies were involved in a search and rescue operation in the Potomac River, which borders the airport. Dozens of police, ambulance and rescue units, some ferrying boats, staged along the river and raced to positions along the tarmac of Reagan airport. Live TV images showed several boats in the water, flashing blue and red lights. The Federal Aviation Administration said the midair crash occurred around 9 p.m. EST when a regional jet that had departed from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military helicopter on a training flight while on approach to an airport runway. It occurred in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over three miles south of the White House and the Capitol. Investigators will try to piece together the aircrafts' final moments before their collision, including contact with air traffic controllers as well as a loss of altitude by the passenger jet. American Airlines Flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet and a speed of about 140 miles per hour when it suffered a rapid loss of altitude over the Potomac River, according to data from its radio transponder. The Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet, manufactured in 2004, can be configured to carry up to 70 passengers. A few minutes before landing, air traffic controllers asked the arriving commercial jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33 at Reagan National and the pilots said they were able. Controllers then cleared the plane to land on Runway 33. Flight tracking sites showed the plane adjust its approach to the new runway. Less than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. The controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later: 'PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.' Seconds after that, the two aircraft collided. The plane's radio transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the river. Video from an observation camera at the nearby Kennedy Center showed two sets of lights consistent with aircraft appearing to join in a fireball. The collision occurred on a warm winter evening in Washington, with temperatures registering as high as 60 degrees Fahrenheit, following a stretch days earlier of intense cold and ice. On Wednesday, the Potomac River was 36 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The National Weather Service reported that wind gusts of up to 25 mph were possible in the area throughout the evening. The U.S. Army described the helicopter as a UH-60 Blackhawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. A crew of three soldiers were onboard the helicopter, an Army official said. The helicopter was on a training flight. The crash is serving as a major test for two of the Trump administration's newest agency leaders. Pete Hegseth, sworn in days ago as defense secretary, posted on social media that his department was 'actively monitoring' the situation that involved an Army helicopter. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, just sworn in earlier this week, said in a social media post that he was 'at the FAA HQ and closely monitoring the situation.' The airport was to remain closed until 5 a.m. Friday. Located along the Potomac River, just southwest of the city. Reagan National is a popular choice because it's much closer than the larger Dulles International Airport, which is deeper in Virginia. Depending on the runway being used, flights into Reagan can offer passengers spectacular views of landmarks like the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol. It's a postcard-worthy welcome for tourists visiting the city. The incident recalled the crash of an Air Florida flight that plummeted into the Potomac on January 13, 1982, that killed 78 people. That crash was attributed to bad weather. The last fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, including 45 passengers, 2 pilots and 2 flight attendants. Another person on the ground also died, bringing the total death toll to 50. An investigation determined that the captain accidentally caused the plane to stall as it approached the airport in Buffalo.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhtfydu1l	2025-01-29T20:25:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/Hy100WKOdkx/Hy100WKOdkx_1_34_800_451_0_small.jpg

An American Airlines regional passenger jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed into the Potomac River after a midair collision near Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night, officials said. There were 60 passengers and four crew members aboard the plane. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter, a U.S. official said. The Washington Post, citing sources, said multiple bodies had been pulled from the water. No survivors had so far been found, the newspaper reported. The U.S. Army said in a statement that it could 'confirm that the aircraft involved in tonight's incident was an Army UH-60 helicopter out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia. We are working with local officials and will provide additional information once it becomes available.' The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said a PSA Airlines CRJ700 regional jet collided midair with the helicopter while on approach to Reagan. PSA was operating Flight 5342 for American Airlines, which had departed from Wichita, Kansas, according to the FAA. The airport said late on Wednesday that all takeoffs and landings had been halted as emergency personnel responded to an aircraft incident.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkmulyo001e	2025-01-29T19:58:35-08:00

Among the most notable names on the list is Zakaria Zubeidi. As part of the deal, Israel will release 30 prisoners serving life sentences and 20 others with varying sentences in exchange for Berger. In return for Yehoud, 30 minors and female prisoners will be freed. For Mozes, Israel will release 30 prisoners, including 27 with varying sentences and three serving life terms. Notorious terrorists among those to be freed Zakaria Zubeidi – Arrested in 2019 for involvement in multiple shooting attacks near Beit El. In September 2021, he escaped from Gilboa Prison with five Islamic Jihad inmates but was recaptured five days later. He was sentenced to five years. Zubeidi previously served a lengthy prison term for commanding the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades in Jenin. Ismail Radaideh – A life-term prisoner and member of Fatah’s Force 17, he murdered Greek Orthodox monk Tsiboktakis Germanos in 2001 and planned an attack on Hebrew University. Mohammed Abu Warda – Responsible for the 1996 Jerusalem bus bombings on Route 18, which killed 44 people. He also orchestrated a deadly attack at an Ashkelon hitchhiking post that same year. He was sentenced to 48 life terms. Ashraf Abu-Srour – A Palestinian Authority member convicted of shooting and killing soldier Shahar Vekart near Rachel’s Tomb in 2000.

The IDF has conducted situation assessments and plans to tighten intelligence operations surrounding the event. So far, no prisoners released in the past week have been rearrested, and Israeli authorities are advising against immediate detentions, opting instead to monitor the situation over time. Meanwhile, hundreds of additional troops have been deployed to the West Bank to bolster both defensive and offensive operations. Military preparations include removing Palestinian flags from public spaces, setting up ambushes on roads leading to celebration sites, and, if necessary, conducting precise airstrikes near gathering areas as a warning. Should large-scale rallies take place, security forces are prepared to disperse them by force if operational conditions allow it and approval is granted. However, stopping the celebrations remains a challenge, particularly in densely packed cities like Ramallah, Nablus, and Bethlehem, where thousands of unarmed civilians, including children and the elderly, often participate. Such scenes are broadcast live across the Arab world, complicating Israeli efforts to intervene directly. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1iuzqooyl	2025-01-29T13:32:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/H1tOyPMukx/H1tOyPMukx_0_240_1280_721_0_small.jpg

How the IDF cracks down on online incitement	Established after Oct. 7 massacre, counter-incitement unit tracks social media activity, flags suspicious Facebook accounts and employs legal experts to prosecute offenders; 'We're seeing impact, but there’s still a lot of work to do' As part of the planned hostage deal, Israel is set to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners by the end of the week, many of whom will return to the West Bank. Despite efforts by the IDF's Central Command to curb celebrations, images of terrorists rejoicing continue to circulate online. A specialized counter-incitement unit, formed within Central Command at the outset of the war, has been at the forefront of efforts to combat public and online incitement. Led by military prosecutors in the West Bank Division, the unit operates in coordination with intelligence officers and operational teams under the command of Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth. In 2024, the unit has filed 303 indictments for incitement offenses. In comparison, the West Bank Military Prosecution typically filed 60 to 70 such cases per year in the past. During the 2015 wave of lone-wolf attacks, that number peaked at around 150. 'There is no doubt we've seen a surge,' a senior official in the West Bank prosecution said. 'Before the war, this issue fell through the cracks. It requires coordination between multiple agencies. Immediately after Oct. 7, we saw a sharp rise in online incitement, particularly among women, with people praising martyrs and glorifying Hamas' attack.' The official outlined the challenges of enforcement, explaining that legal complexities often make it difficult to define incitement. 'For example, someone wrote after Oct. 7, ‘a great and glorious act.’ On the surface, it looks like incitement, but it could be interpreted differently. We have to consider context and the use of certain phrases rather than just their literal meaning.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Investigators employ technological tools to track incitement but must go beyond simple screenshots. 'Once we detect incitement on a Facebook post, for instance, we need to ‘capture’ the entire page,' the official said. 'We scroll through past posts, gather as much evidence as possible to establish a pattern of incitement and link the page to a specific suspect. Then, we build an indictment under a defined legal provision.' To aid prosecutions, the military commander of Central Command issued a minimum sentencing order after the war began, mandating at least one year in prison for incitement, with at least six months served behind bars. Among those arrested by the counter-incitement unit were members of a Palestinian band called Al-Ibaa, which performed at various venues in the West Bank. According to an indictment, after Oct. 7, the student council at An-Najah University in Nablus invited one of the band's singers to perform at an event. The singer agreed to a payment of 4,000 shekels. When the band arrived in early May, they realized the event was a memorial for 'martyrs' and was decorated with Hamas flags. During the performance, the musicians sang, 'Advance, O Hamas, you strike fear into everyone. May God grant you victory.' In another case, prosecutors indicted a 50-year-old Palestinian woman from the village of Sanur in the northern West Bank for multiple inciting posts on social media. She allegedly shared an illustration of Hamas terrorists with the caption 'Al-Aqsa Flood'—the name Hamas gave to its Oct. 7 attack. In a separate post, she wrote, 'Tel Aviv is burning. Praise be to God. May God guide our army’s fire,' accompanied by a green heart—Hamas’ signature color. Israel’s counter-incitement efforts are expected to intensify as the war continues, with authorities closely monitoring online activity and taking legal action against those suspected of encouraging violence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjdh00yooyx	2025-01-29T12:49:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/yk14240678/yk14240678_0_162_425_240_0_small.jpg

October 7 massacre in Sderot: The security gaps that left civilia...	IDF probe reveals failures in Sderot’s 7/10 defense: alert squad left with handguns, long rifles taken before attack and police station battle diverting forces; while military takes blame, criticism also falls on local leadership In the coming weeks, the IDF is set to release a series of investigations into the October 7 Hamas attacks on communities in southern Israel, including those in the Gaza border region and the western Negev. The central theme emerging from these investigations is the military’s failure to defend Israeli communities, an assessment that has been widely acknowledged, with officials taking responsibility. However, following the release of findings regarding Kibbutz Be’eri, public outrage led the IDF to pause publication of additional reports. Despite this, newly appointed Defense Minister Israel Katz has instructed officials to accelerate the completion of the investigations, pushing for the release of outstanding findings. One of the most anticipated reports, now in its final stages, focuses on security failures in the town of Sderot. The investigation reveals significant lapses within the military, but also places blame on local authorities, including the Sderot Municipality and its security division. The report highlights the town's inability to respond effectively to the Hamas assault, despite having years of experience transitioning between routine and emergency situations due to ongoing security threats. On October 7, 22 members of Sderot’s civilian alert squad were present in the town. Unlike the armed security teams in other Gaza border communities, whose M-16 rifles had been confiscated per military orders, Sderot’s municipal security division voluntarily handed over its weapons to the Gaza Division, without any directive to do so. This decision was made unbeknownst to Mayor Alon Davidi, and after the handover, no one informed him that the alert squad had been left without automatic weapons. The rifles were stored in a military armory for an extended period. Although Gaza Division officials later recommended that the municipal security division retrieve the weapons and rearm the team, nothing was done due to concerns that the weapons could be stolen from members’ homes. As a result, when the October 7 attack began, alert squad members were left armed only with personal handguns, severely limiting their ability to engage the dozens of Hamas terrorists who stormed the town. The investigation also reveals that, prior to October 7, Sderot's longtime security chief, Kobi Harush, had resigned due to health reasons, and his successor, Ronen Gabay, had no prior security experience, having previously served as Mayor Davidi’s driver. Upon taking office, Gabay began the process of retrieving the weapons his predecessor had handed over, but the bureaucratic process dragged on. The delay was largely due to a requirement that emergency responders install safes in their homes to store the rifles—a costly process that lacked funding and clear oversight. Harush had stepped down in summer 2022 after being diagnosed with cancer and required to undergo life-saving treatments. Military protocol required him to return all weapons under his authority until a replacement was formally appointed on January 1, 2023. However, months of bureaucratic delays in the municipality stalled the official appointment, leaving no one authorized to sign for the weapons. Even when the alert squad was eventually approved for rearmament, bureaucratic obstacles resurfaced—this time over the lack of safes required for storing M-16 rifles, further delaying the process. Mayor learned of the shortage – on the day of the massacre Another critical finding from the investigation: Mayor Davidi was entirely unaware that members of the town’s alert squad lacked automatic weapons. He only discovered this fact on the day of the attack. The investigation further revealed that Sderot’s alert suqad had not undergone the required training and drills, which fall under the responsibility of the IDF. The town’s security coordinator, like all other security coordinators, operates under the IDF’s authority and works directly with it. Today, the situation in Sderot is different. Following the events of October 7, the town decided to establish a large security division. It is headed by Eran Guez, a retired IDF lieutenant colonel with a background in combat and intelligence, who has built a significant and efficient security framework for the residents. The security division has substantial budgets and personnel allocations. It also oversees the municipal supervision unit, managed by Tal Mehai, which consists of dozens of young inspectors, most of whom are veterans of IDF combat units. As part of the conclusions drawn from October 7, it was decided that the security coordinator’s role would now fall under the new head of the security division. This means that Gabay would report to Lt. Col. (res.) Guez. The two clashed repeatedly, mainly over authority issues, to the point of a complete breakdown in their relationship, including shouting matches in various forums. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ultimately, Mayor Davidi decided to remove Gabay from his position and conducted a hearing for him earlier this month. A process will now begin to find a new security coordinator. Gabay, however, intends to fight to keep his job and may take legal action. Gabay was seriously wounded on October 7 when he engaged the terrorists who had barricaded themselves inside the Sderot police station. Regarding that infamous battle, the investigation found that a large number of police forces arrived at the station but remained concentrated there, failing to spread out across the town or provide responses to other attack sites. The reason for this, it appears, is that officers had clearer situational awareness from their colleagues at the police station but were less informed about the other attack locations throughout the town. Many police officers in Sderot lost their lives defending the town, saving countless others. As in other communities near Gaza, the defenders of Sderot were heavily outgunned and outnumbered, similar to those in Kibbutz Be’eri and Kfar Aza. In Sderot alone, there were at least 11 active combat zones on October 7. Two of them are well known to the public: the battle at the police station and the horrific massacre of a group of pensioners on their way for a day trip to the Dead Sea. Why were the shelter doors locked? Another crucial issue raised in the investigation is the question—why did the doors of the town's public bomb shelters remain locked on the day of the massacre? This can be understood through the claims made by the victims' families. Recently, a massive lawsuit was filed in the Tel Aviv District Court by the families of the victims of the so-called 'Pensioners' Massacre' in Sderot, in which 13 elderly people were murdered in a Hamas ambush. The lawsuit, totaling NIS 12 million ($3.36 million), was filed by eight families of the victims, accusing the Sderot municipality and Motorola of severe negligence that led to the massacre due to a critical failure in the Gatekeeper smart shelter system. Thirteen senior citizens were murdered in that attack in Sderot while on their way to a spa day at the Dead Sea. At 6:30 a.m., as a massive rocket barrage began targeting the town, their minibus suffered a flat tire, leaving them stranded by the roadside near a municipal smart shelter. This smart shelter, operated by Motorola, was supposed to open automatically in emergencies and during an air raid siren. It was equipped with a heavy door that could be locked from the inside. However, when the elderly passengers attempted to enter, the system failed—the doors remained locked, and all attempts by both the victims and passing police officers to open them were unsuccessful. Minutes later, Hamas terrorists arrived in pickup trucks and slaughtered all 13 elderly individuals, who stood helpless and unprotected beside the locked shelter. Had the shelter doors opened, the lawsuit claims, the terrorists would have likely continued driving past without noticing the group, and their lives would have been spared. The lawsuit was filed by the families of the victims: Zinaida Beilin, Lyudmila Furman, Valery Friedman, Igor Kurtzer, Nadezhda Sprivchakov, Berta Shmiayev-Batsian, Michal Zerbailov and Lilia Giller. The IDF said in response: 'On October 7, the IDF failed in its mission. However, IDF soldiers, reservists, alert squads and civilians fought heroically throughout the Gaza border region. The findings presented in this article do not constitute an official IDF investigation. The IDF is conducting its own inquiry into the events of October 7 and their preceding circumstances, including the battle in Sderot. Once the investigation is completed, it will be transparently presented to the bereaved families, residents and subsequently, the public.' The Sderot Municipality stated: 'On October 7, members of the alert squad and the security coordinator fought bravely alongside IDF soldiers, police officers, commanders, reservists and civilians to stop the attack and save lives. The security coordinator, Ronen Gabay, was wounded by terrorist gunfire during the battle at the police station, was evacuated by medical teams and hospitalized. 'Regarding the alert squad—firstly, it is important to note that such teams are operated and overseen by the IDF. The IDF determines the number of team members in each community and is responsible for ensuring that all members are equipped with firearms, which unfortunately did not happen on the morning of October 7. 'Regarding the weapons issue—in August 2022, when the town's previous security coordinator completed his tenure, he decided to return the weapons to the army. The town's leadership was unaware of this, and from its perspective, the alert squad continued to operate as usual. After appointing a new security coordinator—a process that took several months—the alert squad was restructured and underwent several training sessions. 'As part of rebuilding the team, applications were submitted to the National Security Ministry to issue firearm licenses as required. However, the process was delayed because the previous security coordinator had failed to return the IDF-issued weapon storage facilities for team members’ homes. As a result, on October 7, alert squad members did not have long rifles but went out to fight with their handguns. 'Today, following the mayor’s directive and actions taken by the security division, the alert squad now includes over 100 members, all equipped with long rifles and full gear. 'Regarding the shelter near the library—a lawsuit has been filed in court by some of the victims' families, and therefore, we are unable to comment on the matter.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjglzmduyx	2025-01-29T12:29:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/07/r100iewCeT/r100iewCeT_128_1_615_347_0_small.jpg
Rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa appointed Syrian president, armed fa...	After 54 years of Assad family rule, Syria enters a new era with Ahmad al-Sharaa as transitional president; rebel factions unite to form a national army, pledging to rebuild the country and reshape its foreign policy and economy Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani), leader of Syria’s new administration, delivered a victory speech on Wednesday, marking his official appointment as the transitional president of Syria. The event was attended by prominent Syrian military faction leaders, the prime minister and several ministers from the caretaker government. According to a military source present at the closed-door meeting, attendees unanimously approved Sharaa's appointment as Syria’s transitional president, granting him authority to form a legislative council for the interim period. 'Months ago, Damascus appeared to me like a devoted mother, wounded and distressed, looking upon her children for salvation while bleeding and struggling with humiliation. But today, Syria rises with newfound dignity,' Sharaa said during his speech. 'We have broken the chains, liberated the oppressed and dusted off the humiliation that clouded Damascus. The sun of Syria shines anew as people chant in celebration of this monumental victory.' Sharaa emphasized that while wars typically bring destruction, Syria’s victory was characterized by 'mercy, justice and compassion.' He called for renewed determination to rebuild Syria, highlighting the need to restore state institutions, preserve civil peace and revive the country’s economy and international standing. The military source revealed that 18 armed factions agreed to dissolve themselves and integrate into the Defense Ministry to form a unified Syrian army. Among these groups were Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Jaysh al-Nasr and Jaysh al-Izza. Military commander Fadlallah al-Hajji described this as the 'beginning of a new era toward building a just nation for Syrians who have made tremendous sacrifices.' Commander Azzam al-Gharib highlighted the responsibility that comes with this victory, urging everyone to contribute to state-building efforts. Meanwhile, Ahmed Issa Sheikh stressed the importance of unity, compassion and collaboration in rebuilding Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Amir Sheikh echoed these sentiments, asserting that just as 'protests were the path to liberation, solidarity will be the way to reconstruction.' Commander Essam Buwidani reaffirmed his support for the new leadership, while Fahim Issa expressed confidence in Sharaa’s ability to lead Syria into a better future. Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani outlined Syria’s foreign policy under the new administration at the event. He emphasized a strategic, multifaceted approach to reassuring international partners, gaining new allies and representing Syrians domestically and abroad. He added: 'We have successfully crafted a new Syrian identity that embodies freedom, justice and dignity, laying the groundwork for a nation where all citizens feel a sense of belonging and pride.' Al-Shibani highlighted Syria’s commitment to regional peace, underlining its intention to strengthen Arab ties and forge strategic partnerships. He also noted that diplomatic efforts led to temporary suspensions of U.S. and European sanctions, fostering a favorable environment for economic recovery. Syrian political figure Firas al-Khalidi, head of the Cairo Platform for the Syrian Opposition, described Sharaa’s appointment as a 'natural consequence of his sacrifices and leadership.' He emphasized the need for capable leaders to steer Syria out of the chaos left by the Assad regime. Al-Khalidi also welcomed the dissolution of military factions, viewing it as a critical step toward establishing a state that respects its people and neighboring countries. 'The new administration is open to all Syrians, regardless of sect or affiliation, to contribute to nation-building,' al-Khalidi said, hailing this moment as a 'historic milestone.' Sharaa’s speech comes more than 50 days after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime and HTS's temporary administration of the country under a caretaker government dominated by Sharaa loyalists. Previously, Sharaa had announced plans to disband HTS and hinted that national elections could take up to four years, while drafting a new constitution may require around three years.

An Israeli airstrike killed a Palestinian terrorist in Jenin on Tuesday after he was spotted throwing an explosive device at Israeli forces, the military said on Wednesday. According to the IDF, an Air Force aircraft identified the suspect during an operation in the area. Within minutes, the terrorist was struck and eliminated. Following the strike, secondary explosions were observed at the scene, indicating the presence of additional explosives, which the military said were likely intended to target Israeli troops.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkujp100dyg	2025-01-29T09:04:43-08:00	
Israel presses Hamas for answers on fate of Shiri Bibas and her c...	Jerusalem demands clear, official answers on fate of Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, abducted on October 7; her husband, Yarden Bibas, kidnapped separately, expected to be released in future exchange As Israel prepares for the third phase of the hostage release deal on Thursday, officials have issued a renewed demand to Hamas, through mediators, for clear information on the fate of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir. After 481 days since the war began, Israeli authorities say their goal is to close the painful uncertainty surrounding the family and finally provide definitive information to their relatives. Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were expected to be released in earlier phases of the deal, as the agreement prioritizes women and children over military personnel. However, they were not freed in previous exchanges, and Hamas has now indicated that it will release three male hostages on Saturday instead. Meanwhile, Shiri's husband, Yarden Bibas, who was kidnapped separately during Hamas' October 7 attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, is expected to be released in the first stage of the deal, given what Israeli officials described as his humanitarian condition. The uncertainty surrounding the Bibas family has turned them into one of the most harrowing symbols of the October 7 hostage crisis. The IDF has previously said that there is grave concern for the fate of Shiri and her children, but no official confirmation has been provided regarding their condition. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Jimmy Miller, Shiri's cousin, spoke this week in an interview with Ynet, expressing the family’s anguish over the lack of information. 'What will we tell Yarden if he is freed before his wife and children?' Miller asked. 'What will we say to him? We have no words. These are difficult times—our worst nightmare.' Miller said that even the military officers assigned to assist the family have no concrete answers about their fate. 'We get bits and pieces of information, but nothing that gives us clarity. There is no certainty about anything. We hold on to a sliver of hope that we will see Shiri, the children and Yarden together, but everything is speculation. There is no official confirmation—even from the army—on what actually happened to them,' he said. Miller described the ongoing uncertainty as unbearable, saying that the family is desperate for closure. 'The officers assisting us don't know exactly what’s happening either. I just hope for some kind of surprise, that we will finally be able to breathe again. We are running out of air. This is a catastrophe, and I don’t know how much longer we can take it. We need to know what happened to Shiri and the children—we have to know,' he said. Miller also expressed concern over the psychological impact on Yarden if he is released without his family. 'If Yarden is freed without them, how will he cope? The mere thought of it is devastating,' he said. 'On one hand, we celebrate every hostage that returns. Each one is a world of their own, for their families and for us—we have all become one big family. But Shiri and the kids were supposed to be back already. They should have been here by now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkv4iyooje	2025-01-29T08:44:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/29/HyTTLaVST/HyTTLaVST_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The last lookout, a grieving sister and an 80-year-old survivor: ...	In first, Palestinian Islamic Jihad will release 2 hostages, Gadi Mozes and Arbel Yehoud, while Agam Berger, the last remaining lookout in captivity, will also be freed The third phase of the hostage release deal is set to take place Thursday morning, with the release of Gadi Mozes, 80, Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20. Mozes and Yehoud were both held by the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), marking the first time in the current deal that the terrorist group will release hostages in its custody. Gadi Mozes (80) Mozes was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, where his partner, Efrat Katz, was murdered. His ex-wife, Margalit Mozes, was also kidnapped but was freed in the first hostage release in November 2023. Nearly two months after the October 7 attack, Hamas released a proof-of-life video featuring Mozes alongside fellow hostage Elad Katzir. Reacting to the footage, his son Yair Mozes expressed deep concern: 'My father looks very thin. You can see he is exhausted. He is usually a very cheerful and lively person, but here, you can see the bags under his eyes—his physical condition is not good.' Born in Hadera, Mozes moved to Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza Strip about 60 years ago as part of a youth movement program. He worked in agriculture, eventually becoming a renowned agronomist who trained generations of farmers in the kibbutz and taught irrigation and crop cultivation courses worldwide, particularly in developing countries. His son Oded Mozes described him as an involved and supportive father and an active grandfather. 'He takes the grandchildren to the pool, on trips and teaches them about potatoes and carrots in the fields,' he said. Einav Mozes, Oded’s wife, shared the family's distress over the uncertainty surrounding his captivity. 'We know nothing about his condition in captivity, and that is one of the hardest things. Someone you love so much, and you have no idea what’s happening to him,' she told Ynet. 'You try to push away intrusive thoughts, but you can’t. Did he even get a piece of flatbread today? He suffers terribly from the cold—was he given a blanket? In the heat, does he have enough water? Is he sleeping on the floor? Are they abusing him? Just being there is already abuse, but how are they treating him? What does he know? What doesn’t he know? A million thoughts, and you’re not there with him. The thought of him being alone in this situation is unbearable.' Arbel Yehoud (29) Yehoud was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz along with her partner, Ariel Cunio, during the October 7 attack. Her brother, Dolev, left his home that morning to help treat the wounded. After eight months of uncertainty, his body was finally discovered in the kibbutz. A lifelong space enthusiast, Yehoud developed a passion for astronomy after watching Star Trek as a child. In recent years, she worked at a technology, science and space center in the Eshkol Regional Council. Her mother describes her as 'endlessly energetic, sensitive and full of life.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Her father, Yehiel Yehoud, spoke at the Knesset, directing an emotional message to his daughter: 'Do not break, my love, the soul of our family. We love you and are waiting for you. My child, did you sleep last night? Do your captors beat you? What do they demand of you in exchange for a piece of bread? Are you terrified by the sounds of war? I beg you, my daughter, to stay optimistic because you will return to us, just as you were taken from us.' Under the original terms of the hostage deal, the first groups to be released were female civilian captives. Yehoud was initially slated to be freed in the first or second phase, but due to what Hamas called 'technical issues,' her release was postponed. Instead, Hamas prioritized the release of four female military lookouts—Naama Levy, Liri Albag, Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev. In response, Israel refused to open the Netzarim Corridor for humanitarian movement. Following mediation efforts, an agreement was reached to secure Yehoud’s release on Thursday. As part of the deal, the Netzarim Corridor was reopened, allowing hundreds of thousands of Gazans to return to northern Gaza. Agam Berger (20) Berger, a resident of Holon, was abducted from the Nahal Oz outpost just two months after enlisting in the IDF, where she served as a military lookout. In footage from the October 7 attack, Berger is seen with blood-stained face, though it remains unclear whether she was injured or if the blood belonged to fellow soldiers who were murdered in the shelter beside her. She is the last Nahal Oz lookout still in captivity, following the November 2023 rescue of Ori Magidish and the recovery of Noa Marciano’s body, after she was executed by her captors. This past Saturday, four additional lookouts—Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Daniella Gilboa—were freed. Berger is the daughter of Shlomi and Merav and has a twin sister, Li-Yam, as well as two brothers, Bar and Ilay. A talented violinist, she volunteers with special-needs populations. Her family describes her as strong-willed, outspoken and a fierce advocate for justice. On November 26, on her father’s birthday, freed hostage Agam Goldstein-Almog called him and relayed a message: 'I was with your Agam in captivity, and she asked me to wish you a happy birthday.' Other released hostages said Berger remained steadfast in her beliefs while in captivity, reciting blessings over food and refusing to light fire on the Sabbath. After viewing the full video of his daughter’s abduction, Berger’s father, Shlomi, shared his devastation: 'I had already seen the end of the video on October 8, but watching it in full closed the circle. The sheer number of terrorists on an IDF base—their indifference—they casually ate, smoked, prayed. Nothing threatened them. They came in, kidnapped, murdered and then laughed. Where was the IDF? Where was the State of Israel?' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rygn9cv00ye	2025-01-29T08:18:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/S1G5D6vuke/S1G5D6vuke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu meets with US envoy Witkoff in Jerusalem	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, at his office in Jerusalem on Wednesday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1yqtcvoje	2025-01-29T07:38:01-08:00	
Netanyahu heads to US on Sunday – when will he meet Trump?	PM to depart for Washington next week as first foreign leader to visit White House during Trump’s second term; Netanyahu scheduled to return to Israel on Thursday A day after receiving an official invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released on Wednesday his itinerary for his upcoming trip to Washington. Netanyahu, the first foreign leader to visit the White House during Trump’s second term, is set to depart for Washington early Sunday morning. Two days later, he will meet with the president in the Oval Office and is scheduled to return to Israel on Thursday. In a statement sent to reporters, officials emphasized that the schedule is still subject to change, noting, 'A final itinerary has not yet been confirmed. An updated schedule will be provided on Sunday before departure.' Netanyahu’s visit comes exactly two weeks after Trump’s second inauguration. According to the preliminary schedule, Netanyahu is not expected to testify next week in his ongoing trial in Israel and has sought court approval to postpone the hearings. On Tuesday, reports emerged that Trump is expected to host Netanyahu for a formal White House dinner. Sources close to the prime minister said his wife, Sara Netanyahu, will accompany him and return to Israel with him on the state aircraft Wing of Zion. In the official invitation, Trump wrote, 'I look forward to discussing ways to achieve peace for Israel and its neighbors, as well as our joint efforts to confront shared adversaries.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Israel on Wednesday. As part of his visit, he toured the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza and held preparatory talks ahead of the second phase of a planned agreement set to take effect 42 days after its initial implementation. Israeli officials have voiced concerns over Qatar’s potential influence on Witkoff due to his extensive past business ties with the Gulf nation. In 2023, Qatar purchased the iconic Park Lane Hotel in New York for $623 million from a real estate group led by Witkoff, which had owned the property for a decade. The deal was seen as a financial lifeline for the developer, who was facing challenges in maintaining ownership of the hotel. Senior Israeli officials, speaking privately, have expressed fears that Witkoff’s close relationship with Qatari officials could allow them to sway his positions. At the same time, they acknowledge his deep personal connection to Israel and strong understanding of its security needs. There are also growing concerns in Jerusalem over Qatar’s potential influence on Trump and his inner circle. Qatar’s role is expected to be critical as negotiations resume for the second phase of the hostage deal, set to begin on day 16 of the ceasefire agreement next week. Israeli leaders are preparing for the talks, though several cabinet ministers remain skeptical about their success. Some are convinced that negotiations will ultimately collapse, leading Israel to resume military operations. They cite Hamas' likely refusal to accept Jerusalem’s key demands, which include the demilitarization of Gaza, the expulsion of the terror group’s leadership and Hamas’ exclusion from post-war governance in the enclave. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkiwwtvu1l	2025-01-29T07:25:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SJb7A72vJe/SJb7A72vJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US president to sign executive order to combat antisemitism, pledging to deport non-citizen students and resident aliens who participated in pro-Palestinian protests and directing Justice Department to prosecute anti-Jewish threats and violence U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Wednesday to combat antisemitism and pledge to deport non-citizen college students and other resident aliens who took part in pro-Palestinian protests, a White House official said. A fact sheet on the order said Trump would order the Justice Department to 'aggressively prosecute terroristic threats, arson, vandalism and violence against American Jews.' 'To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,' Trump said in the fact sheet. 'I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.' According to the New York Post, the order directs federal agencies to submit policy recommendations to the White House within 60 days and mandates the Justice Department to investigate cases of pro-Hamas graffiti on college campuses. During his election campaign, Trump vowed to deport 'Hamas supporters' from U.S. universities, a pledge he reiterated in a May 2023 rally. 'When I am president, we will not allow violent extremists to take over our campuses. If you come here from another country and try to bring jihadism, anti-Americanism or antisemitism to our universities—we will deport you immediately,' he said at the time. Trump has also pledged to prioritize combating discrimination on campuses, particularly cases of antisemitism, and to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs focused on gender identity and racial equity. Within his first days in office, he ordered the removal of DEI initiatives from all federal agencies. White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt announced Tuesday that Trump will soon sign an additional executive order on education, which will include cutting federal funding to institutions that promote curricula blaming the U.S. for systemic racism. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1hoxapojx	2025-01-29T07:19:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/09/rJ63Ithbkg/rJ63Ithbkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Lebanese media reports Israeli airstrikes hit Farah City amusement park in Nabatieh, injuring 4; IDF says strikes targeted Hezbollah truck and vehicle transporting weapons; Hezbollah lawmaker condemns attack as 'ongoing Israeli threat' Lebanese media reported Tuesday that Israeli airstrikes targeted two locations in southern Lebanon, including an amusement park. The first strike hit Nabatieh al-Fawqa, where 20 people were reportedly injured in an attack on a pickup truck. The second strike, according to reports, hit the Farah City amusement park, located along a nearby road, injuring four people. The amusement park, which had reopened in December after a temporary closure due to the war, has been an active recreational site. Posts on its Facebook page in recent days included messages such as: 'The best outing for the best kids' and 'There’s nothing better than the laughter of children filling Farah City with life and joy.' Another post read: 'Turn the first day of the week into something special with games and surprises!' Videos shared online showed the aftermath of the strikes, including damage to the amusement park complex. While the park is a civilian site frequented daily by children, reports indicated that Hezbollah continued to operate in the area or use it as a base. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Mohammad Raad, head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, condemned the airstrikes, calling them 'yet another example of the constant and ongoing threat posed by Israel against our people, our land and the security and stability of all nations in the region.' He accused the international community of enabling Israeli actions through its silence, adding that Hezbollah has the right to 'confront Israeli aggression to safeguard Lebanon’s security and sovereignty.' The IDF did not directly address reports of a strike on the amusement park. However, the military said Tuesday that Israeli Air Force aircraft targeted a truck and another vehicle belonging to Hezbollah in the areas of Shaqif and Nabatieh, both of which were 'transporting weapons' and had been monitored by Israeli forces. 'The IDF is determined to continue operating in accordance with understandings between Israel and Lebanon, despite Hezbollah’s attempts to return to southern Lebanon.

Egypt's Sisi rejects proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza	Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi on Wednesday dismissed a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump to relocate Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to neighboring countries as part of its reconstruction efforts. 'The expulsion and displacement of the Palestinian people is an injustice in which we cannot take part,' Sisi said.

Israel waits to learn identity of 3rd hostage that will be releas...	Israel expects to receive the list of hostages to be released on Thursday from Hamas today, ahead of the expected release of Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and another hostage who has not yet been named; Trump's envoy to the Middle East arrived in Gaza and will also meet with Netanyahu in Israel for discussions on the second phase of the deal and Saudi Arabia relations A day before the scheduled release of Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and another hostage - a man who is still alive, Israel is on high alert ahead of the transfer of the names from Hamas. According to the agreement, the terrorist organization is supposed to transfer on Wednesday the list of names of the hostages who will be released Thursday. In Israel; the families of the hostages are waiting with great anticipation to discover the name of the third hostage who will be released, assuming Hamas complies with the deal. Throughout the week it has been assumed that the hostage who will be released Thursday alongside Agam Berger and Arbel Yehoud is American-Israeli citizen Keith Siegel, partly due to a news report on NBC. However, there is no absolute certainty regarding the identity of the third hostage that Hamas will release as part of the 'special' phase added to the agreement, as part of resolving the crisis of Arbel Yehoud's non-release and Israel's insistence on not withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza until her release was arranged. Another release is expected on Saturday, in which three living men are expected to be freed. Meanwhile, ahead of the opening of negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire deal - which is supposed to begin on the 16th day of the cease-fire according to the agreement, Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, arrived in Israel Wednesday and will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after visiting the Gaza Strip. Witkoff came to Israel from Saudi Arabia, where he was negotiating a comprehensive deal for the Middle East, which would include the implementation of the second phase of the cease-fire, the reconstruction of Gaza, and a path to normalization with Riyadh. On Wednesday morning, the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed claimed that Witkoff had pledged to Netanyahu in a meeting they held before the cease-fire was announced to stall the reconstruction of the northern Gaza Strip and to postpone the entry of caravans there, until an agreement is reached on 'plans that will provide security for the communities surrounding Gaza,' according to the report. The Qatari newspaper reported that the U.S. has formulated a plan that includes security projects that will ensure that Gaza will not pose a future threat to Israel. It was also reported that the U.S. commitments were intended to push Netanyahu to continue with the agreement, and to push Gazans to leave the strip for other countries by blocking and slowing the reconstruction of the northern Gaza Strip, and making the area uninhabitable for the long term. The report has no confirmation from another source. Meanwhile, crowds of Gazans continue to make their way to the northern Gaza Strip. Very long traffic jams were recorded on Salah ad-Din Street, the length of the Gaza Strip, from its center to the checkpoint set up for cars on the Netzarim Corridor. According to Palestinian reports, 50 vehicles are entering the checkpoint per hour. Trump's intention to remove the residents of the Gaza Strip in order to rebuild it continues to cause a stir in the Arab world. According to the Wall Street Journal, Egypt and Jordan - the countries where the American president intends to house those Palestinians - have joined Saudi Arabia in talks on an emergency meeting of the Arab League, at which the member states will present public opposition to the plan, and apply pressure on it to 'change direction,' according to Arab sources quoted in the report.

Trump's plan for the Palestinians: Viable or unrealistic?	Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon: 'Trump is showing that he is really thinking outside the box' Is U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to relocate Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt viable? According to former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon, it may not be as far-fetched as it seems. Ayalon told ILTV News that while the idea has faced strong pushback from Jordan, the concern is that an influx of Palestinians could destabilize the kingdom. 'About 80% of Jordanians are Palestinians,' Ayalon explained. 'Certainly, King Abdullah wouldn’t want them to be there and take over, as they have tried before.' As for Egypt, Ayalon noted that while the Sinai Peninsula is vast and could temporarily accommodate Palestinians, Egypt would not agree to such a move without Palestinian approval. 'Trump is showing that he is really thinking outside the box,' Ayalon said. 'He is thinking like a constructor, a real estate guy—given this chaotic situation in Gaza and the rubble, you cannot really build with all this population, so it would be easier to move them out and back.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmqwjduyx	2025-01-29T03:42:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/S12zNFDuyg/S12zNFDuyg_0_146_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Miri Eisin says what Hamas wants to do is control how Israelis feel, to scare the citizens The victory for the Hamas terrorist organization is that it still exists, according to Col. (Res.) Miri Eisin, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. Eisin told ILTV News that for Hamas, victory is not measured by the number of fighters killed or weapons destroyed but by whether it maintains authority in the Gaza Strip. 'What they want to control is how we feel, and that scares us,' Eisin said. She explained that Hamas no longer has the heavy weapons it once did, meaning it cannot carry out a coordinated, multi-pronged attack like on October 7.

UNRWA Lebanon says not impacted by US aid freeze or new Israeli l...	The director of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon said on Wednesday that the agency had not been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's halt to U.S. foreign aid funding or by an Israeli ban on its operations. UNRWA currently is not receiving any U.S. funding so there is no direct impact of the more recent decisions related to the U.N. system for UNRWA,' Dorothee Klaus told reporters at UNRWA's field office in Lebanon. U.S. funding to UNRWA was suspended last year until March 2025 under a deal reached by U.S. lawmakers and after Israel accused 12 of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza of participating in the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the Gaza war. The U.N. has said it had fired nine UNRWA staff who may have been involved and said it would investigate all accusations made.

F-35 jet crashes, explodes in ball of fire | See the explosion	Crash in front of cameras at Alaska Air Force base: Initial investigation indicates that pilot encountered 'inflight malfunction' during training flight and was forced to eject Extraordinary footage emerged from Alaska early Wednesday morning of a U.S. Air Force F-35 jet crashing during a training flight and explodes in a ball of fire. The pilot on board managed to bail out before hitting the ground, and is seen in the background plummeting to safety. According to the US Air Force, the crash at Eielson Air Force Base occurred during the landing process, after the pilot encountered some kind of 'inflight malfunction.' After falling to the ground, the pilot was taken to receive medical treatment, and his condition was described as stable. The crash caused 'significant damage' to the plane and that there will be a 'a thorough investigation in hopes to minimize the chances of such occurrences from happening again.'

Hezbollah hands over to Lebanese army huge tunnel complex reveale...	The Imad 4 underground complex included trucks, motorcycles, and the ability to launch missiles; Reports in the Arab world and in Lebanon, said when the Lebanese army received the facility from the terrorist organization it was emptied of heavy equipment; The Lebanese army entered a huge underground facility that Hezbollah revealed during the war, which contains large tunnels through which trucks can also travel, media outlets in Lebanon and around the Arab world began reporting Tuesday evening. The Imad 4 facility, as presented by Hezbollah in August before the exploding pager operation and the shake-up that the terrorist organization experienced with the elimination of its senior figures, was equipped with computers, lighting, and a size and depth that also allows motorcycles to pass through. The Al-Arabiya channel reported Tuesday night, citing sources, that the Lebanese army entered the facility located in southern Lebanon, but that it was emptied of heavy equipment before the army entered. The Lebanese Al-Jadeed channel also reported the entry of Lebanese army personnel and, according to reports, the facility was handed over to them more than a week ago. According to the same report, the facility is located between the villages of Joya and Itit in the area of ​​the city of Tyre. Footage published by Hezbollah at the time revealed a long, illuminated Hezbollah underground labyrinth, with retractable missile launch platforms underground. The Al-Mayadeen network affiliated with the terrorist organization reported at the time that 'the video shows the secrecy maintained around the location of Hezbollah's missile capabilities. The facility is located deep underground, far from hostile intelligence capabilities and also provides protection against hostile targets.' A year ago, an extensive article about Hezbollah tunnels was published in the French newspaper Libération - where it claimed that the terrorist organization had dug hundreds of kilometers of tunnels carved into rock over more than 30 years, some of them 40 meters to 80 meters deep. The investigation found that the tunnels are more sophisticated and dangerous than those in Gaza, and that blowing up some of them could cause an earthquake or landslides.

Netanyahu 'hero' among young Iranians: Author in hot water follow...	An Iranian political commentator and author finds himself in legal trouble following impromptu remarks he made in Qatar, in which he said younger Iranians are more distrustful of Palestinians and increasingly view the Israeli premier as a 'hero', prompting Tehran’s prosecutor to file a criminal complaint Tehran’s prosecutor has filed a criminal complaint against Sadegh Zibakalam, an Iranian political commentator and author, over recent statements that praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as 'baseless,' Iranian news agency Tasnim reported on Tuesday. Zibakalam, who has a history of similar convictions, is facing new legal trouble, reportedly due to comments he made at a conference in Qatar. There, he claimed that younger Iranians view Netanyahu as a 'hero.' 'You would be shocked by the number of Iranians who despise the Palestinians since October 7. What happened to the sympathy? It’s gone,' Zibakalam, a staunch supporter of the Iranian regime, said at the Qatar conference. 'If someone had told me, Sadegh, a day would come when Iranians would hate the Palestinians and praise Netanyahu – of all people – as a hero, I would have thought they were out of their minds. I would have thought they were speaking nonsense and didn’t understand Iranians at all. But I’ve seen it with my own eyes over the past 15 months. I’ve witnessed the levels of hatred among the young Iranian generation toward the Palestinians and their perception of Netanyahu as a hero.' During the conference, he also touched on the U.S. elections, saying, 'If someone had told me that Iranians would dream of a Donald Trump victory – a man who is against women, Arabs, immigrants, and Black people – I would have responded, 'You don’t know Iranians.' But I’ve seen with my own eyes what has unfolded over the past 15 months.' Zibakalam, has previously faced legal trouble for remarks deemed problematic. However, his controversial statements often align with the regime’s narrative. In recent years, he has been accused of spreading fake news and unsubstantiated content on social media, leading to several lawsuits against him. He was previously sentenced to 18 months in prison and banned from political activity in both physical and virtual spaces for two years due to 'propaganda activities against the regime.' In another case, he was sentenced to one year in prison, and in a third, where he was accused of publishing 'false information,' his sentence was reduced to six months following an appeal to Iran’s Supreme Court. Currently, he is reportedly out of prison due to health reasons. Beni Sabti, a researcher at the Iran Program of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), explains that Zibakalam is considered someone who helps preserve the Iranian regime, ensuring it does not weaken or become less conservative. According to Sabti, Zibakalam's remarks at the Qatar conference were misinterpreted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: So why has he been charged now, despite being a regime supporter? 'Because he aired the regime's dirty laundry,' Sabti explains. 'There are things you simply don’t say publicly. Even if people in Iran criticize the weak economy, they’re thrown in jail for exposing these issues externally. You’re not allowed to present the Iranian regime as weak, flawed, or ineffective, nor can you suggest that its enemies are admired.' Sabti notes that Zibakalam’s portrayal of Netanyahu as 'admired' is particularly problematic because it undermines Iranian propaganda. 'At the same conference, he also said that Hamas has managed to stand up to Israel heroically and with strength,' Sabti adds. 'He didn’t only talk about Netanyahu.' Sabti further described Zibakalam as 'unreliable,' claiming that in the 1980s, Zibakalam was involved in hanging regime opponents and overseeing the execution of Kurds. According to Sabti, Zibakalam’s statements, in some ways, serve the Iranian regime. 'Every time there’s trouble for him, it’s dismissed,' Sabti says. 'He acts as a shield for the regime. He makes grand statements that sound appealing, so people think there are 'good Iranians' within the regime and that dialogue with them is possible. This lures the West. The Iranians play games with headlines and appearances.' Sabti believes this is why Zibakalam was allowed to speak in Qatar and remains out of prison. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkezcuw00yl	2025-01-29T00:10:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/01/SyY0GtKCR/SyY0GtKCR_0_0_434_255_0_small.jpg

World shocked as Trump insists on idea of forced Palestinian relo...	Trump’s proposal to move Palestinians from Gaza to Jordan, Egypt, or other nations has drawn global criticism; Fierce opposition from these countries highlights fears of destabilization, while analysts warn of the plan’s impracticality and potential long-term security risks No longer is the concept of forced emigration of Palestinians from Gaza confined to Israeli far-right circles. With President Trump's full-throated endorsement, issued with the backing of the presidential seal, it is now firmly implanted within the realm of mainstream political thought. Trump has proposed the relocation of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the devastated Gaza Strip during the long reonstruction– a suggestion that has sparked astonishment globally and fierce opposition from the nations he named as potential destinations: Jordan and Egypt. Other countries mentioned in reports, such as Albania and Indonesia, have also strongly denied any agreement to accept refugees under such a plan. Trump first unveiled his proposal late Saturday night, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. He described Gaza as a 'massive demolition site' and declared that to rebuild it, its residents should be relocated to Jordan or Egypt. He suggested this could even serve as a long-term solution, saying: 'We’re talking about moving 1.5 million people and simply clearing out the entire area.' Despite vehement opposition from Jordan and Egypt, Trump reiterated his stance the following night, claiming to have discussed the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi after an earlier conversation with Jordan’s King Abdullah. However, an Egyptian official quickly denied such a conversation between Trump and Sisi had even taken place. 'I wish he’d take some of them,' Trump said about the Egyptian president. 'We help Egypt a lot, and I’m sure he can help us. He’s my friend.' Trump added, 'El-Sisi is in a very tough part of the world, to be honest. As they say – it’s a rough neighborhood. But I think he can do it.' While Israeli right-wing leaders have rushed to embrace the idea – Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich even promised to draft a practical plan for implementing Palestinian emigration – the fierce resistance from Palestinians themselves, alongside opposition from Jordan and Egypt, makes the proposal appear unfeasible. Furthermore, it remains unclear how committed Trump is to advancing the plan. Even his close ally, pro-Israel Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, expressed significant skepticism, saying in a CNN interview, 'I don’t know what he’s talking about,' and dismissing the idea as 'not very practical.' Publicly, Egypt and Jordan justify their opposition with pro-Palestinian statements, but both regimes, in Cairo and Amman, are primarily concerned about the threats such a move would pose to their own stability. Hassan al-Hassan, a researcher at the Bahrain Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN that both governments would face 'widespread domestic resistance' if their citizens perceived them as complicit in a 'second Palestinian Nakba.' He added that since Gaza’s residents would not agree to leave voluntarily, any forced relocation to Egypt or Jordan would create 'a variety of existential threats' for those countries. The fierce resistance from Palestinians themselves, alongside opposition from Jordan and Egypt, makes the proposal appear unfeasible Egypt, already grappling with severe economic challenges, fears that absorbing large numbers of Gazan refugees would further destabilize the country. With over 100 million people – many of whom live in poverty – Egypt’s economy has only worsened during the Gaza war. Houthi attacks in the Red Sea disrupted shipping through the Suez Canal on one end, and the strait of Bab al-Mandab on the other, exacerbating the situation. According to the UN, Egypt is already hosting 877,000 refugees, most of whom are not from Gaza. However, estimates suggest that around 100,000 Gazans entered Egypt during the war, despite the government’s official stance against 'the displacement of Palestinians.' Another concern for Egypt is the potential infiltration of terrorist elements into the Sinai Peninsula under the guise of accepting refugees. Sisi’s regime has long battled jihadist militants in Sinai, and the government views Gaza’s residents, particularly Hamas, as aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood – a group outlawed in Egypt. Security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted, 'Hamas, a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, is something the Egyptians prefer to keep on the other side of the high fence along the Philadelphi Corridor inside Gaza – not on their territory.' Sisi has repeatedly expressed his staunch opposition to the migration of Gazans into Egypt throughout the war. As early as October 2023, shortly after Hamas’ October 7 terror attack, Sisi declared that 'the solution to the Palestinian issue will not come at Egypt’s expense. The solution is not displacement, but justice and the Palestinians’ right to self-determination.' He even suggested that, if Israel insists on evacuating Palestinians from Gaza, it should move them to the Negev. Following Trump’s recent statements, senior Egyptian officials have reiterated their opposition. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel-Atti stated yesterday, 'Egypt rejects any displacement of Palestinians, whether temporary or long-term.' Jordan has similarly maintained its firm opposition to any relocation of Palestinians, with officials in Amman repeatedly emphasizing this stance in recent months. While Egypt fears the displacement of Gazans into its territory, Jordan is primarily concerned about the relocation of Palestinians from the West Bank. In November 2023, Jordanian Prime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh declared, 'Any attempt to displace Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank is a red line – and will be considered a declaration of war.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following Trump’s remarks, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi reiterated this position two days ago, stating that 'Jordan is for Jordanians, Palestine is for Palestinians, and the solution to the Palestinian issue lies on Palestinian soil, where their independent state must be established. No to displacement. Not only because it is a historic and consistent national position for Jordan, but also because any attempt to uproot Palestinians from their land will destabilize security and stability and will not bring peace. The Palestinian issue cannot be solved at Jordan’s expense.' Jordan also fears that absorbing large numbers of Palestinians would destabilize the delicate balance of power between its Bedouin tribes and its 2.39 million registered Palestinian refugees. The arrival of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands more could upset this balance. Jordan, like Egypt, is already economically strained, having absorbed large numbers of Syrian refugees during the civil war. The addition of Gazan refugees would further burden its fragile economy. Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, noted that the cost of absorbing so many refugees would be so high for Egypt and Jordan that even U.S. aid would not suffice. Al-Hassan, the Bahraini researcher, warned, 'Neither Egypt nor Jordan can afford to take in millions of additional refugees.' He also cautioned that the influx of refugees could create future security risks, as their presence in Egypt and Jordan might lead to attacks against Israel. 'By seeking to empty Gaza of its Palestinian residents, Trump is serving the fanatics on Israel’s far right,' Al-Hassan accused. 'Ironically, his proposal, if implemented, would be self-defeating,' he argued, warning that destabilizing Jordan and Egypt could empower Islamist forces like the Muslim Brotherhood, which 'would be far less friendly to Israel and more sympathetic to Hamas.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqqcbp00kx	2025-01-28T23:11:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/rJnzHo8uJx/rJnzHo8uJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Australian police say foiled antisemitic attack involving explosi...	Australian police said on Wednesday they had foiled a planned antisemitic attack after discovering a caravan containing explosives in an outer Sydney suburb in New South Wales state. The caravan was discovered on Jan. 19 in Dural, a suburb some 36 kms (22 miles) northwest of the centre of Sydney, Deputy Police Commissioner David Hudson told a news conference. 'That caravan contained an amount of explosives and some indication that those explosives might be used in some form of antisemitic attack,' he told a news conference. The threat had been fully contained and there is no further threat to the Jewish community, he added. Hudson said arrests had been made but did not disclose how many or what the charges were.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1jx6iwuyg	2025-01-28T22:48:11-08:00	
Republican Congresswoman's bill, supported by Trump, would rename...	Rep. Claudia Tenney, who led efforts earlier this year to introduce the ‘Recognizing Judea and Samaria Act,’ confirmed last week that she plans to revive the legislation, which is backed by Trump A bill aiming to redefine the language used to describe the disputed territories between Israel and Jordan will be reintroduced in the U.S. Congress this month. Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY), who led efforts earlier this year to introduce the 'Recognizing Judea and Samaria Act,' confirmed last week that she plans to revive the legislation. The proposed bill seeks to officially refer to the area commonly known as the West Bank as 'Judea and Samaria.' Tenney also revealed that U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged his support, bolstering the bill’s chances of advancement. 'We need to make sure that we don’t allow the language, the tradition, the history of Israel, to be weaponized by terms like ‘West Bank,’' Tenney told a room of hundreds last week at the re-launch party of the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus. The proposed legislation mandates that all official documents referring to the region currently known as the West Bank instead use the term 'Judea and Samaria.' Senator Tom Cotton will also reintroduce a parallel bill in the Senate. 'President Trump has said this is going to be a very priority task for him to get this done,' Tenney said. 'It’s the beginning of us shifting the language, and what we’re doing and making sure that we always protect the historical homeland of the Jews, and that is in Israel, and Israel includes Judea and Samaria.' Jordan, which controlled the area from 1949 to 1967, introduced the term 'West Bank' as a geographical designation; the area was named for its location west of the Jordan River. However, the region – historically known as Judea and Samaria – has been central to the identity and heritage of the Jewish people for thousands of years. After Israel regained control of the territory in 1967, it was officially known as the Judea and Samaria region, which aligns with the names of the biblical kingdoms of Judea and Samaria. Despite this historical connection, many governments worldwide continue to use the term West Bank. 'Calling it Judea and Samaria ignores the basic reality of 3.5 million people who are not Jews and living in the West Bank,' said Middle East analyst Gershon Baskin, who is in opposition to the proposed bill. 'That reality does not change with linguistics.' Elias Baboun, peace initiator of the Palestine Land Peace Plan and a resident of Bethlehem, said changing the name to Judea and Samaria is not the main issue. 'What truly matters is achieving justice and equality for all the people in the region,' he told The Media Line. 'The name may have historical and symbolic significance, but it remains a secondary matter compared to the larger issue of equal rights.' Supporters of Israel argue that the 'West Bank' terminology seeks to delegitimize Israel’s presence in the region. 'The Israeli people have an undeniable and indisputable historical and legal claim over Judea and Samaria, and at this critical moment in history, the United States must reaffirm this,' Tenney said in a statement in May, shortly after she initially introduced the legislation. 'This bill reaffirms Israel’s rightful claim to its territory. I remain committed to defending the integrity of the Jewish state and fully supporting Israel’s sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.' Cotton echoed this sentiment in December when he first introduced the bill. 'The Jewish people’s legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria go back thousands of years,' Cotton said. 'The U.S. should stop using the politically charged term ‘West Bank’ to refer to the biblical heartland of Israel.' According to Israel Ganz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, 'People still use terms like West Bank, like it’s nowhere, and it’s not part of the State of Israel.' He said that using a term like 'West Bank' causes people to 'forget this is the biblical land. We want it to be called ‘Judea and Samaria.’ We also want to apply Israeli sovereignty over this ancient, historical Jewish place.' Noor Dahri, executive director of the UK-based Islamic Theology of Counter Terrorism think tank, seconded Ganz’s sentiments. He said that if the legislation moves forward, 'it would be another milestone after moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. The original name of the area is Judea and Samaria, which was later turned into the West Bank, which I believe was a direct attack on Jewish history.' He called the term West Bank 'a successful act to erase the Jewish geographical evidence' and a 'form of antisemitism.' Even Baboun admitts that 'Jews face significant challenges in freely practicing their religious rituals at holy sites in areas under Palestinian control.' He emphasized that access to Jewish religious sites like the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron is highly restricted for Jews. 'These restrictions contrast with the rights that Palestinians enjoy at the same sites,' Baboun added. Earlier this month, Tenney spearheaded the launch of the Congressional Friends of Judea and Samaria Caucus. Alongside advocating for the name change, the caucus supports Israeli annexation of the territories Israel gained during the Six-Day War in 1967. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: To date, Israel has refrained from annexing the area for various reasons, and it largely remains under military administration. Currently, Jews predominantly reside in what is designated as Area C, while Palestinians live under Palestinian Authority rule in Areas A and B, as well as under Israeli military rule in Area C. While proponents of annexation argue that the region is integral to Israel’s historical and biblical heritage, the international community largely views Israel’s policies in the West Bank as a violation of international law. The International Court of Justice in July 2024 issued an advisory opinion declaring that Israel’s continued presence in the Palestinian territories is illegal under international law. The nonbinding ruling cited violations of the prohibition on acquiring territory by force and the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people. The court’s findings expand on its 2004 advisory opinion, which deemed the construction of Israel’s separation barrier in the territories a form of de facto annexation. The countries that back this assessment maintain that most of the West Bank should form part of a future Palestinian state. However, the Trump administration previously recognized the territory as disputed and stated that for Israelis to live there was not illegal under international law. The Yesha Council, a leadership body in the West Bank, is counting on President Trump’s support for Israel’s annexation of the area. 'After years of the [Biden] administration being against the Jews living in Judea and Samaria, the biblical heartland, to come back here to the inauguration of President Trump with a team of people that believe in the biblical heartland is truly a blessing,' said Yesha Council spokeswoman Eliana Passentin. The night before Trump’s inauguration, the Yesha Council organized a rally in Times Square. Electric billboards displayed messages praising the former and future president, and Israelis marched through the streets waving Israeli flags in celebration. 'We are excited,' Passentin said. 'We are grateful for everything President Trump has done in the past for Israel, everything he’s doing in the present, and everything that he will do in the future.' The push to adopt the term 'Judea and Samaria' is not without precedent. In February 2024, Troy Miller, president and CEO of the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB), endorsed a resolution calling for the rejection of the term 'West Bank' and the adoption of 'Judea and Samaria' instead. The resolution, prepared collaboratively by Israel365, The Israel Guys, and the Israel Allies Foundation, was endorsed during the annual NRB convention. It argued that Judea and Samaria represent the biblical heartland of Israel, including historically significant sites like Hebron, Bethel, Shiloh, and Shechem, and fulfill scriptural prophecies of Jewish exile and return. The resolution emphasized the West Bank's strategic importance, noting that the Samaritan mountains provide critical oversight of Israel’s coastal cities, including Tel Aviv and Ben-Gurion International Airport. It also highlighted the positive impact of the Jewish presence in the area, pointing to economic opportunities for Palestinians created by Israeli investment and jobs. The NRB, with over 1,100 member organizations, reaches millions of viewers, listeners, and readers. As such, this shift in language can potentially influence the narrative both in the short and long term.

Union representing 30,000 CUNY faculty and staff votes to divest ...	The move is a stand against Israel’s 'apartheid regime' and its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, supporters say at university, which has been a focal point for student-led activism on this issue, with protests and solidarity campaigns The Professional Staff Congress (PSC), the union representing over 30,000 faculty and staff at the City University of New York (CUNY), passed a resolution to divest its union funds from Israeli companies and government bonds. The resolution approved late last week narrowly passed with 73 votes in favor and 70 against, reflecting the contentious nature of the decision. The union also recommended that the Teachers Retirement System (TRS), which manages over $100 million in pension investments tied to Israeli entities, adopt a similar policy. Proponents of the resolution described the move as a stand against what they termed Israel’s 'apartheid regime' and its actions in Gaza and the West Bank. The resolution's supporters emphasized solidarity with Palestinian workers and students and cited international calls for labor unions to oppose institutional complicity in Israeli policies. 'This decision marks an important step toward aligning our investments with our values,' stated one delegate. They argued that divestment underscores the union’s commitment to social justice and international solidarity. Since October 7, CUNY has been a focal point for student-led activism on this issue, with protests and solidarity campaigns calling for institutional accountability and support for Palestinian rights. Jewish groups have expressed concerns about rising antisemitism on college campuses and have accused CUNY of failing to adequately address these issues. Critics argue that framing Israel’s actions in terms of 'apartheid' and 'genocide' is inflammatory and ignores the complexities of the conflict. They contend that such rhetoric can contribute to a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty. The resolution has also faced significant criticism within the union itself. Opponents expressed concerns that such a divisive stance could undermine unity among members and open the union to legal challenges. Historically, the PSC leadership has been cautious about taking explicit positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, fearing potential backlash. This hesitation was reflected in the narrow margin of the vote, with several delegates warning that the move might alienate members or distract from the union's core mission of advocating for labor rights and educational resources. 'This decision risks fracturing our union at a time when solidarity is more important than ever,' one delegate who opposed the resolution said. 'Our focus should remain on the issues directly impacting our members, not on divisive international politics.' They have also pointed to past instances where political resolutions led to membership disputes and legal battles, including a lawsuit following the union's 2021 resolution to discuss boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) initiatives. That case, which argued that members should not be compelled to support positions contrary to their beliefs, nearly reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The resolution has also drawn legal scrutiny. On Tuesday, a complaint was filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights, alleging that the PSC-CUNY’s divestment policy constitutes a discriminatory boycott in violation of New York Executive Law. The complaint, submitted on behalf of Zionist Jewish and Israeli faculty members, argues that the union’s adoption of BDS policies discriminates against faculty based on their creed and national origin. According to the complaint, the union’s decision effectively excludes Zionist Jewish and Israeli faculty members from certain research grants and collaboration opportunities. It further asserts that the boycott prevents faculty members from engaging in academic work with Israeli institutions and scholars, thereby institutionalizing discrimination within the university system. 'The PSC-CUNY has made abundantly clear that it does not view Zionist Jews or Israelis to be protected classes and has abandoned their sacrosanct Duty of Fair Representation to these groups,' the complaint states. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjqc00rvo1e	2025-01-28T21:55:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/05/22/r17Kt8wv9/r17Kt8wv9_27_0_2134_1201_0_small.jpg
Chinese tech company Alibaba releases AI model it claims surpasse...	Chinese tech company Alibaba on Wednesday released a new version of its Qwen 2.5 artificial intelligence model that it claimed surpassed the highly-acclaimed DeepSeek-V3. The unusual timing of the Qwen 2.5-Max's release, on the first day of the Lunar New Year when most Chinese people are off work and with their families, points to the pressure Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's meteoric rise in the past three weeks has placed on not just overseas rivals, but also its domestic competition. The Jan. 10 release of DeepSeek's AI assistant, powered by the DeepSeek-V3 model, as well as the Jan. 20 release of its R1 model, has shocked Silicon Valley and caused tech shares to plunge, with the Chinese startup's purportedly low development and usage costs prompting investors to question huge spending plans by leading AI firms in the United States.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkxsaswujl	2025-01-28T21:41:09-08:00

Qatari channel Al-Araby reported that U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, pledged in a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to disrupt the reconstruction of the northern Gaza Strip until an agreement is reached on plans for the security of the Israeli border communities. According to the report, the meeting prior to the announcement of the agreement detailed an American plan that includes security projects that will be funded by the U.S. and the Gulf States, concerning the area between the Gaza border communities and the Gaza Strip, to ensure that the area does not pose a future threat to Israel. It was also reported that the American commitments were intended to pressure Netanyahu to continue with the agreement, and to push the Palestinians to emigrate from the Gaza Strip.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxwnhpoyl	2025-01-28T21:38:53-08:00

The IDF won't withdraw until the Lebanese army shows it is in con...	In the next three weeks of the extended cease-fire, the IDF plans to destroy many hotbeds of terrorism in southern Lebanon; at the same time, military outposts are being set up between Israeli towns and the border fence; 'Responsibility for security of our residents lies with the IDF, and certainly not with the Lebanese army or any other foreign force' Since the United States announced earlier this week that agreements had been reached to extend the cease-fire with Lebanon, the riots initiated by Hezbollah along the border - in which it sent hundreds of activists with the organization's flags to try to enter villages near the fence and confront IDF soldiers - have calmed down. On Tuesday, for example, there was a tense silence on the northern border. IDF forces continued to repel attempts by Lebanese civilians to approach the villages where they were prohibited from staying and fired deterrent shots at them. The Israel Air Force, despite the cease-fire, attacked Hezbollah weapons , due to what was defined as a 'violation of the agreement.' A senior military official who is still operating with his forces in the depths of southern Lebanon told Ynet and Yediot Aharonoth that 'until the Lebanese army fulfills its missions and demonstrates good and sufficient control over the territory, we will not recommend transferring control to them.' The IDF plans to fill the additional three weeks, during which, according to the agreement, its forces will remain in southern Lebanon and conduct a long series of operations to destroy terrorist areas and collect weapons that Hezbollah has hidden and that still remain, mainly in the eastern sector, which borders the Upper Galilee. 'In the villages that are not adjacent to the fence in the western and central part of southern Lebanon, we have returned control to the Lebanese army. But in the villages that are adjacent to us and along the border fence, along its entire length, we are still there,' the senior military official explained. He emphasized that no one in the IDF trusts the Lebanese forces to ensure the security of the residents who have already begun to return north. 'The responsibility for the security of our residents lies with the IDF, and certainly not with the Lebanese army or any other foreign force,' he said. This clear statement is supported by the IDF's new defense concept on the northern border. 'We organized the space differently,' the senior official explained. 'The concept today is that the IDF is at the front, even before the communities. Every town that exists, between the border fence and that town, will have an outpost.' So far, the establishment of several military outposts has been completed, in what will be - as the residents who are supposed to return to the north are demanding - an Israeli security zone. 'If we want the residents to return, there needs to be a strong and massive security zone,' according to Rafi Biton, a native and resident of Avivim. 'One that will give security to the residents here, and not like it was in the last decade when they simply abandoned us. They left us to rely on technological wonders like radars and cameras, and on the first day of the war, Hezbollah knocked everything down and left us naked.' Biton's family has been evacuated to a hotel in Tiberias since the outbreak of the war, and recently he has been trying to convince his wife, Rachel, and their children to return home, but without success. 'After October 7, I no longer want to be in this place of fear,' Rachel explained. 'We lost our innocence.' According to the government's decision, which is based on the IDF's recommendation, tens of thousands of displaced people in the north can return to their homes on March 1. However, in accordance with the cease-fire agreement, the hundreds of thousands of displaced Lebanese whose homes served as infrastructure for terrorism and were part of the network of launch and attack posts for the Radwan forces will also be allowed to return and will ostensibly be able to rebuild their homes and even renew the terrorist infrastructure. The IDF is well aware of the residents' concerns. 'We will continue to act and remove any infrastructure that threatens, or could threaten in the future,' said the senior military official. 'We are certain that Hezbollah terrorists will not become peace activists, but will try to continue to establish themselves. We are using many tools and capabilities to understand what Hezbollah is trying to do. We are building the system in such a way that, whenever Hezbollah tries to establish something, our ability to handle it will be immediate, and not just the ability to watch it. We will make sure that they will not be used as terrorist infrastructure again. The responsibility on the IDF's shoulders is to make sure that Hezbollah does not establish its infrastructure again.'

'The army fought here and did an amazing job. The soldiers deserve all the praise, and right now we need to trust the international system and Israel,' he said. 'If I don't trust the people who ran the war here, then who will I trust? We were very complacent and we must never return to that complacent state, but I think that as citizens we need to believe that we have sobered up, that the IDF has sobered up, and that there is now much greater readiness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ihjhpo1l	2025-01-28T21:09:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/HkxC2kI800Jx/HkxC2kI800Jx_1_84_1601_901_0_small.jpg

US Senate blocks bill to impose sanctions on International Crimin...	Despite setbacks in efforts to challenge the ICC, Israeli officials are hopeful that ongoing discussions in Washington could lead to a modified version of the proposal in the future Legislation that would have imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court in protest of its arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister was voted down in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. Senate Democrats blocked the bill that was intended to severely punish the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) for the arrest warrants it issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The bill promoted by Republicans, to impose 'crippling' sanctions against the court and against anyone involved in its investigations into Israel, received a majority of votes – 54 to 45 – but not the 60-member majority needed in the in the 100-member Senate to prevent a filibuster and allow the legislation to advance. The vote was largely along party lines, with almost every Democrat and independent voting against it. Senator John Fetterman was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans to advance the measure. Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff did not vote. Republicans have a 53-member majority in the Senate. In an interview with The Washington Post before the vote, Fetterman said he wanted the 'strongest version' of sanctions on The Hague: 'I'm going to vote for it, I don't understand how anyone could not vote for sanctions against the ICC, after how they've treated Israel.' The 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act' would have imposed sanctions on any foreigner who investigates, arrests, detains, or prosecutes U.S. citizens or those of an allied country, including Israel, who are not members of the court. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: It passed the House earlier this month 243-140, as 45 Democrats joined Republicans in voting 'yes.' In the Senate, Democrats said they agreed with much of the bill, but said it was too broad and risked alienating important U.S. allies and imposing sanctions on lower level workers at the court in the Netherlands. Urging colleagues to vote 'no,' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, accused the ICC of having 'an anti-Israel bias that cannot be ignored.' However, he said the bill was poorly crafted and also could target U.S. companies, such as those whose products help protect the court from foreign hackers. Although it seems like a setback for Israel's efforts to act against the ICC, officials in Jerusalem say that discussions in Washington regarding the proposal's wording are ongoing. There is a possibility that the proposal may resurface later, potentially in a more softened form. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who signed the bill, accused Democrats after the vote of poor negotiating practices on the text. 'Democrats had 10 months to negotiate this bill, but instead they waited until the last minute to demand unworkable changes,' he said, claiming that Democrats want to grant significant relief to tech companies. 'Democrats voted against protecting American forces against a court-martial,' Cotton accused - referring to the Republicans' claim that the arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials constitute a dangerous precedent that could also threaten future soldiers and senior officials in the United States, which, like Israel, is not a member of the court and does not recognize its authority. 'Make no mistake: Democrats today weakened our national security and Israel's ability to defend itself.' The drafters of the law state in the proposal that Prosecutor Karim Khan 's accusations against Israel, alleging war crimes and attempts to starve civilians in Gaza, are 'baseless and illegitimate.' The proposal also states that the arrest warrants issued by the ICC judges constitute a 'dangerous precedent' that threatens the US, Israel, and other allies that do not recognize the authority of the court, which was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute. Israel never signed the treaty, but in 2021 the court's judges ruled that it had jurisdiction over what was happening in the Palestinian territories because the Palestinian Authority had joined the treaty. An investigation into suspected war crimes against Israel had already been opened at that time, and it was expanded following the events of the war. The prosecutor who requested the arrest warrants, Khan, is currently embroiled in an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment . In recent days, Western diplomats and human rights organizations have warned of the implications of the bill, arguing that sanctions on the ICC would harm efforts to prevent war crimes around the world – and also the court’s investigations into Russia following the war in Ukraine. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a letter sent by 20 European diplomats to senior Senate officials, they warned that the proposed sanctions 'threaten to erode the rule of international law, which is critical in promoting order and security in the world.' According to them, 'such steps would undermine the very principle of international justice and accountability – a principle of which the United States has been a strong advocate.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylymr8u1e	2025-01-28T13:55:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/ry8XXaUO1l/ry8XXaUO1l_186_2_893_503_0_small.jpg
Poll: 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the US	An opinion poll indicated on Tuesday that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish their Arctic island - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - to become a part of the United States, Danish daily Berlingske reported. U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that Greenland was vital to U.S. security and Denmark should give up control of the strategically important island. The survey by pollster Verian, commissioned by the Danish paper, showed only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of becoming part of the U.S., with 9% undecided, Berlingske said. Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede, who has stepped up a push for independence, has repeatedly said the island is not for sale and that it is up to its people to decide their future. The U.S. military has a permanent presence at the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, a strategic location for its ballistic missile early-warning system, as the shortest route from Europe to North America runs via the island.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjff10io1g	2025-01-28T12:44:42-08:00

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin's statements on holding talks to end the nearly three-year-old war showed he was afraid of talks and sought to make the conflict endless. 'Today, Putin once again confirmed that he is afraid of negotiations, afraid of strong leaders and is doing everything to prolong the war,' Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Putin's actions, he said, were 'aimed at making the war endless.' Putin earlier said Ukraine could find the legal means to hold talks with Russia despite what he described as Zelenskiy's 'illegitimacy,' meaning he had remained in power beyond his legal mandate.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hke8jr8dyl	2025-01-28T12:43:12-08:00

Even in captivity, I saw how you were fighting for me': Naama Le...	She was held hostage for 477 days and now Naama Levy details her first horrifying days of captivity, as well as messages of gratitude and hope; Still recovering, she and her fellow lookouts await the release of Agam Berger and Arbel Yehoud and send messages of love and thanks to the public Three days after her release from captivity, lookout Naama Levy, along with her friends Karina Ariev, Liri Albag, and Daniella Gilboa, shared a 'first message' on the Instagram page that had campaigned for her release: 'I’m home. After 477 days, I’m finally home. I’m safe and protected, surrounded by family and friends, and feeling better every day.' Alongside a photo of herself with her parents and the message she wrote on the helicopter taking her to an Israeli hospital-'Finally home, thank you to the people of Israel,' Naama revealed: 'During the first 50 days after October 7, I was mostly alone. Later, I was held in captivity with my fellow lookouts and civilian captives, who gave me strength and hope. We supported each other until the day of our release and even afterward.' Naama wrote that she is waiting for the release of lookout Agam Berger, who is expected to be freed from captivity on Thursday, along with civilian Arbel Yehoud and another hostage whose identity is still unknown. 'We are waiting for Agami and the other hostages so we can complete the rehabilitation process. I want to thank the IDF soldiers and the entire people of Israel. Even in captivity, I saw how you were fighting for me! Thank you all, I love you.' Although Naama spent the first 50 days after her abduction alone, she was not held in a tunnel. Later, she was reunited with her fellow lookouts and other civilian captives. The lookouts were not always kept together, as their captors occasionally separated them and moved them between locations. Meanwhile, Liri Albag’s sister, Shai Albag, shared a video from the day of her release and wrote: 'My little sister—you’re number one. For 477 days, you didn’t give up; you believed the happy ending would come. I’m proud of you and love you more than words can ever express. And as I told you today – my life’s mission was to bring you home, and now my mission is to make all your dreams come true 💙.' Radio host Omer Gefen shared a greeting on behalf of Romi Gonen, who was released in the first phase of the deal along with Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher. 'I want to send you greetings, everyone, from Romi Gonen, who is listening to us right now with her family. She asked me to dedicate a song on her behalf and share a few words,' Gefen said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He added: 'Romi writes: ‘To the strongest family there is, my family – you are the best in the world, and the amount of love and appreciation I have for you can never be put into words. I’m with you ‘until after eternity.’ A meaningful song for her, and for us, we’ll listen to Peer Tasi’s ‘Until After Eternity.’ We love you, Romi, we’re thinking of you and everyone else. Thank you for these words.' The four lookouts who were released from Hamas captivity are still staying at Rabin Medical Center, surrounded by family and close friends. As time passes, more details are emerging about the harsh reality they endured in captivity – and the bravery of these young women. Alongside the treatments the women are receiving at the hospital, they are constantly trying to find out whether their friend Agam Berger will be released in the next phase of the deal on Thursday and reunited with them. Only once Agam’s situation is clarified will it be decided which hospital she will be transferred to. Liri Albag will turn 20 next week, and her friends are preparing to celebrate with her, depending on her medical condition. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkyzk3i00jl	2025-01-28T12:10:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/Bk1xOFLd1e/Bk1xOFLd1e_1_52_695_392_0_small.jpg

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday he had ordered a report detailing how to tackle the effect on Ukrainian programs hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of foreign aid. Zelensky said Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba and other officials would determine the effect on Ukrainian programs of Trump's order, which aims to review whether aid allocations are in line with his foreign policy.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday called U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion to relocate Palestinians from war-ravaged Gaza to Jordan and Egypt 'unacceptable.' 'Any resettlement plans, the idea that the citizens of Gaza will be expelled from there to Egypt or Jordan, is unacceptable,' Scholz said, referring at a campaign event in Berlin to Trump's comments. He reiterated his support for a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians live peacefully side by side, adding that it must be clear that the Palestinian Authority would assume responsibility for Gaza. Germany is among Israel's main arms suppliers, with its defense exports to the country rising nearly tenfold annually in 2023, the year when the Gaza war started.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1t7chuujg	2025-01-28T11:13:21-08:00	
Trump, Netanyahu to meet at White House next week	The Israeli premier will be the first foreign leader Trump meets with since he took office; The U.S. president is also expected to invite Netanyahu to dinner at the White House; His envoy, Steve Witkoff, is set to touch down in Israel to speak with Netanyahu, and will also visit Netzarim Corridor in Gaza before the start of negotiations on next phase of cease-fire; However, concern swirls around possible influence of Qatari authorities on Witkoff, over past business ties with Doha President Donald Trump has invited Benjamin Netanyahu to a meeting at the White House on February 4, according to an official statement from the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday night. The statement noted that Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to be invited to the White House since the start ofTrump’s second term. The U.S. president is also expected to invite Netanyahu to dinner at the White House. Sources close to the prime minister said that Sara Netanyahu will return to Israel on the official government Wing of Zion airplane after the prime minister's visit to the United States. In the official invitation, Trump wrote: 'I look forward to discussing with you how to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to confront our common enemies.' However, just this week, the prime minister requested to reduce the number of days he is required to testify in his corruption trial, citing his recovery from prostate surgery. The official statement reported that Netanyahu was invited but did not explicitly confirm his attendance. Given that Netanyahu is scheduled to continue his testimony during those days, he is expected to request approval from the judges to cancel the hearings. Meanwhile, Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to arrive in Israel on Wednesday to visit the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza and hold preparatory talks ahead of negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release agreement, which is set to take effect 42 days after its initiation. In Israel, there is concern about the influence of Qatari authorities on Witkoff, due to his past extensive business ties with the Doha government. In the summer of 2023, Qatar spent $623 million to purchase the famous Park Lane Hotel in New York from a real estate group led by Witkoff, which had owned the property for about a decade. Essentially, the Qataris 'rescued' Trump’s associate from financial difficulties surrounding the continued ownership of the hotel. Senior Israeli officials, in private conversations, have expressed concerns about the close relationship between the Qataris and Witkoff, fearing the Qataris may have undue influence over him. While Israel holds Witkoff in high regard, with those familiar with him describing him as deeply connected to Israel and its security needs, there is also concern about Qatar’s influence on President Trump and his team. Qatar’s influence is critical as the second phase of the hostage deal approaches, with negotiations set to begin on the 16th day of the agreement next week. Israel is preparing for the talks, though several government ministers are convinced that the negotiations will fail and that Israel will inevitably return to fighting. They doubt Hamas will agree to the conditions set by Jerusalem, which include disarming the Gaza Strip, exiling Hamas leaders, and ensuring the group’s non-involvement in Gaza’s 'day after' governance. At the same time, some ministers were 'shocked' by the 'ceremony' Hamas held for the release of four female observers who were freed from captivity. The event demonstrated that the terrorist organization has not lost its ability to govern, as it showcased active armed battalions, white pickup trucks, machine guns and motorcycles with sirens. These images are in stark contrast with Israeli claims that it has succeeded in dismantling Hamas’ military capabilities. Nevertheless, senior Israeli officials believe that Witkoff and Trump will not rush to allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resume fighting in Gaza. Instead, they are expected to present a series of incentives that will make it difficult for Netanyahu to take that path. These include potential sanctions on Iran, normalization with Saudi Arabia, the initiation of discussions on a security memorandum of understanding, and harsh sanctions on the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Netanyahu will find it challenging to say 'no' to Trump and risk losing these opportunities. All these issues are expected to be discussed during the planned meeting between Trump and Netanyahu at the White House next week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Some have noticed that in Netanyahu’s recent statements he has hinted that Israel may not necessarily return to the type of fighting seen previously if negotiations for the second phase of the agreement fail. 'If we need to return to fighting, we will do so in new ways and with great intensity,' the Prime Minister said this week. Some believe Netanyahu is signaling that there will not be a massive ground operation like before, but rather more surgical combat methods and targeted eliminations. Witkoff is set to arrive in the region on Wednesday on his private plane. He will visit Israel and Gaza after attending the main ceremony marking 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp in Poland, where he met with families of hostages. After visiting the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza, Witkoff is expected to meet with Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. Meanwhile, Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Than spoke by phone Tuesday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. According to a statement from Qatar’s Foreign Ministry, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continuing joint mediation efforts in the Gaza Strip and emphasized the importance of adhering to the cease-fire. The statement added, 'The parties expressed their hope that the agreement will move to the second phase, leading to a permanent cease-fire.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rirjio1x	2025-01-28T11:09:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SJb7A72vJe/SJb7A72vJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel announces UNRWA ban to take effect in 48 hours	Israel's UN Ambassador announced officially that Palestinian aid agency UNRWA must leave Jerusalem by Thursday; 'The decision was not made lightly, nor was it made quickly. It was not a political decision, it was simply a necessary one' he says Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, announced officially on Tuesday that Jerusalem will sever all ties with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and anyone operating on its behalf. The decision will take effect on Thursday, January 30, as stipulated by the law passed by Israel's government. 'I hereby inform the United Nations and the Security Council that the legislation concerning UNWRA's activities in Israel will officially come into force in 48 hours,' Danon stated. 'In accordance with applicable Israeli law and following the termination of the provisional agreement, UNRWA must cease its operations and evacuate all premises it operates in Jerusalem. The legislation forbids UNWRA from operating within the sovereign territory of the state of Israel and forbids any contact between Israeli officials and UNWRA,' Danon said. 'Furthermore, UNRWA will be prohibited from maintaining any representative office, service or activity within our territory, and will terminate all collaboration, communication and contact with UNRWA or anyone acting on its behalf. This decision was not made lightly, nor was it made quickly. It was not a political decision. It was simply a necessary one,' he also said. Danon added that the severing of ties 'follows decades of betrayal by an agency that has placed political agendas, neglect and cover-ups over humanitarian principles. This decision reflects years of efforts to address the grave accusations raised against it. This decision also reflects the reality of the situation that UNWRA has miserably failed in its mandate, and it has failed the people who were supposed to benefit from its services. More precisely, this decision was driven by UNWA's constant refusal to address the widespread infiltration of its ranks by Hamas and other terrorist organizations.' 'No sovereign state should facilitate the operation of an agency that threatens its national security and blatantly violates its laws. Israel remains committed to its obligations under international law, and we reaffirm our readiness to cooperate with other UN agencies that are not tainted by terror,' he concluded.

Contractor working in Gaza accidentally killed by IDF fire	Kobi Avitan, a 39-year-old father of 3 from Eilat operated a tractor and performed engineering work of the IDF; He was shot dead in the Netzarim Corridor after being mistaken for a terrorist Kobi Avitan, an employee of a contracting company that performs engineering work for the IDF on behalf of the Ministry of Defense, was killed Tuesday morning in the Netzarim Corridor after being mistaken for a terrorist. He was operating a tractor as part of work on the cross-Gaza highway - the western part of which the IDF was required to withdraw from Tuesday as part of the hostages release deal, thereby enabling the mass return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip. Avitan was killed by DF forces. Under the direction of the Military Prosecutor's Office, an investigation by the military police has been opened. Avitan, a 39-year-old father of three children, lived in Eilat. ZAKA Search and Rescue paid tribute to him, noting that he volunteered at the organization's branch in the city. 'Kobi was a man of kindness who dedicated his life to the common good and gave his soul for the people of Israel.

The ZAKA family shares in the deep mourning of his wife Tali and the dear Avitan family, praying that in his great and good deeds you will find solace and know no more sorrow.' Tuesday's serious incident is the first time Israelis have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the start of the cease-fire as part of the hostage deal - and the first fatal incident there since the explosion of the building in Beit Hanoun on January 13, in which five Nahal patrol fighters were killed.

The operation involves 16 helicopter flights a day that will at first deliver at least 160 tonnes of life-saving medical supplies over a week to hospitals and medical centers, army officials said. Under an agreement sponsored by the U.S., Israel had allowed Jordan to deliver aid to a designated location near Israel's Kissufim border crossing with the devastated Gaza Strip.

Palestinians return to Gaza City: Kiss the ground, clean up rubbl...	Some 300,000 refugees returned to northern Gaza, reuniting with family members they had been separated from for 15 months; Families gathered to celebrate their reunions, marking the moment with both joy and determination; 'We will not leave again,' one returning refugee says, 'not even Trump will make us emigrate' Displaced Palestinians returning to their homes in Gaza City this week found a city in ruins after 15 months of fighting, with many seeking shelter among the rubble and searching for relatives lost in the chaotic return march. Gaza City, in the north of the enclave, is a shell of the bustling urban center it was before the war, with swathes of buildings destroyed by bombardments and piles of rubble and torn-up concrete on every side. 'Look at this scene, there is nothing to say,' said a man who gave his name as Abu Mohammad as he searched for a place to settle. 'People will sleep on the ground. There is nothing left.' Many of those returning, often laden with what personal possessions they still have after months of being moved around as the battlegrounds shifted, had trekked 20 km (12 miles) or more along the coastal highway north. 'I am waiting for my father, mother and brother. We lost them on the way,' said Jameel Abed, who walked up from the central area of the Gaza Strip. 'We found some lights here and we are waiting for them,' he said. 'There is no car, no motorized rickshaw, no donkey cart, no vehicle, nothing that could move on this road.' By late on Monday, Gaza's Hamas authorities said more than 300,000 people, or almost half of those displaced from the north during the war, had crossed into Gaza City and the north edge of the enclave from areas in the south. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even as those who arrived in Gaza looked around for somewhere to settle down, tens of thousands were still moving north as mediators began preliminary work on the second stage of cease-fire negotiations due to begin next week. Three more Israeli hostages are due to be handed over on Thursday by Hamas, the terror group still in control of Gaza, with another three expected on Saturday, in exchange for scores of Palestinian prisoners set for release from Israeli jails, some of whom will go into exile. In Cairo, a high-level Hamas team led by Mohammad Darwish, head of the group's leading council, held talks with Egyptian mediators and welcomed 70 Palestinian prisoners who arrived in Cairo prior to being moved to third countries who would be willing to host them, a Hamas statement said. These include Qatar, Turkey and Algeria, according to Hamas and other sources. Later on Tuesday, Hamas said the delegation has also discussed with Cairo officials alleged Israeli violations of the truce and ideas to achieve national unity with the rival Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas, including an Egyptian proposal to form a committee to run post-war Gaza. Hamas, which has run Gaza since 2007, and Abbas' authority, which has a sway in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, have so far failed to end political splits that weakened Palestinian aspirations for statehood. Negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire Under the terms of the cease-fire, agreed this month with Egyptian and Qatari mediation and U.S. support, 33 hostages are due to be released during a six-week cease-fire, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, many of them serving life sentences in Israeli jails. Seven hostages and 290 prisoners have so far been exchanged. A second stage, which will decide what happens to more than 60 other hostages, including men of military age as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, is due to begin by next Tuesday. But Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, said the group believed the talks would go ahead. 'We are ready to begin negotiations for the second phase at the specified time and are confident that Netanyahu has no choice but to proceed with the second phase,' he said. What would follow full implementation of the cease-fire remains unclear after Israel's repeated declarations that Hamas will not be allowed to remain in power in Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump's call for Palestinians in Gaza to be taken to Egypt or Jordan, though strongly rejected in the region and by Palestinian officials and residents, has further complicated the outlook. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h11100nclu1l	2025-01-28T09:40:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/Sk8fNuIdJx/Sk8fNuIdJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Casualties reported in UAV attack in Nabatieh that led to a large fire and billowing smoke in the area; Comes days after cease-fire was extended, allowing the IDF to remain in Lebanon for more than two more weeks. An unusual attack in the Nabatieh area in southern Lebanon was reported on Tuesday evening, less than two days after cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon was extended, allowing the IDF to remain in Lebanon for more than two more weeks. According to the Al-Mayadeen channel, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, this was an attack by a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). The Beirut Health Ministry reported that there were seven casualties in the attack - which led to a large fire and smoke rising in the area. If the IDF did indeed attack the area, then this is the most significant attack in a long period of time in southern Lebanon. Earlier, the Lebanese army claimed that the IDF opened fire on military personnel and civilians on the Yaron-Maroun al-Ras road, and that a soldier and three civilians were injured. This happened while Lebanese army soldiers were escorting residents returning to villages in the south of the country. The White House announced earlier this week that the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon has been extended until February 18. The Americans issued the announcement in light of the fact that the IDF had not yet withdrawn from southern Lebanon, and due to crowds of Lebanese rioters, most of them acting at the behest of Hezbollah. The IDF fired distance shots at many of them, and according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 22 civilians were killed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjedq5800kg	2025-01-28T09:09:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/HkVjEcL00yg/HkVjEcL00yg_4_356_957_539_0_small.jpg

Every terrorist we identify is marked for death': IDF Special Fo...	Duvdevan Special Forces, stretched across multiple fronts since October 7, return to their core mission: eliminating armed terrorists in the West Bank; Recent operations in Tulkarm reveal tactical ambushes, drone technology and the dismantling of explosives and terror networks the IDF's Duvdevan Special Forces, which has been stretched thin since October 7, 2023, across three combat zones, has recently returned – mostly – to its original purpose and primary expertise: combating armed terrorists in the alleys of the West Bank. Exclusive footage from the fighting in the alleys of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarm reveals the complexity of their operations. The unit led a major operation in the Nur al-Shams refugee camp near Tulkarm, last month as part of its role at the forefront of the IDF’s offensive lines in the northern section of the West Bank and again in recent days. This offensive activity, conducted near the seamline and just three kilometers in a straight line from Route 6 and the communities of Hefer Valley Regional Council, takes place in a world so near yet far from the calm of the Sharon region, north of greater Tel Aviv. During an operation that began in recent days in Tulkarm, two armed militants were already eliminated, including the leader of the local terrorist network, and approximately 20 explosive devices were detonated. Duvdevan eliminated more than 10 armed terrorists during the operation – both on the ground and from the air. They conducted nighttime ambushes and daytime searches, attempting to reach every last armed terrorists. They uncovered large stockpiles of weapons in the camp and the command centers of terror groups, which had likely been used to plan the attack that prompted the unit's offensive: a large-scale incursion into Israeli territory by dozens of armed terrorists, inspired by the deadly October 7 massacre. Duvdevan thwarted the incursion. The threat level decreased following the operation, but Central Command estimates it is only a matter of time before the soldiers will be required to return to the area –just as they have raided this hostile camp dozens of times in the past two years. Exclusive footage from the operation, obtained by Ynet, reveals the challenges of fighting in the densely built and crowded urban terrain: numerous blind spots, narrow streets, hidden explosive devices and the need for precise command and control by officers. The simple understanding is clear: every armed terrorist identified is sentenced to death. The soldiers were documented using the small 'Tarnegol' ('Rooster') drones, which were first revealed last year. These drones can move and jump over obstacles on the ground, navigate narrow paths or tunnels, and then fly through windows and rooms. 'We’ve eliminated enemies in large numbers across the West Bank in recent months – dozens of armed terrorists we’ve killed, piles of explosive devices we’ve destroyed. Tulkarm is no longer the same place it used to be,' said Captain N., a platoon commander in the unit, in an interview with Ynet. In footage from the operation, Duvdevan and Shin Bet operatives can be seen operating together in Jenin. The unit has returned to its original mission. 'We saw explosive devices even on the peripheral roads around Nur al-Shams. They are prepared for our entry, but we eliminate them even when they barricade themselves inside houses,' added Captain N. 'We don’t take risks with our soldiers – every armed terrorist is immediately killed. This is what the unit does best, transitioning seamlessly between missions, moving from Gaza to Lebanon and back to the West Bank.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In Tulkarm, Duvdevan worked, as it has in Nablus and other strongholds of terror organizations in the West Bank, alongside reserve soldiers, sometimes deployed independently when the regular forces were primarily engaged in operations in Gaza or Lebanon. During the Tulkarm operation, soldiers also discovered bomb-making labs, lathes for manufacturing weapons and explosives with remote activation capabilities hidden in children’s school bags. 'Terrorists simply fled, but we ambushed them,' described Captain N. 'They left behind hot cups of coffee, active phones and electricity running. We even found large improvised vehicle bombs weighing tens of kilograms. I don’t think we’ll be fighting there in cycles because each time there are fewer enemies and fewer weapons. They try to flee the camp whenever we enter.' Captain N. explained, as reported two weeks ago by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, that the IDF finds it challenging to strike the many armed terrorists present during funeral processions. 'It’s very complicated to operate there because there are many uninvolved civilians. Still, we work nonstop, thwarting attacks daily and arresting, on average, about 10 wanted terrorists weekly – just the unit alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjlsxf8ojg	2025-01-28T08:49:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/BJWbw7dIOyg/BJWbw7dIOyg_0_0_1280_590_0_small.jpg
Israel proposes south Lebanon buffer zone as border violence erup...	Renewed clashes highlight long-standing disputes over troop presence and Hezbollah’s influence in southern Lebanon Clashes between the IDF and Lebanese civilians on Sunday have raised alarms over the fragile cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, brokered to halt last year’s war. At least 22 people were killed and over 120 injured, including women and children, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The violence unfolded in southern Lebanon as thousands of displaced residents attempted to return to their homes, defying Israeli military orders and Lebanese army warnings. The IDF said in a statement that its forces fired warning shots to deter 'imminent threats' from groups approaching Israeli positions. 'On Sunday, IDF troops operating in southern Lebanon fired warning shots to remove threats in a number of areas where suspects were identified approaching the troops. Additionally, a number of suspects in proximity to IDF troops that posed an imminent threat to the troops were apprehended and are currently being questioned at the scene,' according to the IDF. Avraham Levine, speaker, and digital content manager at the Alma Center, justified the IDF’s response, saying: 'We were faced with an overwhelming number of people approaching our positions, and our forces fired in response to what was perceived as a direct threat. Retaliation is not what we wanted, but soldiers saw people carrying Hezbollah flags coming their way and had no time to check everyone’s IDs. The Lebanese army should have avoided this circumstance in the first place.' Lebanese officials strongly condemned the incident, calling it a violation of the ceasefire agreement signed three months ago. 'The cease-fire was meant to protect the people of Lebanon, but Israel continues to violate it,' said Faisal Mosleh, a professor of international relations in Beirut. 'Shooting unarmed civilians is not an act of self-defense; it’s an act of aggression. Israel’s forces are once again showing their disregard for the safety of Lebanese citizens and the terms of the cease-fire.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Imad Harb, director of research and analysis at the Arab Center Washington DC, questioned Israel’s intentions. 'The cease-fire agreement was supposed to lead to a full withdrawal, but Israel aims to extend its stay. I doubt this deadline will be met,' according to Harb. The U.S. confirmed on Sunday that the cease-fire agreement will remain in effect until February 18, 2025. 'The arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, will continue to be in effect until February 18, 2025,' the White House said. The delays have fueled frustrations in Lebanon, where the new government, led by President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, faces immense challenges in restoring stability. 'The new government is trying to move the country forward, but Israel’s failure to meet its obligations makes this task nearly impossible,' Mosleh said. In Beirut, Hezbollah supporters held demonstrations to showcase their resilience. While far from the violence in the south, the gatherings highlighted the group’s enduring role in Lebanese society. Harb described the demonstrations as 'a display of resilience, but it also signals how vulnerable they really are.' Levine criticized Hezbollah’s role. 'Hezbollah is exploiting this situation to build their narrative as defenders of Lebanon. Their goal is to provoke tensions and delay the full implementation of the cease-fire agreement,' he said. Critics argue that such a measure would exacerbate tensions rather than bring stability. Harb dismissed the idea. 'This isn’t new. Israel had a buffer zone in Lebanon from 1978 to 2000, and it failed to provide the security it sought. Why would this strategy work now? It’s destruction for the sake of control, but it won’t bring peace or stability to anyone,' Harb said. Future negotiations and challenges In a related development, the U.S. announced that Israel, Lebanon, and the U.S. would begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after October 7, 2023. That date marked Hezbollah’s attack on Israel in support of Hamas, as violence erupted in Gaza. The ongoing presence of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon remains a contentious issue. Lebanese leaders face the dual challenge of addressing external conflicts and managing internal divisions. Harb observed, 'Lebanon’s leadership has no choice but to engage with groups like Amal and Hezbollah. These forces are a powerful part of the political landscape, and while their influence is controversial, the government cannot afford to ignore them.' Despite skepticism, Harb expressed cautious hope for Lebanon’s future. 'Lebanon has faced immense challenges in the past, and we have always managed to rebuild. I believe in our people, in our resilience. If our government can find a way to unite and address both our internal divisions and external pressures, there is still hope for a brighter future,' he said. Whether Lebanon’s fragile cease-fire can hold and the region can avoid further escalation remains to be seen. The coming months will test the resilience of Lebanon’s government and the effectiveness of international efforts to stabilize the region.

Let Israelis move to Greenland, Iran says after Trump suggests mo...	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says by relocating Israelis to Greenland the US can kill two birds with one stone, and resolve the Greenland problem and Israel-Palestinian issue Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi proposed Tuesday that Israelis should be relocated to Greenland, rather than implementing former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move Palestinians out of Gaza. 'I think this is a project many people have tried to do in the past, but they have all failed. You know, Palestine cannot be deleted and Palestinians cannot be expelled. So my suggestion is something else. Instead of Palestinians try to expel Israelis, take them to Greenland so they can kill two birds with one stone. They can resolve the problem in Greenland and Israelis, it would be a good place for them,' he said in an interview with Sky News You don't think the Israelis have a right to live in what they regard as their homeland?

IDF will say on Syrian Mount Hermon 'indefintely', Defense Minist...	During a visit to Mount Hermon, Israel Katz emphasized that 'the IDF will remain in the security zone indefinitely' and 'we will not rely on others for our defense – here or anywhere else'; He added that Israel 'will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves and we will act against any threat' Defense Minister Israel Katz visited IDF posts on the summit of Mount Hermon in Syria, and in assessing the current situation he defined Israel's security policy in Syria and announced that 'The IDF will remain at the summit of the Hermon and the security zone indefinitely to ensure the security of the communities of the Golan Heights and the north, and all the residents of Israel.' 'I came here to ensure that the IDF is well-prepared for both defense and offense, for a prolonged stay at the Hermon outposts,' Katz said during a visit to the Hermon's peak. 'We will not return to the reality of October 7, and we will not rely on others for our defense – here or anywhere else. We only rely on the commanders and soldiers of the IDF, both regular and reserve, to provide security to the people of Israel.' 'We will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves in the security zone in southern Syria… we will act against any threat,' he also said. The minister added that Israel would establish contact with friendly populations in the area, especially the large Druze community 'which has historic and close family relations with our Druze brothers in Israel.' During a visit to the peak of Mount Hermon, together with the commander of the 210th Division, Brigadier General Yair Palai, and the commander of the 810th Mountain Brigade, Colonel L., Katz heard from the forces in the outposts about the operational activity in the field to protect Israel's border and prevent the establishment of hostile forces in the area. He spoke with soldiers from the Alpinist Unit, with soldiers of the Haredi Battalion 8551, and the Har Zion 0710 mobility unit, and thanked them for their great contribution to the security of the State of Israel. Meanwhile, an IDF spokesman reported that the Technology and Logistics Branch, the Northern Command, and the Engineering and Construction Branch at the Ministry of Defense have been working in recent weeks to provide the fighting forces with the best possible response to the winter conditions in the Syrian Hermon sector.

'Infrastructure and equipment were established that can withstand various weather conditions, including temporary structures with an additional layer of insulation, heating means, generators and a water heating system.' The IDF spokesman added: 'As part of the complete response, a unique medical building was provided for treating injuries from cold temperatures, equipped with appropriate medical equipment, kitchens and a dining room that will enable the provision of hot food to the soldiers. Thousands of winter items were distributed to the fighters in the sector, with an emphasis on unique equipment for snow conditions, including heating bags, raincoats, storm suits and winter boots.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bya5nduujl	2025-01-28T07:06:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/r1bU8RvUdkl/r1bU8RvUdkl_83_97_1179_664_0_small.jpg

Hostage families urge Trump: Secure phase II of hostage deal	In meeting with evangelical leader Mike Evans, hostages families deliver a message to the president: 'Only you can save them' The families of Israeli hostages have appealed to former U.S. President Donald Trump to ensure the continuation of phase two of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal, which they hope will bring their loved ones home. In a meeting with Mike Evans, founder of the Friends of Zion Museum and one of Trump’s key allies in Israel, the families shared emotional messages directed at the former president. 'We have 65 more hostages that are going to stay after the first stage of the deal, and you have to make sure that all of them will come back home,' said the wife of a man who was taken hostage but asked to remain anonymous. 'I am begging you from the bottom of my heart, and I can’t wait to see my husband and all the hostages hug you. Thank you for all the things you are doing to bring all of them home.' Gal Gilboa Dalal, a survivor of the Nova music festival and the brother of Guy Gilboa Dalal, who was kidnapped from the same event, and a handful of other hostages met with Evans during Evans’ recent visit to Israel, where he hosted an event celebrating Trump’s legacy at his museum in collaboration with ILTV. Dalal credited Trump with helping finalize the current deal and securing the release of hostages. According to Evans, Dalal described Trump as 'the most powerful man in the world and the only person who can make a difference to bring his younger brother and all the hostages home.' Another family member, Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David—who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival at age 22—also made an impassioned plea. 'Dozens of innocent people, aged 1 to 86, are being held in tunnels 50 meters underground in horrible conditions,' he said. 'They have been in captivity for more than 475 days. My brother is a young man, and he is set to be released only in the second stage of the deal. I am so afraid that they are dying there. At any moment, they can be executed.' David urged Trump to ensure the agreement continues. 'You are the only one who can bring back my brother and all the hostages,' he said. 'You have to make sure the two sides agree to continue to the second phase of the deal. You are the only one who can bring back my little brother. Please help us and save his life.' Evans delivered the families’ messages to Trump, who responded. Evans, who served as one of Trump’s faith advisors during his presidency from 2017 to 2021, has continued to act as a liaison for the former president in Israel. Since October 7, he has been instrumental in supporting hostage families through events, fundraising, and direct aid. Israel is in the midst of phase I of a hostage deal, which includes the release of 33 hostages over 42 days. So far, seven hostages have returned home. Another three are expected to be released on Thursday and three more on Saturday. Among the released hostages are four observer soldiers, female soldiers who were serving at the Nahal Oz base on Israel's border on the day of the Hamas attack.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj3nquuo1l	2025-01-28T06:17:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/H1zo4OUuyl/H1zo4OUuyl_1_872_1689_951_0_small.jpg
Suddenly, I have a daughter who speaks Arabic': Romi Gonen's fir...	Former hostage's father speaks with Ynet about her healing process, the horror she endured in Gaza and the family's surprise at her mental and physical condition after over a year held captive Over a week after being released from Hamas captivity, Romi Gonen's father Eitan told Ynet on Tuesday that 'Romi is amazing, wonderful. A champion inspiring admiration and awe. We just look at her and are in complete shock at what we see.' 'When she saw me, she simply said, 'Dad, I came back alive.' That means all the interviews we did on TV and radio somehow managed to reach Gaza as well,' he noted. 'I ended every interview with these words: 'Romi will come back alive.' I said it thousands of times, hoping she'd hear it just once and she did,' he added. 'That was the most important thing she had to tell me in the first sentence after 471 days of not speaking. 'I feel incredible euphoria. We waited so long for this day — to feel, to embrace Romi, to talk to her, like you see in the pictures. I get emotional every time I see that video; it's the highest of all highs.' Talking about her long captivity, Eitan clarified: 'On Sunday, after consulting with psychologists, we handed the reins over to Romi. We told her we didn't want to overwhelm or discomfort her. We won't ask questions and will let her process it her way. If she wants a hug, we'll hug her.' 'If she wants us to stand aside, that's what we'll do — and it's working. When she feels a little closed off, she says, 'Let me go,' and we do. When she says, 'Gather around me,' we gather.' Eitan shared that the family was surprised by Romi's physical condition. 'We were very worried about her right arm, where she was injured. We had no idea what or if she'd eaten or if she was sick. But I know Romi's noble spirit; she's the family's sunshine. I wanted that to come back, unharmed. Our sunshine is shining again, without a doubt.' He stressed that a bond formed between her and the other captives. 'The friendship between her and Emily Damari became like a bond of blood. She met Emily in captivity and something extraordinary developed there. I stand aside and say, 'Wow, we have another family member.'' 'They were each other's entire world in captivity. They talked, helped and cared for each other — like a mother, a father, a sister. And when they returned to Israel, they did everything together. 'They go out to eat together, visit places together and chat in each other's rooms. We've gotten to know the wonderful families, both Emily's and Doron Steinbrecher’s. I stand aside and see three superheroes.' Are there any signs hinting at their time in captivity? 'On Romi's first day back, I think most of her speech was in Arabic and she didn’t even realize it. She spoke Arabic nonstop there for over 400 days. She learned it because the terrorists didn’t speak Hebrew or English. So, in the toolbox she developed for herself, part of it was learning how to communicate — to make requests, to get permission for everything she wanted to do. 'To stand, to talk, to go right, to go left — it all required approval. And how do you get that? Only by learning their language. So, yes, that’s one anecdote: Suddenly, I have a daughter who speaks Arabic.' Eitan praised U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration for their involvement in securing the deal. 'I have a very important message from Romi: Completing the deal in all its phases is a vital obligation for Israel. It's unacceptable to break this agreement or shift the blame onto one side or another. 'All captives must come home. There's no need to look for someone to blame — Hamas is a terrorist organization; we know that. They’ll test all our nerves, breaking agreements here and there.' After former hostage Liri Albag's father, Eli, criticized decision-makers who opposed the deal, Eitan said: 'It upset me and my entire family to see [Bezalel] Smotrich and [Itamar] Ben-Gvir's congratulations for Romi, Emily and Doron's return. Are you joking? To oppose the deal and then congratulate them? I despise this behavior.' 'I can't believe they wear a kippah. They claim to be Jews, even more righteous than me but I think that’s very wrong. They acted against Judaism, against tradition and against the most fundamental Jewish mitzvah, redeeming captives.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Don’t try to scare us with the released terrorists. We have the IDF, we have security forces — why was Ben-Gvir the national security minister? He stripped the police and everyone under him of their power,' he added. 'If his daughter had been kidnapped, he wouldn’t have said these things, not him nor Smotrich. I've said this from the start: to speak at the expense of the hostages’ families and call this a reckless deal means they themselves are reckless, not anyone else.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj4a11uioyg	2025-01-28T05:34:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/SyAQ9PB00Jx/SyAQ9PB00Jx_532_0_749_422_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu's Haredi coalition partners urge him to see cease-fire ...	Both Shas and United Torah Judaism leaders vow to su pport any deal that would see all of the hostages held captive by Hamas return but in addition to far-right members of the coalition, the PM's own likud members say no deal if Hamas remains to rule Gaza Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ultra-Orthodox coalition partners are urging him to see the cease-fire and hostage release deal through to its end and not return to the war after the first phase is completed. Negotiations on the second phase of the agreement are to begin next week. Netanyahu has been warned by his far-right coalition partners in the Religious Zionist Party that they would topple his government if he ended the war. 'Don't stop!' said Labor Minister Yoav Ben-Tzur from the Shas Party said on Tuesday in a public event. 'Our boys and girls are suffering there. I promise you that all six of the Party's members will support you. Bringing them back is the most sacred cause.' Shas chairmen Aryeh Deri said n Monday in a meeting of his Knesset factions that the deal must be completed in full. In a not so veiled criticizm of far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and the former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir who resigned from the coalition after the cease-fire deal was signed, Deri said Shas from day one wanted to eliminate Hamas and remove its ability to rule Gaza but on the other hand, the hostages were always top of mind. In the first deal we brought home close to 100 captives. Not everyone agreed with us and now, I understand the concerns because the prices are high, but we have to save lives,' he said. 'We will make every effort to bring every last one of the hostages, home. We are not busy making threats or public declarations. We are not threatening anyone.' Under the terms of the deal, Israel has already begun releasing terrorists sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Israelis and will continue to release them from Israeli prisons as more hostages are freed. In the second phase of the deal, Israel agreed to withdraw its troops out of Gaza, effectively bringing an end to the war. Housing Minister Yitzhak Issachar Goldknopf from the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party agreed. 'I told Netanyahu that we would support any deal to bring the hostages home,' he said. Netanyahu had been accused of avoiding a deal that would end the war and potentially leave Hamas able to regain control of the Gaza Strip, under pressure from Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. The resigning minister called the cease-fire deal a catastrophe for Israel's future security. Culture Minister Mickey Zohar from Netanyahu's Likud Party told ynet in an interview on Tuesday that completion of the deal could rely on the plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to transfer half of the population of Gaza out of the Strip and settle them temporarily in neighboring Arab countries. 'If we find a way to present a global agreement for an agreed migration, we would support it. This could lead to a break through toward the second phase of the cease-fire deal,' Zohar said. 'Let's be clear. Returning the hostages is our top priority but we cannot allow Hamas to remain in control in Gaza.' But you did not propose any alternatives? 'Alternatives are being considered with the U.S. and others. There is currently no 'operationally realistic' option many people are sitting and thinking of solutions and we hope they find them.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ahead of Netanyahu's planned meeting with Trump, Zohar said he was already discussing the second phase of the deal, despite his coalition partners on the right, threatening to topple the government. 'I know he is examining the security implications of the second phase,' he said. 'If he finds a suitable solution acceptable for him and the defense establishment that would not harm to Israel's security and would ensure Hamas cannot rule Gaza, that could bring about a breakthrough.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1efsuu00jx	2025-01-28T04:23:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/15/r1HqNMSPkx/r1HqNMSPkx_0_160_1558_877_0_small.jpg

Native of Hezbollah's strong hold the Dahieh: Meet Lebanon's firs...	Naamat Aoun steals show at her husband's presidential inauguration and stirs interest in Lebanon thanks to her roots and fashion sense Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun was elected on January 9 and has since faced numerous challenges, particularly the return of South Lebanon residents to their villages as the IDF remains deployed in the area. In the early days of his presidency, attention shifted to his wife, Naamat Aoun, born Naamat Elias Naama. On the day of Aoun’s election and inauguration, the Lebanese daily outlet An-Nahar predicted that 'Naamat Aoun will play an active role,' during his term. 'Her extensive experience in public relations allows her to champion social and humanitarian issues in Lebanon.' Naamat comes from a modest family in the A-Shiyah area of Beirut’s Dahieh district, Hezbollah’s main stronghold in the country. Her father, Malham, worked for Lebanon’s national carrier, Middle East Airlines. She has two sisters, Tania and Lina and has had a 23-year log career as head of protocol and public relations at the Lebanese American University. Naamat and Joseph Aoun have two children: Khalil, a banker and professional basketball player and Nour, a science graduate working with international organizations. They’re also have two grandchildren and reportedly one more on the way. Though often described as avoiding the spotlight, Naamat doesn’t shy away from expressing her views. 'My blood is southern, my home is in the South and I go to the South,' she said in a recent interview. 'May Allah strengthen the South. Together, we will rebuild it and return to it, God willing.' President Aoun himself hails from Al-Aishiya, a village in South Lebanon. Known for her social and religious activism, Naamat has spoken about the challenges of her life, shaped by her husband’s military career. She has frequently stated that she raised their children largely on her own during sensitive security periods while maintaining a successful career. 'It wasn’t easy but my husband’s support helped me achieve personal and professional success,' she said in an interview. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One aspect that captured public attention following Aoun’s inauguration was Naamat’s outfit: a Moschino suit and Dior shoes valued at over $1,000. An-Nahar noted her elegant appearance, describing her black-and-white suit as a symbol of balance between change and strength at the start of a new era. The report added that white, as a neutral and festive color, was chosen to signify that Naamat is not aligned with any political faction in Lebanon’s divided landscape, enhancing her image. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzrjgu001e	2025-01-28T02:23:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/SJMXM0Ndye/SJMXM0Ndye_366_47_2269_1277_0_small.jpg
Woman sells baby for adoption abroad	A 71-year-old is indicted after agreeing to sell her ward's unborne child to a couple for adoption in the U.S while the mother who is in her care, is hospitalized in a psychiatric facility A 71-year-old court-appointed guardian from northern Israel has been charged with selling a baby born to a young woman under her care. The case, investigated for eight years by the Israel Police Northern District’s Central Investigative Unit, culminated in a severe indictment filed by the Northern District Prosecutor’s Office on Tuesday. The defendant, whose name is under gag order, faces unprecedented charges but is not in custody. Nazareth District Court President Judge Esther Hellman allowed the publication of key details from the indictment, though the trial will be held behind closed doors. The defendant, represented by attorney Yahli Sperling, is accused of human trafficking, kidnapping for trafficking purposes, child abduction and obstruction of justice. According to the indictment, filed by senior deputy district prosecutors Nurit Hadass and Hani Ezra, the defendant worked with individuals suffering from mental illnesses and was appointed as the complainant’s legal guardian in May 2015. 'When the complainant was in the late stages of pregnancy and hospitalized in a psychiatric facility, the defendant decided to arrange for the baby’s adoption of her own volition,' the indictment read. 'To advance her plan, she located a couple in Israel and agreed they would adopt the child in the U.S., covering all pregnancy and birth-related expenses, without informing the complainant or relevant authorities.' The defendant allegedly flew with the complainant to New York without notifying authorities. The adoptive couple arrived days later, and the defendant facilitated the adoption process, including hiring a U.S. lawyer, arranging a caregiver for the complainant and preparing necessary documents. After the birth and a deterioration in the complainant’s health, the defendant signed adoption consent forms on her behalf and assisted the couple in finalizing the adoption with U.S. authorities. The defendant returned to Israel shortly after the adoption, leaving the complainant hospitalized in the U.S. Despite her requests to return, the complainant was forced to remain abroad and dependent on others without financial resources, her passport or proper medical care. In September, six months after the birth, a host family purchased a flight ticket for the complainant to return to Israel. Upon her return, she filed a police complaint, leading to the adoptive couple’s identification and the child’s location. National Anti-Trafficking Coordination Unit Director Dina Dominitz called the indictment 'unique and precedent-setting, both in Israel and globally.' She added: 'It attributes severe offenses of human trafficking and kidnapping for the purpose of bearing and taking a child, involving particularly cruel exploitation. 'The international investigation underscores the importance of cooperation between enforcement and treatment agencies. I hope this indictment brings healing and justice to the young woman at its hear, who was brutally exploited by those meant to protect her.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Attorney Yahli Sperling, representing the defendant, said, 'My client’s actions were beyond reproach. She vehemently denies the allegations, which do not reflect the truth and this will be clarified in court.' 'The indictment’s filing nine years after the incident speaks volumes about the doubts surrounding it. My client is an elderly, ill woman whose life has been dedicated to charity and volunteer work. She committed no criminal offense,' she added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcuc7uoyg	2025-01-28T02:00:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/02/H123lztJA/H123lztJA_0_16_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Six hostages to be freed this week, some families' concern grows ...	PM's coordinator informs families of Hamas reports about fatalities among the hostages; 'its Hamas,' says a brother of a captive, 'it does not end until it does'; three hostages to come home Thrusday, three more on Saturday Six Israeli hostages held by Hamas are expected to be released this week. Three on Thursday including Arbel Yehoud, whose release was delayed by Hamas, Agam Berger and a living male hostage. Three more, living men, are to be freed on Saturday, before implementation of the cease-fire deal is back on track with three hostages freed each week. Hamas is supposed to deliver the names of the hostages 24 hours before their release so on Wednesday, the terror group is to confirm the release of Yehoud, Berger and probably American-Israeli Keith Siegal, whose wife Aviva was freed from captivity in the 2023 exchange. And on Friday, Hamas will provide the names of the three men to be freed on the following day. After Hamas finally transferred the details regarding the condition of the remaining hostages that are to be included in the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, the families of some of the captives were informed by the government's point man on hostages and missing Israelis, Gal Hirsch, that the chance of their loved ones' being alive are small. 'But Hamas has not provided concrete evidence that my brother is no longer alive,' said Dani Elgarat whose brother Itzik was abducted during the Oct. 7 massacre. He said the information that was received does increase the family's concerns, 'but it is not over until it is,' he said.

Israelis unconvinced that returning to the north is safe	Many residents evacuated from their home close to the Lebanese border say they are not hurrying to return; insist the government and military must ensure their safety For the past 16 months, Rafi and Rachel Biton from the Upper Galilee town of Avivim have been displaced from the home they built 32 years ago, near the Shi'ite village of Maroun al-Ras across the border in southern Lebanon. On Monday, Rafi returned to organize the house, hoping to convince Rachel to move back when the evacuation period declared by the government, ends next month. During his visit, Rachel called him frequently via video to check on his well-being. 'I’m very worried. I left a home of 32 years and I can’t see a way back,' she says. Rafi, drawn to his childhood home in the Galilee, says he feels torn away each evening when returning to the Tiberias hotel, where the family had been housed for since the war began. 'We regularly give thanks in the synagogue for the miracle here,' he says. 'We’ve faced great tragedies, but nothing like what could have happened. We celebrated Simchat Torah together as a community and within minutes, terrorists from Maroun al-Ras could’ve descended on us. We wouldn’t be alive to tell the story.' Gunfire from IDF forces stationed near the destroyed village was audible throughout our conversation. Most of the homes in Maroun al-Ras, once a Hezbollah stronghold, have been destrpyed. Pointing to the area’s former Hezbollah symbol, Rafi remarks on its complete destruction but warns: 'A year from now, you’ll see it rebuilt.' Rafi believes a strong buffer zone is essential for residents to return. 'For a decade, we’ve been abandoned with technology like radars and cameras. Hezbollah disabled it all on the war’s first day, leaving us exposed.' he says 'After October 7, I don’t want to live in fear anymore. We’re not naive,' his wife adds. Rafi and Rachel, married for over three decades, agree that they’ll return only when the IDF visibly secures the area. 'The village controlled the entire region, from Meron to Dalton,' Rafi says. 'Security means having the army inside, ensuring Hezbollah isn’t watching us anymore.' Elsewhere along the northern border, tensions have eased following the cease-fire extension between Israel and Hezbollah. However, isolated incidents continue, including provocations by Lebanese waving Hezbollah flags. Near the village of Aitaroun, two Hezbollah operatives carrying flags were detained by IDF forces and taken for questioning. He stresses the importance of Israeli resilience and that he believed northern residents would return to their homes out of love for their homeland. 'Strong settlement, agriculture and a vigilant military are the solution. It’s our responsibility to shape reality here,' he added.

‘Hamas is blackmailing Israel’	Hamas accused of manipulating Israel during hostage negotiations. Analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem warns of Hamas’ tactics and calls for strength Hamas continues to blackmail Israel, even as the hostage-for-ceasefire deal was signed and is being implemented, according to Mideast analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem. He said, 'When you make a deal with a terror organization such as Hamas or Hezbollah, you know what to expect. This was expected by the Israelis.' Ben-Menachem was referring to Hamas’s decision to hold civilian hostage Arbel Yehud during the previous release on Saturday, even though she was expected to be released. In response, Israel delayed allowing Gazans from the northern part of the Strip to return home. 'We have to learn to negotiate with this cruel enemy terror organization,' Ben-Menachem said. 'They only understand one language, the language of force. Any attempt to come to terms with them, to negotiate with them, they will always try to cheat and manipulate Israel and blackmail Israel. 'So, we have to be very, very strong,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjj11gxidkl	2025-01-28T00:25:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/SJ11dzeIOyl/SJ11dzeIOyl_0_307_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Smiling hostages not evidence of humane captivity, but a PR stunt	Reports reveal Hamas' pre-release 'rehabilitation' strategy to mislead public opinion Following the release of hostages Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, Hamas supporters quickly pointed out that the women appeared neither malnourished nor distressed. They noted the hostages were smiling and seemed well-fed, using this as justification for Hamas’ actions on October 7. However, new details have emerged about Hamas' pre-release practices. According to a report from Channel 12, Hamas implements an accelerated 'rehabilitation process' shortly before releasing hostages. This includes providing them with nourishing and nutritious food, as well as stimulants designed to create the illusion of humane treatment during their captivity. Since their release, however, these hostages have shared accounts of their actual experiences, revealing that their time in captivity was far from humane and highlighting the harsh reality of their ordeal. Testimonies from the young women indicate that they endured harsh conditions, including subsisting on seawater, bread, and rice, while being held in underground tunnels and cages. The pre-release measures, described by N12, appear to be a calculated effort by Hamas to manipulate public perception. Other recently freed hostages have since been discharged from medical care, where doctors and social workers have advised their families to allow the survivors to share their stories at their own pace. Gilboa, who still carries a bullet in her leg from the October 7 attack, has shown resilience. 'She’s smiling, and her mood is stable,' her family shared, though the psychological scars will take time to heal. Meanwhile, reports state that one of the female soldiers freed on Saturday expressed a desire to stay behind with Agam Berger, who remains in captivity. Berger, along with six other soldiers, was taken from the Nahal Oz post during the October 7 attacks. She is expected to be part of the next release on Thursday, along with Arbel Yehud and one other hostage. As more hostages return home, their bravery and resilience serve as a testament to the human spirit. But the stories of those still held in captivity remind us that the road to justice and healing is far from over.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skce3gidyl	2025-01-28T00:03:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/yk14239222/yk14239222_0_0_820_462_0_small.jpg
100 armed Americans, dogs, ensure no weapons flow to northern Gaz...	Consortium of defense contractors inspects vehicles for arms' transfere north; companies say dedicated to highest professional stadards and implimentaion of the cease-fire terms Thousands of Gazans continue to head to northern Gaza on Tuesday after their passage was permitted on Monday. Convoys of cars have been crossing through the A-Rashid road while others make their way on foot. According to the cease-fire agreement there is not security check for the people walking north and only vehicles are inspected by the consortium of American defense contractors set up to carry out that task. These are highly-skilled, ex-military, ex-CIA personnel who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan and have vast fighting experience. Some of them speak Arabic. They are armed and their mission is to prevent the flow of weapons and terrorists, north. In all, 100 employees of the consortium have been sent to Gaza, using a hotel in southern Israel as their home base. All are working under the mandate given by the mediators in the cease-fire deal – the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, who also pay their wages. A second line of defense is manned by an Egyptian security fence that participates in the initial questioning and secures the site. Inspections are carrying out using X-ray equipment and other technologies in addition to hand searchers. The Americans travel in white pick-up trucks or blue armored vehicles, reminiscent of those used by UN peace keeper, but unlike them, the American defense contractors do not intend to turn a blind eye. Hamas would likely be disappointed if the terror group attempts to test them. When a car approaches the checkpoint all of its passengers, but the driver, must exit the vehicle while the driver and his car are inspected for explosives. The entire process takes only minutes. Along the road, on both sides of the checkpoint at Netzarim, Hamas police are deployed to maintain order and IDF troops deploy dogs to sniff out any weapons. The consortium includes Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) and UG Solutions who provide comprehensive security solutions globally. It also includes the Egyptian SRS security firm. The consortium was selected by the mediators, with the agreement of the parties to the cease-fire deal. The legality of the consortium's work has not yet been clarified. For example it is not clear who would investigate a fatal shooting incident if one occurs. Would it be Israel Police? The U.S.?

Aner Shapira's baguette truck	New food truck inspires soldiers, in memory of fallen Nova festival hero A new food truck is delivering warm baguette sandwiches to soldiers on the frontlines in Gaza, Lebanon, Judea, and Samaria in honor of fallen civilian-soldier Aner Shapira. Shapira attended the Nova music festival on October 7, the day Hamas infiltrated Israel and began a killing spree. While returning to his military base, he was forced to detour due to gunfire on the highway. He pulled over and entered a shelter where 24 people were already hiding. Shapira, noticing the panic among those inside, reassured them and urged them to remain calm. He instructed them to hide and cover their heads with their hands. Standing in the center of the room with a broken beer bottle as a makeshift weapon, he prepared to defend the group. The terrorists began firing and throwing grenades into the shelter. Shapira heroically caught and returned the first eight grenades to the attackers. Tragically, an RPG eventually exploded, taking his life. Known for his love of cooking, Shapira often made shakshuka and other classic Israeli dishes for his friends. To honor his memory, the NGO Nechama and Hatzala launched a food truck that delivers baguettes to soldiers, inspiring them to remember Shapira’s bravery and remain motivated in their mission.

Liquid prophecy: Father-daughter duo crafts ‘Biblical’ wine	A boutique winery and lodge in a remote settlement is creating a vibrant gathering space despite political and logistical challenges The winding Samaria roads leading to Esh Kodesh are dizzying—both breathtakingly beautiful and steep, making the drive awe-inspiring and a little intimidating. But once you reach the top of the hill, located 35 kilometers from Jerusalem and home to only a few dozen families, the view is nothing short of spectacular. From this vantage point, you can see the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan River Valley to the east. Nestled in the heart of this small community is a charming wooden cabin that looks like something out of Little House on the Prairie, complete with a slanted roof and large windows. In the frigid cold of winter, the windows fog up; inside, it’s toasty and inviting. Settlers Winery & Lodge opened just two months ago, and it has already become one of, if not the, most happening spots in the Binyamin region on Thursday and Saturday nights. Hundreds of locals and visitors from across the country come to drink wine, enjoy good food, and jam to live music until dawn. The lodge is the brainchild of A.Y. Katsof, a 40-year-old resident of Esh Kodesh. Katsof, who has lived in the community for 15 years, essentially built his house with his own two hands. In 2011, he planted his first rows of grapes, inspired by a vision to make wine in the hills of Samaria, just as described in Jeremiah 31:5: 'Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit.' In 2017, he bottled his first label, Settlers Cellar. Since then, the boutique winery has been producing thousands of bottles annually, primarily sold through a private wine club. The wine is also available at the bar—but you won’t find it in stores. Katsof’s then-7-year-old daughter, Neomi, planted those first grapes alongside him. Now 19, Neomi is running the bar with her father, managing a two-cabin bed-and-breakfast, and helping with the winery. With her blond hair, feisty attitude and cowboy boots, she strides through the restaurant with visible pride in what she and her father are building together — although much of the past year, Katsof was away serving in the reserves. Around 9 p.m., the bar begins to fill, starting with a small group of soldiers, followed by young women, likely from a nearby seminary. By midnight, it’s packed. The lights are dim, and as guests grow livelier, the music becomes more eclectic—country, rap, rock, Israeli melodies, even meditative tunes. Instruments like darbukas, guitars, and a small keyboard come out for an open mic session that feels like karaoke but is far more spontaneous and soulful. 'People come from all over Israel: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Raanana, Gedera,' Katsof said. 'We often talk about normalization with Arab countries. This wine bar is normalization among ourselves, among Israelis.' Katsof explained that people connect through the music, which he calls 'jams.' 'Around 12:30 a.m., the music really gets going,' Katsof says as he picks up a guitar to play a soft rock song. His mellow voice fills the room as he sings some of the greatest hits of the ’70s and ’80s. 'Random people get up, bring instruments — country, blues, reggae,' Katsof continued. 'People play guitar solos until the sun rises. Some fall asleep on the couch. Others sleep in their cars.' The menu varies, reflecting the challenges of living in a remote location where food isn’t always easily accessible and you have to be planful. Esh Kodesh is fairly isolated, with the nearest community, Shiloh, about 15 minutes away. There’s a small market in Esh Kodesh with limited hours, and a slightly larger one in Shiloh. For major shopping trips, residents drive to Ariel, 19 kilometers away. On this particular Thursday night, the menu features kosher cheeseburgers—made with kosher meat and vegan cheese—along with fries and pickles. There are also mini schnitzel bites – fried chicken patties. They discover they forgot the lettuce, so just go with the flow. 'It’s hard work,' Neomi said. She recalled planting grapes for the first time as a child, waking up early to help her father before heading to school. 'It wasn’t like a walk in the park,' she admitted, rolling her eyes slightly. 'But at the end of the day, I definitely enjoyed the work, and I still do. We’ve planted a lot.' Working with family, Neomi acknowledged, can 'be very hard.' After spending several months working on a farm, she returned to Esh Kodesh to help her father. 'It’s a lot of responsibility,' she said, 'but I think the hard work is good for me. I love being busy. If there’s nothing to do, I go crazy.' Her feistiness is evident in her big, round eyes. Her long blond hair falls below her waist, and her cowboy boots make sharp clicks on the wooden bar floor as she sets down ketchup bottles and tea light candles in glass holders to brighten the tables. Since starting to work at the winery, Neomi said she has developed a deep appreciation for wine. As her father serves samples of their varieties, she often weighs in on her favorites. With practiced ease, she flips out glasses and pours just enough to give a taste, careful not to waste what her father calls 'liquid prophecy' — wine sourced from the land of the Bible, fulfilling the verse in Jeremiah. Not everyone supports what Katsof is doing. Esh Kodesh has the added complication of having been built without authorization from the Israeli government and is therefore also considered illegal under Israeli law. It was included in the 1999 'outpost agreement' with Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s government, which evacuated some outposts, moved others, and permitted others to remain in place but did not formally legalize their status. 'Settlers are pioneers' In 2015, Ariel Handel, a professor at Tel Aviv University, coined the term 'wine-washing' in a paper examining the winemaking industry in these disputed areas. A few years later, an opinion writer for Al Jazeera adopted the term, claiming that 'Israel is using its wine industry to distract from its other domestic pastimes like ethnic cleansing, apartheid, and the periodic massacre of Palestinians.' Critics argue that the emphasis on winemaking in the region serves to whitewash its realities. Instead of viewing the occupied territories as a site of checkpoints, clashes and violence, the focus shifts to portraying them as destinations for fine wine, tourism, and an idyllic quality of life. For years, Settlers Cellar focused exclusively on producing deep red wines, primarily cabernet sauvignons. However, in recent years, the winery has started experimenting with bubbly rosés and other new creations. Katsof opens a bottle of their pink wine. It has a bottle cap, similar to a glass soda bottle, and inside is a slightly bubbly elixir. The wine is sweet but not overly so—perfect for a summer day on the beach, a sailing trip across the Mediterranean, or a picnic in the desert, all quintessential Israeli pastimes. 'You go to France, you drink champagne,' Katsof explained. 'You go to Spain, you drink cava. If you go to the hilltops of Judea and Samaria, you drink ‘buot.’' 'Buot,' which means bubbles in Hebrew, is a sparkling wine that Katsof is developing specifically for the region. 'Every region has its own terroir. Planting grapes in the hills of Samaria is not easy. After 4,000 years, when the Jews returned here, this land was covered in forest,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The terrain is challenging, with limestone hills that are difficult to farm. The region’s cold mornings, hot days, and cooler evenings create additional hardships for the vines. But Katsof believes these challenges result in stronger, more flavorful grapes. He named the winery 'Settlers Cellar' not to evoke the negative connotations associated with the term, but because, as he put it, he and his family came to a deserted hilltop and settled it. 'Settlers are pioneers,' Katsof said. The early days were not easy. Arab residents would occasionally break into the vineyard and burn the fields. As a boutique winery, Settlers Cellar can experiment with small batches. 'Sometimes we get lucky, and sometimes we get even luckier,' Katsof admitted with a grin. Still, he believes they’re only scratching the surface of what they can achieve. 'We are just starting to figure out how to create special, unique flavors,' Katsof said. Neither Katsof nor his daughter is formally trained in winemaking. They’ve learned on the job, relying on advice from friends in the industry. For Neomi, like her dad, the work is about more than just making wine—it’s about fulfilling a spiritual mission. 'My siblings and I are very connected to the Bible and the land. Every Shabbat meal, my father tells us another story about the prophets or the Torah, so we understand. The land was promised to us by God, and it says to plant vineyards in the mountains of Samaria. So that’s what we are here doing,' she explained. Their work has also inspired Christian believers. Each season, a group of volunteers from the center and southern United States travels to Israel through an organization called HaYovel to help harvest the grapes. 'The world is against Israel’s right to live in their biblical homeland,' the group’s website states. 'We bring Christians to Israel to serve the land and people, enabling them to connect to the land of their faith, restore Christian-Jewish relations, and confirm Israel’s right to their ancestral homeland.' Other Christians living in or visiting Israel have also supported Katsof’s efforts, including Henry Strauss, the spouse of Ilse Strauss from the Bridges for Peace organization. Strauss, alongside others, helped build the wine bar, contributing his labor and bringing in like-minded volunteers. 'There is no Arab labor here — only Jewish and Christian labor,' Katsof said. 'They are very, very busy, but they volunteer to help us because they believe in helping Jews.' Katsof has six children, ranging in age from 19 to 8. His 16-year-old son Yisroel often helps out in the kitchen. Katsof shared a touching story: two soldiers, grieving the recent loss of a close friend who died in Gaza, came to the bar one night to jam. They played their guitars until the early hours of the morning. A few days later, one of the soldiers asked Neomi out on a date, and they’ve been seeing each other ever since. Nearly every night the bar is open, the young man—whom they refer to only as 'N.'—returns to drink, hang out, and enjoy the atmosphere. As the sun rises, Neomi and N. often sit on the stage to play music together. Neomi, who has a beautiful voice, is shy and only sings after her work is done. Katsof looked at his daughter with a smile. 'If they end up together, this whole winery will be worth it just for them.'

'I’d like to get them living in an area where they can live without disruption and revolution and violence,' Trump said. 'When you look at the Gaza Strip, it’s been hell for so many years…There have been various civilizations on that strip. It didn’t start here. It started thousands of years before, and there’s always been violence associated with it. You could get people living in areas that are a lot safer and maybe a lot better and maybe a lot more comfortable,' he said. The president told reporters on Air Force One that he hoped the Egyptian president would agree to take the Gazan's in and said the United States provided Egypt with much aid and he was sure el-Sisi, whom he called a friend, could help.

Syria intercepts weapons shipment destined for Hezbollah	New Damascus rulers fins a variety of weapons and missiles near the Lebanese border, signaling a resurgence in the group’s smuggling operations despite prior setbacks The Ministry of Interior in Syria's new administration announced on Sunday that it had seized a shipment of weapons allegedly intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah group. A media source from the Syrian Ministry of Interior stated that the General Directorate of Border Security intercepted the shipment on smuggling routes along the Syrian-Lebanese border. The source told The Media Line that the operation took place near the city of Serghaya in the Damascus countryside, an area where Hezbollah has reportedly been increasing its activity. In a related development, the Public Security Directorate of the Syrian Ministry of Interior announced last week the thwarting of another arms smuggling operation aimed at Lebanon. The shipment reportedly contained a variety of weapons. The General Security Directorate in the coastal province of Tartus said it intercepted the shipment, which was headed to Lebanon through illegal crossings, in coordination with the province's intelligence agency. According to officials, the shipment was seized before crossing into Lebanese territory. It included a variety of weapons and missiles. Images released by the directorate showed the confiscated items, which included sniper rifles, machine guns, Russian-made AK-47 rifles, grenade launchers, and three boxes containing missiles. Although Hezbollah has lost several vital supply routes in recent years—most notably its Syrian corridor, which facilitated arms transfers from Iran—the group appears to be resuming its illicit activities. In December, Hezbollah’s Secretary-General, Naim Qassem, acknowledged the impact of these disruptions. He admitted that developments in Syria have directly affected Lebanon and Hezbollah’s operations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with several other party commanders, as well as the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah's activities in arms smuggling and drug production have declined significantly. However, recent events suggest a resurgence of the group’s operations, albeit on a smaller scale. This resurgence poses significant challenges to Syria's new administration as it grapples with securing its borders and curbing Hezbollah's influence in the region.

Freed hostages share experiences with friends and family	IDF lookouts witnessed their friends murdered, other dying of wounds; terrorists guarding them forbade crying or holding hands but the girls found ways to support each other; the picked up Arabic and use black humor to process their ordeal Since their release from Hamas captivity on Saturday, the four IDF lookouts have been telling their families about the long months when they were held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. 'The are talking all the time about their experiences. They are telling all, perhaps out of a sense that they have to let it all out,' some who have been with the girls, said. They were aware of the events during the Oct. 7 massacre because they were abducted by the terrorists, relatively late and understood the magnitude of the atrocities. People around them said they spoke of what had transpired in the shelter that they were in, where they watched their friends slowly die or be murdered and that had a significant effect on them. They also said they used black humor to communicate and are spending the time at the Beilinson Hospital to be together surrounded by close friends and family. The girls have picked up good Arabic language skills and occasionally drop a word in Arabic in their sentences. A few of them contacted other hostages that were free, who had been with them in Gaza. All the girls have met up with friends and Liri united with her partner Nir, and was happy to see him on his feet after he was badly hurt in a terrorist ramming attack and has been in a wheel chair. After he was operated on last March, he was able to walk with the help of crutches. Naama Levy was held hostage on her own for a long time until she was united with the other girls. Then she asked them if they were really alive. Four of the girls tried to pass the time with physical exercise despite to difficult condition they were held in and the lack of food. The terrorists who guarded them did not allow them to hold hands or cry but they found ways to support each other.

Closet leading to tunnel shaft: Ynet joins IDF forces in Jenin	Military continues its West Bank counterterror operation in Jenin, now expanding to Tulkarm and exposing dangerous terror infrastructure in the area Security forces expanded their West Bank counterterror operations on Monday to the Palestinian town of Tulkarm, where Hamas terror cell leader Ihab Abu Atiyya was killed in an airstrike. In a tour of the Jenin refugee camp, the extensive destruction from the operation is evident. The camp is now in ruins, with D9 bulldozers visible from afar. Most residents have left and security officials stressed the military allowed them to leave via designated routes. 'Large forces are currently operating in the camp during the initial stages of the operation, which will continue indefinitely,' the IDF said in a statement. 'This comes after dozens of operations in Tulkarm, Nur al-Shams and Jenin since the start of the war, aimed at dismantling terror infrastructures.' So far, 15 terrorists have been killed, over 40 injured and more than 35 Palestinians have been detained for questioning. Forces have destroyed several booby-trapped apartments and command centers and continue to search for weapons, explosives labs and terror hideouts. IDF Combat Engineering Corps units are clearing pathways around the camp. A security source said that approximately 60 buildings in the camp were demolished in the past week. 'Opening a 450-meter route in such dense terrain takes nearly two days,' they explained, noting the challenges of operating in such conditions. Col. A, a brigade commander who was moderately injured last month in an explosion in Tulkarm, said, 'The difference in this operation lies in the mission: completely neutralizing the Jenin battalion. We have the resources, forces and firepower needed, as well as the time it requires.' 'We started the operation with tactical ingenuity, applying pressure on terrorists in the camp's center, eliminating those who remain and intercepting escapees with intelligence-backed special forces,' he added. Senior IDF Central Command officials suggested the operation might last months to fully dismantle the battalion, which has become a symbol in the West Bank, drawing both fleeing terrorists and significant funding from Iran and other sources via Hamas. During the tour, Lt. Col. D, commander of an IDF reconnaissance Unit, presented a room containing weapons and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) connected to gas canisters. 'Something that looks like a child’s wardrobe conceals a hole leading to a hidden shaft where terrorists stored arms,' he explained. 'The room also contained a surveillance command center equipped with computers monitoring our forces’ movements through cameras installed in the camp,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Outside another room, forces discovered additional ready-to-use explosives and a vehicle rigged as a car bomb. A soldier described these IEDs as 'dangerously unstable but highly lethal,' adding they are often transported to other areas and used on roads near settlements. The operation involves units from various IDF combat infantry units, Border Police units, UAV operators and attack helicopters when needed. However, the mission has not been without cost.

The Iranian handler saw potential' interrogation of spies reveal...	Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev tell police they knew they were speaking with an Iranian handler who wanted information on fighter jets and military bases in the country After 21-year-old IDF reserve soldiers Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev were arrested on suspicion of spying and providing classified information to Iran on Monday, their claims during their interrogation showed a worrying picture about Tehran’s incessant efforts to obtain information on Israel. 'The Iranian agent asked me in messages where I served. I replied, ‘The Iron Dome.' He wrote, 'Prove it,' so I sent him a video from the base,' Eliasfov said during his interrogation. Eliasfov revealed the Iranian agent questioned how his friends reacted when he told them about spraying graffiti for him. 'They told me to be careful and called me a spy,' he said. He added that his partner asked him to cut ties with the agent, saying, 'Please block him.' 'This was early on, so I blocked him,' Eliasfov said. 'Later, when media reports about agents emerged, she sent me the articles and said, 'See? It’s a good thing you stopped.'' Superintendent Sarit Peretz of Israel Police’s Lahav 433's National Unit for Serious and International Crime Investigations explained, 'Initially, we thought they were active-duty soldiers but we later realized they were reservists and involved the Shin Bet and Military Police. This case exposed us to classified materials, requiring us to collaborate with military investigators.' Peretz said the suspects were arrested at home, where they were 'shocked' but quickly connected their detention to activities for Iran. 'Initially, they downplayed the incident, but as the investigation deepened, they acknowledged their awareness of the agent, the damage their actions caused and the potential consequences,' Peretz noted. The suspects admitted they knew they were communicating with a foreign agent but tried to claim uncertainty. Evidence, including a Ynet article they discussed about Iranian espionage, tied them directly to their actions. 'The graffiti spraying was a starting point for more significant operations,' Peretz said. Andreyev reportedly decided to stop cooperating after realizing the implications, but not before assisting Eliasfov in coordinating with the agent. Eliasfov allegedly filmed classified information from the Iron Dome base and sent it to Iranian handlers. 'He claimed he only sent part of the video, but the full footage is in Iranian hands,' Peretz said. Iranian requests included technical data on Air Force fighter jets, information on military bases and aerial footage of IDF facilities such as Nevatim Airbase and military headquarters in Tel Aviv. Eliasfov also forged operational orders about an IDF raid in Lebanon and offered to sell ammunition. 'The Iranian handler saw the potential there — a connection to someone in Iron Dome and another in the IDF HQ. That’s a goldmine,' Peretz added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked if their families were aware, Peretz said, 'One of Yuri’s family members knew and warned him against it. Friends and coworkers suspected something but dismissed it as just graffiti.' She stressed, 'Even graffiti can create fear and signals Iranian infiltration into Israel.' Regarding national security risks, Peretz concluded, 'In the right hands, this information is very dangerous and will move to someone who can use it. I hope the military addresses the vulnerabilities.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjey58s00jx	2025-01-27T11:03:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/Sy9XdRV00kg/Sy9XdRV00kg_102_0_1069_601_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah leader says group rejects delay in IDF withdrawal from ...	In speech, terror group's Director-General Naim Qassem attacks Lebanon's political leaders for speaking out against Hezbollah alleging they disappeared during Israeli attacks; Qassem also accuses Israel of assassinating a senior commander Hezbollah's Director-General Naim Qassem said on Monday that the Iran-backed terror group does not accept the delay in the IDF withdrawal from South Lebanon, 'by even a single day.' In a televised address Qassem attacked Lebanon’s political leaders, accusing them of 'raising their voices against the resistance and disappearing during Israeli attacks. 'He can't grant Israel any concessions,' he said of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun. 'Does the U.S. expect to find someone in Lebanon who will accept continued Israeli attacks? That won’t happen. All consequences from the delay in Israel’s withdrawal are the responsibility of the UN and the U.S.,' he said. 'The enemy requested to halt attacks and we agreed because we didn't seek them in the first place,' he added. 'We didn't decide on war. We agreed to the cease-fire because the state decided to defend its borders and expel Israel. This is an opportunity for the state to fulfill its duties and prove its capabilities on the political level.' Qassem said Hezbollah did not expect to lose so many of its leaders in such a short time. 'The leaking of information, the enemy's media control and its air force contributed to the attacks against us.' Following Hezbollah's provocations in southern Lebanon on Sunday which led to 22 deaths from IDF fire, Qassem declared, 'We won because we returned and because Israel will withdraw against its will.' 'Hezbollah soldiers haven’t left the area and Hezbollah remains steadfast and strong. We chose patience and refrained from responding to Israeli violations, despite feelings of humiliation and a desire for revenge.'

All those on motorbikes, are Hezbollah' Lebanon border once agai...	Hezbollah operatives parade in villages of South Lebanon, once again posing a threat despite an agreement that should keep them far away Dozens of Lebanese roamed freely in the ruins of Al-Matmura village, near the border fence facing the western Galilee on Sunday. The area was vacated by IDF forces on January 11, and the Lebanese army was expected to secure it and prevent residents from returning. However, no Lebanese army presence was visible in the area overlooking Israel. IDF troops looked on, wary of possible anti-tank missile or gunfire that could escalate tensions and reignite the war with Hezbollah after the cease-fire in southern Lebanon ended overnight without an Israeli withdrawal. Nearby, sporadic gunfire echoed as the military worked to prevent the return of Hezbollah terrorists, disguised as civilians, to restricted areas. Earlier, a senior correspondent for the Hezbollah-affiliated al-Mayadeen network, Ali Mortada broadcast from the village ruins. 'Israel is having a very bad day,' he mocked. Meanwhile, locals hoisted Hezbollah flags and fixed them into the ground, while motorcycles and vehicles moved freely through the streets, with some riders approaching the Israeli border fence. 'Anyone riding a motorcycle there is a Hezbollah operative,' a young local said, requesting anonymity because he had family across the border. Israel 'can't stop the Sunni villagers from returning,' he added, 'These are their homes.' A nearby shepherd, reflecting on the conflict. 'War is bad. What's happening there isn’t good,' he said. Over the past year, most of the 2,000 residents of Arab Al-Aramshe located near the border with Lebanon, remained in their homes despite frequent Hezbollah drone and missile attacks targeting Israeli military positions in the village. In October 2023, a Hezbollah terror cell infiltrated the village, killing three soldiers, including Col. Alim Saad. The attackers arrived from Al-Matmura, which housed vast stockpiles of advanced weapons and fortified combat positions, later seized by Israeli forces. The area was handed over to the Lebanese army two weeks ago. Recent social media footage shows Hezbollah operatives, including civilians, attempting to reclaim destroyed border villages, taunting nearby Israeli forces who responded with warning shots. 'The Lebanese army isn't preventing Hezbollah's return to these areas, as Israel feared,' Retired Lt. Col. Sarit Zehavi, head of the Israeli Alma Research Center think tank, said. Eitan Davidi, head of Margaliot’s local council, added, 'We can't accept breaches or allow residents to return under these conditions.' 'The situation requires maintaining strategic positions to ensure northern residents' safety. If Lebanon objects, Israel should be prepared to resume the conflict,' he said, addressing the agreement seeking to implement UN Resolution 1701 from 2006 which Israeli residents now fear is not enough to prevent Hezbollah from recuperating its strength in Lebanon and ensure their safety.

Lookout soldier Maya Desiatnik survived October 7. The return of ...	Maya saw her fellow soldiers killed and kidnapped during the Hamas attack and massacre at Nahal Oz, where she was stationed at the military base; She has been plagued by PTSD, nightmares, and overwhelming survivor’s guilt For Maya Desiatnik, the morning of October 7, 2023, will forever be etched in her memory as the day her world changed forever. On that fateful morning, Hamas, the terrorist organization ruling Gaza, launched an unprecedented and brutal attack on Israel. Among their targets was the Nahal Oz military base near the Gaza border, where Maya was stationed as a lookout soldier. 'I will never forget what I saw through the surveillance cameras,' Maya recalls, her voice heavy with emotion. 'The terrorists breached the border effortlessly, storming into our base. Chaos erupted as they advanced, leaving destruction in their wake.' Trapped in the command center with her fellow lookout soldiers, Maya endured hours of terror as gunfire and explosions echoed around them. When the terrorists set the command center on fire, Maya narrowly escaped, but her fellow soldiers and friends were not as fortunate. 'I was the only one who survived,' she says, her voice breaking. 'I lost my closest friends that day. The memories of them and their bravery are with me always.' In the aftermath of the attack, Maya faced a new and more complicated battle. Her physical injuries from smoke inhalation eventually healed, but the emotional scars run far deeper. Plagued by PTSD, nightmares, and overwhelming survivor’s guilt, Maya has struggled to find her footing. During her recovery, the fact that not all her friends had perished that day, and instead were taken captive by Hamas, gave her a sliver of hope. The knowledge that Daniella, Liri, Naama and Karina, had reportedly been taken captive by Hamas became both a source of strength and a tormenting uncertainty. Months passed, Maya traveled to New York with a delegation from the organization Belev Echad - an international nonprofit dedicated to helping injured soldiers. There Maya was confronted with heart-wrenching images of her friends in captivity. 'I didn’t want to see them,' she recalls. 'But when I did, I recognized Daniella immediately because of the tattoo on her arm. It was a moment of both hope and pain, knowing they were alive but trapped in such unimaginable circumstances.' Just last week, Maya’s world shifted once more. While on another advocacy mission with Belev Echad in Cleveland, Ohio, she received the news she had prayed for: her friends had been released and were on their way home to Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I felt a tidal wave of emotions – relief, joy, anger, everything at once,' she says. 'Relief that they were alive, joy that they were safe, but also anger at Hamas for dragging this out, for separating us, for trying to claim some twisted victory in the end.' Maya’s reaction was raw and immediate. 'I broke down and cried,' she admits. 'For the first time, I cried tears of happiness. It felt like a weight had been lifted. For so long, my life revolved around ensuring their stories weren’t forgotten, and now, they are free. They are home.' This moment of closure marked a profound turning point for Maya. For over a year, she has lived with the singular purpose of advocating for her friends’ freedom, unable to imagine a future beyond her grief. 'Now, I finally feel like I can breathe,' she says. 'For the first time, I’m allowing myself to think about the future – studying, traveling, and rebuilding the life I put on hold.' She currently is traveling to college campuses across the United States under the auspices of Belev Echad, sharing her story, and ensuring the world hears the truth about Israel and the sacrifices made by its people. Through her lectures, Maya is not just educating audiences but also inspiring them. Her story is one of survival, resilience and the unbreakable bond between friends. 'Their release is not just a moment of joy; it’s a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the strength we find in each other,' she says. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1rw5mbuyg	2025-01-27T06:03:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/BJ2o6GH001x/BJ2o6GH001x_65_580_919_518_0_small.jpg
Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander says Iran purchased Russian...	Iran has purchased Russian-made Sukhoi-35 fighter jets, a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said on Monday, amid Western concerns about Tehran and Moscow's growing military cooperation. This is the first time an Iranian official has confirmed the purchase of Su-35 jets. However, Ali Shadmani, who was quoted by the Student News Network, did not clarify how many jets were purchased and whether they had already been delivered to Iran. 'If the enemy acts foolishly, it will taste the bitter taste of being hit by our missiles, and none of its interests in the occupied territories will remain safe,' Shadmani warned referring to Israel. Iran's air force has only a few dozen strike aircraft, including Russian jets as well as ageing U.S. models acquired before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj211hwrdye	2025-01-27T04:38:10-08:00

Hamas list confirms fate of hostages: 25 reported alive out of 33...	Hamas confirms 25 Israeli hostages are alive; Israel says list aligns with intelligence assessments; 'The families have been updated' Hamas has handed over to mediators a list showing that 25 Israeli hostages are still alive, out of 33 scheduled for release, an official of the group told Reuters on Monday. He said Israel had received the list from the mediators of the Gaza cease-fire agreement. According to Israeli officials, the list was divided into categories: women and men, living and deceased. The list revealed that the majority of the additional 26 hostages slated for release in the first phase are still alive. Israeli authorities updated the families. Some were informed that the list confirms the assessment that their loved ones are alive. But other families were given the difficult news that the information received confirms grave concerns about the lives of their loved ones. However, it was clarified to these families that a hostage cannot be officially declared dead while their body remains in captivity unless Israel obtains unequivocal evidence. Families whose fears for their loved ones' lives were confirmed by the Hamas list received personal calls overnight and into the morning from the Coordinator for POWs and MIAs, Brigadier General (res.) Gal Hirsch. Some families, who have been receiving consistent updates based on reliable information independent of the Hamas list, are unwilling to accept the situation, as there has been no definitive confirmation of death. As a result, they maintain hope that their loved ones are still alive. Additionally, Hirsch released a statement to all the families regarding the agreements reached overnight concerning civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud, the upcoming releases scheduled in the following days, details about the list received from Hamas, and the opening of the Netzarim Corridor to the northern part of the Gaza Strip on Monday morning. Israeli officials stated overnight that the list provided contained no surprises and aligned almost exactly with intelligence assessments. Prior to receiving the list, Israel had assessed that out of the 33 hostages expected to be released in the first phase, 25 were alive. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The guarantee Israel received for Arbel’s release was a public declaration from the United States and Qatar. The delay in her release was primarily due to internal power struggles between Islamic Jihad and the Resistance Committees, with the expectation that Hamas would enforce a resolution — something that ultimately occurred. Hours after learning that Arbel would be released from captivity this coming Thursday, her family from Nir Oz issued a statement expressing their feelings. 'We are experiencing complex, emotional and nerve-wracking days,' they wrote. 'We long for the moment when we can once again embrace our Arbel and pray for the return of all the hostages.' Arbel, who has been in captivity for 479 days, is set to be released in three days, along with the only remaining female IDF lookout in captivity, Agam Berger, and another unnamed hostage. This unusual phase of the deal was reached to resolve the cease-fire crisis. Three additional hostages are expected to be released on Saturday. The crisis began after the list of female hostages scheduled to be released in the second phase of the deal was published last Saturday evening, and Arbel, a kidnapped civilian, was not included — contrary to the agreements between Israel and Hamas. In addition, Hamas failed to provide the agreed-upon list of hostages by midnight on Saturday, only submitting it on Sunday near midnight. Once the list was handed over to Israel, families were promptly updated. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry000glhdje	2025-01-27T04:28:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/23/BJf44Z3EPa/BJf44Z3EPa_181_87_2574_1449_0_small.jpg
Gaza hostages held in tunnels for over 8 months, were starved, ID...	They had little to no human contact and showed signs of 'mild starvation'; Hostages said their treatment improved in the days leading up to their release including more food and showers Some of the hostages released from Gaza so far during the current cease-fire had been held in Hamas tunnels for up to eight months straight, deprived of daylight and with little to no human contact, an Israeli general said on Monday. Three Israeli civilians and four soldiers - all women - have been released so far in the most recent cease-fire, which began on Jan. 19. In return, Israel has released 290 Palestinian terrorists and murderer, and detainees. 'Some of them told us that they've been in the past few months, that they've been through the entire time, in tunnels, underground,' deputy chief of the Israeli military's medical corps, Colonel Dr. Avi Banov, told journalists online. 'Some of them were alone through the entire time they were there,' he said. 'Those who said they were together were in better shape.' The Israeli military oversees the first health checks that the hostages receive upon their arrival in Israeli territory. Reuters was unable to reach Hamas' armed wing for comment but the terror group that perpetrated a massacre on southern Israel 15 months ago said on Saturday that it maintains hostages' wellbeing. The hostages said their treatment improved in the days leading up to their release, Banov said, when they were allowed to shower, change their clothes and received better food. They appeared to be in good condition and smiling in videos on the days of their release. Citing the hostages' privacy, Banov would not say whether any of the seven bore signs of torture or abuse. Some had not received proper treatment for wounds sustained when they were captured during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and some showed signs of 'mild starvation,' Banov said. The three civilians, released on the first day of the cease-fire, were discharged from hospital on Sunday. The four soldiers, freed in the cease-fire's second swap on Saturday, were still being treated in another medical center. Eitan Gonen, father of 24-year-old Romi Gonen who was released on Jan. 19, told Israel's public broadcaster Kan: 'Romi is amazing. We met a mature, amazing woman who stunned us all.' Gonen would not elaborate on her medical condition or details of her ordeal. But he said that while in captivity she had heard some of the radio interviews he had given. 'Even if only 10% of the interviews reach the hostages' ears, it is enough to give them strength,' he said. 'It gave her a lot of strength, energy and great hope.' More than 250 hostages were abducted in the Hamas attack in October 2023. Around half were released the following month during the war's only previous truce, and others have been recovered dead or alive during the fighting. Israel still lists 90 captives in Gaza, with around 30 declared dead in absentia. Twenty-six women, children, elderly, ill or injured hostages are still meant to be released in the six-week first phase of the cease-fire. Hamas provided a list late on Sunday detailing their condition, at least eight of them reportedly are dead. Israeli authorities have said that they believe most due to be released in the first phase are alive and they fear for the lives of the rest. They have given no new details since receiving the list. Banov said he expected that some of next hostages 'will be more ill and also people who have died during their time in Gaza.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skkogzsd1x	2025-01-27T04:14:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/ryrLroMOyl/ryrLroMOyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Three other people were moderately and lightly injured and were evacuated to the government hospital in Tulkarm. Footage from the scene shows the vehicle engulfed in flames. Since the start of Operation Iron Wall at the beginning of last week, two commanders of the Al-Qassam Brigades in the camp have been reported killed, including Abu Atiwa, as well as the commander of the Jenin Brigade affiliated with Islamic Jihad. Earlier Monday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health announced one man was dead and two moderately injured as a result of IDF gunfire near the Qalandiya camp. At the same time, the IDF's Iron Wall operation in Jenin continued, and the Palestinians published footage of terrorist houses that were set on fire or destroyed as a result of the forces' activities. This is the seventh day of the IDF and Central Command operation in the Jenin refugee camp and surrounding villages, and so far 16 people have been killed and about 50 injured. According to the IDF, the forces have destroyed about 20 IEDs and dozens of pipe bombs, including using D9 engineering tools that exposed axes around the camp.

IDF reservists arrested for spying for Iran: 'Very sensitive info...	Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev are suspected of contact with a foreign agent, passing classified information, and aiding the enemy in war; Eliasfov admitted that he sent his Iranian handler a video he recorded of the Iron Dome system, saying 'I got into a difficult financial situation'; they were first asked to spray pro-Iranian graffiti in Tel Aviv Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev, 21-year-old IDF reserve soldiers from the Kiryat Shmona area, are at the center of another Iranian espionage case. A prosecutor's statement has been filed against the two in preparation for an indictment for contact with a foreign agent, passing classified information to a foreign entity, and aiding the enemy in wartime, the Rishon LeZion Magistrate Yuval Kedar allowed to be made public, despite the opposition of the defense attorneys who requested that the names of the two remain confidential at this stage. Their detention will be extended until Friday for the filing of an indictment in the Haifa District Court. Eliasfov is the main suspect and, according to the investigation, as part of his job search, he contacted an Iranian operator on social media. To begin with, he sprayed graffiti in Tel Aviv, after his handler asked him to spray the inscription 'Children of Ruhollah' - the first leader of Iran after the Islamic Revolution. He recruited his friend Andreyev, by convincing him that it was easy money. At one point, they exchanged Israeli media articles about Iranian espionage over the past year, including one about the previous spy who was caught. They talked about the possible punishments, and Andreyev - who was serving as a reservist in the Kirya defense department headquarters at the time - got scared and stopped cooperating. Eliasfov began his career as a spy as a soldier in regular service and continued in the reserves. He served in Iron Dome, and was exposed to classified information. At the request of his handlers, he filmed and transmitted a video of the system, which contains information at the highest classification level. By the time he was caught, Eliasfov had managed to receive $2,500, while Andreyev only $50. Both admitted to the accusations during the interrogations, and talked about the tasks they were assigned, the information they passed on, and the payments they received.

Identity of the new Germany in question as far-right AfD party ga...	Concerns about Holocaust trivialization and nationalist policies underscore the growing anxiety over the influence of the far-right party, which evolved into a powerful political force and recently won the endorsement of Elon Musk Strong relations with Israel and a commitment to commemorating the Holocaust have been central tenets in Germany’s identity since the end of the Nazi regime, and especially since German reunification. But the identity of the new Germany now seems to be in question, as the far-right Alternative for Germany party, known by its German-language initials AfD, is polling over 20% leading up to the federal election on February 23. The AfD was founded in 2013 as a movement critical of the European Union. In the years since, it’s evolved into a powerful political force, blending anti-immigration rhetoric with nationalist policies. Following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-party government last November, the AfD has capitalized on discontent over Germany’s open borders and economic policies, drawing voters disillusioned with traditional conservative parties. The far-right party has been in second place in the most recent polls for the general elections, raising concerns among Jews in Germany and abroad. The party has expressed strong support for Israel, especially following the October 7 attacks, but party leaders have also been accused of trivializing Holocaust history. Some are concerned that relations with Israel and the German Jewish community could be affected even if the party doesn’t have enough popular support to win the chancellorship. With the federal elections getting closer, the rise of the AfD forces a critical question: Under a party pushing such divisive rhetoric, could Germany remain a modern democracy rooted in historical responsibility? In December 2024, Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, publicly endorsed the party, stating on his social media platform X that 'only the AfD can save Germany.' He further supported the party by authoring an op-ed in Die Welt, criticizing traditional parties and advocating for the AfD’s platform. In January 2025, Musk hosted a livestream with AfD leader Alice Weidel, discussing various topics and bolstering the party’s visibility. Later that month, he made a virtual appearance at an AfD campaign rally in Halle, addressing 4,500 attendees and emphasizing the importance of preserving German culture while moving beyond past guilt associated with the Nazi era. Musk’s involvement has been met with significant criticism from German political figures, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who condemned his actions as interference in Germany’s democratic process. Additionally, during President Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration, Musk faced backlash for making a gesture resembling a Nazi salute, which he dismissed as an overreaction. Emmanuel Navon, an international relations lecturer at Tel Aviv University and senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, attributed the AfD’s appeal to the disillusionment of traditional conservative voters in Germany. 'Angela Merkel’s policies on immigration and the economy alienated segments of the electorate who now find refuge in the AfD,' according to Navon. The AfD has capitalized on fears of immigration and the erosion of national identity, he said, themes that resonate deeply in many European nations facing similar political shifts. Similarly, Carsten Ovens, executive director of a German organization devoted to promoting relations between Israel and European countries, said that the AfD’s growth is part of a broader trend of polarization in Germany exacerbated by economic crises and societal transformations. 'Since the reunification of Germany, the eastern regions have faced rapid systemic changes,' Ovens, a former member of the Hamburg state Parliament, said, pointing to the financial crisis of 2008 and the 2015 refugee crisis as critical junctures increasing polarization. This polarization, Ovens said, has nurtured extremism on both ends of the political spectrum. 'While the AfD’s strength is particularly pronounced in the east, it has become a nationwide problem,' he said. 'The AfD at its core is a racist and antisemitic party and a threat to Jewish life in Germany and abroad.' Indeed, the AfD’s growth has sparked anxiety within Germany’s Jewish community. While most antisemitic violence in Europe today stems from far-left and Islamist groups, the AfD’s rhetoric concerning Germany’s Nazi past has drawn sharp criticism from Jewish groups. Alexander Gauland, the party’s honorary chairman, infamously referred to the Holocaust as merely 'a speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.' Ovens said that the party’s historical revisionism alienates Jewish communities both domestically and internationally. 'A party that trivializes the Holocaust cannot be a partner for Jewish life in Germany or Israel,' he said. Should the AfD gain more influence, its foreign policy could strain Germany’s traditional role as a mediator in the Middle East and undermine Western cohesion Andreas Friedrich Horst, spokesperson for leading AfD member Beatrix von Storch, squarely rejected the claim that AfD leaders had made antisemitic remarks. He said that leftists had 'wrongly and maliciously' accused AfD members of antisemitism in order to distract from antisemitism on the left. 'It is the left that compares the Holocaust with immigration restriction and the war in Gaza. For the AfD, Jewish life belongs to Germany and has to be protected, [and] Israel is the only Western democracy in the Middle East and an important ally in the fight against Islamic terrorism,' he said. Horst attributed the success of the AfD to the dissatisfaction of many Germans with open borders, the abandonment of nuclear and coal power, and 'gender ideology.' 'When I grew up, this was the agenda of the radical left. Today, it is the agenda of the political mainstream,' he said. 'Angela Merkel made it the official policy of the Christian Democrats. People are fed up with this, and they want to go back to normal. This is true not only in Germany but also in all Western countries. The roots for the success of the AfD are the same as for the success of Donald Trump.' According to Navon, some of the values celebrated by the AfD are also associated with Israel – namely, national pride, security, and economic success. He said that many on the far right also see Israel as a 'bastion against radical Islam.' Similarly, Ovens said that the AfD often uses a pro-Israel stance 'as a fig leaf to obscure its Islamophobia.' After the attacks of October 7, 2023, honorary AfD chair Gauland said that 'The attack was not only aimed at the Jewish state, it was also aimed at us. Israel is the West in an environment that rejects and fights the West. When we stand with Israel, we are also defending our way of life.' But in October 2024, Tino Chrupalla, one of the AfD’s co-chairs, called for an end to arms deliveries to Israel. 'This highlights the party’s hypocrisy,' Ovens says. 'It is easy to express support when it costs nothing, but their actions tell a different story.' Furthermore, the AfD, like other far-right European parties, often supports Russia, Navon said. 'This is problematic for Israel because of Russia’s alignment with Iran and its efforts to undermine US-led global order in tandem with China,' he said. 'Such alliances are contrary to Israel’s strategic interests.' Should the AfD gain more influence, its foreign policy could strain Germany’s traditional role as a mediator in the Middle East and undermine Western cohesion, Navon said. Defending the AfD point of view, Andreas said that the prime ministers of Israel and Russia have built up a strong relationship and that Israel has refused to sanction Russia. 'If we want to stop the Iranian nuclear program, it is much better to look for diplomatic support in Moscow then to make Russia an enemy,' he said. Both Ovens and Navon said that the rise of the AfD is unlikely to disrupt official ties between Israel and Germany, two countries that have cultivated a unique relationship rooted in shared values and historical responsibility. 'The broad majority of German political parties support the partnership with Israel,' Ovens said. But he warned that the AfD’s influence on public discourse could have indirect effects. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As the German general election inches closer, Andreas believes that domestic issues will determine the victor at the ballots. 'We need a new immigration policy, new energy policy, investment in our rotten infrastructure, stopping spending money for migration, climate, gender and other ideological nonsense, and reducing the tax burden on companies and citizens,' he said. If they want to beat the AfD, traditional conservative parties will have to address issues like immigration and integration head on, Navon said. He said that ignoring these concerns will only bolster the AfD’s influence.

Reservists arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran	Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev, 21-year-old IDF reserve soldiers from the north of the country, are suspected of contact with a foreign agent, passing classified information to a foreign entity and aiding the enemy in the war - as part of another Iranian espionage case, the Rishon LeZion Magistrate's Court announced on Monday. Eliasfov is the main suspect, and according to the investigation, as part of a job search, he made contact with an Iranian operator on social media. Eliasfov started spying as a regular soldier and continued in the reserves, and later recruited Andreyev. He served in the Iron Dome unit, and was exposed to classified information. At the request of his operators, he filmed and transmitted a video about the system, which includes information at the highest classification level. By the time he was caught, Eliasfov had managed to receive $2,500, and Andreyev only $50.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1i001yhdjl	2025-01-27T01:30:29-08:00	
Even Trump couldn't force us to emigrate': Hundreds of thousands...	Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians return to northern Gaza after months of displacement, with 650,000 expected to make their way back through the Netzarm Corridor despite destroyed homes and ongoing challenges; Masked men waving Hamas and Islamic Jihad flags welcomed them Following the IDF's reopening of the Netzarim Corridor Monday after an agreement was reached for Arbel Yehoud to be returned on Thursday, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have begun returning to northern Gaza, with reports estimating around 650,000 people making their way back after months of displacement. The displacement followed Israeli evacuation orders and military activities in the region during the war. Palestinians were forced to live in temporary tent camps, but with the corridor reopened many are now heading back to their destroyed homes. While the Israeli military warned against the transfer of weapons or terrorists to the north, enforcement efforts have varied. Vehicles traveling through Salah al-Din Street are being inspected by an American company, while those walking along al-Rashid Street near the coast face no screening. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have taken advantage of the return for propaganda purposes. Masked terrorists with headbands bearing their organizations' insignias greeted returning residents, shaking hands with some and waving to others. In one widely shared photograph, a man holding a child stands beside a Hamas terrorist, both making victory signs for the cameras. Welcome banners were also posted on the remaining structures in the area. Tens of thousands of Palestinians had waited for two days at checkpoints, hoping to return to their homes. Many slept on the streets after Israel delayed reopening the corridor due to unresolved issues regarding Arbel Yehoud’s release. This morning, with the matter resolved, masses of people began their journey north. Ismail Abu Matar, a father of four, described the scene as 'a sea of people' moving northward. He and his family waited three days to return to their home in Gaza City. 'These were three days of hell. We feared the cease-fire would collapse, and we wouldn’t be able to return,' he said. Another Palestinian, who walked from Deir al-Balah to the north, said, 'Two months ago, I cried in the shameful tent camps, and today I’m returning to my family and my people, back home. I will rebuild my house from the ruins. Without the resilience of the people in the north, we wouldn’t have seen this day.' One man declared, 'We will die here; we will not uproot ourselves again. Even Trump couldn’t force us to emigrate. I’m happy to be back and will never leave again.' A man who returned to Gaza City after over a year expressed his relief, saying, 'We’ve been waiting for this moment for a year and four months. Today, I’d rather die than uproot myself again.' Another Palestinian from the Zaytoun neighborhood added, 'I’ve been sleeping in the street for five days, waiting to return. I regret the moment we left. It would have been better to die in my house. We were humiliated.'

'Now I will walk about five kilometers to reunite with my family in the north. I’ve been waiting for this moment,' he said. Hamas released a statement declaring, 'The return of the displaced is a victory for our people and a declaration of the failure and defeat of the occupation and its plans for displacement. The sight of the massive crowds of our people returning to the areas they were forced to flee, despite the destruction of their homes, confirms the greatness of our people and their steadfastness in their land despite the pain and tragedy.' Islamic Jihad issued its own statement, saying, 'In a legendary scene, hundreds of thousands of our displaced people are returning to northern Gaza, which Israel destroyed. This return is a response to anyone who dreams of uprooting our people.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1g1m6n001x	2025-01-27T00:29:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/H15QosV001l/H15QosV001l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Lebanese army spills 'sensitive information' to Hezbollah during ...	Lebanese military intelligence leaked sensitive information to Hezbollah during a fragile cease-fire with Israel, Britain's The Times reports; The leaks exposed Hezbollah's ties to the Lebanese army, raising concerns about its ability to control southern Lebanon effectively The head of military intelligence in southern Lebanon, Suhil Bahij Gharb, leaked secrets to Hezbollah during the cease-fire agreement with Israel, the British newspaper, The Times, reported on Monday. The report stated that 'sensitive information' was leaked to the terrorist organization from a security control room managed by the United States, France, and the UN peacekeeping force (UNIFIL). The Times indicated that the information passed by Gharb to Hezbollah jeopardized the cease-fire, which was achieved after more than a year of efforts. According to an international intelligence report obtained by the newspaper, Gharb is just one of dozens of officers in the Lebanese army who leaked information to Hezbollah terrorists, warning them of planned raids or patrols. These leaks allowed Hezbollah to hide weapons and evade exposure. According to an intelligence document obtained by The Times, 'Hezbollah is using internal and sensitive information regarding the Lebanese army to conceal its operations from international bodies tasked with regional security.' The document also raised concerns about the Lebanese army's ability to effectively control southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah has been building its military and political power for years. Israeli security officials stated that, while the Lebanese army 'does its job' and has confiscated some weapon stockpiles in areas vacated by Israeli forces, the leaks from its officers enabled Hezbollah terrorists and their weapons to remain near the Israeli border. Gharb, a Shiite Muslim residing in southern Lebanon, was present in the international operations room due to the insistence of Wafiq Safa, a senior Hezbollah commander who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in Beirut last October. In an interview with The Times, Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut, noted that Hezbollah’s survival does not depend on maintaining a military presence in southern Lebanon but rather on preserving the political power it has accumulated in recent years. He also pointed out that, as Israel has previously stated, given that Hezbollah terrorists in the southern region are essentially Shiite residents of villages near the border, completely eliminating the presence of the terrorist organization south of the Litani River would be challenging. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Sunday night, the White House announced, minutes before midnight, that the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon has been extended until February 18. The U.S. announcement came as the IDF had not yet withdrawn from southern Lebanon, and in the shadow of the riots there Sunday, in which crowds of Lebanese people rioted, most acting on behalf of Hezbollah, causing disturbances. IDF troops fired warning shots at many of them, and according to data from the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 22 people were killed. The White House’s announcement, which implies the IDF will be required to withdraw from Lebanon in about three weeks, also mentioned that Israel and the U.S. will begin negotiations to return Lebanese terrorists captured during IDF’s ground operations in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese prime minister confirmed that his country would comply with the extended cease-fire and added that Beirut had submitted the request for the release of Lebanese detainees captured by Israeli troops. The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which serves as a mouthpiece for Hezbollah, reported this morning that 'the Lebanese army has begun redeploying in Aitaroun, Mis al-Jabal, and Houla' in southern Lebanon. Earlier, the newspaper reported that Hezbollah rejects the agreements reached between Israel, Lebanon, and the U.S. Official sources told the newspaper that the terrorist organization is unwilling to enter any new negotiations and that the mediators must compel 'the enemy' to implement the agreement. According to Al-Akhbar, 'What was yesterday will continue today with the masses. The people will not wait for approval. What happens today could be a turning point in the confrontation.

Iran-backed militias in crisis as Middle East alliances unravel	Tehran faces mounting challenges as its proxy strategies collapse, domestic discontent rises, and new regional alliances threaten its influence The Islamic Republic of Iran, long reliant on a network of proxy groups to exert influence across the Middle East, faces significant challenges as its strategy falters. Years of investment in allies such as Hezbollah, Hamas and other factions in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria are unraveling, leaving Tehran grappling with diminishing regional authority and rising domestic discontent. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran today is very different from what we knew six or seven months ago,' according to David Menashri, a professor at the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies. 'It has lost its proxies. All these years of investment in groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have nearly collapsed. Iran’s regional prestige and power are diminished.' Tehran has responded by intensifying its propaganda, including publishing a video of a naval underground arsenal just days before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Propaganda as tool of survival Iran’s propaganda machine, though longstanding, now reflects the severity of its crisis. The video, showcasing advanced missile systems purportedly capable of targeting U.S. aircraft carriers, is part of Tehran’s efforts to project defiance. 'The regime is trying to compensate for its weaknesses by using extensive propaganda to suggest that everything is normal. It’s not,' Menashri observed. 'This messaging aims to reassure the Iranian people and signal to the world that Iran remains a formidable power.' But these efforts fail to obscure the regime’s struggles. 'These maneuvers are more about external messaging to opponents like the US and Israel, showing that Iran is not an easy target,' said Nima Baheli, an Iranian political analyst. Economic Struggles and the search for alliances Iran’s economy, battered by years of sanctions and mismanagement, is nearing collapse. The regime’s allocation of billions to support its proxies has fueled public anger at home. 'The Iranian people see a government that cannot prioritize its economy,' Menashri noted. Seeking relief, Tehran is attempting to rebuild international ties. 'Iran needs agreements with the United States to alleviate sanctions and stabilize its domestic situation,' Baheli explained. He added that Elon Musk’s involvement in Trump’s administration could open new channels for dialogue. 'It’s unclear whether Musk’s actions reflect personal initiatives or coordinated policies, but his business-oriented mindset could facilitate negotiations.' Menashri recalled past diplomatic efforts. 'For four years, Joe Biden’s administration negotiated with Tehran. They even scheduled a meeting for October 9, 2023, which was postponed due to the ongoing war. Both sides have shown interest in dialogue,' he said. Nuclear ambitions and strategic calculations As its proxy strategy falters, Iran’s nuclear program has taken center stage, raising concerns in Washington and Jerusalem. 'Israel cannot act alone against Iranian nuclear sites; it needs US support,' Baheli said. 'Trump appears to favor diplomacy over military action, but Israel’s moves are closely tied to US policy.' 'Israel will follow Trump’s lead on this. Neither the States or Israel want a nuclear Iran, but each is hoping that the other would eventually do this dirty work,' Menashri added. Shifting Alliances and the ‘Cotton Road’ Amid Tehran’s challenges, Trump’s 'Cotton Road' initiative seeks to isolate Iran further. The project envisions stronger economic ties between Saudi Arabia, India, and other key players, sidelining adversaries like Iran and potentially Turkey. 'The Cotton Road aims to create an alliance that excludes Iran,' Baheli explained. However, Saudi Arabia’s participation hinges on progress toward resolving the Palestinian issue. 'The Saudis need at least a symbolic gesture toward a solution for the Palestinian cause,' Menashri said. The complex web of alliances illustrates how the Palestinian issue remains a linchpin in regional diplomacy. > This underscores how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains pivotal in regional diplomacy. 'The recent Gaza truce was strategically timed to affect Biden’s position and freeze the issue before Trump’s formal takeover,' according to Baheli. Menashri noted Trump’s complex approach. 'He pushes for Saudi-Israeli normalization while permitting settlement expansions. He wants to detach militarily from the region but has been more involved than before. We’ll have to wait to see his true intentions,' he said. A regime under pressure Iran’s trajectory reflects a mix of military setbacks, economic hardships, and waning influence. While its propaganda portrays resilience, the reality is of a regime struggling to adapt to evolving geopolitical dynamics. 'The region is in flux, with key developments hinging on new US policies, Iranian actions, and shifting alliances,' Baheli concluded. Menashri added, 'Iran’s internal and external challenges are interconnected. Resolving them will require a strategic shift — one the regime seems unprepared to make.'

Cease-fire extended in north: IDF to remain in Lebanon for anothe...	Following day of riots and the deaths of 22 Lebanese civilians by military gunfire, the White House announced the IDF would have 3 more weeks to withdraw, extending the agreement until February 18; Hezbollah rejects this; Israel, Lebanon and the U.S. will begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese who were arrested during the ground operation, including Hezbollah terrorists The cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon has been extended until February 18,the White House announced on Sunday night, minutes before midnight. The U.S. announcement came as the IDF had not yet withdrawn from southern Lebanon, and in the shadow of the riots there Sunday, in which crowds of Lebanese people rioted, most of them at the behest of Hezbollah. The IDF fired at them from a distance and, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 22 people were killed. According to the White House announcement, which states that the IDF will be required to withdraw from Lebanon in only about three weeks, Israel and the U.S. will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese terrorists captured during the IDF's ground operations in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese prime minister confirmed that his country would abide by the extended cease-fire, adding that he had forwarded the request for the release of the Lebanese detained by the IDF to Beirut. However, the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which serves as Hezbollah's mouthpiece, reported Monday that the terrorist organization rejects the agreements reached by Israel, Lebanon and the U.S. Official sources told the newspaper that Hezbollah is not willing to enter into any new negotiations, and that the mediators must force the 'enemy' to implement the agreement. 'What happened yesterday will continue today with additional displaced people,' it said. 'The people will not wait for approval. This could be a turning point in the conflict, and more people could die today. The people's decision is to continue.' It also said that the incidents captured on video Sunday 'confirm' the need for Hezbollah south of the Litani, as the U.S. 'does not want the Lebanese army to hold the south - otherwise it would put pressure on the enemy.'' Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, also addressed the extension of the cease-fire Sunday night. 'We announced the extension of the cease-fire. The Israeli government was wonderful. They are a wonderful partner. They did a pretty good job in Lebanon.' An Israeli political source said, 'We are in constant dialogue with the Americans, and we explain to them the security importance to Israel of Lebanon's full implementation of the agreement.' Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel 'will continue to firmly enforce the cease-fires in the north and south. Anyone who violates the rules or threatens IDF forces will pay the full price. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7.' The cease-fire in southern Lebanon effectively ended on the night between Saturday and Sunday, without the IDF withdrawing from all areas. Still, in recent days, residents of southern Lebanon began to move en masse, in vehicles and on foot, toward the border villages and also to those from which the IDF had not yet fully withdrawn, precisely on the date on which the deadline was set. Within a short time, the clashes also began. Despite calls and warnings from the Lebanese army - which is supposed to implement the cease-fire agreement in the south of the country and demonstrate control over the area - residents of southern Lebanon crossed the army's checkpoints Sunday morning with almost no resistance. The Lebanese army placed fences at the entrances to several border towns to prevent the residents from passing, but they trampled the fence and passed without any interference. The bigger problem that the residents encountered, according to publications in Lebanon, were the IDF's embankments that blocked several roads, but the residents also crossed these. The Lebanese army, which failed to block residents of southern Lebanon from reaching the villages, changed its tone Sunday. Instead of requesting that they not approach the villages, it reported that 'army units are escorting residents' entry into the towns, in light of the Israeli enemy's insistence on violating Lebanon's sovereignty, its attacks against civilians, which have resulted in deaths and injuries, and its refusal to abide by the cease-fire and withdraw from the Lebanese territories it has occupied.' The army command also renewed its call for citizens 'to exercise restraint and act according to the instructions of the military units.' Hezbollah praised in an official statement the Lebanese who tried to return to their villages, despite the IDF's announcement that for now it would not completely withdraw from southern Lebanon. 'This is a glorious day. The great resistance has proven once again that they are a people rooted in their land and clinging to every grain of soil. The sights of the returnees to the villages, with the flags of the dead and the flags of Hezbollah, embody the highest meanings of steadfastness and victory. This confirms that this people, in its steadfastness, is the most powerful weapon of the resistance,' the terrorist organization said. 'The international community, led by the countries sponsoring the agreement, must take responsibility for the violations and crimes of the Israeli enemy and force it to withdraw from our lands.' The IDF emphasized Sunday that the army continues to operate in southern Lebanon in accordance with the directives of the political echelon and within the framework of the cease-fire agreement between the parties. IDF forces, the army said, are deployed in several areas while maintaining frontal defense and preventing the return of enemy elements or civilians beyond the agreed line. > A military source said Sunday that IDF forces responded with dispersal gunfire to riots in the southern villages in order to remove threats and prevent anyone from approaching the border fence area. During the operation, several suspects who approached the forces and posed a real threat were arrested, and they were taken for questioning in the field. The IDF confirmed reports that a Lebanese army soldier was injured. 'According to the agreement, the withdrawal of forces does not have to take place at the end of the 60 days, and the discussion about extending the period and the temporary location of the forces is taking place between the political echelon, the US and Lebanon,' the military source clarified. The Lebanese army, the IDF said, also did not sufficiently 'clean up' the areas controlled by Hezbollah, mainly in the eastern sector. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rka00zjv001x	2025-01-26T21:24:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/SJblpCQukg/SJblpCQukg_0_148_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Netzarim Corridor opens, crowds of Gazans move north	After release of Arbel Yehoud arranged and list of hostages' statuses handed over by Hamas, displaced Gazans were allowed to start moving to northern Gaza; IDF warns 'entry of armed men or transfer of weapons prohibited, violates agreement' After the crisis that threatened the continuation of the hostage deal was resolved , the IDF opened the Netzarim route at 7:00 a.m. on Monday morning, allowing masses of displaced Palestinians to begin to cross and return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip. The crossing was supposed to open on Saturday, but Israel decided to keep it closed until the release of Arbel Yehoud , a civilian woman who was supposed to be freed in the second release of the hostage deal on Saturday, was arranged. Hamas did not honor the agreement and released the IDF observers Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, Daniella Gilboa and Liri Albag, leading Israel to postpone the opening of the crossing. The IDF spokesman in Arabic, Lieutenant Colonel Avichai Adraee, informed residents of the Gaza Strip Sunday night that their passage to the northern Strip on foot would be allowed starting at 7:00 a.m., via a-Rashid Street, known as the sea route. Adraee announced that 'vehicles will be allowed to move to the northern Strip via the Salah a-Din Road after inspection (from 9:00 a.m.). The entry of armed men or the transfer of weapons to the northern Strip will be considered a violation of the agreement.' He added: 'It is prohibited to approach the Rafah Crossing area or the Philadelphi Corridor, it is prohibited to swim in the maritime area, and it is prohibited to approach Israeli territory or the buffer zone.' The Gaza Interior Ministry issued instructions to residents Sunday morning, saying that vehicles will be able to enter Salah a-Din Street starting at 9:00 a.m. 'However, the entry of vehicles will not begin until after contact has been made with the Egyptian security authorities,' it said. Regarding al-Rashid Street, 'Israel will not accept any attempt to pass a vehicle, truck, tuk-tuk or donkey-drawn cart through the street without inspection, and it may shoot at the vehicle on the grounds that it is carrying a weapon. Therefore, do not violate the instructions. There is a complete ban on transportation on the street and everyone must adhere to the instructions.' The vehicle crossing on Salah ad-Din Street in Netzarim will be secured by an American company, whose purpose is to prevent the return of armed men and weapons in cars. The company includes about 100 armed security personnel, most of whom are Americans and some of whom speak Arabic. The security personnel are veterans of elite units or former CIA personnel. The crisis that was resolved with the release of 6 hostages Starting on Saturday, crowds of Gazans gathered near the closed Netzarim Corridor, and since Sunday night, Palestinian media have released footage from the Gaza Strip, showing thousands of Gazans waiting on the sides of the a-Rashid highway, which is a main crossing from the south to the north of the Gaza Strip. Many Gazans even stayed overnight near the axis, hoping that the crossing would open early in the morning, but it remained closed. At the same time, the Palestinians reported that four Gazans were injured by IDF gunfire in the Nuseirat area, where displaced people were waiting to return to the northern Gaza Strip. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim addressed this, claiming in an interview with the Qatari channel Al Araby that 'Israel's preventing the return of displaced people to the north is a clear violation of the cease-fire agreement.' According to him, 'Israel is delaying and delaying, even though we have sent confirmation that the hostage Arbel Yahoud is alive. We demand that the mediators put pressure on Israel and force it to allow the return of the displaced people. Direct contacts are taking place with the mediators in order to find a solution and open the Netzarim Corridor.' The crisis in implementing the agreement, came to an end Sunday night when Qatar, followed by the Prime Minister's Office, announced the two rounds of hostage releases expected to take place this week, which include the release of six hostages. Israel announced that an agreement had been reached under which Arbel Yehoud would be released on Thursday, along with IDF lookout Agam Berger and another hostage - and that three additional men would be released alive on Saturday. Israel estimates that the hostage to be released on Thursday is American-Israeli Keith Siegel. Hamas also submitted the list containing the status of the hostages who are to be released in phase one of the deal, which it had also been supposed to submit on Saturday. > The Prime Minister's Office announced Sunday night that 'Following the conducting of vigorous and determined negotiations led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas has backtracked and will carry out an additional phase of releasing hostages this Thursday. In this phase, the civilian Arbel Yehud, the soldier Agam Berger and an additional hostage will be released.' The statement added that, 'in parallel, Israel has received from Hamas a list that includes the status of all of the hostages due to be released in the first stage.

After 'concrete warnings', Government Minister Amichai Chikli can...	In an unusual announcement, the Prime Minister's Office reported that the Minister of Diaspora Affairs was forced to cancel a planned visit to the European Parliament 'in light of concrete warnings, and according to the guidance of security officials'; The concern that led to the decision was not disclosed In an unusual announcement, the Prime Minister's Office reported that Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli was required to cancel his trip to Brussels 'in light of concrete warnings, and in accordance with the guidance of security officials.' The Prime Minister's Office did not disclose the specific suspicion that led to the dramatic decision to prevent Chikli from flying to an event at the European Parliament in the Belgian capital, where he was also expected to meet with the city's Jewish community. 'I regretted receiving instructions from security officials this evening to cancel my participation in the International Holocaust Remembrance Day events at the European Parliament. Unfortunately, the capital of Europe has become an unsafe place for Jews and Israelis,' Chikli said Sunday night. However, the Hind Rajab Foundation, which repeatedly files complaints against IDF soldiers around the world, claimed that Chikli avoided the visit because he was 'evading prosecution.' A post on the X platform published by the foundation read: 'The minister who threatened HRF chairman Dyab Aboujahjah canceled a visit to Brussels, citing 'security concerns.' We are convinced that this decision has more to do with avoiding justice and legal action. The Hind Rajab Foundation will continue its efforts to End Impunity.' Recently, the foundation has targeted soldiers and filed counter-complaints claiming that 'crimes against humanity' were committed in the war in Gaza. Two weeks ago, the same pro-Palestinian organization made its first attempt to arrest an IDF general, when it submitted a request to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for the arrest of Major General Ghassan Alian, the coordinator of government activities in the territories (COGAT). Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At the same time, there was no significant fear that the minister would be arrested, so it could be that this is a security threat. Nor is anyone known to have threatened to file a lawsuit against the minister, since he is not a commander in the army and there is no arrest warrant against him from The Hague - unlike Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. In addition, a lawsuit filed in Belgium against the IDF attaché did not progress due to his immunity. The chairman of the European Jewish Organizations Association (EJA), Rabbi Menachem Margolin, said in response: 'The fact that even today, 80 years after the Holocaust, an Israeli minister is forced to cancel a visit to a Western country for security reasons indicates more than anything that all the leaders' 'Never Again' declarations are empty of serious commitment. This year's International Holocaust Remembrance Day will be the saddest since the Holocaust.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1jjcevojx	2025-01-26T14:22:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/28/Bk3rjX03xke/Bk3rjX03xke_0_114_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Agreement reached: Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and 4 other hostages...	Qatari mediators announced that civilian Arbel Yehoud, soldier Agam Berger and one other hostage will be released Thursday, with three additional hostages freed Saturday; Hamas has provided status updates on 26 hostages to be released in first stage, as soon as Monday morning Israel will open Netzarim Corridor, allowing displaced to return to northern Gaza The crisis that threatened the hostage deal has been resolved. According to Qatari mediators, understandings have been reached between the parties stipulating that civilian Arbel Yehoud, lookout Agam Berger and one other hostage will be released on Thursday, followed by the release of three additional hostages on Saturday. Additionally, Hamas has provided a list detailing the condition of the 26 hostages who are supposed to be released during the first stage of the deal, as it committed to in the agreement. In return, Israel will open the Netzarim Corridor starting on Monday morning, allowing displaced Gazans to return to northern Gaza, the Prime Minister's Office announced. 'Israel has received from Hamas a list that includes the status of all of the hostages due to be released in the first stage. Under these agreements, Israel will – from tomorrow morning – allow the passage of Gazans to the northern Strip,' according to the statement. 'The Prime Minister reiterates that Israel will not tolerate any violation of the agreement. We will continue to act for the return of all of our hostages, the living and the deceased,' the statement concluded. A statement by Majed Al-Ansari, spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noted that 'Israel will provide, every Sunday during the first phase of the deal, a list of 400 Gazans who have been detained since October 7.' Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, on Sunday night said he was pleased about the resolution of the crisis between Israel and Hamas. 'It's wonderful, I spoke to the president about it. He was happy,' he said. 'Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani did an amazing job. I thank the Israeli government and those who were involved. It's a good day for the hostages.' Islamic Jihad had previously announced that an agreement had been reached to secure the release of Arbel Yehoud – who was initially supposed to be included in the second phase of the deal but was kept in captivity by Hamas in violation of the agreement. However, Israel denied this claim. Israel believed that internal disputes within Gaza – particularly between Islamic Jihad and the Resistance Committees, including disagreements over credit – were causing Islamic Jihad to complicate her release. During negotiations, Islamic Jihad claimed Arbel was a soldier and demanded the release of 30 prisoners serving life sentences in exchange. Israel strongly objected, and it was reportedly agreed that she would be classified as a civilian, not a soldier, for the purposes of the deal. The dispute also revolved around the timing of her release, with Israel insisting that she be freed by Wednesday. Arbel is not held solely by Islamic Jihad but — according to their own statements – also by the Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades, which is the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees, considered the third-largest terrorist organization in Gaza. The group has a jihadist-Salafist ideological orientation, and its operatives participated in the abduction of Gilad Shalit alongside Hamas operatives in June of 2006. The organization was also responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Eliyahu Asheri on the same day. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Over the years, the organization has carried out numerous attacks, including bombings in Gaza targeting both military and civilian locations before the implementation of the Disengagement Plan, as well as attacks inside Israel. The group has claimed responsibility for launching rockets at Israel during several rounds of escalation. Over time, Israel has eliminated several of its leaders, the most recent being Raafat Abu al-Halal, whose killing in Rafah was announced by IDF on October 19, 2023. On October 7, the terrorist organization participated in the massacre and also abducted Ohad Yahalomi, who is still being held in Gaza and is expected to be released as part of the first stage of the deal. His 13-year-old son, Eitan, was abducted along with his father but was released in the first deal conducted between Israel and Hamas in late 2023. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjujzee001g	2025-01-26T13:56:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/BykDGENdJx/BykDGENdJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

He told ILTV that both Israel and U.S. President Donald Trump are seeking an end to the conflict in the north. The primary goal, he said, is to enable the return of the 65,000 northern residents who were displaced from their homes. 'It is not through more fighting and rockets and battles,' Levine said.

She told ILTV that Israel 'has to do everything possible to ensure we bring back all the hostages.' 'That’s what we should do because that’s how we really win,' Hassan-Nahoum said.

Female IDF hostages weren't allowed to hold hands or cry | New de...	Families of the four liberated lookouts deliver a series of public statements, demanding the return of all hostages, accountability for the mistakes of October 7; Liri's father angrily called out government ministers who voted against the deal that brought his daughter home: 'I despise you' They weren’t allowed to hold hands or cry, but they found ways to support one another. A day after the emotional release of the four IDF lookouts from Hamas captivity – Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev, and Daniella Gilboa – new details emerged about their 477 days of suffering. Statements from their families at Rabin Medical Center, where the freed hostages are currently recovering, were broadcast live. Yoni Levy, Naama’s father, opened his statement by saying: 'For 15 months, I spoke to you many times. From the depths of my heart, I addressed decision-makers, the media, the people of Israel, and world leaders. I pleaded, as a father, trying to save his daughter from hell. This moment, standing here today, is the moment I prayed for, imagined, and hoped for during 477 days – not just for myself, but for all of us. On October 7, our country shattered into thousands of pieces, leaving families forever broken. That was the moment our personal lives were shaken, and we became known as ‘the family of Naama Levy, the abducted lookout.’' 'I am certain that the events at the Nahal Oz outpost will eventually be thoroughly examined through a state inquiry. Naama is now safe with us, surrounded by family and friends, but the fight is not over. There are still 90 hostages that we must bring home. They are our sons and daughters, the very foundation upon which our country is built. There will be no healing, no revival, until we know that the State of Israel is the father and mother of every one of us.' Orly Gilboa, Daniella’s mother, said: 'Our Daniella is home. How long I’ve waited to say that. How long I’ve waited for this moment, to give thanks that my Daniella has returned home and is now just meters away from me. My daughter came back thin and pale. She suffered in captivity, but she remains the same wonderful and talented girl she was before they took her. She hasn’t lost her spark of mischief or her pride as an Israeli, as you could see yesterday during the so-called ‘ceremony’ marking their release.' 'Daniella was abducted as Danielle. We added an extra vowel to her name on the advice of a rabbi during her captivity. She saw us at rallies, refusing to give up, and she knew we would do everything to bring her back alive.' 'This could have been any of our daughters left behind – someone’s beloved daughter who became part of this struggle, who became part of a true family we didn’t choose. We will not stop or give up until Agam is home – her and all the other hostages who must return by the end of this deal. Yesterday morning, I was still consumed by fear that the deal would fall apart, that Daniella wouldn’t come back to me. I ask and demand that the deal be fully implemented. Our new family, the family of the hostages, must receive everyone back. We owe it to them.' Eli Albag, Liri’s father, expressed gratitude for public support of the hostage deal but harshly criticized those in the government who opposed it: 'I’m emotional – Liri is back. Our Liri has returned. There are still 90 hostages: the Bibas family, Agam Berger, Arbel Yehoud. They should already be free. I thank the citizens of Israel – because of you, the hostages are starting to come home. We will not rest or stop until the last hostage is back. I want to tell Netanyahu and those who supported the deal: keep going until the end. To the opponents – this nation will hold you accountable. When you saw my daughter and the other three lookouts come out with proud smiles, where were you, those who voted against it? I despise you.' Sasha Ariev, Karina’s sister, said: 'We are so grateful that Karina is with us, but we cannot forget for a moment everyone we lost at Nahal Oz, everyone who isn’t with us today. She’s just beginning to process what she went through, but your support will help heal some of those wounds. We still have 90 brothers and sisters who are far from home. Karina knows how that feels and can’t stop thinking about them. 'We are still waiting for Agam, Arbel, Shiri and all our loved ones. We will not rest or stop until everyone is back. I want to give special thanks to President Trump. We are full of hope for the future and need your continued support to bring all our brothers and sisters home. And to you, dear Mr. Witkoff, you are a sensitive and special person – thank you for everything you’ve done. The spirit of our people is what gives us the strength to continue.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At the end of the statements, all the families formed heart shapes with their hands, imitating the gesture Liri made from the window of an IDF helicopter after her release. Details from Captivity Naama Levy was held alone for a long period before being reunited with her friends. When she saw them, she asked if it was real and if they were alive. The four young women tried to pass the time by exercising and staying active, despite the harsh conditions and limited food. Their captors did not allow them to hold hands or cry, but they found ways to support one another. Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev were held together most of the time, and their bond – formed at their base before the abduction – grew even stronger. Just as the families of the lookouts supported one another through the ordeal, so did the young women themselves. At the Rabin Medical Center ward where they are staying, there are many shared spaces, and they spend time together, supporting each other and meeting the families and friends they spoke about while in captivity. Daniella didn’t hear Eden Ben Zaken’s song dedicated to her while in captivity, but she was deeply moved when it was played for her for the first time. For now, the four freed women are being updated on everything that happened in the last 15 months, and they are also sharing their experiences. The family of Agam Berger – the lookout who was abducted with them and remains in captivity in Gaza – visited the hospital this evening and met with the now-liberated lookouts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rycxegvdye	2025-01-26T13:00:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/SkMlyc9fuJx/SkMlyc9fuJx_0_0_1600_1048_0_small.jpg

What is the health status of the observer soldiers who were relea...	Ariella Lahyani: 'You can see these same girls on the day they were abducted. You see them covered in blood, injured, crying, terrified' The four observer soldiers released over the weekend are reportedly in stable condition, according to the director of Beilinson Hospital, where they were taken. However, as ILTV correspondent Ariella Lahyani noted, 'It is far too soon for the public to truly know what their condition is or to understand what their recovery will look like.' Following their release on Saturday, some pro-Hamas and anti-Israel activists claimed that the young women were not malnourished. While they appeared smiling and waving, it is critical to remember that such appearances are part of Hamas’s propaganda strategy. 'Hamas had the hostages on a literal stage for the whole world to see, and Hamas understood that what the world saw would be a reflection of how they’ve been treating the hostages for nearly 16 months,' Lahyani stated. 'So, yesterday was by no means an accurate presentation or indication of how the hostages are being treated. And all you have to do, really, is to look at the footage from October 7. You can see these same girls on the day they were abducted. You see them covered in blood, injured, crying, terrified. You see Naama Levy with a black eye and bloody pants, and we can expect that this is a more accurate representation of what these hostages have endured for nearly 16 months.' The hostages have already shared that they suffered severe physical and psychological trauma, including isolation and extreme hunger. They were often denied basic hygiene, such as showers. Crying and even holding hands were forbidden. They were forced to cook and clean toilets for their captors. 'The most important thing is to respect their privacy and to allow them the time and space to be surrounded by their loved ones, but what is for sure is that all hostages have a long road of recovery ahead of them,' Lahyani stated.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjap67vdyx	2025-01-26T12:52:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/yk14237568/yk14237568_0_23_1212_683_0_small.jpg

Irish president attacks Israel during ceremony, Jews who proteste...	Irish President Michael Higgins used his Holocaust Remembrance Day speech to criticize Israel, sparking protests from Jewish attendees who were forcibly removed; Jewish leaders had warned the president's participation was inappropriate, citing his dismissal of antisemitism concerns and anti-Israel rhetoric Irish President Michael Higgins, known for his anti-Israel stance, used his speech on Sunday during an International Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony to criticize Israel’s actions in Gaza. Jewish attendees protested loudly and were forcibly removed from the hall. Several Holocaust survivors attended the ceremony. A video from the event shows security personnel forcefully removing Jewish attendees who protested Higgins’ remarks. Higgins has a history of anti-Israel policies, having previously denied the existence of antisemitism in Ireland, criticized Israel’s embassy in Dublin, and condemned Israel’s actions against Hamas. His statements eventually led Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar to close Israel’s embassy in Dublin entirely. During the event, Holocaust survivors shared their stories of the atrocities they endured. Additionally, the names of relatives of Irish Jews murdered in the Holocaust were read aloud. In his speech, Higgins emphasized the importance of education to prevent future atrocities like the Holocaust and addressed the war in Gaza. During his remarks, Jewish participants turned their backs to the president in protest and were violently removed by security personnel. 'The grief caused to families by the horrific acts of October 7, and the response to them, is unimaginable. The loss of civilian lives, the displacement of people, the destruction of homes and institutions—all are beyond comprehension,' Higgins said. 'The current agreement must end the killing and urgently provide a massive increase in humanitarian aid to save more lives. It is essential that all remaining hostages are freed and that every stage of the agreement is fully implemented.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier this month, after it was announced that Higgins would be the keynote speaker at the International Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony, leaders of Ireland’s Jewish community voiced their opposition. Maurice Cohen, chairman of the Council of Representatives, described Higgins’ invitation as 'inappropriate.' 'This solemn occasion requires respect, sensitivity, and a commitment to honoring the memory of the victims. His participation may offend many in the audience, both Jewish and non-Jewish, who expect dignity and unity on such an important day,' Cohen said. Ireland’s Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Yoni Wieder, expressed concerns just a week and a half before the ceremony. 'President Michael Higgins ignores the current scourge of antisemitism in Ireland, let alone takes any action to address it,' Wieder said. 'He has not taken the concerns raised by representatives of the Jewish community seriously, and in May, he dismissed discussions about antisemitism in Ireland as ‘public relations.’ With this approach, I fear that his speech marking Holocaust Remembrance Day will cause anxiety for many Irish Jews.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hytegzvuje	2025-01-26T10:49:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/HyMx88Vzp/HyMx88Vzp_0_0_3000_1953_0_small.jpg

Justice Yitzhak Amit elected Supreme Court president; Justice min...	Judicial Selection Committee voted to appoint Justice Yizhak Amit as Supreme Court president, ending a 15-month standoff; but Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who tried to prevent the move citing journalist investigations including in Yediot Acharonot, boycotted the hearing; Levin does not intend to recognize Amit's presidency, which will hinder the judicial system The Judicial Selection Committee appointed on Sunday High Court judge Yizhak Amit as permanent Chief Justice. The vote on the 14th president of the Supreme Court comes after a series of delays over 15 months since the previous court president, Justice Esther Hayut, retired from the position. Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who serves as the chairman of the committee, boycotted the discussion, as did coalition representatives Minister Orit Struck and Knesset lawmaker Yitzhak Kreuzer. After hours of discussions in their absence, the most senior judge on the Supreme Court, Amit, 65, was elected to the position. The vote followed the tradition of elected the most senior justice to assume the presidency. Amit was prevented from participating in the discussion since it dealt with his appointment. In addition, the committee voted to appoint Justice Noam Solberg, 63, to the position of deputy president of the Supreme Court. Amit is accused by Levin and others of presiding over several cases in which he had conflicts of interest , after a Yediot Acharonot investigation found that he appeared in the cases involving a property he owns in Tel Aviv together with his brother under an assumed name. The hearing was held after the high Court ordered Levin to allow it to meet in order to appoint a president, after the Justice Minister refused to allow the committee to meet as he attempts to reform the judicial system. Levin, who was not present at the hearing, responded to the decision in a joint statement with Struck and Kreuzer. 'Today, the Judicial Selection Committee convened and supposedly 'elected' a Supreme Court president. We did not participate in the hearing. Electing a Supreme Court president while a heavy cloud hangs over the candidate's conduct in a number of different cases, including allegations of his alleged conflict of interest and construction irregularities in his residence, while giving contradictory answers to the allegations that were made, and without the basic obligation to conduct a professional and objective examination of those allegations, is a moral disgrace, contrary to all rules of proper administration and reeks of selective enforcement.' This means that the judicial system, which requires joint administrative decisions by the minister and the president, will not be made 'The Israeli public knows what has happened in the past, and even in the very recent past, with the fate of leading candidates for other senior positions, whose appointments were rejected and disqualified due to similar allegations. No less serious, the aforementioned 'selection' was made by virtue of an illegal order of the High Court of Justice, at the height of a fundamentally illegal process, which stripped the Minister of Justice of his statutory powers, and turned the Judicial Selection Committee into a rubber stamp of the High Court,' the statement said. 'The High Court's order was issued even though there is no real urgency in appointing a president to the Supreme Court, as the acting president has all the powers of the president; but the High Court judges have found a way to force this appointment through a forceful and illegal step. This is a sad day for democracy and a sad day for our legal system. A president who is 'elected' in such a way will not be able to gain the public's trust, which is necessary for the legal system as a fundamental condition for its existence. On behalf of a huge public whose democratic rights were trampled on in this illegal process, and whose expectation of a fair and moral legal system was also trampled on, we will not stop acting until we rectify this shameful situation from the ground up,' the statement concluded. President Isaac Herzog congratulated Amit. 'For decades and in various instances, Justice Amit has contributed greatly to the Israeli legal system, and I am confident that his many skills and rich experience will play a significant role in leading the Supreme Court and the judiciary with responsibility, discretion and dedication to the benefit of the State of Israel, and in the very important task of increasing public confidence in the legal system,' he said in a statement. 'The judicial system in general and the Supreme Court in particular are a critical part of our democratic fabric and the protection of human and civil rights. We must guard them with all vigilance. I believe that we must now move forward and put behind us the debate that has taken place in recent weeks surrounding the selection process for the president of the Supreme Court. We must look ahead, lower the flames of controversy, and strive to reach understandings as much as possible.' The High Court of Justice ruled on Friday that the Judicial Selection Committee must convene Sunday, after an extension was granted to discuss allegations against Amit, who was supposed to be elected on January 16 and has served as acting president until now. Levin decided to boycott the hearing in protest of the High Court order ordering him to convene the committee and also because of his firm opposition to Amit's appointment as president of the Supreme Court. Against the backdrop of the boycott by the Minister of Justice and coalition representatives, Amit is expected to receive the support of two Supreme Court Justices, Justices Solberg and Dafna Barak-Erez, two representatives of the Bar Association, Muhammad Na'amaneh and Yonit Kalmanovitz, and opposition representative Knesset lawmaker Karin Elharar. Levin believes that the High Court orders forced him to convene the committee to select a president, instead of discussing a compromise outline he proposed to the Supreme Court, which also includes the election of three judges who are currently missing from the Supreme Court. In the minister's opinion, these orders are illegal, and constitute a crossing of the line by the High Court in the face of the government and the Knesset. In the meantime, Levin made it clear that he will continue to insist that the allegations against Amit be investigated to the fullest extent, despite the words of Attorney General Gali Baharav Miara and the head of the police investigations division, Boaz Balat, who stated that there is no suspicion of criminality in the judge's actions. The disciplinary investigation demanded by Levin is based on about 15 newspaper publications, including the Yedioth Ahronoth exposé , which, in the minister's opinion, allegedly cast doubt on Amit's conduct, citing conflicts of interest in which he was involved during his tenure as a judge. This conflict of interest, the minister emphasizes, indicates his unsuitability for the position. Levin does not intend to recognize Amit's presidency, so until the end of his term he will continue not to cooperate with him in the field of court administration. This means that the judicial system, which requires joint administrative decisions by the minister and the president, will not be made. Among other things, decisions will not be made on the subject of selecting judges, adding budgets, selecting presidents and establishing search committees, building courts, and planning the system for the coming years. Therefore, by the end of Levin's term, only 10 justices will serve on the Supreme Court instead of 15. Some 4,800 objections were submitted to the Judicial Selection Committee against Amit's election. They were discussed by the committee about three weeks ago, where they were presented by members of right-wing legal associations who were invited in a precedent-setting manner to speak. These are the main allegations: Appeared under a different name in legal proceedings and did not report A Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth report revealed that in recent years Amit was a party to several civil legal proceedings concerning an apartment he and his brother own in south Tel Aviv, using his former name, Yitzhak Goldfreind, without reporting it and without the lawyers knowing that they were representing a Supreme Court judge. In one of the proceedings, an indictment was even filed against him. Also, a judge who heard one of these proceedings appeared on the Judicial Selection Committee while Amit was a member of it. At the same time, Amit heard cases from the law firm that represented him and his brother and in a case involving the Tel Aviv Municipality which was conducting proceedings regarding a property he owned. Amit, on the other hand, claimed that he became aware of the existence of the procedures mentioned only following the submission of the inquiry. According to him, his brother and he received from their parents as a gift two stores on Eilat Street in Jaffa, named after Dov and Yitzhak Goldfreind, as their names were at the time. In 2016, Amit gave his brother a general-notarial power of attorney to deal exclusively with the aforementioned properties, precisely in order not to be involved in anything related to them. He signed a power of attorney for his brother regarding a lawsuit to dissolve a partnership in the property filed by the developer and a number of rights holders in the property against dozens of other rights holders, including Amit and his brother. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another proceeding is a request for leave to appeal filed against the Magistrate's Court decision issued in the first proceeding. In this proceeding, Amit and his brothers, along with many others, appear as formal respondents only, in light of the fact that the order to dissolve the partnership was not issued against them. In any case, Amit had no knowledge of the existence of the proceeding, and no document was submitted in his name or on his behalf in the proceeding. In another proceeding, Amit signed by virtue of the power of attorney given to the entrepreneur, who initiated the administrative petition process, without informing Amit's brother about the procedure, and without the knowledge of the judge. Regarding the so-called 'concealment,' the reason Amit appears in the proceedings under his former last name, Goldfreind, is that the rights holder information for the purpose of filing court documents was taken from the original papers, where the judge appears under this last name. In the general-notarial power of attorney given by the judge to his brother, it is explicitly written Yitzhak Amit, not Yitzhak Goldfreind, so the claim that Amit 'concealed' his identity is unfounded.

Iranian cyberattack targets kindergartens, plays rocket sirens, t...	Iranian hacker group Handala claimed responsibility for breaching emergency button systems in educational institutions across Israel, using them to broadcast rocket sirens and terror-supporting songs; in addition, tens of thousands of fear-inducing text messages were sent to citizens, allegedly as part of the same coordinated attack An alleged Iranian cyberattack breached the emergency button system of Israeli company Maagar-Tec on Sunday, triggering rocket sirens, Arabic messages and terror-supporting songs across 20 kindergartens and educational institutions nationwide. The attackers, identified as the Iranian hacker group 'Handala,' claimed responsibility for the breach. They reportedly exploited Maagar-Tec's interfaces, responsible for emergency button systems, to carry out the coordinated attack. In addition to disrupting schools, the hackers sent tens of thousands of fear-inducing text messages to citizens by accessing a database linked to the company. Authorities instructed affected institutions to disconnect their devices from power until the situation is resolved. Maagar-Tech issued a statement confirming ongoing maintenance on its website, which remains temporarily inaccessible. Meanwhile, the National Cyber Directorate reported it is working closely with Maagar-Tech and the Ministry of Education to restore systems safely. 'Earlier this morning, the National Cyber Directorate received reports of a breach involving emergency buttons installed in several kindergartens. Investigations revealed that a cyber group had accessed the private supplier's system, using it to broadcast terror-supporting songs and alarm sounds,' a spokesperson said. The investigation confirmed the attack affected around 20 kindergartens. Additionally, another interface of the same supplier was used to send mass fear-mongering messages to citizens.

Some 22 dead, dozens wounded as Lebanon alleges Israeli violation...	With 22 civilian casualties, southern Lebanon saw heightened tensions as residents returned to border villages despite warnings; Lebanese army struggles to enforce order, while Israeli forces maintained positions, citing operational needs and cease-fire agreement directives In the early hours of Sunday, the agreed-upon ceasefire in southern Lebanon ended without Israeli forces withdrawing. As anticipated in the neighboring country in recent days, residents of southern Lebanon began moving en masse, both by vehicle and on foot, toward border villages, including ones from which Israeli forces have not yet fully withdrawn. This despite the fact that on Saturday morning, in an official statement, the Lebanese army asked residents to delay heading to the southern border area due to 'the presence of landmines and suspicious objects left behind by the Israeli enemy.' Residents of southern Lebanon were urged 'to act responsibly and follow military instructions to ensure their safety.' The army added that 'there has been a delay in several stages due to the enemy’s stalling in withdrawing, complicating the army’s deployment preparations, though it remains ready to complete its deployment as soon as Israel withdraws.' In the evening, the army issued another statement about its deployment in several border villages, urging civilians 'not to approach areas Israeli forces have withdrawn from and to adhere to the guidance of military units.' Despite these warnings and calls from Lebanese army – tasked with implementing the cease-fire agreement in southern Lebanon and demonstrating control over the area – residents of southern Lebanon crossed military checkpoints Sunday morning with almost no resistance. The Lebanese army had placed barbed-wire fencing at several entrances to border towns to prevent residents from entering, but they lifted the fences and crossed without obstruction. The greater challenge for residents, according to Lebanese reports, was Israeli forces' dirt barriers blocking several roads, but even these were eventually crossed. The Lebanese army, unable to prevent southern residents from reaching the villages, changed its declarations on Sunday morning. Instead of requesting residents to stay away, it reported that 'army units are accompanying residents’ entry into towns, against the backdrop of the Israeli enemy’s insistence on violating Lebanon’s sovereignty, its attacks on civilians that have caused fatalities and injuries, and its refusal to adhere to the cease-fire agreement and withdraw from Lebanese territories it has occupied.' The army command also reiterated its call for residents 'to act with restraint and follow instructions from military units.' All discussions about clearing 'landmines and suspicious objects,' as well as the need for Lebanese army to enter villages before residents to secure their return were abandoned. Residents of southern Lebanon entered the towns without any oversight. Senior Hezbollah officials emphasized Sunday morning that it was the residents who cleared the roads for the army, using the opportunity to demonstrate how 'resistance is essential' in cooperating with Lebanese army. Meanwhile, Lebanon's Ministry of Health on Sunday evening reported that 22 people were killed and 124 injured in the south of the country, after IDF soldiers fired shots to disperse a threat. At least five Lebanese were detained or arrested by Israeli forces. One video circulating online shows a woman standing in front of a tank. Ghaleb Abu Zaynab, a member of Hezbollah’s political council, stated on Sunday that: 'This return is dangerous, but residents of the south insisted on coming back and taking their rights into their own hands. The people are moving forward, and the army is with them.' It seems that, lacking control, the army is now aligning with them. In its latest statement this morning, Lebanese army declared: 'Army units stand alongside citizens against the Israeli enemy, which continues to refuse to implement the cease-fire agreement and withdraw from Lebanese territory.' This, however, is not the army’s immediate mission in the south. Scenes from southern Lebanon on Sunday demonstrate that, despite responsibilities imposed on it under the two-month-old cease-fire agreement, the Lebanese army lacks the ability to control the area south of Litani River or to deter Hezbollah operatives and their supporters. It is also unclear whether the army even wants to fulfill this role. The Lebanese army does not want to be seen as 'complying' with Israel’s demands to dismantle Hezbollah or as standing between southern Lebanese residents and Israel. Hezbollah infused into Lebanese army Half of Lebanese army soldiers are Shiite Muslims. Over the past years, Hezbollah has gained significant control over the army. Even though the terrorist organization has weakened within the country, and even if Shiite Lebanese soldiers themselves do not support Hezbollah, those that surround them likely do. A source told the pro-Hezbollah Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar last week that Israel wants the 'Lebanese army to become a tool that works for it and for the monitoring committee,' with senior military officials refusing to act as 'officers operating under the enemy’s orders and clashing with residents.' Despite international declarations in recent months about strengthening the Lebanese army, there is no evidence that significant new capabilities were demonstrated on Sunday in the south. Returning residents, including Hezbollah operatives, are now in the villages, despite all army requests for them not to enter. 'This is the equation of the army, the people and the resistance,' said Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah on Sunday morning. 'The resistance fought here until the last day. The people liberated Aita al-Shaab and will liberate Marun al-Ras and Aitaroun. The people are opening the way for the army. The equation of the army, the people, and the resistance is not something written in ministers’ statements but is implemented on the ground.' Instead of acknowledging its failure to enforce order in the south, Lebanese officials have been blaming Israel since Sunday morning for violating the cease-fire agreement, supporting southern residents and attempting to project control. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun stated: 'I call on our people in the south to exercise self-restraint and trust the army. Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable. I am closely monitoring the southern residents’ situation at the highest levels to ensure their rights. The army remains committed to protecting you and ensuring your safety. I share with our people in the south the joy of the victory of truth.' Speaker of Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri accused Israel of wrongdoing, saying that 'Israel continues to violate Lebanon’s sovereignty and the terms of the cease-fire. The blood of southern Lebanese residents is an urgent call to the international community to compel Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon.' Lebanon’s incoming Prime Minister Nawaf Salam added: 'I fully share President Joseph Aoun’s trust in the army’s role in defending Lebanon’s sovereignty and ensuring the safe return of our people.' This is despite the army’s actual failure to ensure the safe return of residents. Meanwhile, Israeli forces emphasize that they continue to operate in southern Lebanon in accordance with directives from political leadership and within the framework of the cease-fire agreement between the sides. According to the army, Israeli troops remain deployed in several areas, maintaining forward defense and preventing the return of enemy forces or civilians beyond agreed line. 'Since this morning, hundreds of civilians, including Hezbollah operatives, have attempted to approach the first line of villages at several points, conducting provocative marches and attempting to create provocations,' a military source reported. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The source added that IDF troops are responding with warning fire to remove threats and prevent approaches to the fence area. During operations, several suspects who approached troops and posed a real threat were detained and taken for field interrogation. Israeli forces confirmed reports of injuries to a Lebanese soldier, but full details, including reports of fatalities, have not yet been clarified. 'According to the agreement, withdrawal of troops does not have to be completed within 60 days, and discussions about extending the period and the temporary positioning of troops are ongoing between political leadership, U.S., and Lebanon,' the military source clarified. He added that Israeli forces continue to closely monitor Hezbollah attempts to return to southern Lebanon and operate according to operational and political needs. Israel also stated that Lebanese forces has not adequately 'cleared' areas controlled by Hezbollah, particularly in the eastern sector. Israel has an operational plan and a range of options in case of escalation, which is currently deemed 'unlikely.' Lebanese reports mentioned gunfire directed at displaced people attempting to return to their homes, but Israel explained that fire was only directed at those posing a threat to troops. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktkucx001x	2025-01-26T08:32:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/H111v2OXdkx/H111v2OXdkx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Islamic Jihad says Arbel Yehoud to be released early, Israel says...	The civilian Israeli hostage reportedly will be released in exchange for 30 life prisoners and the opening of the Netzarim Corridor for displaced people from northern Gaza; Israel confirms progress in talks to expedite her release but says no agreement yet Israel and Palestinian terrorists appear to be approaching a breakthrough that will lead to the release of civilian Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud. The reports of progress come as crowds of Gazans are still stranded near the Netzarim Corridor, which remains blocked by Israeli troops, as they attempt to return to their home communities in northern Gaza. Israeli officials confirmed Sunday evening that there is progress in talks that will lead to the early release of the civilian hostage, who was supposed to be released from Hamas captivity on Saturday. However, the officials clarified that an agreement has not yet been reached. Previously, Sky News reported in Arabic that 'Hamas and Jihad agreed to release Arbel Yahud 24 hours before the third scheduled exchange on Saturday.' According to the same report, she will be released in exchange for the opening of the Netzarim Corridor and the beginning of the return of displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, and in exchange for the release of 30 terrorists serving life sentences. Arbel Yahoud is a civilian, so women and teenagers, not life prisoners, had been supposed to be released in exchange for her. The Saudi news outlet Al-Arabiya also reported that 'the mediators succeeded in overcoming the crisis of the kidnapped Arbel Yahoud.' On Sunday afternoon, a senior official in Islamic Jihad - the organization that apparently is holding Arbel Yehoud - said that 'we expect a breakthrough tonight in the surrounding crisis.' According to him, 'efforts are being made by the mediators to resolve the crisis, which may lead to the release of the kidnapped woman before Saturday.' Israel has not confirmed that any agreement has been reached. There is a great effort to resolve the crisis and pressure from the mediators, and President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is also involved in the issue. At the same time, residents in the Gaza Strip were filmed 'looking' for Arbel Yehoud. 'All the people are waiting for Arbel,' one resident said in the video. Another resident added: 'Half a million people are sleeping on the streets because of her. Where is Arbel? Ten thousand prisoners in prison and not a single Arab has moved - and because of Arbel, all the nations have stood up.' The movement of displaced persons back to the northern Gaza Strip was banned following the crisis with Hamas over the release of Arbel Yehoud. She was supposed to be released in the second round, under the agreement which stated that live civilian women would be released before the female soldiers, but this did not happen, and therefore Israel announced that until the crisis is resolved no movement of displaced persons to the northern Gaza Strip will be allowed. The terrorist organization has meanwhile accused Israel of violating the agreement, stating that 'Hamas and the mediators are monitoring the occupation's prevention of the return of the displaced to the north, which is using the excuse of Arbel Yehoud - even though we announced that she was alive and gave all the necessary guarantees for her release.' However, Israel is still denying Hamas' claim that a sign of life was transferred from Arbel Yehoud. A political source clarified Sunday that 'Prime Minister Netanyahu stands firm on his decision not to allow Gazans to cross north through Netzarim until the issue of the closure of Arbel Yehoud is resolved.' In the meantime, Hamas has managed to violate the deal once again and did not present the list of hostages and their conditions as it was required to hand over by Saturday. Throughout Saturday night and Sunday morning, Palestinian media published numerous videos and photos from the Gaza Strip, showing thousands of Gazans waiting on the sides of the a-Rashid Road, which is a main crossing from the southern Gaza Strip to the north. Many Gazans even stayed overnight near the Netzarim Corridor, hoping that the crossing would open in the morning, but it remained closed. At the same time, Palestinians reported that four Gazans were injured by IDF gunfire in the Nuseirat area, where displaced people were waiting to return to the north of the Gaza Strip. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim addressed this, claiming in an interview with the Qatari channel Al-Araby that 'Israel's preventing the return of displaced persons to the north is a clear violation of the cease-fire agreement.' According to him, 'Israel is delaying and delaying, even though we have sent confirmation that the kidnapped Arbel Yahoud is alive. We demand that the mediators put pressure on Israel and force it to allow the return of the displaced persons. Direct contacts are taking place with the mediators in order to find a solution and open the Netzarim Corridor.' Israel is also striving to resolve the crisis, and according to a CNN report, they have turned to the person who many believe promoted the negotiations that led to the deal in the first place - Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East. According to an Israeli source, a message was sent to Witkoff, asking him to intervene in the crisis.

According to the directorate: 'In parallel with the return to Israel of seven kidnapped women, four of whom are soldiers, Israel released the terrorist prisoners in accordance with the agreement. During the implementation of the cease-fire yesterday, Hamas committed two violations of the agreement: Arbel Yehoud has not yet been released and the list of the status of the hostages set to be returned in the first phase has not yet been submitted.' 'As a result, it was decided that the crossing of Gazans into the northern Gaza Strip will not be approved. Since yesterday until this hour, many efforts have been made with the U.S. and the mediators to bring about a settlement for the recovery of Arbel. It was expected that Hamas would create difficulties and continue psychological warfare on the way to implementing the agreement. We are determined to bring about the return of all the hostages, both living and dead.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ioo0qdjg	2025-01-26T07:34:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/SyapeARwJg/SyapeARwJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Returned hostages Emily, Doron and Romi released from hospital	Sheba Medical Center says Romi Gonen, Emily Damari, and Doron Steinbrecher, who were freed a week ago, were discharged after completing their medical evaluations; 'We will continue to support them' the hospital adds; 'We have a long road ahead of us, but we will keep working tirelessly to bring the remaining hostages home' Doron's father says Sheba Medical Center announced Sunday that Romi Gonen, 24, Emily Damari, 28, and Doron Steinbacher, 31, recently released after 471 days in Hamas captivity, have completed their stay and medical evaluations at the facility’s reintegration complex. 'The medical center will continue to support them and their families,' the hospital said in a statement. 'We remain ready and vigilant until the last hostage returns.' The released women are now headed to Kfar HaMaccabiah, where they will continue receiving medical care and emotional support while reuniting with their families. Roni Steinbrecher, Doron’s father, spoke of the overwhelming emotions surrounding the young womens' release and expressed gratitude to the Israeli public for its support and to the hospital for its care. 'We have a long road ahead of us, especially for Doron, but we will persist in advocating for the swift return of all remaining hostages,' he said. On Friday, the families of Gonen, Steinbrecher, and Damari shared their first Shabbat meals together after more than 15 months of separation. 'This is the first Shabbat in 67 weeks with Doron at our table,' said Roni and Simona Steinbrecher. 'While we are overjoyed, our celebration will only be complete when all hostages are home. This is a national mission, and we must keep up the momentum through public gatherings across the country.' The Steinbrecher family encouraged continued public demonstrations, emphasizing: 'Our Doron thanks everyone and urges you to keep attending rallies. We will not stop until every hostage is returned.'

Tensions over remaining hostages Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains dire, with 90 hostages still in captivity. According to the ongoing agreement, 26 of them are expected to be released in the next stage. However, negotiations have hit a snag over the release of Arbel Yehoud, initially slated for the second phase. Efforts to resolve the impasse are ongoing, though the Netzarim crossing, scheduled to open as part of the agreement, remains closed due to what Israeli officials have described as a breach by Hamas. Thousands of Gazans were seen near the crossing Sunday morning, some chanting, 'Where is Arbel? Everyone is searching for her.'

Hell hath no fury like a Jewish woman': Dr. Sheila Nazarian, Tanya Zuckerbrot and Siggy Flicker discuss advocating for Trump, his pro-Israel stance, efforts against antisemitism and standing firm in Jewish identity amid rising hate Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States brought together influential supporters, including three prominent Jewish women—Dr. Sheila Nazarian, Tanya Zuckerbrot and Siggy Flicker—who reflected on their advocacy for Trump, their connections to Israel and their personal journeys in activism. Nazarian, an Iranian-born plastic surgeon and activist, recalled braving freezing temperatures to attend the Liberty Ball on inauguration night. 'I like to think of it as conservative Disneyland,' she said. 'Once inside, it was great to be with other like-minded people. It was really fun to see all the MAGA hats and everyone so excited for the future of America.' Zuckerbrot, a nutritionist and mother of five, described the relief she felt on election night. 'I had a viewing party here at my home, and there was just so much elation, but even more so relief,' she said. 'The direction our country was heading in was concerning for so many reasons—national security, the economy—but as a Jewish woman with five children in college to see antisemitism on such a national scale and the Democratic Party's failure to make Jews feel safe. As a mom and as a Jewish woman, I was just so relieved that Trump won the presidency.' Flicker, born in Jerusalem to a Holocaust survivor, shared her unwavering loyalty to Trump, whom she has supported for nearly a decade. 'I left reality TV from day one. I left everything and my husband said, 'Siggy, go full force with Donald Trump,' and that was about 8 years ago and I got a lot of heat for it, but I knew in my heart Israelis trust their gut instinct. This is a friend of Israel. This is a friend of the Jewish people. This is the man who's going to save the world and get rid of jihad. Donald John Trump,' she said. Zuckerbrot added that she believes that standing by Trump 'shows our connection to our homeland Israel because Trump has been an advocate of Israel.' 'It's been shown in his policies—from the Abraham Accords and sanctions of Iran and also Trump's willingness to fight antisemitism here in the United States,' she said. 'So for me, this election was not so much about national issues but really my connection. I was a one-issue voter because Israel is our ancestral homeland and it is our obligation and our privilege as Jews in the Diaspora to do whatever is necessary to protect Israel's future. 'I went from ‘Boobs and Botox’ to Israel and the Jewish people.' Flicker praised the president's 'no BS' attitude and described him as a 'fearless' leader who speaks from the heart. Flicker, who has a personal relationship with Trump, highlighted his passion for America and strong stance against antisemitism. She recounted Trump’s frustration with being mislabeled as antisemitic, emphasizing his Jewish family connections. 'Not everybody has common sense,' she said, adding, 'He’s relatable, even as a billionaire.' Flicker also discussed her recent meeting with Trump following the October 7 Hamas attacks. She urged him to prioritize the return of Israeli hostages. 'President Trump kept on saying, ‘It would have never happened if I was president,’ and I believe him,' she said, emphasizing his commitment to supporting Israel. Nazarian shared her journey from posting about plastic surgery to becoming an outspoken advocate for Israel. She said she began addressing antisemitism on social media in response to growing hostility on U.S. college campuses. 'I went from ‘Boobs and Botox’ to Israel and the Jewish people,' Nazarian said. Her pivot intensified during May 2021's Operation Guardian of the Walls and again after the October 7 Hamas attacks. Despite backlash and threats, she continued her advocacy. 'I thought I was going to lose everything, and I was willing to lose everything, but not only did I get to keep everything, I have gained so much more. So I highly recommend following your soul, following your core values, being true to yourself. God rewards the authentic,' she said. Nazarian addressed a shift in Jewish American political affiliations, noting that Jews from Holocaust survivor families often lean left due to concerns about nationalism, while those from countries like Iran and Cuba lean conservative due to their experiences with socialism. 'A lot of Jews have switched to the Republican Party, and I hope more will switch. I hope that more people will wake up, and I know that these three women on this show with me today are going to be a huge factor in that,' she said. Nazarian highlighted Trump’s unwavering support for Israel, including the Abraham Accords and adding antisemitism protections under Title IX. Zuckerbrot explained why she took the unusual step of publicly endorsing Donald Trump, despite it being a contentious choice within the Jewish community. 'As a Jew, we feel that even our safety in this country was being challenged,' she said. 'Jews make up less than 1% of the world population. We are a minority, and there are such few voices standing up for the Jewish people.' Zuckerbrot emphasized the significance of advocacy, even at a personal cost. 'For the first time in my professional career, I publicly shared which candidate I was voting for and I did it because I felt that if I could sway even one person to come over to vote for Trump, then that would have been an impact,' she said. Zuckerbrot cited data to illustrate shifting allegiances: Trump's share of the Jewish vote in New York rose from 30% in 2020 to 45% in 2024, a 50% increase. 'I do believe that that increase was due to people like Siggy, Sheila and hopefully myself too, who explained why Trump was a friend to Israel and a friend to the Jews here in the U.S.,' she added. While acknowledging the Democratic Party’s history of supporting liberal social values, Zuckerbrot criticized what she described as 'double talk' on the campaign trail. 'I think that the threat to withhold arms from Israel was a turning point for many people, especially myself, where I could never go back,' she said. 'The United States should always present as an unwavering ally to Israel and to suggest that we would not give Israel what it needs to eradicate a terrorist organization, which they are doing on behalf of the world, was so disheartening to me, and there was no way I could ever vote for a candidate that would ever threaten Israel's future.' 'Hell hath no fury like a Jewish woman. There is nothing that makes me more proud than to stand up for the Jewish people in the State of Israel.' Flicker described how her father’s experiences in the Holocaust and warnings shaped her commitment to advocating for Israel and the Jewish people: 'I grew up in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. We moved there from Israel, and I remember at kiddush every Friday night my father would repeat story after story after story about the Holocaust, and I would say to my father, 'why do you keep repeating the same stories? We're in America, Daddy, we're safe.' And he said, 'Siggy, antisemitism is like cancer. It stays dormant, but when it comes out and it will come out, I want to make sure that you're strong enough to look at it in the face and defeat it.' Reflecting on recent events, Flicker noted the rise in antisemitism globally, including attacks on Jews in Europe, the U.S. and college campuses. 'Look where we are today, our children are afraid to wear their Star of David, Jews are being persecuted, we look at what's happening in Europe. Look what's happening all over the United States in our colleges,' she said.

What the Israelis have created in a land that has no oil underneath is absolutely remarkable. Hell hath no fury like a Jewish woman. You will not touch my people. You will not touch my children, and if I lose my life tomorrow, I lose my life in the way that I want to lose my life. There is nothing that makes me more proud than to stand up for the Jewish people in the State of Israel.' Flicker explained why she limits public interaction on her social media platforms. Despite addressing controversial topics like her support for Israel and President Trump, Flicker said she has not received direct threats. However, she emphasized her decision to avoid toxic exchanges. 'I will not give jihad a platform on my social media,' Flicker said, referring to anti-Israel sentiments and online abuse. 'I'm not interested in your comments, I'm not interested in having dialogue. If you want to have dialogue with me, send me a DM. I'll respond to you and then we can go on from there. But what a lot of people are doing is they leave their comments on and all the bots and all the jihadis come out there with their 'Free Palestine' and 'From the river to the sea.' Not interested in that.' Flicker said her focus is on sharing her own message and maintaining a positive space. 'I'm very passionate about what I feel and I feel like I have a phenomenal life because I do not allow toxic energy in my life, and that starts with social media,' she said, adding that avoiding negativity allows her to live a fulfilling life. 'I can't be on every day because I'm a fighter. If somebody comes on and says 'From the river to the sea,' I'm going to respond in a way that I can't repeat right now.' Nazarian expressed her belief that Trump would continue to strongly support Israel. While clarifying she does not have a personal relationship with Trump, Nazarian highlighted his track record and expected policies. 'I think the things that he for sure is going to do is bankrupt Iran so that there isn't all of this money to be given to the proxy terrorist organizations to be attacking Israel, which is great,' she said. 'I know he's going to be giving the 2000-pound bombs to Israel and those are the bunker busters to really be able to do some damage to the nuclear program if they need to. I don't think he's going to stand in the way of Israel and their right to defend themselves. He has said many times that he is a president of peace, peace through strength. But I don't think he's going to handicap Israel the way that the prior administration did.' She criticized the Biden administration’s decision to lift sanctions on Iran, stating it allowed Iran to grow $150 billion wealthier and fund destabilizing efforts, including anti-Israel protests on U.S. college campuses. 'When the revolution started in Iran, it started on the campuses,' Nazarian noted, describing parallels between tactics used then and the growing antisemitism she sees on American campuses today. 'They're using the same playbook—to create chaos and division here in the U.S. just like they did in Iran.' She also addressed criticisms of hostage negotiations with Hamas, calling it 'hostage extortion' rather than a deal. 'If somebody comes in and steals a child and you pay ransom to get your child back, that's not a deal, that's extortion,' she said. Nazarian voiced confidence that Trump would not force Israel into such positions, adding, 'Donald Trump has shown that he is a good friend to Israel. He's not going to be paying both sides. He's not going to handicap people who want democracy and freedom in the Middle East.' Flicker emphasized the president’s decisive actions in favor of Israel during his first term and his potential future impact. 'Israel's very significant to Donald Trump,' she said. 'I believe actions speak louder than words. When Donald Trump was president, Iran was broke, he bankrupted them, and he also bankrupted the Palestinian Authority. When you stop funding 'pay-for-slay,' you're stopping funding the killing of innocent Israelis. Trump recognized the Golan Heights, poverty in Judea and Samaria. Donald Trump is a man of little words and all action.' She also praised Trump’s business-oriented approach to governance, describing his vision for expanding peace in the Middle East as 'Abraham Accords on steroids.' She explained that Trump is fostering alliances with Arab nations that oppose extremist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. 'There are Arab nations who do not like the jihadis. They're done with it and they are coming on board and we will have peace in the Middle East which no one thought was possible. That is Donald Trump's dream. He is going to bring peace to the Middle East and he's going to wipe out all these little tentacles of Iran,' she said. 'Before October 7, everybody thought that the Palestinians really wanted peace and you saw what happened. It's impossible to have peace with the Palestinians because, from the age of three, they are taught that Jews are like dogs and they must die. We do not have a right to exist in their eyes. We must secure Israel and its borders, and it starts now with Donald Trump as president.' Zuckerbrot emphasized the importance of embracing Jewish identity as a powerful response to growing antisemitism. 'Trump said it best: it's the dawn of a new day. Standing proudly in our Jewish identity is the greatest act of defiance that Jews can make right now. It shows that we are not afraid, we are not backing down, we are here to stay forever,' she said. 'The losses are painful but Israel's facing an existential crisis and as Jews, we have a moral obligation to do whatever is needed to support Israel.' She praised the Jewish commitment to tikkun olam, or repairing the world, and lauded the contributions of Jews to global progress and innovation. 'I think that this administration is ushering in a decade of Jewish people feeling safe again to stand proudly in their Jewish identity and to fight the good fight,' she added. Zuckerbrot also shared the personal cost of her activism, revealing she had lost thousands of followers and a 30-year friendship due to her outspoken support for Trump. 'The losses are painful but Israel's facing an existential crisis and as Jews, we have a moral obligation to do whatever is needed to support Israel,' she said. 'I believe the work we are doing as Jewish people by supporting Donald Trump is God's work and therefore any friendships that have been lost, God has chosen to take those people out of my life and I'm very lucky to say that by being true to myself and my values.' She credited her alignment with like-minded advocates, such as Nazarian and Flicker, for giving her renewed strength in what she described as 'the fight of our life.' The panelists urged the Jewish community to stand together in solidarity, using their platforms to combat antisemitism and support Israel. 'Every voice matters right now,' Zuckerbrot concluded. 'Our brothers and sisters in Israel must know they have our unwavering support. You are not alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1kqysqdje	2025-01-26T06:08:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/B1QoVl2w1g/B1QoVl2w1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

13 Israels injured, 5 locals killed in serious bus accident in La...	A night bus driver in the East Asian country apparently fell asleep and the bus overturned into a ditch on the side of the road; 13 young Israelis were injured, 5 of them in moderate to serious condition. Some 13 young Israelis were injured Saturday night in a bus accident in Laos, including five who are in moderate to serious condition. Five people were killed in the accident, after the bus driver, who apparently fell asleep, crashed into a tree. The driver died from his injuries. The injured Israelis, aged 19 to 30, were on a night bus ('sleeper') that overturned in a ditch on the side of the road, on the way from the town of Vang Vieng to the town of Pakse. The dead are locals from Laos, and in addition to the Israelis, locals and about 10 Europeans also were injured. The injured Israelis received initial medical treatment at a small hospital nearby, then were treated in Pakse, and later - following the intervention of the MAGNUS International Search & Rescue team and the Foreign Ministry - they were transferred by ambulance to Thailand, for further treatment at a hospital with better medical facilities.

She is definately number one, Liri Albag's pround aunt says	Ruhama Albag tells ynet that she was not surprised to see her neices vigor and energy when she finally returned from 477 days of caprivity in Gaza; says she has a wonderful family that will help her on the long road to recovery Liri has returned home full of vigor, said her aunt Ruhama Albag on Sunday, 'I hope that continues and improves even more.' The proud aunt who joined Liri's parents and the rest of the families of hostages, in the struggle to bring about the captive's release said the fight would continue. Liri was released by Hamas on Saturday with Naama Levy, Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev in the second hostage release, part of the first phase of the cease-fire deal negotiated with Hamas. She was abducted from the Nahal Oz base where she had served as a lookout and was held by the terrorists in Gaza for 477 hellish days. Ruhama had not yet met her niece who had spent her first night out of captivity. 'I told her mom a long time ago that I was happy to wait for year to meet her if only I knew she was home. I don't need anything more than that,' she told ynet in an interview. 'Liri has personality and that does not change. I was not surprised to see her write Liri Albag number one and her wave out the window. But I was shocked at her energy. I guess this does not go away. She is a special child and we have never doubted her inner strength.' Liri's aunt understands that her niece has a long road to recovery ahead. 'She is home now and will be in full control of her life. She has a strong family and wonderful parents and in time things will work out and become clear.' But the struggle to bring all of the hostages is not over. 'All this euphoria lasts for the first 24 hours and the road is long. We all have a responsibility not just as a family. I think everyone has a responsibility to bring all of the hostages back. It is inconceivable that this is still going on after a year and three months. I imagine it would go on for nearly two years with all sorts of agreements.' Ruhama said that when the first group of hostages were released in 2023, the family heard how Liri was strong and holding the others together. 'But we don't know what happened after that, what conditions they were held under and what they had experienced.'

Incoming CIA chief says COVID-19 origin likely in China lab	John Ratcliffe appointed under the new Trump administration, says renewed look at reports indicates likelihood of virus leaking from Wuhan lab, contradicting predecessor's position Two days after incoming CIA Director John Ratcliffe assumed the role, the agency released an updated assessment on Sunday stating a high likelihood that the COVID-19 virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China. This marks a shift from its earlier neutral stance between the natural-origin theory and the lab leak hypothesis. The CIA clarified that the updated assessment wasn’t based on new intelligence but on a renewed analysis of existing data, including a deeper examination of the working conditions in Wuhan’s research labs prior to the outbreak. A spokesperson stressed that the possibility of a natural origin is still under review. Before taking office, Ratcliffe expressed firm support for the lab leak theory, calling the investigation into the virus's origin a 'top priority' for national security. 'I think our intelligence, our science and our common sense all really dictates that the origins of COVID was a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,' He said upon his swearing-in and vowed to push the CIA aggressively for more information. Reports suggest the updated assessment was developed during former U.S. president Joe Biden’s administration under former CIA Director William Burns, following National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s directive for a review of the pandemic’s origins. However, Ratcliffe decided to make the findings public, aiming to ensure the CIA’s involvement in the ongoing debate. Despite the shift, the assessment is classified as having 'low confidence,' indicating inconclusive intelligence. Intelligence officials warn that a definitive conclusion may never be reached due to limited data and China’s refusal to cooperate with international investigators. China has strongly rejected the CIA’s findings, accusing the U.S. of politicizing the issue. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson dismissed the claims as 'baseless rumors' and urged focus on scientific collaboration instead of accusations. The worldwide intelligence community remains divided on the issue. Some argue that the origin debate is secondary to China’s broader failures in regulating its live animal markets and research labs. Others view it as a critical intelligence question with far-reaching implications for U.S.-China relations. Since the pandemic's onset in 2019, conflicting reports from government and academic bodies have muddied the waters, with some supporting the lab-leak theory and others pointing to Wuhan’s live animal market as the likely source. Under the Biden administration, most intelligence agencies leaned toward a natural origin, albeit with low confidence. While agencies like the National Intelligence Council and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) supported a natural origin, the FBI and U.S. Department of Energy leaned toward the lab-leak hypothesis, albeit with differing specifics. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Amid these revelations, scientists and policymakers are calling for an independent investigation with unrestricted access to Chinese data. Many agree that uncovering the virus’s origin is vital for both scientific understanding and security, though some argue the growing pressure stems as much from geopolitical tensions as public health concerns. China continues to resist full cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Western entities, complicating efforts to resolve the mystery surrounding the pandemic’s origins. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjjgqq700kl	2025-01-26T02:40:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/03/19/9856564/9856564_0_94_1300_732_0_small.jpg
Crowds of Gazans gather at passages waiting to return to northern...	Israel and Gaza factions exchange blame over delay in allowing displaced residents of northern Gaza to move back while Hamas fails to release Arbel Yhoud or deliver details on the condition of the remaining hostages to be freed in the first phase of the deal A large crowd of displaced Gazans on Sunday gathered near the Netzarim Corridor waiting to cross to the northern parts of the Gaza Strip. Their passage had been delayed after Hamas failed to comply with its commitment to release Arbel Yahoud, a 28-year-old Israeli civilian on Saturday under the terms of the cease-fire agreement. Israel announced that until the release of Yahoud was clarified, and Hamas delivers a report on the condition of the remaining hostages, as it had committed to do, the IDF would not allow Gazans to return north. Images in the Palestinian media showed Gazans spending the night outdoors on the side of the A-Rashid road, waiting for their passage to be allowed and in the crowds that continue to gather there in the morning hours. They also reported that four people were wounded in IDF fire near the Nuseirat refugee camp. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told the Qatari Al Araby network that Israel was in violation of the agreement. 'Israel is delaying and postponing although we sent the certainty that Arbel Yahoud was alive. We demand that the mediators pressure Israel to allow displaced Gazans to return home,' he said. 'There are discussions underway with the mediators to find a solution and for the roads to be opened.' According to a CNN report earlier, Israel asked Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy, to intervene. According to an official, Israel's message to Witkoff read 'Push Hamas to comply with the terms and free Arbel.' The directorate for the families of hostages in the Prime Minister's Office (MPO) said on Sunday that they were informed of the recent events around the implementation of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. 'Hamas violated the agreement twice on Saturday. Arbel Yahoud was not released and the list detailing the conditions of the other hostages to be freed in phase one of the deal, was not delivered,' the directorate said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Therefore, it was decided not to allow the passage of Gazans to the northern areas. Since Saturday efforts were underway with the United States and the mediators to arrange the return of Arbel. Hamas was expected to raise obstacles along the way. We are determined to return all of the hostages both those living and the dead.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjubycmuyx	2025-01-26T02:35:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/BkDU400Qdke/BkDU400Qdke_0_189_542_306_0_small.jpg

Fight not over until all hostages home, grandfather of freed Naam...	Shaul Levy returns to stand in support of hostages return, this time holding the photo of Omer Wenkert after his own granddaughter was freed; 'All we could do is hug, no words, no questions,' he says of the reunion As he has done for the past 470 days, 78-year-old Shaul Levyi came on Sunday to the hostage square in Beer Sheva but this time he held up the picture of Omer Wenkert and not of his granddaughter Naama Levy who was released from Hamas captivity on Saturday. Hundreds stopped to give him a hug and talk for a bit and many who were in cars passing by, honked their horns in support of the granddad who had become a familiar feature and a symbol of the struggle for the hostages to be freed. Levy described the moment they met at the hospital. 'In this situation, all you can do is hug, and just be,' he said excitedly 'I waited a bit to give her a moment and not pressure her.' He said all he did was hug and kiss her and cry but did not ask her any questions. 'The most important thing is to give her time to understand what she had been through and that now she is safe and surrounded by love.' But the enormity of the situation was clear. 'I thought to myself now we are meeting her and this morning, the girls were sill in a tunnel, then made to participate in a show, to stand and be given release certificates.' He said there was a difficult emotion. 'But they came through it and the main thing is that they are home. 'One stone has been removed from the pile of weight,' he said adding that he had a need to come back and stand as he had before, at the square, for closure. A ceremony celebrating her release was held at Naama's old high school. Levy attended surrounded by hundreds of students who showered him with love and embraces. 'All my strength when I stand before you, is dissipating,' he told them. 'There is nothing that brings me more joy than Naama that I was fortunate to hug and feel yesterday. Without words. And your embrace today is huge. I am shaking. There is such a wonderful community here and there are you, the students that I love.'

PA's Abbas congratulates terrorist released in hostage deal	IDF continues to act trying to prevent celebrations following release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners after the release of additional Hamas hostages Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas called on Saturday to congratulate Yasser Abu Bakr, a senior operative of Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade after he was released from prison as part of the cease-fire agreement with Hamas. 'This is for the homeland, but they’ve [Israel] crossed the line with you,' Abbas told Abu Bakr, who replied, 'I think there’s no need to celebrate when thousands died in Gaza.' Abu Bakr was responsible for a 2002 terror attack in Netanya that killed two Israelis, including a 9-month-old baby, and was involved in other deadly strikes. Reports indicated that Fatah named a training program after him. Abbas's call sparked outrage in Israel. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X (formerly Twitter), 'Mahmoud Abbas remains a terror supporter and the Palestinian Authority is nothing more than a terrorist organization. His call to a murderer of Jews should be a wake-up call to those who still see the PA as an alternative to Hamas after the war.' Otzma Yehudit party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir added, 'You close your eyes to the PA rewarding murderers and teaching terror, release thousands of terrorists, stop the war in Gaza and retreat from Netzarim and northern Gaza. Give bulldozers to Hamas and don’t forget to tell us they’re deterred. It’s time to change the system.' Yisrael Beiteinu party leader Avigdor Lieberman wrote, 'Holocaust denier Abbas shows his true face again — a terror supporter congratulating vile murderers. Anyone embracing terrorists with blood on their hands is a terrorist and cannot be part of any process, let alone supervise the Rafah crossing.'

Trump, Netanyahu expected to meet, discuss Saudi deal	Prime minister expected to travel to D.C. early in February when negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza deal, begin; officials say Trump to use potential of normalization with Saudis and other Muslim nations to push PM not to resume war Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet U.S. President Donald Trump early in February although a date has not yet been set. Israeli officials say the meeting is important and the two nations would attempt to agree on a number of burning issues including the threat from Iran. Trump does not want to see an Israeli military strike but is willing to impose sever sanctions on Tehran while in Jerusalem, the officials said the sanctions must come with a credible threat of military action. Netanyahu's visit will coincide with the start of negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire deal in Gaza. Trump has said he agrees that Hamas must not remain as the rulers in the Strip but had also said he wants to see the agreement fulfilled in full rather than a resumption of the war if the talks fail. The officials said Trump would urge Netanyahu to continue talks, using the Saudi deal as an incentive. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to visit Riyadh in the near future to finalize the details of the normalization deal. The United States is working on a normalization package that includes other Muslim states as well, such as Malaysia and Oman. The Americans believe that normalization of ties with the Saudis would make it easier for Netanyahu to convince the more extremist elements in his government to agree to the second phase of the cease-fire deal.

IDF stays put in Lebanon after withdrawal deadline, Hezbollah thr...	Israel says Lebanon army, Hezbollah have yet to implement the deal fully, therefore withdrawal will be coordinated with the U.S.; Macron calls both sides to comply with agreement IDF forces remained in Lebanon on Sunday. 60 days after the cease-fire with Hezbollah began, despite the requirement to withdrawa all troops by 4:00 a.m. and after Israel formally announced that the pullout would be delayed over violations of the agreement by Lebanon. The Lebanese army accused Israel of 'delaying' its withdrawal and said in a statement it’s 'ready to deploy immediately once the IDF withdraws.' It also warned residents near the southern border to 'exercise caution due to mines and dangerous objects left by the Israeli army.' IDF spokesperson in Arabic Col. Avichay Adraee posted a statement urging residents not to move south of the marked villages on the map provided by the military. 'The IDF has no intention of attacking you, but for now, movement south of this line is prohibited until further notice. Anyone crossing south does so at their own risk,' he wrote, listing over 60 villages off-limits to returnees. French President Emmanuel Macron called on both sides to honor their commitments 'as soon as possible to restore Lebanon's sovereignty.' In a conversation with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Macron stressed compliance with the agreement, to which Aoun responded, 'Israel must be forced to uphold the terms of the agreement to preserve regional stability.' Last Friday, the Prime Minister's Office said that the cease-fire agreement allows for the IDF’s phased withdrawal, which depends on Lebanon's enforcement of the deal, including Hezbollah's retreat north of the Litani River. 'As the agreement has not been fully implemented by Lebanon, the phased withdrawal will continue in coordination with the U.S. Israel will not endanger its residents and will ensure the safe return of citizens to their homes,' the statement read. On Thursday, Hezbollah threatened that any presence of Israeli forces in Lebanon beyond the 60-day deadline would be considered a 'blatant violation' and an 'attack on Lebanon's sovereignty.' The terror group warned it might use 'all means necessary' to reclaim the land. Israel says hat the Lebanese army has yet to deploy fully in former Hezbollah strongholds, leading the Security Cabinet to decide — without a formal vote — that the withdrawal won’t be completed for now. Ministers agreed the IDF would respond forcefully to any violations by Hezbollah. While Hezbollah has largely refrained from responding to Israeli actions in Lebanon, its messaging consistently warns that failure to withdraw could reignite conflict.

Israeli officials say the sooner Arbel Yahoud is released the sooner Gazans would be allowed to return to the northern parts of the Strip; IDF Arabic language spokesperson posts urgent warning to stay away from Netzarim until further notice Thousands of displaced Gazans spent the night outside, sleeping on the streets, as they waited for the IDF to open the Netzarim Corridor and allow them to move back to the northern areas of the Strip. Israel announced on Saturday that the passage would remain closed after Hamas failed to release Arbel Yhoud from captivity on Saturday, as it had committed in the cease-fire deal. According to a report on CNN, officials asked Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff to intervene and 'push Hamas to comply with the terms of the agreement and release Arbel.' IDF Arabic Language spokesperson Avichai Adraee posted an urgent warning to Gazans not to approach the Netzarim Corridor. 'In light of the violations of the cease-fire by Hamas and to avoid friction and misunderstandings there has been no change to the instructions as they were in place.

Trump says Jordan, Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza	U.S. president he is looking at Gaza and seeing a demolition site 'its a real mess' adding that a removal of 1.5 million people to neighboring Arab nations would 'clean up the whole mess' U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza, Speaking to reporters on Air Force 1, when asked if this was a temporary or long-term suggestion, Trump said: 'Could be either.'

Former US ambassador: 'Saudis were very clear' about Palestinian ...	Jack Lew, who completed a year and a half as US envoy to Israel last week, claims the Saudis will not push the Palestinian issue aside like the Abraham Accords; In a farewell interview, he tells Ynet about the differences in the war between Netanyahu and Washington U.S. President Joe Biden's first request to Jack Lew to allow the president to appoint Lew as ambassador to Israel was in July 2023. In Israel, these were the peak days of protests against the judicial overhaul, but the Americans looked ahead, at the big geopolitical picture, and persisted in the quest to reach a normalization deal that would satisfy the U.S., the Sunni Muslim countries in the Middle East, and Israel. The announcement of Lew's appointment came in early September, but two months passed between confirmation in the Senate and his departure for Tel Aviv, and in the middle Hamas carried out the surprise attack on October 7. By the time Lew landed here, in a country stricken by shock, it seemed that an agreement with Saudi Arabia was the last thing on the agenda. His short tenure as ambassador, which ended last weekend with the change of administration in Washington, was focused mainly on the war; coordinating airlifts, defending international institutions, contacting families of hostages, and negotiating with Hamas. However, he insists that even during these 15 terrible months, he did not give up on the task of reengineering diplomatic relations in the Middle East. 'So when I came here, when President Biden asked me if I would accept this post, it was in July of 2023, so we're several months before October 7. The reason he asked me and that I accepted this post was to try and get Saudi Israeli normalization done,' Lew explained. 'Having the right people in the right place was going to make that more likely. I thought it was of huge strategic importance, and that was the, you know, that was the reasoning that brought me here. Originally, when I got here just three weeks into the war, it was in a very different circumstance. There hasn't been a day that I've been here that we haven't remained focused on Saudi normalization, where we have been very clear, even as we talked about the need to bring the cease-fire negotiations together. I mean, the hostage release and cease-fire could have created a window to complete Saudi normalization, and we now, obviously, in the last days, can't do it, but it is no less in the national interest of Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States to have Saudi normalization than it was in July of 2023 when I thought it was a good reason to change the same interest,' he said. I have never lived through a war day to day in the country fighting the war 'There hasn't been a day that I've been here that we haven't remained focused on Saudi normalization, where we have been very clear, even as we talked about the need to bring the cease-fire negotiations together,' Lew added. 'I mean, the hostage release and cease-fire could have created a window to complete Saudi normalization, and we now, obviously, in the last days, can't do it, but it is no less in the national interest of Saudi Arabia, Israel and the U.S. to have Saudi normalization than it was in July of 2023 when I thought it was a good reason to change the same interest. I think the interest is it.' 'Now, let me tell you what's changed before October 7, I believe that there was a need to address the issue of Palestinian self-governance. I don't know exactly what the required agreement would be, but it was not like the Abraham Accords, where you could just put that issue to the side. The Saudis were very clear about that. In my understanding, I think after October 7 all of the signals have been very much consistent with that, that there has to be a credible process to address those issues. Now I don't think that that requires doing anything that would create a risk to Israel's security. Then there's that any agreement would have to be predicated on Israel accepting it. It would have to be predicated on Israel being able to defend itself and have security.' When was the moment that you realized we are going to have a hostage deal? 'I thought there was going to be a hostage deal. I felt that over the last week, 10 days, it was clear that all the parties were trying to close. And a deadline helps in all difficult decisions. I will say that there had been enough hopeful moments that I believed it when both sides had actually approved it. It's been up and down and up and down. It's taken too long, and it's going to be a hard agreement to for all parties to continue to implement. So it's going to take ongoing focus and determination to get not just through the six weeks and the release of the 33 hostages, but to engage in the negotiation over phase two and to push those difficult issues to completion.' What was your involvement in the in the diplomatic contacts? Did you only get updates or you take active role in this process? 'So I've been closely connected to the U.S. diplomatic effort for the entire time that I've been here, I don't think a day has gone by when I haven't had conversations with our team directly or through members of my staff that were working with them. Sometimes it was advice to the team, sometimes it was coordinating the meetings between our leaders and leaders in Israel, so I can't say there was just one element to it.' 'It was a very long process, and I've been deeply engaged with the families of hostages, obviously the American hostage families, who are our first priority. But I can honestly say that I have not turned down meetings with any hostage families. I've met with the families of the young women soldiers. Quite a number of times I've been with families who are Israeli and not American. My feeling being here was that the things I could do directly were to make sure that the families knew we were doing everything that we could do.' 'I could answer questions as directly as possible to help them understand where I saw the state of the negotiations and when they asked me to do things, if they were things that I could do. Last Saturday night, just a week ago, I was in the Hostage Square with my colleagues, the ambassadors from UK and Germany. And it was because one of the families of the young woman soldiers said the world needs to know that these hostages come from your countries as well.' Is it really the same deal that was on the table in May? 'You don't have a deal until both parties want an agreement. Hamas did not want an agreement in May, no matter what was said here, you weren't going to have an agreement. I can't speak to what decision making went into, different moves made by the government of Israel, but it certainly was described to me that there was a desire for a deal. The action sometimes made it more challenging, as I just said, in terms of the public discussion of the Philadelphi Corridor, that's different from whether or not you are willing to accept a deal.' 'Fundamentally, Hamas made a decision, and I've said 1,000 times that whether we liked it or not, there wasn't going to be a deal if Hamas wouldn't accept a deal, because you couldn't unilaterally make a deal. So one can debate whether we could have moved things faster. We've never had any direct ability to influence Hamas. Hamas is influenced by the change of situation on the ground, and the war has obviously put pressure on them, the change of situation in the region, where the condition that after the very successful Israeli military operations in Lebanon, Syria, Iran, there's different reality in the region.' Do you think that Netanyahu will continue to the second stage? 'We're sitting here not even 24 hours after the government approved the agreement, I think there will be pressures in both directions. I personally believe that once hostages are released and they're reunited with their families there will be mixed emotions. We don't know exactly what condition they're in. We don't know exactly how everyone will feel when those moments come, but I think it will create a lot of pressure to give peace to the remaining families. I think if the negotiations can continue in the spirit that they've gone so far, there's a pathway here. It's a hard pathway, and it's going to require making decisions that need to be explained for the public to understand them, and that's what leadership is about.' There was no embargo Ambassador Lew is referring, among other things, to the conflict in the background of the UN Security Council resolution from last March, which approved a call for a cease-fire during Ramadan, mentioning the hostages, but without demanding their release. The U.S. abstained, but did not veto it. This led to a rift between Washington and Jerusalem, and Netanyahu's office was quick to announce the cancellation of the Israeli delegation that was supposed to go to the U.S. 'So if you have a resolution in the UN Security Council where the U.S. goal is to keep other countries on our side, saying a cease-fire has to be connected to the release of the hostages, if you change the language to get other countries to support you. You can choose to say, the US did not change its position. That was what we said. Or you can say, the US did change their position. That's what the government here said. I think that's a strategic mistake.' 'You can disagree with the language in private. You can say, I wish you wouldn't do that, but what we knew was we'd had no support in the UN if we went the other way. And subsequent to that, we've had to veto resolutions in the UN Security Council, because we can't get any other country to keep the ideas linked. So we took a change of grammar and it became daylight. I think that took a small difference and made it a daylight issue. It was not something that had to be daylight.' 'What was real was that the rest of the world was drifting, and we were trying to hold the rest of the world for as long as possible from drifting too far. The much discussed issue of munitions, we have provided more military support at a speed than we've ever done before. There was a different disagreement about one munition open public, the 2,000 pound bombs to describe that in public as an arms embargo, is completely exaggerated. The day that the shipment of 2,000 pound bombs did not go airplanes were delivering precision guided small diameter bombs. So it was a disagreement about an important, but a single, weapon system that for months colored the debate. Now I'm not saying there isn't a good reason.'

The footage from the hospital also showed the moving meeting between Daniella Gilboa and her partner Roy, after 477 days in which they did not see each other. The director of Beilinson Hospital, Dr. Lena Feldman Koren, said Saturday evening that 'their medical condition is stable, and we will provide them with all the care and support.' She said she was amazed by their 'spiritual strength,' adding: 'These are strong women who bravely survived for very long days and the light in their eyes never went out. They are here, they are with us, they are strong - and they are wonderful.' Hundreds gathered Saturday night in Ra'anana to celebrate the return of the hostages, including Naama Levy, a resident of the city. Mayor Chaim Broyde told Ynet: 'This is an exciting day. We called on people to come and sympathize with the families. We must not stop in the fight to bring everyone back.' He praised the Levy family as 'a noble family that waged a struggle worthy of every compliment.' He said that for more than a year he has been carrying a lock in his pocket for a heart display at Naama's school, which he hopes to open 'this evening.' Residents gathered Saturday night at the Amsterdam Sports Hall in Petah Tikva for a celebration initiated by the municipality in honor of the release of Daniella Gilboa, a resident of the city. During the day, residents took to the streets with Israeli flags and spontaneously danced in various parts of the city. At the end of Shabbat, the municipality announced a large festive event to mark the occasion. Daniella's friends took to the stage during the celebrations and excitedly said: 'Our Daniella is alive and she is home. We want to thank everyone who supported us along the way.' Petah Tikva Mayor Rami Greenberg said: 'When you see this excitement, you understand the importance of returning hostages. We are waiting for everyone.'

IDF blocks passage of displaced to northern Gaza over withholding...	Israel refuses to allow displaced Gazans to return to northern Gaza Strip without guarantees for Arbel Yehoud's release; Shots reportedly fired at displaced people attempting to return with one person killed by IDF fire Israel is trying to resolve the crisis of civilian Israeli Arbel Yehoud's prolonged captivity in Gaza despite the hostage return agreement. Arbel, who senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials have said is alive, was not released so far in the deal even though the agreement stipulated that civilians would be released before soldiers. It had been expected that she would be released Saturday in the second release of hostages in the first phase of the current agreement. The Prime Minister's Office announced that until her release is arranged, the Netzarim Corridor to the northern Gaza Strip will not be opened as stipulated in the cease-fire agreement. At the same time, Israel is working with the Americans to pressure Qatar to expedite Arbel's release. On Saturday afternoon, Palestinians reported that the IDF fired at displaced people who were trying to return to northern Gaza. At another location, on Salah a-Din Street, there was also IDF fire, reportedly killing one Gazan and wounding another. According to the IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari: 'Over the past day, IDF troops operated against threats posed to them in the Gaza Strip. IDF troops identified several gatherings of dozens of suspects that posed a threat to the forces. The troops fired warning shots to address the threat. ‏Contrary to the reports made over the past several hours, the IDF only fired warning shots to distance the suspects, and did not aim to shoot the suspects or to cause harm.' 'We emphasize that, as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused to the suspects as a result of the shooting. The IDF is determined to fully maintain the terms of the agreement to return the hostages. The IDF is prepared for any scenario and will take any necessary actions to thwart any immediate threat to IDF soldiers. The IDF calls the residents of Gaza to follow its announcements and avoid approaching the troops deployed in the area,' he added. A senior figure in one of the Palestinian terrorist organizations told the Al-Mayadeen network that 'Israel's lack of commitment to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza threatens to halt the implementation of the remaining terms of the agreement.' Meanwhile, an Egyptian source earlier told the AP that the issue of Arbel Yehoud's release and the withdrawal from Netzarim is a 'minor matter' that the mediators are working to resolve. The talks to resolve the issue are taking place behind the scenes, with Hamas claiming that the terror group has pledged to release Arbel next Saturday, while Israel is demanding guarantees for this. Israel is making it clear that the sooner Arbel is returned, the sooner the withdrawal from the Netzarim axis will begin. According to a source in the terrorist organizations, Arbel is a 'soldier' linked to the 'Israeli space program,' but these are unfounded claims. Israel has made it clear that Arbel Yehoud is alive and being held by another terror organization, but difficulties have arisen in transferring her to Hamas. Sources familiar with the details emphasized: 'Israel did not want to create a situation where it agrees to a violation. This is not frivolity, but insisting the agreement is upheld after consultations.' The prime minister's spokesman denied Hamas' claims Saturday evening that Israel received a sign of life from Arbel. Israel also asked the Americans to pressure the Qataris to promote a solution to the crisis. Mossad chief David Barnea is also holding intensive talks with the Qatari prime minister to find a solution. A White House spokesperson said that they continue to push for Arbel Yehoud's release through negotiation channels. One of the options being considered is that Hamas will give Israel a clear sign of life, or release her before the next time on Saturday. At the same time, there is concern that Hamas will further delay the list it was supposed to deliver on Saturday, which is supposed to list the number of living hostages. In Hamas' view, Israel is also currently violating the agreement, and therefore there is no certainty that they will agree to hand over this list. The Qataris are making an effort to find a solution that will prevent the deal from collapsing. Hamas has made accusation s against Israel, claiming that 'the occupation is still delaying the implementation of the cease-fire and prisoner exchange conditions, by continuing to close al-Rashid Street and preventing the return of displaced persons from the south to the north. We hold the occupation responsible for any disruption in the implementation of the agreement and its implications for the other stations.'

We are waiting and looking forward to the moment when we can hug our Arbel as soon as possible.' Meanwhile, NBC reported that Keith Siegel who holds American citizenship will be released in one week on Saturday as well as Sagui Dekel-Chen. The remaining freed American citizens are scheduled to be released in a second phase. In Israel, however, they say that both are on the list, but there is still no certainty that this will happen. 'There is no list yet,' an Israeli source said in response to the report. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkykw6gdje	2025-01-25T12:54:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/SyeuWJKGukx/SyeuWJKGukx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
UN refugee chief calls for more help for Syria as refugees return...	The United Nations refugee chief said Saturday that some 200,000 refugees have returned to Syria from neighboring countries since the government of Bashar Assad was overthrown last month. The influx comes after an estimated 300,000 refugees returned from Lebanon late last year while it was under bombardment during the Israel-Hezbollah war. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi cautioned during a visit to Damascus during which he met with Syria's new de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, that many of the returnees may not stay unless living conditions in the country improve. He called for the lifting of Western sanctions on the country, many of which targeted Assad's government but have not been removed since it fell on Dec. 8 as the result of a lightning rebel offensive. There are more than 4.7 million refugees registered with the U.N. refugee agency, or UNHCR in neighboring countries. The largest number are in Turkey, with nearly 2.9 million, followed by Lebanon, with more than 755,000. In addition to returning refugees, some 600,000 out of an estimated 7 million internally displaced Syrians have gone home, Grandi said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjmt00cfoje	2025-01-25T12:35:22-08:00

The American billionaire, who caused a stir after being filmed performing a gesture reminiscent of the Nazi salute, said in a video speech at a conference of the far-right Alternative for Germany party: 'Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents' Billionaire Elon Musk made a surprise appearance via video link at an election event for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the eastern city of Halle on Saturday. Days before the world marks International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, Musk said that in Germany 'there is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that.' He said that 'children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents,' apparently referring to Germany's Nazi past. Speaking to an audience of 4,500 people, alongside party leader Alice Weidel, Musk added: 'We need to look at the future of Germany with optimism and enthusiasm. It's important to be proud of these German culture and values. It's about preserving German culture and protecting the German people. Convince people to vote AfD. Its (the party's) policies make sense.' Musk, who also spoke of suppression of speech under Germany's government, has previously attacked German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on X. Earlier this week, the American billionaire caused a stir after Donald Trump was sworn in as U.S. president. At the end of Musk's speech during the festivities he was filmed making a gesture reminiscent of the Nazi salute.

Senior US government source told NBC that the 65-year-old hostage, an American citizen, will be among the hostages released next Saturday; The source also said that Sagui Dekel-Chen, who has U.S. citizenship, will be released 'immediately after,' likely the next day Hostage Keith Siegel - who holds both American and Israeli citizenship - will be released in the next hostage return next Saturday, NBC reported on Saturday after the release of the four female from Hamas captivity. The network attributed the information to a senior American government official, who added that American-Israeli hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen will be released 'immediately after him.' The remaining American citizens are scheduled to be released in Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Israeli officials, however, they say that both men are on the list, but there is still no certainty that when their release will happen. An Israeli source said in response to the report out of the U.S. that 'there is still no list' that would guarantee that Keith Siegel will indeed be released. In addition to Siegel in the next release, Hamas and Islamic Jihad promised to also release civilian Israeli woman Arbel Yehoud, who was supposed to be released in the current round. According to the agreement between Israel and Hamas, all the civilians were supposed to be released before the soldiers. In addition, IDF spokesman Brigadier General Daniel Hagari said that there is serious concern for the lives of Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir. Hamas and Islamic Jihad confirmed that Arbel is alive. The Prime Minister's Office announced Saturday that until her release is arranged, the Netzarim Corridor will not be opened for the return of civilians to the northern Gaza Strip.

White House lifts embargo on sending heavy bombs, D9 bulldozers t...	Critical shipment for Israel unfrozen by the Trump administration includes 1,700 heavy bombs for the Air Force from Boeing and 134 D9 bulldozers from Caterpillar The White House on Saturday lifted the embargo on supplying 2,000-pound heavy bombs and D9 bulldozers to Israel. This means that the shipment that the Biden administration had delayed, out of fear that Israel would use bombs in population centers in Gaza, will now arrive in the country. The critical shipment that has now been unfrozen includes, among other things, 1,700 heavy bombs for the Air Force from Boeing, along with 134 D9 bulldozers from Caterpillar and other weapons. The IDF had already prepared in advance for the unfrozen embargo on this shipment, in preparation for Trump's entry into the White House. The bombs for the Air Force, which the defense establishment had already purchased from Boeing - using shekels and not in aid dollars - weighing close to a ton per bomb, were frozen, since the US was concerned that the IDF might harm civilians with them. The decision to freeze them was made shortly before the start of the ground operation in Rafah, due to American concerns about using them in such a densely populated area. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The use of the D9 bulldozer to flatten buildings in the Gaza Strip led to major internal criticism in the U.S., protests, and tremendous pressure on the Biden administration, which gave in and froze their delivery for months.

These bulldozers were also needed in southern Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryn2anmojl	2025-01-25T10:50:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/rybWjsAwJe/rybWjsAwJe_0_40_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
CIA now says COVID-19 'more likely' to have come from lab	I onclude whether COVID-19 was the result of a lab incident or it originated in nature. But in the final weeks of the Biden administration, former CIA Director William Burns asked CIA analysts and scientists to make a clear determination, stressing the pandemic's historical significance, according to a senior U.S. official. The CIA says it has 'low confidence' in its assessment that a 'research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely' and notes in its statement that both scenarios - lab origin and natural origin - remain plausible. China's government says it supports and has taken part in research to determine COVID-19's origin, and has accused Washington of politicizing the matter, especially because of efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate. Beijing has said claims that a laboratory leak likely caused the pandemic have no credibility. â€œThatâ€™s a day-one thing for me,' he said.

Families of 3 women who remain in Gaza celebrate return of 4 fema...	After the release of the four soldiers, three young women remain in Hamas captivity: Arbel Yehoud, 29, Shiri Bibas, 33, and soldier Agam Berger, 20, who is due to be released in the next round The Berger family said on Saturday afternoon that they are happy about the return of Naama Levy, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Liri Albag and are waiting for the return of Agam, who is due to be released in the next round, provided that Hamas abides by the agreement. Alongside Agam, Israel is demanding that civilian Arbel Yehoud, who was due to be released before the soldiers, be released in the next round - and even before her. According to reports, American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, will also be released with them. The IDF spokesperson said there is serious concern for the life of hostage Shiri Bibas, and the lives of her young children Ariel and Kfir. Agam Berger's story and the family's response 'Thank you to the people of Israel for the warm embrace,' the family said. 'We are happy and excited about the return of our four daughters home, we are all one big family! We are waiting and looking forward to embracing Agam, with God's help, as early as next week. We will not rest until all the hostages are returned home safely.' Aharon, Agam's grandfather, spoke with Ynet at the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv. 'I look forward to seeing her next week, and hope that they will abide by all the agreements. The liaison officer informed us that it will be next week,' he saud. 'I am happy, but disappointed that Agam is not among them,' Aharon also said. 'But this is reality. What can be done? I am also disappointed with the entire conduct of the negotiations. More could have been done, and earlier. On the one hand, I am very happy for the families that we know well, and I know how the parents feel, but let's hope it will be okay. The enemy is unpredictable, like the Israeli government. Like they did the first time and blew the whole deal for nothing and it cost people's lives.' Did it encourage you to see them smiling and standing on their feet? 'Very much. Of course. What a question, I am also preparing to meet them, they knew that.' On the morning of October 7, when she fled to bomb shelter, Agam forgot her phone in the bedroom. She called her sister Bar from the phone of one of her friends, the late Shirat Yam Amar. In the first call, she told her parents that she was safe on base, that everything was fine. About 20 minutes later, she called again, and said one last sentence: 'Mom, they are shooting at us, there are terrorists, everyone is crying, but I am not afraid.' That morning, five female reconnaissance soldiers were kidnapped from the Nahal Oz outpost by Hamas. Noa Marciano was also taken but was murdered at Shifa Hospital and later recovered by the IDF. Ori Magidish was rescued alive by the IDF in a daring operation. Arbel Yehoud's story and the family's response Arbel Yehoud, 29, a civilian from Nir Oz, was supposed to be released, but Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed 'technical difficulties' before her release. Arbel's family said earlier that 'our hearts are filled with joy over the return of Karina, Daniela, Liri and Naama. We are waiting and looking forward to the moment when we can embrace our Arbel as soon as possible.' Israel has informed Hamas and Islamic Jihad that it will not allow the return of displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip until reliable guarantees are received for the release of Arbel, who is alive. On Saturday afternoon, there were reports in Gaza of fatal shots at displaced people who were waiting to travel to northern Gaza. There is optimism that the crisis will be resolved, since the Islamic Jihad confirmed that she was in their hands. The Yehoud family is a descendant of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz, and children Dolev, Neta and Arbel are the third generation who chose to start a family there. On October 7, all three of them were in their apartments on the kibbutz. Their parents left Nir Oz a few years ago, but remained connected to the community. During the kidnapping, the terrorists murdered the couple's dog, which they had adopted shortly before October 7. They named her Murph, after the heroine in Arbel's favorite movie, 'Interstellar' Arbel, the youngest, was kidnapped from her apartment with her partner Ariel Cunio, who has not been included at this point on the lists of hostages set to be returned in this phase of the release deal. Ariel's brother, David Cunio, was also kidnapped and held captive, while his wife Sharon and his two daughters were released in the first deal in November 2023. During the kidnapping, the terrorists murdered the couple's dog, which they had adopted shortly before October 7. They named her Murph, after the heroine in Arbel's favorite movie, 'Interstellar.' 'Arbel has a magnetic smile, no one can resist it,' said her father. 'She is in touch with the elderly on the kibbutz and always helps them with a lot of patience. I would come to the kibbutz once a week and leave with pride.' Dolev, the oldest, was murdered on October 7 after he went out to treat the wounded as a volunteer medic for Magen David Adom, leaving behind his three children and his wife, who was then pregnant with their fourth daughter. For months, the family thought Dolev had been kidnapped, until his body was found in June. Neta Yehoud, the middle brother, was besieged in a bomb shelter for 11 hours with his daughter. His wife Hodaya was abroad at the time. The terrorists entered and left their home three times and, despite this, the two survived. In the evening, He left his daughter in the kibbutz's compound and went looking for his siblings, Dolev and Arbel. He did not find his brother, but came across the bodies of friends and burned-down houses, including the house of the neighbors, the Bibas family. The Bibas family's story and the family's response Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir were supposed to be released in the previous deal before it broke down. In this deal, they were supposed to be top priorities but Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not releasing them. Unfortunately, there are grave concerns for the lives of the Bibas family – Yarden, Shiri, Ariel and Kfir – which Israel has not received any indication. 'Morning 477, we did not rest tonight either,' the Bibas family said Saturday. 'Yesterday at 4:00 p.m. when the list of released hostages was published, our world collapsed on us. Although they had prepared us for this, we had hoped to see Shiri and the children on the list that was supposed to be a list of civilians.' They criticized the media for ignoring Shiri and the children, and reporting mainly about the fact that Arbel Yehoud from Nir Oz was not among the freed women. 'In the evening, when we turned on the news, our pain, our struggle and, especially, the important discourse about the complexity of not being on the list disappeared from the media. Dear supporters, who do not give up, continue to pray, hope and demand answers. An exciting and complex day lies ahead. Liri, Daniella, Naama, and Karina, we are waiting to see you smiling and wrapped up in your amazing families at home.' Shortly after the news was published, and after the release of the four soldiers, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari issued a statement to the media: 'We are committed to the return of Agam Berger, who is still in captivity. Hamas did not live up to the agreement in its obligation to return civilians first. We will insist that Arbel Yehoud return, as well as Shiri and the children of the Bibas family, for whom we have very serious concerns and we expect certainty in this matter, and that they return soon.' The Bibas family was kidnapped on October 7 from their home in Nir Oz. During the war, footage from the day of the kidnapping was released, showing Shiri, Ariel and Kfir being led through the streets of Khan Younis, and Yarden being led on a motorcycle through a Gazan crowd. Hamas claimed in late November 2023 that Shiri and her two children were not alive. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The terrorist organization did not publish any proof of this, and Israel did not signal at the time that there was any indication of this.

Daniela, Liri, Naama and Karina were held together for much of the time and were often forced to loo after their captors' children and cook for the terrorists while receiving very little food for themselves; They are said to have met 'very serious Hamas figures' during their captivity and heard their parents interviewed on the radio and saw their pictures on signs in Israel Daniela Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev, who returned to Israel on Saturday after 477 days in Hamas captivity , were held throughout the period in civilian apartments and tunnels, in poor sanitary conditions, and often did not shower for long periods. They were forced to cook and clean for their captors, sometimes even while receiving little food for themselves. In addition, the four returned hostages were exposed to the media at times, when they were able to listen to the radio and heard their families on it. Therefore, when they met with their parents and sibings for the first time after their release, the young soldiers told them what heroes they were. 'You were truly my strength. I heard you so much, and you are truly the only ones who gave me hope,' Liri told her parents, after telling her family that she had heard them while she was in captivity. In addition, they also knew about the hostage release deal that took place in November 2023, and one of them heard her family members wishing her well on the radio on her birthday. At times, the four were held together, and at times they were forced to babysit the children of some of their captors. During their captivity, as could be seen in the psychological terror video released by Hamas after their release, they learned to speak Arabic. The Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation reported that all four female observers who returned Saturday were held together in captivity with Agam Berger, who is due to be released in the third round next Saturday, and that in recent days they were separated from her - a separation that was very difficult for them. It also noted that during the first days of captivity, an adult was with them who took care of their food and showering, and mediated between them and the terrorists. They were moved from place to place within Gaza City disguised as Palestinian women, and were held both in tunnels and in buildings. The public broadcaster reported that that the main media outlet to which they were exposed while in captivity was Al-Jazeera, and Hamas terrorists told them about the IDF's fighting in the Gaza Strip. Thus, they knew about the incident in which 21 fighters were killed in a building explosion, and said that they felt that December 2023 was the month with the most significant fighting. The public broadcaster's report also noted that Liri Abag was the one who took care of the group, spoke to the terrorists, and was the 'leader.' Regarding Hamas' attempt to humiliate them by releasing them by putting them on stage, an attempt that failed, they said: 'We showed them on stage, it didn't move us. We are stronger than that.' In the helicopter, they joked with the families, asking them to speak Arabic and saying that otherwise they wouldn't understand.

It was also reported that they told their families that 'there were times when there was no food, and when the IDF attacked nearby places, it was scary. We supported each other and held each other.' In addition, according to the report, they told the families that the fight for them gave them hope, and also that 'we saw our pictures on the signs in Israel, we even laughed about the choice of pictures.' Liri said that she saw the hat her family took out, with the inscription 'Hope' like her tattoo. The same report also noted that Naama Levy was in captivity with Doron Steinbrecher, who was released last week, and they did sports exercises together to keep themselves fit. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skxrfnfdjg	2025-01-25T10:15:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/ryrLroMOyl/ryrLroMOyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

According to the IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, 'Over the past day, IDF troops operated against threats posed to them in the Gaza Strip. IDF troops identified several gatherings of dozens of suspects that posed a threat to the forces.

We emphasize that as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused to the suspects as a result of the shooting. The IDF is determined to fully maintain the terms of the agreement to return the hostages. The IDF is prepared for any scenario and will take any necessary actions to thwart any immediate threat to IDF soldiers.
