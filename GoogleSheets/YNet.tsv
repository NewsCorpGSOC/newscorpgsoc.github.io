World unites in commemoration of October 7 and calls for release ...	Commemorations around world over marked first anniversary of Hamas attack, with events from the US to Europe honoring the victims; 'We are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel' On Monday, commemorations were held around the world to mark the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas massacre, as communities honored the victims and raised awareness about the hostages still held in Gaza. In the United States, students from elementary to college levels participated in the 'Yellow Shirt Initiative,' organized by Club Z, a Jewish advocacy group. Students wore yellow to remember the victims of the attack and to call attention to the 101 hostages still in captivity, including seven American citizens and a baby, Kfir Bibas, kidnapped at nine months old. 'By wearing yellow, we are sending a clear message that none of us are alone,' said Masha Merkulova, founder of Club Z. 'We are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel and the release of hostages.' 'Many students have encountered Jew hatred in their schools after October 7. They often feel alone and isolated. By fellow students, teachers, and strangers all wearing yellow to remember the horrors of October 7 and the hostages still in captivity, we are sending a clear and strong message that none of us are alone,' said Masha Merkulova, founder of Club Z. 'The families of the hostages will see that they are not forgotten. Club Z empowers us to have a voice and to learn how to lead change for good. I am proud of this student-led initiative. Together, we are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel, supports the release of hostages from the hands of a terror organization and stands with humanity,' The yellow ribbon has been a popular emblem of support during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis (when 52 Americans were held in captivity in Tehran for 444 days), for military families during Operation Desert Storm and a symbol of a loved one who is missing or has been abducted (for example, Fiona Cameron wore yellow ribbons after her daughter Sasha was abducted in 1999). 'The yellow symbolizes awareness and support, it sends a message that we are all together, especially for those far from home,' explained Club Z teen Eli Fooksman, 'you don’t need to be Israeli or Jewish to mourn the loss of so many innocent lives on October 7 or to call for the unconditional release of children, women and men. It’s not an Israeli issue. It is a humanitarian issue.' In the Netherlands, around 2,000 people gathered in the town of Barneveld in a memorial event organized by Christians for Israel. The event featured prayers, speeches and a performance of the song Am Yisrael Chai led by Dutch Chief Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs. 'Anti-Zionism is antisemitism,' Rabbi Jacobs told the crowd, a message that resonated as attendees expressed solidarity with Israel. 'These 2,000 people here today are just a small part of the more than 60,000 members we have across the Netherlands,' said Frank van Oordt, CEO of Christians for Israel. 'We are here not only to mourn but to express hope—hope that even in the most difficult of times, love and solidarity can overcome hatred and violence.' 'Our love and support for Israel are boundless. We stood together today as a testament to the power of friendship and faith, and we will continue to do so in the days to come,' van Oordt said in his closing remarks. 'We stood here today, as we have stood for years, united in our belief that Israel deserves our support not just in words but in action,' said Christians for Israel Chairman Rev. Frank Heikoop, emphasizing the movement’s unwavering commitment to supporting Israel. 'This gathering shows the deep bond that exists between our nations.' In Vienna, the 104-year-old Wunderwerk Wien church hosted an event standing against rising antisemitism. Pastor Birgit Berchtold, who leads the Pentecostal-charismatic congregation, emphasized the church’s historical support for Israel, saying, 'As Christians, our faith compels us to stand with Israel not only in words but in action. We believe that by supporting Israel, we are living out our calling to love, honor and protect those who are persecuted.' Sweden also hosted a memorial service, with hundreds gathering at Kristet Center in Örebro to stand with Israel and honor the victims of the attack. Pastor Per-Åke Eliasson of Kristet Center affirmed his congregation’s support for Israel, saying, 'We refuse to be silent in the face of such evil. Our support for Israel is rooted in love, in faith, and in the belief that we must stand up against hatred wherever it exists.' He emphasized that their support goes beyond times of celebration. 'We stand with Israel not just in times of joy, but especially in times of suffering. Our voices will rise against injustice, and our prayers will strengthen those who fight for freedom and peace.' These commemorations, held in different parts of the world, underscored the global solidarity with Israel and the ongoing calls for the release of hostages and peace in the region.

In Jerusalem, US Senator Graham urges Israel-Saudi normalization ...	Prominent U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Saudi Arabia and Israel on Tuesday to establish diplomatic ties by the end of the year, warning that the next U.S. administration is unlikely to be able to secure enough votes to support the deal. The Biden administration is seeking to broker a normalization accord between the two countries that would include U.S. security guarantees for Gulf state Saudi Arabia, among other bilateral deals between Washington and Riyadh. 'We can get you a treaty through the Senate between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a defense agreement like you have in Japan and Australia, if you do it on President Biden's watch,' Graham, who is seen as close to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, told reporters in Jerusalem. 'The next president will have a very difficult time getting 67 votes,' he said in reference to the two-thirds majority needed in the U.S. Senate to approve a defense treaty. Democrat Joe Biden's term as president will end on Jan. 20. Graham, a longtime senator, is a key Republican in Congress with influence on foreign policy and national security matters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1s4fjfkjg	2024-10-08T05:45:29-07:00	
I want to go back': Heroic October 7 survivor Rachel Edri reject...	A year after holding off Hamas terrorists with tea and cookies during 17-hour hostage ordeal, Edri plans to return to her southern Israel home; despite trauma, she insists, 'I want to live and die in that house. It’s my home' Rachel Edri, who survived a harrowing 17-hour hostage situation during Hamas' October 7 attack, has vowed to return to her home in Ofakim, where she and her husband, David, were held captive by five Hamas terrorists. Edri, 66, managed to deceive the terrorists, keeping them at bay with conversation and even offering them tea and cookies. After a complex rescue operation involving her son Evyatar, a police officer, both she and her husband were freed. David passed away four months after the ordeal, never fully recovering from the trauma. Edri's story has since become a symbol of resilience in Israel. Her likeness has been featured on the popular prime-time sketch show Eretz Nehederet (often dubbed 'the Israeli Saturday Night Live') and starred in a web comedy series. Her image has appeared in countless, online memes, murals and even tattoos. She has also been the subject of a documentary about her life which is set to air soon by public broadcaster Kan 11. Along with her son Evyatar, Edri has toured internationally, sharing her experience with Jewish communities. 'Over the past year, my mom and I lectured in London, Berlin and various places in the U.S., mainly for Jewish organizations like the Gush Etzion Foundation or Friends of Israel,' Evyatar said. 'It really helps me, and every time I share what we went through, it eases me emotionally,' Rachel added. However, Edri still struggles to cope with the loss of her beloved husband. 'David wasn’t just my husband, he was my best friend,' she said. 'We were together for 43 years and my best years were with him. When the terrorists put a gun to David’s head, they told him, 'You won’t be alive by morning.' David was in shock from that moment on. 'Even after we were rescued, he never returned to his past self. From that day, he withered before my eyes. I’m telling you this now and I can't stop crying. It got to the point where he couldn’t do anything on his own. For four months, I bathed him, dressed him and fed him. I took care of him all the time, praying to God, 'Don’t take away him from me.' 'He could barely speak anymore. I would ask him, 'David, tell me what hurts,' but he would stay silent. I’m not myself since he died. I have no days or nights without him. Every day when it gets dark, I curse it. It’s just another night of sleeping without him,' she recounted. Are you receiving psychological treatment? How do you spend your day? 'I receive close support from a wonderful social worker and I participate in support groups in Ofakim for senior women affected by October 7. As part of the groups, I attend classes and special events.' Where do you currently live? 'In a house in Ofakim with the rent paid by the government. The day after my first interview we were moved to a hotel, but I asked to return to Ofakim less than a month later. I wanted my peace, my spot and my kitchen.' Evyatar: 'Mom is living with my younger brother now. It's going to get even more complicated because she’s decided she wants to return to her previous home in Ofakim — despite everything that happened there and even though there’s now a memorial for the fallen near the house.' 'At first, we tried to dissuade her, saying, 'Why would you want these flashbacks and nightmares?' Ofakim’s mayor also approached us and offered to buy the house and turn it into a museum. But Mom refused. She said, 'I want to go back. I want to live and die in that house. It’s my home.' To me, her words are a victory. The house is currently under renovation, and she'll move in five months from now,' he added. Rachel, won't it be hard for you to return to live in the house with all those difficult memories? 'I’m sure it’ll be very hard to return to the place where this trauma took place. But I want to show the terrorists that I’m not afraid. I’m going back to the house where my children grew up and where my husband lived and I’m not planning to leave it until the day I die.'

40% of US Muslims deny October 7 atrocities, survey finds	Less than third of US Muslims believe terrorists engaged in acts of murder and rape during massacre; Harris put in tough position, balancing pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian voters to win critical swing state of Michigan and presidency Almost 4 in 10 U.S. Muslims (39%) believe that Hamas did not engage in acts of murder and rape during the October 7 attack on Israel, while only 31% acknowledge that Hamas terrorists did commit such acts, according to a new survey conducted by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, revealing significant divisions in how American Muslims view the terrorist group's actions that day. The survey, conducted by J.L. Partners, also found that 59% of American Muslims see the attack as an effort 'to advance the Palestinian cause,' compared to just 14% who, like 51% of the general American public, view it as motivated by a desire 'to kill Jews and seek the destruction of Israel.' The poll surveyed 1,000 respondents from the general public, with an additional 500 Muslim respondents. The findings underscore the complexity facing Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as she seeks to balance support from Jewish and Arab voters. Harris, a staunch supporter of Israel’s right to self-defense, has also expressed concern over civilian casualties in Gaza, drawing criticism from both sides. In Michigan, a key swing state with a significant Arab and Muslim population, Harris met with community leaders last week to hear their concerns, aware that losing their support could jeopardize her campaign. The survey shows that 49% of Muslims in the U.S. believe Harris is too pro-Israel, while 29% consider her position balanced. Only 7% feel she is overly supportive of Palestinians. These tensions are playing out as Harris faces tight races in several battleground states, with polls showing her lead within the margin of error in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan—states that are critical to her electoral strategy. The survey also highlights a key contrast in voting priorities. While 34% of Muslims in the U.S. identify the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the most important issue in the upcoming November 5 elections, only 4% of the general public shares this view, with most Americans prioritizing inflation and economic concerns.

Dozens of interceptions seen over northern Israel following Hezbo...	Rocket sirens blare in Haifa, Acre and other regions in northern Israel in two separate volleys shortly following Hezbollah deputy chief's speech; IDF says 85 rockets fired in first salvo from sector where IDF operations began overnight Dozens of rocket interceptions in two separate volleys were observed Monday afternoon in the skies over northern Israel, including Haifa, Acre and the surrounding areas, following a series of rocket sirens. Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency services said there were no immediate reports of injuries after conducting sweeps of the areas where alarms were triggered. The first barrage occurred shortly after a speech by Hezbollah Deputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem, following the assassination of the terrorist group's leader Hassan Nasrallah, by Israeli forces in Beirut. 'Attempts to pressure and intimidate us will fail. We are inspired by Nasrallah's strength, and we are his sons. He left behind a legacy of strong resistance across a wide front,' Qassem said, with a second rocket salvo fired about 30 minutes later. 'Israel aimed to eliminate the resistance and destroy the Palestinian people, but the Palestinian people cannot be defeated.' Qassem also remarked on Lebanon’s role, saying that 'the Lebanese front has exhausted the enemy' and indicated that Hezbollah would only consider a cease-fire if efforts by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri for a 21-day truce were successful. 'We support the political process led by Berri for a cease-fire. Until then, there will be no discussion,' Qassem said. The IDF reported that 'approximately 85 rockets were launched from Lebanon, and interception attempts were made. The details are under investigation.' The army added that Israeli forces struck Hezbollah terror targets in the Dahieh district of Beirut. The heavy rocket barrage on Haifa originated from a sector where IDF operations began Monday night. Earlier in the day, rocket sirens were also triggered in Tiberias and several nearby communities, including Mitzpeh, Kfar Hittim and Lavi. The IDF reported that 25 rockets had been fired from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted, while others landed in open areas. The Tiberias municipality confirmed that three rockets exploded in open fields, and no injuries were reported. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s official news agency reported that three people were killed in an airstrike in Suhmur, in the western Bekaa Valley. Earlier reports indicated airstrikes in several locations in southern Lebanon, including Sarfa, Arzoun, Alma al-Shaab and other areas near the Israeli border.

Like unleashed lions': Inside high-stakes IDF operation in Hezbo...	On October 7, Golani's 13th Battalion fought in Nahal Oz with equipment soaked in their comrades’ blood; after months of frustration on northern border, they're now eliminating Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon, using tactics honed in Gaza Thick clouds of dust rise along the road leading to Maroun al-Ras, a key hilltop village in southern Lebanon overlooking the Israeli communities of Avivim and Yir’on. Israeli D9 bulldozers and tanks, operating under the command of the Golani Brigade, now move freely in the area. Just over a week ago, however, Golani soldiers approached the village by foot, navigating through boulders and rugged terrain in the dead of night, just before the first autumn rains would transform the dry landscape into a dense thicket. The IDF has gained rapid operational control over the area, enabling freer movement within this hostile village, which played a symbolic role in the 2006 Lebanon War. Maroun al-Ras sits on a ridge extending toward the nearby town of Bint Jbeil, and Israeli commanders now travel back and forth across the border with relative ease—just over a mile away. In the midday sun, IDF bulldozers shine as they clear new routes and demolish structures that Hezbollah forces once used as launching points for their elite Radwan Force. Nearby, Golani support troops assist their comrades on the front lines. Just days ago, the unit’s drone operators halted the advance of two Israeli Namer armored personnel carriers after detecting six massive, linked explosives planted by Hezbollah fighters. The support company continues to fulfill its mission with advanced observation and attack capabilities. Their drones, precision mortar fire, snipers and logistical operations, including ammunition and equipment transport, play a critical role in assisting the troops stationed at the front. These soldiers, who traversed significant distances on foot deep within Israeli territory, have been preparing for this operation in recent months, despite limited training time due to the ongoing 'defensive battle' in the region. Eight months frustrating months of waiting For months, Israeli soldiers stationed along a security buffer zone within Israeli territory faced uncertainty and frustration. While their comrades from the Givati and Nahal brigades fought in Gaza, these troops remained long-term on outposts with no clear end date. 'Now, they’re like lions unleashed from a cage,' said company commander Capt. Rotem Mizrahi. 'We endured eight challenging months, filled with uncertainty, despite the defensive gains we made. One day we were told we might go back to Gaza, the next, we were preparing for Lebanon. Fighting in Gaza was seen as more 'glamorous,' but this time, everything went as planned.' These soldiers, now engaged in combat in southern Lebanon, have been targeting Hezbollah positions with the precision of a simulator, using the large stockpile of weapons they discovered. Despite their youth, some barely 20 years old, signs of stress shown in the white streaks in their hair as they take a break among the yellowing foliage of their makeshift home for the past six months. Many of these young fighters, who were still high school seniors on October 7 last year, now carry M4 rifles, having moved on from the Israeli-made Tavor rifles previously associated with Israel's infantry over the past two decades. Others bear the marks of the past year more visibly, with wrinkles and a mature, hardened demeanor. 'These soldiers have grown so much that I feel like I’m talking to 30- or 40-year-olds,' Mizrahi noted. 'They’ve gained a lifetime of experience, not just in combat but in life itself.' His deputy, Lt. Ziv Braymok, recounted preparing for a dawn assembly at 5:30 a.m. on the day the war broke out, while stationed in Nahal Oz. 'It started with a heavy barrage of mortars,' he said. 'We quickly gathered 20 soldiers and took out the snipers' rifles. Just 20 of us faced hordes of Hamas terrorists, and we managed to kill 70 of them.' 'Equipment soaked in the blood of fallen comrades was repurposed for the battle. Since then, I’ve been going at full speed. I’ll finish my role and then get out.' That morning, Lt. Braymok saw some of his soldiers fall, some dying in his arms. Before leading his troops to reclaim the Nahal Oz outpost, he received a call from his commanding officer, Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg, who later fell in battle. 'He told me, 'No, go to Kibbutz Kfar Aza. There are many enemies there,'' Braymok recalled. The difficult decision, made at 7:30 a.m. that day — choosing where to fight and whom to save — still resonates deeply with these soldiers. 'Civilians first,' they say, as the weight of that morning lingers in their hearts. 'The soldiers remember more than we do as commanders. In hindsight, we see things from a different perspective,' Lt. Braymok said. 'I don’t remember faces. While searching from house to house in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, I saw dead bodies on one of the beds. A mother and daughter shot in their beds, but I can’t recall their faces or details like their clothes or hair color—it’s gone. My focus was purely on the mission: kill terrorists, save as many civilians as possible and evacuate the wounded.' Braymok described how they reached the height of the fighting and set up defenses near Kibbutz Saad’s carrot packing house to prevent further incursions by terrorists. Equipment soaked in the blood of fallen comrades was repurposed for the battle. 'Since then, I’ve been going at full speed. I’ll finish my role and then get out,' he added. The psychological toll on his unit has been steep—many soldiers struggled to continue and left the unit due to mental health issues, leading to the disbandment of an entire platoon. Yet, new recruits brought fresh energy to Golani. Braymok’s unit went on to lead successful assaults in the narrow allies of Gaza’s Shijaiyah neighborhood, the Zeitoun hills and the high-rise towers of the upscale al-Rimal neighborhood. Reflecting on the aftermath of October 7, Braymok recalled an incident when he and his medic shouted at an unarmed civilian trying to join their fight in Kfar Aza. Hours later, they realized the man was Brig. Gen. (res.) Yisrael Shomer, commander of the 146th Division. 'We didn’t understand why he was calling for reinforcements on the Lebanese border until his wife asked him to evacuate the wounded to their home and put on his uniform. He returned to us in IDF uniform, with the rank of brigadier general,' Braymok said. After their deployment in Gaza ended, Braymok’s unit was sent straight to the northern front, defending the volatile Lebanese border. Now, as part of a long-delayed ground offensive, his soldiers are capturing key Hezbollah villages that they had observed for eight months, intended to be used as launch pads for the terrorist group’s elite Radwan Forces to carry out its plan to invade and conquer the Galilee. The non-stop airstrikes have weakened Hezbollah significantly, forcing thousands of Radwan terrorists north of the Litani River. Many of their tactical commanders have been killed in Operation Northern Arrows. But most importantly, the newest war objective now flows in their veins: Returning northern residents home safely. But for Braymok, the mission is personal. 'Every day, we wake up surrounded by abandoned toys in the kindergarten where we’ve been sleeping for months. The pictures of the kids stare back at us. This is their kindergarten, but they haven’t been here for a year,' he said. 'We’ve come to know the residents from a distance, and their emergency responders have become like second fathers to us. I’ve gotten to know entire families from the kibbutzim. We’ve grown used to seeing the empty kibbutz, but we’re determined to push the threat back and bring them home ourselves.' Close air support is key Drawing on experience gained in Gaza, Israeli support troops in Lebanon demonstrated sharp thinking and quick reactions when they spotted a glint from the window of a three-story building. Despite being hit by a missile the day before, suspicions arose that Hezbollah fighters were inside. Company commander Capt. Mizrahi warned his soldiers, positioned about 300 yards away, of a possible anti-tank squad in the orange-roofed building, which had not yet been cleared. Lt. Ron, a young platoon commander, directed an Apache helicopter to fire a Hellfire missile at the building, maintaining direct communication with the pilot. A drone, continuously surveying the area, streamed the strike live on screen. The soldiers, anticipating Hezbollah fighters may flee or reappear from nearby buildings disguised as firefighters or medics, remained alert. 'They often move like that,' explained Capt. Mizrahi. When the missile struck, the explosion echoed through the makeshift command post. Forces on the ground, aided by a drone and a sniffer dog, prepared to sweep the building. The scale of the operation is large, with an entire brigade assigned to each village, though Capt. Mizrahi noted, 'It's a powerful force, but not on the battalion scale seen in Maroun al-Ras during the Second Lebanon War. I studied that battle closely and passed it on to my soldiers, most of whom were just born at the time.' Time, however, is limited. Unlike in Gaza, the troops are working against the clock, with more villages to secure. Though the operation is smaller in scope, some believe Hezbollah has deliberately abandoned these villages, anticipating Israel’s focus on them in this ground campaign. Outside the command post, Corporal Yayo Tesfa, smiling despite the circumstances, stood out. His three younger brothers remain stranded in Gondar, Ethiopia, waiting for permission to immigrate to Israel. A fourth brother, Yehuda, was born just a week ago in Haifa, but Tesfa has yet to meet him. 'I’m a spotter and a sharpshooter, that’s my job,' said Tesfa, his optimism shining through. 'Honestly, Lebanon is tougher than Gaza, but we’re doing great. We’re Golani.'

Hamas leader-in-exile Khaled Meshaal said on Tuesday the Palestinian terrorist group would rise 'like a phoenix' from the ashes despite heavy losses during a year of war with Israel, and that it continues to recruit fighters and manufacture weapons. One year after the Hamas attack that triggered the war, Meshaal framed the war with Israel as part of a broader narrative spanning 76 years, dating back to what Palestinians call the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe,' when many were displaced during the 1948 war that accompanied the creation of Israel. 'Palestinian history is made of cycles,' Meshaal, 68, a senior Hamas figure under overall leader Yahya Sinwar, told Reuters in an interview. 'We go through phases where we lose martyrs (victims) and we lose part of our military capabilities, but then the Palestinian spirit rises again, like the phoenix, thanks to God.' Meshaal, who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997 after he was injected with poison and was overall Hamas leader from 1996-2017, said the Islamist terrorist group was still able to mount ambushes against Israeli troops. 'We lost part of our ammunition and weapons, but Hamas is still recruiting young men and continues to manufacture a significant portion of its ammunition and weapons,' said Meshaal, without providing details.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhohumkyx	2024-10-08T00:19:10-07:00

A foreign ministry source said that around 2,500 Turkish citizens had applied to be evacuated from Lebanon but that after checks it was determined that a ship capacity of 2,000 would be sufficient. The naval ships will set off on Tuesday from Turkey's eastern Mediterranean province of Mersin, the source said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1eciugkkl	2024-10-08T00:15:10-07:00	
IDF general promises swift return to evacuated north, local leade...	Amid intense airstrikes in Lebanon and rocket fire on central Israel, Northern Command chief Ori Gordin tells frontline leaders residents could start returning home in weeks; 'We aren't returning until there's full security,' Kiryat Shmona mayor insists Northern Command head Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin told local leaders Monday evening that residents of frontline communities near the Lebanese border could begin returning to their homes in phases within a month, sparking backlash from participants who called the timeline unrealistic. The meeting, which lasted about 90 minutes, was held amid escalating military operations. Earlier that day, the Israeli Air Force conducted a major strike on over 120 targets in southern Lebanon in just one hour. Additional airstrikes targeted Hezbollah positions in Beirut’s Dahieh district, with about 200 targets hit in total by day’s end. Explosions from southern Lebanon were visible from the northern Israeli city of Nahariya and echoed as far as the Greater Haifa region. A few hours after the meeting, long-range rockets were fired from Lebanon toward central Israel, marking the fourth such attack on central Israel since the start of the war, which began on October 7. The IDF also issued new restrictions on southern Lebanon, prohibiting vessel movement south of the Awali River and warning of potential naval operations against Hezbollah. Shlomi and other border communities in the Western Galilee were declared closed military zones. Local leaders expressed frustration after the meeting, particularly regarding Gordin’s comments on returning residents. 'He talked about short timelines, suggesting it could happen within weeks to a month, but only for communities not right along the border,' one participant said. 'It sounded overly optimistic.' Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern, who did not attend the meeting, dismissed the notion of an imminent return. 'No one is coming home until the threat is fully eliminated,' Stern said, urging the military to focus on winning the war and leaving decisions about the return of residents to political and municipal leaders. 'We are not returning until there is full security in Kiryat Shmona and a plan for the city's reconstruction is approved.' David Azulay, head of the Metula Council, attended the meeting and said that while the IDF presented significant military achievements, the timeline for residents' return seemed unrealistic. 'In my opinion, it is still far off, especially for my community,' he said. Municipal leaders also voiced concerns about confidentiality breaches. Moti Hatiel, head of the Rosh Pina Council, expressed disappointment that details from the meeting were leaked, calling it 'irresponsible' and damaging to trust between military and civilian officials. Meanwhile, the Fighting for the North movement, representing hundreds of displaced families, sharply criticized Gordin's focus on a return timeline. 'We will not accept anything less than a complete security overhaul, including reaching the Litani River and establishing a buffer zone,' the group said in a statement, warning against halting military operations prematurely. The IDF, in response, said it is working to ensure the safe return of northern residents according to directives from the political leadership. The military emphasized that while Gordin mentioned preparations for the possibility of residents returning, no specific timeline was promised.

Suheil Hussein Husseini played key role in coordinating arms transfers between Iran and Hezbollah, oversaw unit involved in production of precision-guided missiles The IDF confirmed Tuesday morning the targeted killing of Suhail Hussein Husseini, the head of Hezbollah’s logistics network, in an airstrike in Beirut the day before. The strike was carried out by Israeli fighter jets with precise intelligence guidance. According to the IDF, Israeli Air Force fighter jets carried out the operation using precise intelligence guidance provided by the military’s Intelligence Directorate. Husseini led Hezbollah’s logistics unit, which manages the group's budget and organizes its various operational systems, the IDF said. He played a key role in facilitating arms transfers between Iran and Hezbollah, overseeing the distribution of smuggled weapons to different units within the terrorist group, and managing transportation and resource allocation. Husseini was also a member of Hezbollah's Jihad Council, its senior military forum. The logistics unit under Husseini's command also included Hezbollah’s research and development division, which is involved in the production of precision-guided missiles and the storage and transportation of weapons within Lebanon. As part of his responsibilities, Husseini was in charge of funding and logistics for some of Hezbollah's most sensitive projects, including operational plans for war and other special programs, such as launching attacks against Israel from Lebanon and Syria. Husseini's assassination is the latest in a series of targeted killings in Beirut and Hezbollah’s stronghold in the southern suburbs, known as the Dahieh. These strikes have reportedly eliminated key figures, including the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah and his prospective successor, Hashem Safieddine, as well as the leadership of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force and several senior figures referred to within the group as 'great jihad commanders.'

Trump makes surprise visit to Lubavitcher Rebbe's grave in New Yo...	Under tight security, former US president makes unannounced visit to late spiritual leader's grave on October 7 massacre anniversary, placing prayer note and holding up photo of Israeli American hostage Idan Alexander Former U.S. President Donald Trump made a surprise visit Monday to the gravesite of the Lubavitcher Rebbe in New York City, in a gesture of solidarity with Israel and the U.S. Jewish community. The visit coincided with the commemoration of the October 7 attack's anniversary, which has deep significance for both communities. At the Ohel, the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s resting place in Queens, Trump was photographed wearing a black kippah and placing a handwritten note at the grave. The former president, who is seeking to return to the White House in November, was also seen alongside conservative commentator Ben Shapiro holding up a photo of hostage Idan Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen. Karoline Leavitt, the national press secretary for Trump’s campaign, said the former president would deliver a speech later at a memorial event for the victims of the October 7 attack in Florida. She claimed that the horrors of October 7 would never have happened if Trump were still in the White House, an assertion that has been a frequent talking point in the Republican's campaign rallies. Levitt added that Trump’s re-election is 'essential for both Americans and Israelis' to end the violence caused by a 'more powerful, energized and wealthier Iranian regime' that she attributed to the 'weak policies of the Biden-Harris administration.' Trump was accompanied during the visit by Holocaust survivors, relatives of hostages currently held in Gaza and students from various U.S. campuses. The former president had kept the visit private, allowing no media coverage, but reportedly chose October 7 for the visit to express solidarity with Israel and Jewish communities worldwide. Security at the site was tight, with Secret Service agents reportedly securing the area days in advance. The visit was organized by former U.S. ambassador to Israel David Friedman who has maintained a close relationship with Trump since leaving office. Trump's visit comes just over two weeks after Argentine President Javier Milei and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama also visited the Rebbe’s gravesite. Milei, known for his close ties to the Jewish community, credited his election victory to a prayer he made at the site shortly beforehand. Sara Netanyahu, wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also recently visited the grave, accompanied by the families of hostages. The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, is a revered figure whose gravesite has become a pilgrimage destination for both Jews and non-Jews alike. 'The Rebbe welcomed people from all walks of life, Jews and non-Jews, left and right, and his gravesite continues to draw people from around the world,' said Rabbi Mendy Kotlarsky, a senior official in Chabad’s global outreach network.

Katz threatens no cooperation on Lebanon if France pushes Palesti...	After Macron’s call for arms embargo to Israel, FM meets French counterpart, saying, ‘Friends don’t call for an embargo; they help in times of hardship; Katz stresses no cease-fire in Lebanon without enforcing UN resolutions Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned on Monday that if France takes unilateral actions regarding the Palestinian issue, Israel would be unable to cooperate with France on the Lebanese front. The warning, issued to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot during a solidarity visit to Israel marking the one-year anniversary of the October 7 massacre, came just days after French President Emmanuel Macron called for an arms embargo on weapons used by Israel in its war in Gaza, a move that Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, heavily criticized. 'Friends don’t call for an embargo; they help in times of hardship,' Katz told his French counterpart according to a statement issued by his office after the meeting. He added that if Israel withdrew from the West Bank, it would leave Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas vulnerable to a swift takeover by Hamas and Iran, just as occurred in Gaza in 2007. 'There will be no cease-fire that doesn’t serve Israeli and French interests,' Katz added. 'A cease-fire will only be possible when northern Israeli residents can safely return to their homes and only after Hezbollah withdraws north of the Litani River and disarms.' Katz also highlighted the need for effective enforcement of UN Security Council Resolutions 1701 and 1559 in Lebanon, warning that if such mechanisms aren't established, Israel would act independently to enforce them. He stressed that Israel's actions are solely focused on securing its citizens and are not intended to interfere in Lebanon’s internal affairs. Responding to a question from Barrot, Katz clarified that Israel does not intend to evacuate Beirut residents but will target Hezbollah’s terror hubs within the city. He also called on France to leverage Hezbollah’s recent setbacks and push for the election of a new president in Lebanon, seeing an opportunity to shift the balance of power in the country. On the Iranian front, Katz vowed that Israel would respond forcefully to last week's Iranian ballistic missile attack, noting that Hezbollah, Iran's primary proxy in the region, has suffered significant blows. He urged the international community to seize the moment to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions and support for terrorism. Katz’s comments follow Macron’s call for a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, a move that Prime Minister Netanyahu also criticized during a phone call with the French leader on Sunday. Netanyahu's office reiterated that Israel 'expects its friends to stand behind it and not impose restrictions that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil.' Government officials were not surprised by Macron's words, which are a direct continuation of the French line, which already supported the non-binding resolution initiated by the Palestinians at the UN General Assembly on September 18, which called for the imposition of an arms embargo on Israel. However, French defense exports to Israel have been minimal in comparison to its global defense sales, amounting to just 20 million euros annually over the past decade.

One year later, 'Lady in Red' from Nova massacre still grappling ...	Vlada Patapov, dubbed 'Lady in Red' by the Daily Mail, fled the party just before Hamas terrorists arrived; she reflects on surviving with deep regret and trauma, wishing she could have warned others and feeling the weight of those less fortunate A year after the October 7 Hamas attack, the image of Vlada Patapov, draped in a red shawl as she fled the Nova music festival, has become iconic. Captured in a parking lot near Kibbutz Re'im, her escape from the terror was broadcast globally. For weeks, her fate was unknown until she shared her story with Ynet and the Daily Mail, which named her 'Lady in Red.' Reflecting on the anniversary of the attack, the Ashdod-based wedding planner expressed deep regret. 'If I had one wish, it would be to have told everyone at the festival one hour before Hamas attacked that something was going to happen then everyone could have got away,' she told the Mail. Diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, Patapov, like many survivors, continues to grapple with survivor's guilt and trauma. 'I've been having therapy and counseling like many of the others who were there and I find speaking to people helps me cope with what happened that day. But then sometimes I think who can help me when all this is still going on around us and the fear is still here and it's still real,' she said. The anniversary of the massacre and the ongoing conflict have only compounded her trauma. She says that during the massacre, her sole focus was surviving for her three-year-old daughter, Romi. 'When I think back to that day a year ago it all seems so fresh and the only thing that I could think of at the time was staying alive for my daughter Romi and I give thanks for that every day. She will be four soon and for a quarter of her life, she has known only war. It is terrible for us but many countries don't seem to accept or understand what we are going through,' she told the Daily Mail. Patapov decided to attend the festival in southern Israel at the last minute with her partner, Matan, and a friend named Mai. At one point, she found herself alone, witnessing Hamas terrorists murdering her friends. It took nearly 24 hours before she could finally reunite with Romi at home. Patapov spoke of maintaining courage and strength, not only for those inside Israel, but for captives in Gaza as well. 'We can't let the terrorists win. We can't be weak - we must remain strong for Israel and for the hostages who are still in Gaza, but at the same time it's so scary here at the moment for us, we have rockets from Gaza, rockets from Lebanon and now rockets from Iran, it seems as if it will never stop.' On a more somber note, she says, 'The situation is terrifying for us now. it's so scary here at the moment for us, we have rockets from Gaza, rockets from Lebanon and now rockets from Iran, it seems as if it will never stop. These people who attack Israel should imagine what it's like for us here having rockets and sirens and living in fear of a terrorist attack, I could walk out my front door to go to the shops and someone could attack me.' 'I thought it would take a few weeks' In the surprise attack at the Nova music festival, 393 people were killed. Seventeen more were murdered at smaller parties held simultaneously in the south. Among the 101 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, 22 attended the Nova party. 'What I feel most deeply is for the hostages and their families. Who would have thought we'd still be in this situation a year later? I thought it would be a few weeks, maybe a couple of months but it's been a year now and it looks with the Lebanon situation as if things will only get worse,' Patapov reflects. Regarding connections with other festival-goers, Patapov shared, 'There are events going on to remember what happened at the festival but I won't be going because for me the most important thing is to be with Romi and Matan. When Romi hears the sirens she is so scared, she starts crying and with the anniversary I just don't feel like letting her go to nursery so I will keep her at home, only because you just don't know if they will try something again.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1cnsw11yje	2024-10-07T14:07:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/12/07/BkM11Wqy8a/BkM11Wqy8a_0_53_634_357_0_small.jpg
Lebanon rocket barrage jolts central Israel as sirens wail	IDF says 5 rockets launched from Lebanon, with some intercepted by air defenses and others landing in unpopulated areas; no immediate reports of injuries Rocket sirens sounded Monday in several central Israeli cities, including Herzliya, Ramat Hasharon, Tel Aviv (Yarkon), Glilot, Petah Tikva, Hod Hasharon, Kfar Saba, Kfar Qassem, Rosh HaAyin and Ra'anana, with explosions heard across the Sharon region. The IDF confirmed that five rockets were launched from Lebanon, with some intercepted by air defenses and others landing in unpopulated areas. The army added that there were no changes to Home Front Command guidelines. The Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service said there were no immediate reports of injuries. Emergency teams were dispatched to inspect areas where rocket debris was reported and responded to several individuals injured while heading to shelters, as well as those suffering from shock.

Sinwar resurfaces after weeks of silence, report says	Hamas leader reportedly made contact with Qatar in recent days after a prolonged period of silence, confirming that he is alive After weeks of uncertainty regarding his fate, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has resurfaced, making contact with Qatar in recent days after a prolonged period of silence, confirming that he is alive, Saudi network Al Arabiya reported Monday. Since last month, Israeli intelligence had been investigating whether Sinwar had been injured or killed in one of the IDF's strikes in Gaza, after he was once again going incommunicado. Last week, in a high-level meeting attended by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, a question mark was placed over Sinwar's photo, reflecting uncertainty about his status. The New York Times reported over the weekend that U.S. officials believe that Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre, is still alive and making 'critical decisions,' even a year after the attack. Washington officials assess that Sinwar is determined to draw Israel into a regional war, especially after the IDF had entered southern Lebanon for the first time since 2006, and has no intention of negotiating a hostage deal. The report also suggests that Sinwar is likely encouraged by the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, amid expectations that Israel will soon respond to last week's barrage of ballistic missiles. However, the report notes that Sinwar is frustrated by the lack of sufficient support from Hezbollah and Iran. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjlpy3zjyg	2024-10-07T13:35:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/05/25/HkNtiz9t00/HkNtiz9t00_0_0_3000_1985_0_small.jpg

On October 7 anniversary, Netanyahu pushes to rename war	After a moment of silence in a special Cabinet session, PM proposes renaming 'Swords of Iron to 'War of Revival'; ministers viewed graphic video of October 7 atrocities, sparking criticism over its lack of global circulation The Israeli government held a special memorial session Monday to mark one year since the October 7 massacre during which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed renaming the subsequent conflict from 'Swords of Iron' to 'War of Revival.' After Netanyahu's suggestion, ministers Gideon Sa'ar and Amichai Chikli argued the name was too similar to 'War of Independence' and demanded an alternative. Other ministers noted that Netanyahu wasn't fully committed to the name 'War of Resurrection.' During the session, ministers watched a video of the atrocities produced by the IDF Spokesperson for the first time. Some questioned why this video wasn't being shared internationally and were told the Justice Ministry hadn't approved its release due to legal constraints. Ministers expressed frustration, saying this hindered public relations efforts. Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who typically doesn't attend government meetings, stated she was unaware of this directive and left the meeting to investigate. At the end of the special session, ministers were called for a consultation with Netanyahu. The name 'Iron Swords' was initially given to the war at its start, and by December, Prime Minister Netanyahu sought a different name to underscore the war's significance. In December, IDF representatives suggested the name 'The October 7 War' in closed discussions, asking the political echelon to advance the proposal. The government considered other options, including 'The Simchat Torah War,' with Netanyahu expressing support for 'The Genesis War.' IDF Spokesperson stated: 'Following the government meeting, the 'video of horrors' has been regularly screened worldwide for public officials, ambassadors, media personnel, decision-makers, and influencers. An IDF Spokesperson representative screened the video at today's government meeting under the instruction of the political echelon. Comments were taken out of context, and there is no legal directive prohibiting the publication of the video, which is indeed shown worldwide.' The Attorney General's office stated: 'During the government meeting, a false claim was made that the legal advisory to the government supposedly prevented the worldwide publication of the October 7 atrocities documentation. The claim is false.' At the start of the government meeting, Netanyahu lit a memorial candle in remembrance of those murdered and fallen on October 7, and the government members stood for a moment of silence. The deputy cabinet secretary then read a chapter of Psalms, and the cabinet secretary recited the 'Mi Sheberach' prayer for IDF soldiers and hostages. Netanyahu recalled his statements shortly after the surprise attack by Hamas terrorists, including: 'We are at war. Not an operation, not rounds—a war. We will retaliate with a force the enemy has never known and exact a price they cannot comprehend. We are at war, and we will win.' The Prime Minister further stated: 'Since that dark day, we have been fighting. This is our existential war—'The War of Resurrection.' This is what I wish to officially name the war. Since that dark day, we have been on the offensive on seven fronts. Our counterattack on our enemies that are part of Iran's axis of evil, is essential for securing our future and ensuring our security. 'We will end the war when we achieve all our set goals: dismantling Hamas's regime of evil, bringing all our captives home—both dead and alive, neutralizing any future threat from Gaza to Israel, and safely returning our residents in the south and north to their homes. On this day, we bow our heads in memory of our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters, our parents and elders, who were slaughtered by Hamas terrorists. Children murdered in cold blood, women and men slaughtered, entire families obliterated.' 'Determined to finish the task' In his continued remarks, Netanyahu acknowledged the bereaved families 'whose lives were changed in an instant' and the families of the hostages 'who endure endless agony and worry over the fate of their loved ones.' He added: 'We remember our heroes who fell in battle in Gaza, Lebanon, and other arenas. Thanks to them, we repelled the enemy, destroyed most of its capabilities, freed many of our captives, and we are determined to finish the task.' The hostage families' headquarters responded to the Prime Minister's request to rename the war 'The War of Resurrection': 'We wish to remind the Prime Minister that there is and will be no resurrection without the return of all the hostages—the living for rehabilitation and the dead for proper burial in their homeland.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byimgkbykg	2024-10-07T12:55:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/07/SJ57ASbkJg/SJ57ASbkJg_0_86_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Unannounced airdrops near Lebanese border spark panic in northern...	On October 7 anniversary, Upper Galilee residents panic after seeing parachutes, fearing Hezbollah infiltration; IDF clarifies they were supply drops; police criticize unannounced drill, saying it heightened tensions and disrupted safety Several northern Israeli communities issued shelter-in-place advisories Monday evening after residents spotted two parachutes in the skies over the Lebanese border, evoking memories of the October 7 massacre, when Hamas terrorists famously paraglided into Israeli territory during the attack. Locals' fears were compounded by Saudi media reports of Hezbollah operatives allegedly attempting to infiltrate Israel from Lebanon amid heightened tensions on the one-year anniversary of the massacre. The IDF clairified shortly later that the parachutes were part of a resupply mission for the 91st Division, the third division deployed into southern Lebanon, and there was no security threat. Local police and municipal leaders expressed anger over what they called an 'unnecessary incident' on such a tense day, especially since they had not received prior notice. After receiving reports of parachute sightings, Northern District police mobilized all available forces toward the Ramim Ridge on the border. 'Everything we trained for over the past year, we carried out as if this were a real event we were prepared for,' a Northern District officer said. 'Officers were immediately deployed to their posts, special forces units were dispatched to potential landing sites, and senior commanders rushed to the scene. It was one of the most stressful situations we've faced, implementing everything we had prepared for. It’s unfortunate this happened without coordination at such a sensitive time, but it was certainly the strongest drill possible.' Residents in Upper Galilee communities described how some armed themselves in response to the sighting. 'People were locking and loading, stepping outside to protect their families while their children played in the park,' said David, who lives in a moshav near the Lebanon border. 'How could they not pick a different day for this without informing anyone? Tens of thousands of us here on the border were thrown into panic. I hope they learn from this—it’s no joke.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byff55zjkg	2024-10-07T12:27:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/07/HyO36Ob1Jg/HyO36Ob1Jg_0_235_480_271_0_small.jpg

Lawmakers push for specialized genocide court to prosecute Octobe...	Knesset members Simcha Rothman and Yulia Malinovsky to table bill to prosecute planners and perpetrators of October 7 massacre; previous attempts stalled due to concerns over hostage negotiations and challenges in identifying individual culprits Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee Chairman MK Simcha Rothman (the Religious Zionist Party) and MK Yulia Malinovsky (Yisrael Beytenu) are set to introduce a bill after the High Holidays to enable the prosecution of those responsible for the October 7, 2023 massacre in the Gaza border communities, Ynet learned on Monday. Despite efforts over the past year to push the government toward legal action via Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, progress has been stalled. The Security Cabinet has reportedly delayed prosecutions, citing concerns that legal action could hinder ongoing negotiations for the return of hostages held by Hamas and impact their treatment. Additionally, the Cabinet is evaluating the possibility that some captured terrorists may be released in a future prisoner exchange, complicating the legal process. There are also legal challenges in securing enough evidence to tie specific perpetrators to individual crimes in the level of detail required by criminal courts. Rothman and Malinovsky, from both sides of the political aisle, have been working through the Constitution Committee to address these issues since the massacre, with Rothman forming a secretive subcommittee last December to explore legal pathways. This subcommittee, which included Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Attorney General Baharav-Miara, debated the establishment of a specialized tribunal versus utilizing the district court system. Under the proposed law, a 'specialized court for genocide' would be created to focus specifically on the events of October 7, which will be classified as 'genocide acts initiated by Hamas.' The court will have the authority to prosecute those involved in the planning, incitement, or execution of the massacre. The bill would also establish an administrative tribunal to determine terrorist participation in the massacre based on administrative evidence, allowing for the designation of perpetrators as unlawful combatants. A prosecution committee, including representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Defense, and Foreign Affairs, would oversee who among the group will face genocide charges under the Genocide Convention. 'The government had a whole year to prepare for prosecuting those involved, but failed to make it a priority,' MK Malinovsky said, stressing the moral duty to the victims and their families. Rothman added that the new court would provide the legal framework needed to deliver justice for the unprecedented October 7 massacre. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkzy9yz1yl	2024-10-07T11:53:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/03/H10EohEh0/H10EohEh0_0_50_1417_798_0_small.jpg

One year after the October 7 massacre: The remarkable rehabilitat...	Facing immeasurable hardships and obstacles following their injuries in Hamas' attack, three heroes overcame the trauma and pain to rebuild their lives On October 7, 2023, Israel woke up to a morning of pain and terror – a Saturday morning that turned into a massive assault and terrorist invasion, marking one of the darkest events in the country's history. As we mark a year since that devastating day, this story centers around three soldiers – Yael Gottlieb, Reuven Ben Frech and Maya Desiatnik – who were wounded both physically and emotionally and have since embarked on a remarkable journey of healing and recovery. The Invasion of October 7 – a moment of reckoning That Saturday morning, Hamas launched a coordinated invasion from different directions – by sea, air and land. Soldiers, fighters, and civilians found themselves battling terrorists who exploited vulnerabilities in Israel's defense. The attack was meticulously planned, but it encountered warriors who fought with everything they had, even when the situation seemed impossible. Yael's journey – courage amid the chaos It was 6:30 a.m. on October 7 when Yael Gottlieb began what she thought would be a routine Saturday shift at the Ashkelon police station, her final shift in the army. She never imagined that this day would mark the beginning of one of the most challenging battles of her life. The sirens began to wail, and rockets rained down, signaling a terrifying and unprecedented attack. In minutes, reports of missile impacts poured in, and Yael, along with her partner, immediately geared up with helmets and vests, rushing to the scene of the first impact. Arriving at the site, they witnessed a house completely destroyed, with terrified civilians scattered outside. But before they could take it all in, the situation escalated. The radio crackled with an urgent announcement: 'Pelesh Pleshet,' a code signaling an enemy infiltration by air, land, or sea. That morning, the enemy infiltrated on all fronts. Yael and her partner quickly left the scene and drove towards Zikim, where they armed themselves with rifles, gathering as much ammunition as they could find. They took cover behind a sign, anxiously awaiting what they feared would be an encounter with the enemy. Minutes later, they heard cries for help over the radio – terrorists had entered Sderot, and shots were being fired at the local police station. The terror in the voices over the radio was palpable, echoing the bursts of gunfire in the background. Yael and her partner jumped into their patrol car and sped toward Sderot, only to be greeted by chaos – abandoned cars lined the sides of the roads, and panicked people scrambled to reach shelters. As they approached the station, Yael instructed her partner to circle around to the back, hoping to surprise the terrorists from behind. But suddenly, without warning, a barrage of bullets erupted. Yael was hit in the face, her vision going black as pain overwhelmed her senses. Barely able to see, she felt the car slow to a halt about 100 meters away. Her partner exited the car to check if they were still being pursued. Meanwhile, Yael, struggling with her injuries, realized that her hand had also been shot, rendering her unable to lift her weapon. She managed to crawl out of the patrol car and stumbled toward a nearby shelter. Despite the intense pain and disorientation, she refused to surrender. She checked the shelter, scanning it with the weapon she could barely hold, to ensure no terrorists were hiding inside. For a few agonizing minutes, she was alone until a city inspector found her. The inspector called for an ambulance, but they were told that none could reach her location. The inspector tied her shirt around Yael's arm to stem the bleeding, and soon after, a paramedic arrived to treat her injuries. After an hour and a half of waiting, police officers finally arrived and transported Yael to the hospital. As she looked out the window of the patrol car, Yael saw the devastation – burned-out vehicles, lifeless bodies strewn across the streets of Sderot, and plumes of smoke rising from the chaos. The sights were haunting. While hospitalized, Yael first encountered Belev Echad. They stood by her side, and even after her discharge, they invited her to their home. During her visit, she received a tour and learned about the treatments and care they provide. Today, Yael attends therapy at Belev Echad three times a week. She feels like she’s part of a family, a place where she’s understood and supported by those who know her pain. Yael summed it up best, saying, 'This place gave me new life, moments of joy within all the pain and darkness. Every time I come to Belev Echad, I feel at home. They didn’t just provide me with physical treatments – they gave me hope, an anchor to hold onto. I’m not alone on my journey, and I feel that I have a real support system holding me up.' Reuven's story – courage on the scorching road On that fateful morning, Reuven Ben Frech received an emergency call from his unit in Netivot. Rockets were already raining down on Israel, and he hurried from his parents’ home in Ashkelon, grabbing his pistol and rushing to meet his unit. As he drove along the familiar roads, he began to hear scattered reports of infiltrating terrorists, but he had no idea of the sheer scale of the attack. Entering the town of Sderot, Reuven saw civilians lying lifeless on the streets. He loaded his pistol and continued driving cautiously. When he reached the Sha'ar HaNegev junction, he suddenly encountered over ten terrorists on the road. With no way to escape, he stopped his car and opened fire. He managed to shoot one, but the others quickly retaliated, firing at him from all directions. In the chaos, Reuven was struck six times – once in the leg, twice in the arm, and three times in the back. Despite his severe injuries, he managed to press down on the accelerator, driving away while terrorists continued to shoot at him from just 10 meters away. With all his strength, he reached the Yakhini settlement, where he encountered Border Police officers. Recognizing that he could no longer fight, he handed his pistol to one of the female officers and collapsed. However, the terrorists had not given up. They had pursued him to the settlement, and as Reuven tried to exit his car, he knew he needed to escape again. Forcing himself back behind the wheel, he managed to drive a few more kilometers to the Yeshiba settlement near Netivot, where he finally came to a stop, losing consciousness from blood loss. At Soroka Medical Center, Reuven fought for his life. It was there that Belev Echad entered his journey, providing a lifeline during his darkest hours. They became his second family, offering him a safe place to heal, both physically and emotionally. Reuven describes what the organization gave him: 'I never thought I’d find myself smiling again after everything I went through. Belev Echad became my family when I felt everything was broken. They restored my faith in myself, made me believe there was someone who cared, who understood what I was going through. Thanks to them, I managed to keep going, to find the strength to rise again.' The journey of Maya Desiatnik: from the Nahal Oz base to Belev Echad 'My name is Maya Desiatnik, and I am a former lookout soldier from the Nachal Oz base, located near the Israel-Gaza border. I will never forget that fateful day in October when terrorists broke into our base – the day that changed my life forever. I was on duty in the command center when the infiltration was announced. Through the cameras, I witnessed the horrors, seeing how the terrorists crossed the border effortlessly, advancing into our base and taking control. I was with my fellow lookout soldiers in the command center while the battle raged outside, and the terrorists tried to break in. After hours of fighting, they set fire to the command center, and in that blaze, I lost close friends. Out of all the lookout soldiers who were with me in that room, I was the only one who survived. All that remains are the memories and pain, which have become invisible wounds. In the period that followed, I suffered from smoke inhalation and was hospitalized in critical condition. But beyond the physical injuries, I had to face the mental trauma of that horrible day. I suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, uncontrollable fears, and nightmares that took over my nights. For a long time, I couldn’t be alone, I was afraid to leave the house, and every simple action required immense effort. Then, the light entered my life – the Belev Echad organization. At the end of October, while I was deep in pain and loneliness, I found this organization thanks to a fellow survivor from that day at the base. From the moment I arrived, I realized I wasn’t alone. Belev Echad became a home for me. They offered alternative treatments, emotional support, and, most importantly, a sense of belonging and acceptance just as I am. I started participating in MMA training through the organization, which restored the sense of security I had lost. Suddenly, I felt strong again, capable of facing challenges, and not helpless. At the same time, I had the chance to meet others who were also dealing with PTSD, just like me. Together, we became a strong, supportive, and caring community, always there for one another. Belev Echad didn’t just provide me with therapy and tools to cope with the pain; they also helped me regain my belief that I could live a full and meaningful life. Thanks to the organization, I am continuing my journey – a journey of healing, returning to life, and finding hope. I share my story because I know there are others silently battling their inner wounds. I want them to know that there is a way, that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and that you can find the strength to keep moving forward. Today, thanks to Belev Echad, I know I am not alone – and I want you to know that you aren’t alone either.' The embrace of compassion – healing and rebuilding for our heroes The stories of Yael, Reuven, and Maya converge into a narrative of pain, courage, and hope. Thanks to the support network around them, these three heroes found the guidance, encouragement, and family they so desperately needed. They learned to fight together, to accept help, and to understand they are not alone on their road to recovery. Rabbi Uriel Vigler, one of the founders of Belev Echad, shares: 'We established this with the understanding that one cannot face pain alone. Soldiers wounded in battle need not just medical treatments but also a comforting hand, a hug, and a shoulder to lean on. For us, these soldiers are not just warriors – they are brothers and sisters who need help to keep moving forward.' Shavy Vigler, the co-founder, adds: 'Every soldier who enters our community is a symbol of courage, strength, and determination. Our mission is to remind them they are not alone, that we’re here to hold their hand, to give them the strength to continue and move forward. We believe that a big heart beats inside each of them, and we’re here to help them discover their inner strength.' Together, as one heart – this story is the story of all of us.

Yemen ballistic missile triggers sirens across central Israel	IDF says projectile successfully intercepted by air defenses; over 135 rockets fired from Lebanon on Monday as north takes heavy fire A ballistic missile fired from Yemen triggered sirens across central Israel, the IDF said Monday afternoon, adding that the projectile had been successfully intercepted by air defenses. As a result, flights from including Ben Gurion Airport were grounded. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Earlier, sirens were triggered in Kiryat Shmona, Manara, Margaliot and Kfar Blum, with approximately 25 rockets launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Additional sirens were heard in the Haifa Bay area, Acre and Nahariya, with multiple interceptions documented over the Haifa Bay skies. Since the morning, a total of 135 rocket launches from Lebanon have been recorded in the region. Meanwhile, the IDF launched a targeted strike in Beirut's Dahieh district, a Hezbollah stronghold, hitting the area where Hashem Safieddine, the designated successor to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, was targeted. Meanwhile, Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar reported that three residents of the village of Khiam in southern Lebanon were killed in an Israeli drone strike near the Jdeide-Marjayoun road. The victims were reportedly inside their vehicle at the time of the strike.

IDF names elite commando killed in intense Lebanon combat	Warrant Officer (res.) Aviv Magen, 43, of 5515th Mobility Unit, from Herut, killed by Hezbollah mortar shell that also claimed the life of Master Sergeant Etay Azulay; IDF's war death toll reaches 729 The IDF reported Monday that Warrant Officer (res.)

ZAKA volunteer: 'You can’t handle so many bodies and remain the s...	Eli Turjeman worked tirelessly after the October 7 massacre, helping identify around 1,200 bodies; despite a decade of experience with disaster scenes, he was deeply affected by the scale and brutality, especially the state of the bodies Around 200 volunteers of the ZAKA emergency organization worked at the Shura IDF camp in Ramla, where approximately 1,200 bodies were transferred in the days following October 7 for identification. Eli Turjeman, 39, a father of five, was among them. He arrived at Shura on the night of October 7 and later continued working at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. A decade-long ZAKA volunteer, Turjeman had witnessed horrific scenes before, including the 2021 Lag BaOmer stampede on Mount Meron which claimed 45 lives, but October 7 was different. 'Sadly, I've been at numerous events, including the Meron disaster, where I handled all 45 bodies. I've seen my share of death. I’ve been part of teams that handled every imaginable kind of natural and unnatural death—crime scenes, car accidents, terror attacks. I’ve dealt with dozens if not hundreds of children. But nothing compares to what I saw after the massacre. 'We’d never seen anything like it, neither in scale nor brutality. What struck me most was the degradation—the state of the bodies. Bound, burned, dismembered, children. We were the first to open the body bags and witness the devastation. Seeing such mass cruelty broke us. 'I was at the camp extensively during the first week, then went south for two days to collect bodies, and later worked at the Center of Forensic Medicine, where the hardest cases, bodies that couldn’t be identified, were sent. It’s indescribable. I would occasionally return to Shura to help. I’d finish at the center around 9 p.m., drive to Shura, stay until 2 or 3 a.m., and return to the center by 7 a.m. 'The real gut punch was that first morning when we left the camp and saw the families—crowds of hysterical, screaming families. It was difficult, but it pushed us to keep going, to give them answers and allow them to bury their loved ones. We knew the number of hostages wouldn’t be clear until our work was done, so we worked quickly, pulling double and triple shifts. 'There was a rabbinical ruling allowing us to continue working on weekends and violate Shabbat, which, as a Haredi Jew, was very hard for me. We worked around the clock, coming home at night, boiling bloodstained clothes, sleeping for a few hours, and going back. The smell was unbearable, and I’ll never forget it. 'There are soldiers on the battlefield, doctors in hospitals, and then there’s us. Everyone does their part. Not everyone can handle this.' 'You can’t handle so many bodies and remain the same person. People hear names, but we see faces. It stays with us; it never ends. We’re still there, reliving it over and over. I still see the faces and smell the stench. I always tell my fellow ZAKA volunteers—anyone who says they’re unaffected is lying. You can’t face such brutality and not be affected. And it's especially hard because we’re still at war. Every mention of hostages or another fallen soldier brings us back to October 7. 'I continue volunteering at the Forensic Center. How do I find the strength? This is my country. It's what I can give. When someone else is ready to take my place, I’ll gladly step aside. But until then, we’ll keep doing this. There are soldiers on the battlefield, doctors in hospitals, and then there’s us. Everyone does their part.

Remembering the October 7 massacre on social media	In today’s digital world, many of us find that the best way to express ourselves, mourn and remember what we’ve been through is through videos and posts; As we mark one year since the worst massacre in Israel’s history, there are those reminding the world that we Israelis are still living that day, there are still hostages who need to come home, and our grief is far from over Exactly one year ago, Israel experienced one of the most horrific and shocking days in its history. In the early morning hours of October 7, the terror organization Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli communities near the Gaza border, carrying out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. To this day, 101 hostages remain in captivity. Since the attack, Israel has faced a significant challenge in the battle of public opinion on social media, a challenge that grew as the fighting continued and images from Gaza flooded the internet. The country has put considerable effort into sharing accurate information and exposing the atrocities of terrorism to the international community. Prominent citizens and public figures from Israel and around the world have joined these efforts. On Monday, as the nation marks one year since the tragic events, social media has been flooded with posts commemorating that most awful day. These posts highlight the stories of the fallen, the murdered, and the hostages, alongside harrowing testimonies from survivors and shocking footage from the attack sites – all aimed at reminding the global community of the horrors that unfolded.

'As a precautionary measure following escalation in the region, family members of British Embassy staff have been temporarily withdrawn,' the Foreign Office travel advice web page for Israel read. 'Our staff members remain.' Britain advises citizens against all travel to the area close to the border with Gaza and 'all but essential travel' to other parts of Israel and the West Bank due to the yearlong conflict between Israel and Hamas. But British citizens living in Israel are not being told to leave. Instead, they are being advised that consular assistance is 'severely limited.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byovwuzj1e	2024-10-07T05:18:26-07:00

Israel should bomb Iran's oil facilities,' Opposition Leader Yai...	Lapid issued rare warning two weeks before October 7 massacre, but when the war broke out, he set conditions for joining the emergency government; A year later, he explains what really happened in his talks with Netanyahu, what it's like being in the opposition during wartime, and how Israel should respond to Iran’s missile attack A year after the October 7 massacre, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid gave an interview on Monday in Ynet’s special broadcast. He discussed what Israel should do after Iran's brutal attack, why he didn’t immediately join the government when the war began, and why he issued an unusual warning on the eve of Yom Kippur in 2023. Nearly a week after Tehran’s ballistic missile strike, Lapid said Israel must target Iran’s oil fields. 'That’s Iran’s Achilles’ heel. There’s a complex discussion with the Americans about this, and I understand why they don’t want a spike in oil prices just before the U.S. elections. But that doesn’t change the fact that Israel has its own interests and perspectives,' he said. Why the oil fields? Why not the nuclear facilities? 'I believe we need to build a broader coalition to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. This should be done in coordination with the Americans. But right now, Israel must respond to two attacks, not just one. We didn’t respond strongly enough to the first attack. Iran’s Achilles’ heel is its economy. It’s a country on the brink of economic collapse, and you always strike where your enemy is weakest.' About two weeks before Hamas' surprise attack on October 7 of last year, Lapid delivered what is now called his 'warning speech,' cautioning Israelis about a 'violent, multi-front conflict.' Today, he explained that his message was based on intelligence and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was actually the one who 'pushed' for the warning to be shared with the public. 'I was in an opposition security briefing with the prime minister, and the information I heard was terrifying. When you have the kind of intel a prime minister sees, you know where to look. I then went to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee three or four times to review the intelligence material. Everything was there – all the warnings.' Despite the intelligence being available to Netanyahu as well, Lapid said, 'he didn’t seem alarmed by it at all. The system was complacent. They heard the warnings and chose to ignore them. The entire system was so caught up in the idea that nothing would come from Gaza, and that Hamas should be strengthened.' Lapid argued that Hamas’ surprise attack happened because the terror group saw an opportunity. 'The government was focused on other things. The intelligence and military failures are beyond belief, and everyone involved should step down. But above all, Hamas felt there would never be a weaker government, one that was so unconcerned with security,' he said. Regarding the claim that protests against the judicial overhaul, including calls for reservists to refuse duty, contributed to the attack, Lapid dismissed it as 'dangerous nonsense.' He added: 'In a functioning state, the government is responsible for its citizens’ security – that’s the contract. Citizens have the right to protest in a democracy. I’ve always opposed refusal to serve, but from day one – since October 8 –they’ve tried to shift the blame from themselves.' The call for unity and staying out of the cabinet On October 7, Lapid called on Netanyahu to form an emergency government but without ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. As a result, he chose not to join the government alongside Benny Gantz. 'I was proven right,' Lapid said today. 'Gantz and Eisenkot’s decision to join was a mistake in my eyes, and after a few months they had to leave because no one listened to them. If you leave Netanyahu with the majority, it’s not a unity government. It’s just another Netanyahu government, where the rest are extras and he doesn’t have to listen to anyone.' He says that Ben-Gvir and Smotrich are undermining the war effort. 'They weaken Israel. They’re uncontrollable and drag us to the most extreme places. A big part of the reason why Israel, after suffering the worst blow in its history, is being attacked globally is because of their actions, their statements and the destruction they’re causing.' Lapid emphasized that Israel should pause the war to secure the release of all hostages. 'We need to kill Sinwar. He’s a dead man walking, and we will get him. But if we need to pause the war, even temporarily, to bring the hostages home, we should do it. That’s something Netanyahu wasn’t willing to consider,' he concluded.

‘We stormed the house and neutralized 3 terrorists, but the resid...	Capt. A. was called on October 7 from leave to Kibbutz Be'eri, where he saw smoke and heard gunfire; inside, he found civilian casualties, including women and children; amid the chaos, between battling terrorists, he met a girl he couldn't forget Kibbutz Be’eri is one of the symbols of the October 7 massacre and of the military’s failure to protect its citizens. A dark cloud of questions regarding how the fighting was conducted amidst all the chaos, still hovers over the events of that morning. One hundred and one community members were murdered and 31 were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip. In the battles within the kibbutz, 19 IDF soldiers were killed, along with eight Israeli police officers. This is the story of Capt. A., 444 Mobility Unit commander: 'On the morning of October 7, we were at the end of a week-long leave following a very intensive period in the army. I was woken by a phone call from my unit commander telling me there was a complex incident in the south, and that I needed to call up my company and get myself to the unit’s assembly point at Ze’elim. It was very early, and we didn’t yet understand what was going on.' 'I was on my way to the unit by 6:45, picking up soldiers along the way. We weren’t armed as our guns are stored when we’re on leave. So, we set out with kitchen knives. Our unit is in the Gaza border sector where mortars were falling, damaging our equipment and readiness for battle. In an effort to take control of the fire, I gathered a few soldiers, took two Sandcat Tigris armored vehicles, and set off. 'We used our instincts to get to Be’eri. We saw smoke from the kibbutz itself and heard a lot of automatic gunfire. In the afternoon, we were met with heavy fire when we tried getting in through the gate. So, we decided to go around the kibbutz and approach it from the south. But when we got there, our force encountered precision sniper fire. We spread ourselves out and returned fire. Two of our soldiers were wounded. We went in through the main gate anyway, as we knew that was the only point that somehow, the terrorists weren’t optimally prepared.' 'We advanced adjacent to the kibbutz’s surrounding northern fence and saw a vehicle go up in flames with a few bodies inside. I now know that was the security personnel who’d shown up at the kibbutz to provide a response. We then reached a junction and, for the first time, clearly saw the bodies of civilians. Bodies of women and children were lying there. We then started getting fired at from one of the houses on our right. We stormed the house where there were three terrorists whom we managed to neutralize. Sadly, the residents of that house were no longer alive.' 'The fighting that whole night was very intensive. At some stage, two Shaldag soldiers and I went to a relatively new neighborhood on the kibbutz, to a building on fire on its right-hand side. We started searching for survivors. We took cover behind a burnt-out vehicle and noticed a terrorist running toward us. We neutralized him and started walking in a kind of corridor between the wall and the house. We saw that they’d broken into the house through the saferoom window using gunfire and a powerful explosive device placed there. We broke down the window and the front door and got into the safe room where we found a woman’s body, with her family and a boy, who sadly had also been killed. Beside them was the wounded father writhing in pain, along with a girl who was also wounded.' 'We began providing medical response. We checked to see if the mother and boy could be saved, but their breathing and injuries were extremely severe. We put tourniquets on the girl and the two soldiers with me checked the father’s bleeding. He’d been hit twice by gunfire on the back. We took a chair. I’ll never forget that chair. It a was turquoise chair from the balcony. We lifted the girl and took her to the vehicle. She was a young girl with an enormous spirit. Her family had died before her eyes, her father was screaming in pain, and she was sitting there in silence, holding onto my hand. I told her, ‘Everything’s okay, everything’s okay. We’re getting you out now.’ She answered, ‘I know everything’s okay. Just take care of my father’. What a brave girl.' 'We put her in the vehicle and ran with the stretcher to bring out the father. Let’s just say, we had to stop for a while after that. There was a moment when everyone took a moment for themselves, to take it all in. We then rushed back, bringing out one family after the other.' 'During the course of that day, Capt. A. and his company evacuated 130 members of Kibbutz Be’eri and 30 fallen IDF soldiers that they brought out of the inferno using BALNAM 444 (Operational Driving School) Unit armored vehicles. He was only replaced on Sunday afternoon. He then went to the unit to organize a company for continued activity. 'It wasn’t until I got there, that I noticed I was covered in blood. and that my equipment was ruined. By early evening, we’d done a quick equipment inventory, checked the machines and vehicles, and set out for the outpost sectors. We took part in activity cleansing the fence sector of terrorists who were still alive.' 'We were there at the fence sector for a week and a half, along with special forces. By then, we understood that there were hostages, and we started collecting evidence and testimonies. We cleared fallen IDF soldiers and the bodies of terrorists. That week was very intense. I think that was the hardest part for the soldiers. They were walking around with medical masks on their faces, collecting body parts in efforts to bring the soldiers and civilians back for burial in Israel.' 'We later went into Gaza and took part in the IDF ground operation. This was the first time the Eitan AFV had taken part in combat operations – and in enemy territory. With the Eitans, we evacuated 364 wounded during the fighting, sadly, along with the fallen. We’re still operating in Gaza. 'I was hard on myself at the start. I’m not routinely part of the defense array in the Gaza sector. And yet, I was very critical and tough on myself. Why wasn’t I there? How didn’t I know before?

We rescued a father and child, their family all murdered,' IDF C...	A Mobility Unit officer hears gunfire, sees bodies of women and children at Kibbutz Be'eri while civilians wait for rescue; says he can never forget a little girl whose mother and siblings were murdered, sitting quietly as we treated her wounded father 'We rescued a father and daughter whose family had been murdered before their eyes. We stopped for a moment and then rushed back.' Capt. A. A Mobility Unit officer was called up from leave and sent to Kibbutz Be’eri. From outside the kibbutz, he could hear gunfire and saw the billowing smoke, and inside the kibbutz he saw bodies of women and children, civilians who needed to be brought out. Between fighting terrorists and seeing dreadful things, he met a girl he couldn’t forget. 'What I Saw There,' a series of testimonies from the day everything changed. Kibbutz Be’eri is one of the symbols of the October 7 massacre and of the military’s failure to protect its citizens. A dark cloud of questions regarding how the fighting was conducted amidst all the chaos, still hovers over the events of that morning. One hundred and one community members were murdered and 31 were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip. In the battles within the kibbutz, 19 IDF soldiers were killed, along with eight Israeli police officers. This is the story of Capt. A., 444 Mobility Unit commander 'On the morning of October 7, we were at the end of a week-long leave following a very intensive period in the army. I was woken by a phone call from my unit commander telling me there was a complex incident in the south, and that I needed to call up my company and get myself to the unit’s assembly point at Ze’elim. It was very early, and we didn’t yet understand what was going on.' 'I was on my way to the unit by 6:45, picking up soldiers along the way. We weren’t armed as our guns are stored when we’re on leave. So, we set out with kitchen knives. Our unit is in the Gaza Periphery sector where there were mortars falling, damaging our equipment and readiness for battle. In efforts to take control of the fire, I gathered a few soldiers, took two Sandcat Tigris armored vehicles, and set off. 'We used our instincts to get to Be’eri. We saw smoke from the kibbutz itself and heard a lot of automatic gunfire. In the afternoon, we were met with heavy fire when we tried getting in through the gate. So, we decided to go around the kibbutz and approach it from the south. But when we got there, our force encountered precision sniper fire. We spread ourselves out and returned fire. Two of our soldiers were wounded. We went in through the main gate anyway, as we knew that was the only point that somehow, the terrorists weren’t optimally prepared.' 'We advanced adjacent to the kibbutz’s surrounding northern fence and saw a vehicle go up in flames with a few bodies inside. I now know that was the security personnel who’d shown up at the kibbutz to provide response. We then reached a junction and, for the first time, clearly saw the bodies of civilians. Bodies of women and children were lying there. We then started getting fired at from one of the houses on our right. We stormed the house where there were three terrorists whom we managed to neutralize. Sadly, the residents of that house were no longer alive.' 'The fighting that whole night was very intensive. At some stage, two Shaldag soldiers and I went to a relatively new neighborhood on the kibbutz, to a building on fire on its right-hand side. We started searching for survivors. We took cover behind a burnt-out vehicle and noticed a terrorist running toward us. We neutralized him, and started walking in a kind of corridor between the wall and the house. We saw that they’d broken into the house through the saferoom window using gunfire and a powerful explosive device placed there. We broke down the window and the front door and got into the saferoom where we found a woman’s body, with her family and a boy, who sadly had also been killed. Beside them was the wounded father writhing in pain, along with a girl who was also wounded.' 'We began providing medical response. We checked to see if the mother and boy could be saved, but their breathing and injuries were extremely severe. We put tourniquets on the girl and the two soldiers with me checked the father’s bleeding. He’d been hit twice by gunfire on the back. We took a chair. I’ll never forget that chair. It a was turquoise chair from the balcony. We lifted the girl up and took her to the vehicle. She was a young girl with an enormous spirit. Her family had died before her eyes, her father was screaming in pain, and she was sitting there in silence, holding on to my hand. I told her, ‘Everything’s okay, everything’s okay. We’re getting you out now.’ She answered, ‘I know everything’s okay. Just take care of my father’. What a brave girl.' 'We put her in the vehicle and ran with the stretcher to bring out the father. Let’s just say, we had to stop for a while after that. There was a moment when everyone took a moment for themselves, to take it all in. We then rushed back, bringing out one family after the other.' 'During the course of that day, Capt. A. and his company evacuated 130 members of Kibbutz Be’eri and 30 fallen IDF soldiers that they brought out of the inferno using BALNAM 444 (Operational Driving School) Unit armored vehicles. He was only replaced on Sunday afternoon. He then went to the unit to organize a company for continued activity. 'It wasn’t until I got there, that I noticed I was covered in blood. and that my equipment was ruined. By early evening, we’d done a quick equipment inventory, checked the machines and vehicles and set out for the outpost sectors. We took part in activity cleansing the fence sector of terrorists who were still alive.' 'We were there at the fence sector for a week and a half, along with special forces. By then, we understood that there were hostages, and we started collecting evidence and testimonies. We cleared fallen IDF soldiers and the bodies of terrorists. That week was very intense. I think that was the hardest part for the soldiers. They were walking around with Covid masks on their faces, collecting body parts in efforts to bring the soldiers and civilians back for burial in Israel.' 'We later went into Gaza and took part in the IDF ground operation. This was the first time the Eitan AFV has taken part in combat operations – and in enemy territory. With the Eitans, we evacuated 364 wounded during the fighting, sadly, along with the fallen too. We’re still operating in Gaza. 'I was hard on myself at the start. I’m not routinely part of the defense array in the Gaza sector. And yet, I was very critical and tough on myself. Why wasn’t I there? How didn’t I know before? Could I have done anything better to save lives? With time, I have come to understand that I couldn’t have done anything differently, but that was with me all along the way the way, even in battle. That’s a commander’s job. At least that’s what I believe – interrogating yourself and always understanding what you can do better. Being better and providing better response.'

Nova survivor: 'I later found out I broke several bones, but the ...	Itamar Or Luz vividly recalls the terror he faced at the music festival, narrowly escaping as terrorists ambushed and killed many around him, including friends; haunted by the violence and loss, he continues to struggle with the trauma, carrying the memories of that day with him constantly It was one of the deadliest terror attacks in history, but for hours, security forces failed to comprehend the full scale of the horror unfolding at the Nova music festival in Kibbutz Re’im. A total of 393 people were murdered, 44 were abducted to Gaza and hundreds were injured. Itamar Or Luz, 25, still struggles a year later to reconcile the joy he felt just minutes before 6:29 a.m. with the terror that followed. 'Anyone familiar with outdoor parties knows that at 6 a.m., the dance floor is packed. It’s when the best DJ comes on stage, and you want to be there, excited, as the sun rises. It’s indescribable. We were smiling from ear to ear, hugging, dancing and enjoying ourselves. We had been waiting for this party, and it was the last time we were all together. Seven friends went, and six returned. Ten other friends who came in separate cars didn’t come back, and one—Omer Wenkert—is still held captive in Gaza. 'When the first siren went off, we lay on the ground, hands over our heads. Fifteen minutes later, the security officer told everyone to evacuate. We packed up nonchalantly and helped others leave. When we saw our close friends getting into their cars, we figured we could go too. 'I got to the car with two friends, tried to head toward Route 232, and realized all the roads were blocked. A policeman we encountered told us that terrorists had infiltrated the sector. I served in the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, and my two friends were in the Egoz unit, so we understood the situation was different from what we thought, but we were sure it was just four or five terrorists, and the army would take care of it. We parked by the side of the road and waited near the festival entrance. 'Later, I found out I tore ligaments in my ankle and broke several bones, but the adrenaline kept me going. I felt nothing and continued running.' 'Someone suggested we lie next to a three-foot-high concrete barrier. Moments later, a missile hit behind us, and the barrier shattered into pieces. We lifted our heads, realized we were still alive and ran toward the road. A few feet before reaching the road, four pickup trucks stopped in front of us—ten terrorists in each. They aimed their weapons at us and began shooting. It was the first time I came face to face with terrorists. 'At that point, your mind switches. You don’t think, don’t feel—you just act. I veered right, away from everyone, knowing it was my only chance to survive. Meanwhile, I see people around me getting shot and collapsing on top of each other. Stopping was not an option. As I crawled toward the road, as I’d learned in the army, I saw people being shot and collapsing on top of each other. I couldn’t stop. I crawled to the road, and as soon as I lifted my head, two pickup trucks arrived with twenty terrorists, firing in all directions. The bullets missed me by inches. I reached a 20-foot pit and jumped. 'Later, I found out I tore ligaments in my ankle and broke several bones, but the adrenaline kept me going. I felt nothing and continued running. Suddenly, I saw three pickups with people dressed in IDF uniforms. I approached them, and they opened fire with submachine guns. I realized they were terrorists and jumped into the bushes. 'They knew people were hiding in the bushes and sprayed the area with gunfire before driving off. When they returned, they began shouting, 'IDF, IDF, we’re here, come out.' I saw this one girl come out, and the next thing I heard was screaming and gunfire. She just collapsed. They went from bush to bush, dragging people out, shooting them and loading others into trucks. I sat quietly, trying to blend into the bushes. I took off my shirt and tied it around my mouth, thinking that if I got shot, I wouldn’t scream. 'A few minutes later, they set up a command post about 20 or 25 feet from me. All the vehicles and motorcycles gathered there, and they sent out trucks to capture people. I witnessed kidnappings right before my eyes, but I didn’t grasp what was happening at the moment. I didn’t consider they were taking people to Gaza. I lay there from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., listening to them laugh, talk in Arabic and enjoy what they were doing. There was real excitement. 'Around 1:30 p.m., I began to hear IDF forces approaching, and the terrorists' laughter turned to fear. They knew they had no chance if the IDF arrived and began fleeing. By 2:20 p.m., there was total silence. I came out of the bushes and walked through bodies, trying to find just one person alive, but I couldn’t. I moved from body to body, burned-out car to burned-out car. I essentially retraced my steps back to the party. 'I saw hell. I saw the open shipping container full of bodies, blood covering the floor. I took another step toward the tents and saw people who had stayed behind and been murdered. Another step, and I reached the bar, where I saw people lying on the ground, bleeding, missing limbs, heads, hands. I realized no one had survived. Then I started asking myself, where are my friends? Where is everyone? 'A policeman put me in a car, and we drove along Route 232. There were no living people—just bodies, overturned vehicles and burned people. My dad waited for me on Highway 6 near Beit Kama, and we went to the hospital. It wasn’t until nighttime that I learned my friend, Ido Edri, had been killed. That’s when I broke down. He was like a brother to me. 'I never left Nova. My innocence, my soul—something was left there, at that party in October, in that forest. It stays with me every single day. Aside from the grief, the sleepless nights, the sudden bursts of tears when I hear a song in the car—there are the voices of the people who didn’t survive. The screams, the crying. I don’t have to relive it; it’s all in my mind. The ringing in my ears from the gunfire, from the trauma, the immense pain—it all follows me.'

Prison Authority anti-terror forces conduct coordinated raids on prisons across the country holding among others, Nukhbah terrorists involved in Oct. 7 massacre; makeshift weapons confiscated and plot to use electric wires to strangle guards, foiled Special forces of the Prison Authority raided cells housing convicted terrorists and security detainees on Monday, including from the Nukhba forces that committed the Oct. 7 massacre last year. The operation was in response to intelligence indicating intentions to start riots in facilities across the country, one year to the day, after the Hamas atrocities. The coordinated operation began in the pre-dawn hours, with forces using stun grenades and entering cell compounds from all directions. After inmates were taken to an external location, forces conducted searches and found makeshift knives among other materials. Intelligence gathered by the Prison Authorities revealed that some of the prisoners planned to use electrical wires hidden in the walls, to kill guards. Some of the materials confiscated in the searches and the condition of the electric sockets in some of the cells, confirmed those reports Prison Authority chief Chief warrant officer Kobi Yaakovi said the authority prepared in advance to respond to any attempted riot or violence. 'The Prison Authority remains vigilant and shows zero tolerance for any acts of terror,' he said.

Explosion heard near Israeli embassy in Copenhagen	Explosion overnight Monday comes five days after a grenade attack on the building and on the anniversary of the October 7 massacre; Israeli embassy in Stockholm targeted by gunfire An explosion was heard overnight some 500 meters from the Israeli embassy in Denmark, Copenhagen police said Monday, five days after an attack on the diplomatic building. 'We are of course looking into whether there could be a link to the incident at the Israeli embassy,' Copenhagen police inspector Trine Møller told reporters. 'There is no indication that this is the case,' she added, however, specifying that the explosion was probably caused by gunfire. Local press footage shows traces of the explosion in front of a residential building some 500 meters as the crow flies from the Israeli embassy. On the night of October 1-2, explosions occurred very close to the same embassy, ​​probably caused by grenades thrown, in the context of tensions in the Middle East. According to the prosecution, two young Swedes, aged 16 and 19, are suspected of having transported five grenades and throwing two that landed on a terrace about a hundred meters from the diplomatic building. They were placed in custody by a judge on Thursday for 27 days. Two days later, the police indicated that the charges against them had been extended to offenses under the legislation on terrorism, without giving further details. In Sweden, the Israeli embassy in Stockholm was targeted by gunfire, which did not cause any injuries, on Tuesday. The Swedish intelligence services have not ruled out the involvement of Iran in these two incidents.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1mc8xwkje	2024-10-07T02:25:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/07/S100t00Qb1Jl/S100t00Qb1Jl_673_108_2328_1310_0_small.jpg
UNIFIL rejects IDF demand to move north of fighting	Military urges peacekeepers to move 5 kilometers north to avoid the fighting; Irish president says Israeli demand is 'outrageous' after his soldiers make up a considerable portion of the UNIFIL deployment UNIFIL forces in South Lebanon refused an Israeli request to move five kilometers to the north to avoid the fighting and allow the troops to complete clearing villages along the border of Hezbollah fighters so that the residents of the north can return safely to their homes. UNIFIL claimed the IDF was endangering their troops after Israeli tanks took up positions near the peacekeeping force. Ireland, which has 347 of its soldiers deployed among the UN force's 10,000-strong presence in Lebanon, refused the IDF's request, even though 30 Irish soldiers were deployed close to the fighting. The government in Dublin officially told Israel that it refuses to move the UNIFIL force, resulting in an exchange of blame between the Israeli embassy there and Irish President Michael Higgins, a known critic of Israel. 'It is outrageous that the Israel Defense Forces have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending,' Higgins said earlier this week adding that Israel is in violation of UN resolution 1701. 'There is an obligation on Israel and Hezbollah to respect the role of UN peacekeepers and their mandate, and do nothing that would put peacekeepers and our troops in particular in harm’s way,' he said. The Israeli embassy in Dublin said in a statement that the accusation that Israeli troops threatened peacekeepers was false and that the IDF asked UNIFIL to move north for their own safety. 'Let's be clear, the peacekeeping forces have great importance in Israel. The attempt to describe their actions as a threat to UNIFIL is another baseless and defamatory charge, the likes of which we have observed in recent months,' the embassy said in a statement. UNIFIL Spokesperson Andrea Teneti said the peacekeeping force will continue to carry out its duties. 'UN continues to be in contact with the relevant actors on both sides of the Blue Line to de-escalate the situation,' he said.

728 fallen troops, over 25,000 rockets fired at Israel in year of...	IDF reports over 14,000 eliminated terrorists in Gaza, 800 in Lebanon; 347 soldiers and one female soldier have fallen since the Gaza ground operation, while 10 soldiers have fallen in Lebanon; and 4,576 soldiers have been wounded On the anniversary of the October 7 massacre, the deadliest event in Israel’s history, the IDF released a comprehensive report on Monday detailing the toll since the beginning of the war. The report includes data on casualties, the wounded –both physically and mentally – and missile launches that have disrupted daily life in Israel, along with operational successes and the inspiring mobilization of reservists. Since the war began, 728 IDF soldiers have fallen, and of these 347 fighters and one female soldier were killed since the start of the ground maneuver in Gaza, while 10 soldiers have been killed in southern Lebanon since Israel launched Operation Northern Arrows. Additionally, 56 soldiers have died in operational accidents, including 28 from friendly fire incidents and 20 from accidents such as vehicular mishaps and mishandling of ordnance. Other causes include shooting accidents, hazardous materials and air incidents. A total of 4,576 soldiers have been wounded since the war started, 2,299 of them since the ground incursion in Gaza began. Of the total, 1,037 were injured in operational accidents, including weapon malfunctions, hazardous materials exposure and friendly fire. Some 29 soldiers remain hospitalized in serious condition, 151 in moderate condition, and 16 are lightly injured. Since the start of the war, approximately 4,100 soldiers have been evacuated via helicopters and vehicles. Additionally, around 15,000 soldiers have been treated for trauma-related symptoms, with 82% returning to active combat. The response to the 'emergency call-up' orders, known as Tzav 8, has been described as 'inspiring' by the IDF. Around 300,000 reservists have been mobilized since the war began, 20% of them women. The majority, or 46.5%, are aged 20-29. Nearly 5% of the reservists are men aged 50-59, with more than 1% from the 60-69 age group. Reservists have received approximately 7.6 billion shekels in grants as of last month. Throughout the war, tens of thousands of rockets have been launched at Israel. By October 2, 2024, approximately 13,200 rockets had been fired from Gaza, 12,400 from Lebanon, around 400 from Iran, 180 from Yemen, and 60 from Syria. Due to the volume of attacks, Israeli citizens have heavily relied on the Home Front Command’s online portal, which recorded 180.3 million visits and 750,000 emergency hotline calls as of last month. The IDF has reported significant operational achievements. Since the start of the war, around 14,000 terrorists were killed in Gaza, with an additional 3,000 likely neutralized by the end of last month. This includes eight high-ranking commanders, 30 battalion leaders, and around 165 company commanders. In northern Israel, over 800 terrorists have been killed, including 90 commanders. In the Central Command, over 690 terrorists have been eliminated. Meanwhile, IDF Unit 504 has conducted approximately 7,000 interrogations since the war began. In the past year of fighting, Israel has struck countless targets. More than 40,000 airstrikes have been carried out in Gaza, and around 4,700 tunnels have been discovered. In the north, nearly 5,000 airstrikes and around 6,000 ground targets have been hit. While the main theaters of war are in the north and south, military operations have also been ongoing in the Central Command. More than 10,000 raids have been carried out, and over 5,000 suspects have been arrested in the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. About 30 homes belonging to terrorists have been demolished, and around 1,000 weapons have been seized. During the war, the IDF has distributed vast quantities of logistical supplies, including around 70,000 personal weapons, 94,000 ceramic vests, 95,000 combat vests, and over 30,000 helmets. Additionally, 1.2 million uniforms, 138,000 sleeping bags, 185,000 protective goggles, and around 225,000 mattresses have been handed out. To sustain the troops, approximately 4 million tons of combat rations, 28 tons of fruits and vegetables, and 920,000 tons of protein bars, cookies, candy, and gum have been supplied. The IDF has also highlighted the generous food donations from civilians for the soldiers on the frontlines.

Hamas rocket fire targets Tel Aviv, surrounding areas	Terror group claims responsibility for attack one year after October 7 massacre; Initial reports indicate rocket landed in Holon, another in the ultra-Orthodox community of Kfar Chabad near Ben-Gurion airport, where 2 people were lightly hurt Rockets were launched from Gaza at Tel Aviv and areas in central Israel on Monday, one year after the massacre of October 7. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack. Initial reports indicate a rocket landed in Holon and another in the ultra-Orthodox community of Kfar Chabad near Ben-Gurion airport, where 2 people were lightly hurt The military said five projectiles were launched from Khan Younis toward central Israel. Earlier the terror group launched a rocket attack at Gaza border communities while ceremonies commemorating the victims of the atrocities were being held there and at the site of the Nova music festival. Northern Israel also came under rocket fire from Hezbollah in Lebanon during the morning hours as the IDF said it was bolstering its troop deployment in the ground offensive into South Lebanon to remove Hezbollah forces from the border area. Earlier senior Hamas leader Khaled Mashal said the war has destroyed Israel's image around the world. 'Israel has failed for the past year,' he said, adding his thanks to Iran and Hezbollah for their part.

Demonstration in Berlin for October 7 calls to 'liberate Haifa, J...	Two marches were held in Berlin to mark the anniversary of October 7: One in memory of the victims in which the members of the Jewish community marched in silence from the Brandenburg Gate, and the other in Kreuzberg, which was saturated with expressions of hatred; 'You Jews have not learned the lessons of the Holocaust,' said a kippah-clad protester The world is commemorating the October 7 Hamas massacre on Monday) in thousands of events including in rallies and marches, in ceremonies in Jewish communities and synagogues, in special events and discussion groups - but there are also those who prefer, even now a year later, to focus on hatred and blame Israel for all its troubles and the most terrible killing spree in its history. On Sunday evening in the Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, organizers of a pro-Palestinian demonstration and the leading truck with the announcer and the speakers waited and waited, but the general rehearsal for the big demonstration on October 7 did not quite live up to expectations. 'We have a force of 500 or 600 policemen here,' a policeman who was standing in Kottbusser-Tor, the square from where the procession started toward the immigrant neighborhood of Neukalen, and where only a little over a thousand protesters had gathered, told me. 'We thought we would have a police officer for every eight to 10 protesters. It's a bit surprising. But it's less work for us.' The official reason for the demonstration was to express solidarity with the residents of Gaza and Lebanon, and alongside it there were quite a few expressions of joy on the anniversary of the October 7 massacre in the Gaza border communities. There were two separate camps at the demonstration: Germans and Anglo-Saxons from the German left, and Muslim immigrants; Flags of Palestine, Lebanon and Ireland waved wildly; Drummers loudly beat drums; The famous keffiyeh officially announced the year in which it climbed to the top of the fashion icons in the Western world in black and white, blue and white, yellow and black, red and khaki. There were all the usual signs with the same old sayings, such as: 'A thief cannot own what he stole' and 'Occupying Palestine since 1948.' And there were also Israeli demonstrators with signs against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hate is in the air. The announcer chanted against the 'brutal police' and reminded the protesters not to give them any reason to disperse the demonstration. And instead of chanting 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,' they shouted: 'We will not stop until we liberate Haifa, Jaffa, Acre, Safed and Tel Aviv,' and the announcer added: 'From the sea to the sea, this is the only real way to say it and no German white policeman or God will not stop me from saying that.' He also called 'Netanyahu and Scholz you will see, Palestine will be free,' and congratulated their 'brothers' in the resistance movement in 'Gaza, Nablus, Tulkarm and Daheih'. The last place, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut, is the name that evoked the loudest applause. And of course: 'Germany finances, Israel bombs' and 'Five, six, seven, eight, end of Zionism.' I asked Maya, a German student in a fashionable hoodie, if it wasn't strange for her to stand in the middle of Berlin and not sympathize with even one word or act against the biggest murder of Jews since the Holocaust. She pointed to the banner that was hanging on the side of the announcement truck: 'It started long before October 7,' it says, a slogan that has become commonplace among Israel haters. 'I pay taxes to the German government, and I cannot and do not want to be complicit in the genocide and child murder that Israel commits with this money,' she said, adding: 'to stand aside and look at the other side, is to wash our hands of a crime that I am complicit in. I think this is the lesson we learned from the Third Reich. It seems that, according to their behavior, the Jews in Israel did not learn the right lesson.' A young British man passed by us with a sign that compared the pro-Palestinian protest to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. The procession started fashionably late, but it didn't really get going. The ratio was one policeman for every three protesters. 'The hate demonstration is a direct continuation of the terror celebrations in Neukalen on October 7 - the distribution of sweets for the murder of Jews,' Israel's ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said. 'When talking about 3,200 antisemitic crimes in Germany, this is what it looks like. This is the face of Islamist antisemitism that thrives under the cover of freedom of expression.' At a distance of about four kilometers away, a quieter and calmer procession took place, in which hundreds of Jews and Germans who came to sympathize with the victims of the massacre and the hostages who remain in captivity. Several people held in their hands the headline of the important Berlin newspaper Tagsspiegel, which, like other newspapers, printed the faces of the hostages on its cover. They walked in silence from the Brandenburg Gate to the Bebelplatz public square, silent, as if they couldn't believe that a year had already passed since their world had been shaken on a Saturday in early autumn last year. Events marking October 7 to be held in New York In the meantime, more than 400 commemorative events will be held Monday in the U.S. to commemorate the massacre, including exhibitions, shows and interactive activities. Many of the organizers are deliberately obfuscating the location and date of the events for fear of anti-Israel protests, but the Jewish Federations of North America has launched a dedicated website detailing the events. In New York, there will be a major central ceremony led by Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon, where singer Eden Golan will perform 'October Rain,' the song rejected by Eurovision as too political. The 'Last Embrace' exhibition by the artist Yifat Pe’er, dedicated to the victims of October 7, will also be launched at UN headquarters. In the evening, a rally will be held in Central Park, at the initiative of the JNFA, with performances by Eden Golan, David Broza, and student choirs, as well as a candle lighting ceremony in memory of the victims with the participation of families of hostages. In addition, the Chabad community will lead a huge march in Manhattan in memory of the victims, Emanu El synagogue will become a night club in solidarity with the survivors of the Nova music festival, and synagogues and Jewish community centers will hold their own events. Several states in the US lowered their flags to half-mast to mark the massacre, and central buildings in New York state were lit up yellow at the order of Governor Kathy Hochul. At the same time as these events, huge pro-Palestinian demonstrations are expected, especially on campuses. At Columbia University there will be a large protest, and at the University of Maryland, following an unusual court ruling, the university was forced to allow a demonstration.

Military says it struck Hamas rocket launchers after a strike on the Gaza border area at the exact time the massacre began a year ago and while ceremonies commemorating the victims were taking place; Commander says the troops' eyes are focused on their mission and their spirit is high The IDF said on Monday that its forces fired at Hamas launchers in Gaza after rockets were fired at border communities. Hamas launched the rockets at 6.30 AM the exact hour that the massacre began a year ago and as ceremonies commemorating the victims of the atrocities were taking place in communities and at the site of the Nova music festival. The military said targets in central Gaza were also hit while troops were operating there. Forces entered Jabaliya on Sunday. Palestinian media reported widespread strikes in the Jabaliya area, while the IDF announced a targeted airstrike on a Hamas complex in the city. According to the military, air force jets struck Hamas terrorists operating from a command and control center previously used as a UNRWA facility. Captain Nadav Sarlin said that as long as hostages are being held in Gaza, there can be no defeat of Hamas. ' The soldiers don't ask questions and are just keen to carry out their mission and bring more achievements,' he told Ynet. 'Like the many tunnels we uncovered in recent weeks, near the Philadelphi Corridor and the weapons we destroyed in Rafah. It is clear there that there are more targets to go after.' Sarlin said he lost two men in the fighting but the motivation of his troops remained high. 'They've never lost sight of their missions and objectives and their spirits are sky high.' Senior IDF commanders hope that with the Lebanon front taking center stage, Israel will be able to cut the link between the northern and southern fronts, Between Hezbollah and Hamas, which would change the tied in the war and begin to bring it to an end. Israel's deterrence has also returned after the targeted killing of Hezbollah's leadership and the assaults on its assets and they hope the offensive there would be completed within a couple of weeks. They also hoped that the West Bank would not ignite and become another prominent front in the war. But the commanders understand that there will be a need to launch attacks on Hamas in Gaza in the coming year, especially since the government continues to avoid alternative rule over the Strip's two million residents.

Ground operation expands in Lebanon	A week after the IDF's entry into Lebanon, 3 reserve brigades begin 'targeted and limited' ground operation; These are fighters who also fought in the Gaza Strip. Commander of 91st division: 'It is time to change the security situation in the north, for the sake of returning the residents to their homes' The ground operation in southern Lebanon is expanding, about a week after the IDF's entry into Lebanon. The IDF spokesman reported Monday morning that three reserve brigades have begun a 'localized and targeted operational activity' in southern Lebanon. The addition of the brigades signifies the expansion of the ground operation that began in southern Lebanon last week. These solders have fought in the Gaza Strip and the northern sector throughout the last year, and in the last two weeks were re-mobilized. The commander of the division, Lt. Col. Shai Klapper, told the soldiers upon their entry into South Lebanon: 'Soldiers of the 91st Division, my brothers in arms in the regular and in the reserves. For many months you have sacrificed yourselves and worked with endless dedication to form the northern protective wall of our country. Today, the eve of October 7, a year after the enemy's attack on all fronts, a year in which we significantly damaged the enemy and returned the war, the Galilee formation is marching forward.' In a message to the soldiers, he discussed entering Lebanon: 'You, the reserve men, who were the first to show up on the northern front, are going to attack the enemy on his territory. This is our time to change the security reality in the north, for the sake of returning the residents to their homes.' On Monday morning, before the IDF spokesman's announcement of additional brigades joining the fighting, it released the name of a soldier killed in battle on the Lebanese border: Master sergeant (res.) Etay Azulay, 25, from Oranit. In the incident in which Azulay fell, two other soldiers were seriously injured. Since the ground operation in Lebanon began, about a week ago, 10 IDF soldiers have been killed in battles in the northern arena. During the operation in southern Lebanon, the IDF soldiers located many weapons, some of them in underground tunnel systems intended to be used by Hezbollah terrorists to stay and launch an attack near the northern settlements. An underground munitions warehouse was found in one of the houses, containing dozens of anti-tank missiles, weapons, cartridges, Radwan force uniforms, vests and helmets. The warehouse was destroyed and the munitions were confiscated.

Family learns one year later that hostage Idan Shtivi was murdere...	A year after he was abducted from the Nova party while trying to help a couple he met for the first time escape, the family of hostage Idan Shtivi was informed that he was murdered on the morning of the massacre; 'We all prayed that he was alive, unfortunately the bitter news shatters that hope' Hostage Idan Shtivi was murdered one year ago on October 7 by Hamas terrorists, his family was informed on Monday. His body was kidnapped and is being held in Gaza. Until Monday, Idan was believed to be alive. 'We all prayed that Idan ben Haim would live and return to his family. Unfortunately, the bitter news shatters this hope,' said the Petah Tikva municipality, where he lived, in a statement. Idan, 28, loved nature, photography and animals. He was very attached to dogs and other animals and was about to start his second year studying sustainability at Reichmann University. On October 7 he arrived at the Nova music festival to film his friends playing and giving workshops. When the attack began, Idan helped a young couple he met for the first time at the festival to escape, a choice that eventually led to his kidnapping. Idan is survived by his parents Eli and Dalit, three brothers and his partner, Stav. Some 101 hostages, alive and dead, are still being held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip one year after the attack. For 90 days after the surprise attack by Hamas, Shtivi's relatives and friends waited for information about his fate. On January 5, the IDF spokesman informed his family that he was identified as a hostage in the Gaza Strip. 'Hold on, my man. A little more. When you come back the house is waiting for you, with all your things and your equipment. I won't give up on you, and I won't stop believing,' his partner wrote last week, ahead of the start of the school year. Three days ago, Eli Shtivi , Idan's father, wrote on his Facebook account: 'Idan Shtivi is my beloved child. Come back, come back already ❤️🙏🙏', alongside videos of his son.

Australians hold vigils on anniversary of Oct. 7 Hamas massacre	Australians gathered for vigils on Monday to mark the first anniversary of Hamas' deadly attack on Israel, but the events were muted after authorities warned of tougher security measures. At Sydney's famed Bondi Beach, participants holding Israeli and Australian flags listened in silence to a reading of the names of Israel's 101 hostages still held by Hamas. Some pro-Palestinian events planned in Australia to coincide with the anniversary were brought forward a day after talks with authorities, but pro-Israel groups went ahead with the events, from Bondi to Parliament House in Canberra, the capital. At Parliament House, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott told an event organized by Christian group Never Again Is Now that he lamented civilian Palestinian deaths but admired 'the way Israel has been so incredibly fastidious in trying to avoid them'. In a statement on Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he condemned the Hamas assault a year earlier but added, 'As we mourn and reflect, we also re-affirm a fundamental principle of our shared humanity: every innocent life matters.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1fgwx11kyl	2024-10-06T22:27:51-07:00

In one year of war, Israel strikes 40,000 Hamas targets in Gaza	In the past year in the Gaza Strip, Israel has bombed more than 40,000 targets, found 4,700 tunnel shafts and destroyed 1,000 rocket launcher sites, the military said on Monday, the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas massacre. Some 726 Israeli soldiers had been killed since Oct. 7, 2023. Of those, 380 died in the Oct. 7 attacks and 346 in Gaza combat starting Oct. 27, 2023. Injured troops numbered 4,576 since that date. Fifty-six soldiers died as a result of operational accidents, which the military did not define. Some 300,000 reservists have been enlisted since the start of the war - 82% men and 18% women and nearly half of them aged 20 to 29. Since the start of the war, 13,200 rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza. Another 12,400 were fired from Lebanon, while 60 came from Syria, 180 from Yemen and 400 from Iran, the IDF said. It said it killed more than 800 terrorists in Lebanon, where 4,900 targets have been struck from the air along with about 6,000 ground targets. Over the past year, Israel arrested more than 5,000 suspects in the West Bank and Jordan Valley. The military said it killed eight Gaza militant brigade commanders, about 30 battalion commanders and 165 company commanders over the past year.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rka7s111j1l	2024-10-06T21:38:13-07:00	
They Looked Death in Eye. We Mustn’t Forget Them: Maya Desiatnik,...	Each and every story is a whole life; together, however, they make up a puzzle. Many stories have not yet come to light: These are testimonies of soldiers and survivors of the 7/10 massacre, gathered from those who may still not have found the words 'I couldn’t believe they’d hurt them in their pajamas.' Maya Desiatnik, lookout and death war room survivor. The Nahal Oz sector was finally quiet on 6/10. When the sirens kicked off, Maya suddenly noticed terrorists running toward the fence. She recalls the battle, how she lost contact with her friends in the shelter unit, and how she fled the war room that had been set on fire. 'I forced myself to open my eyes.' She’s been rehabilitating and yearning ever since. 'What I Saw There,' a series of chilling testimonies from the day everything changed. Fifty-two male and female soldiers, including 15 lookout soldiers, died at Nahal Oz on the morning of October 7 in one of the first and harshest battles fought that day. The lookouts saw everything and reported everything. They warned and courageously directed forces. Reinforcements showed up only after several, long hours and there was no one to rescue them. Seven were kidnapped by terrorists to Gaza and one has been murdered in captivity. Only two survived the inferno. This is the story of Maya Desiatnik, the only lookout to survive that inferno. 'On October 6, a few hours before the massacre, we were having a discharge party for the late Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani. She called the party 'The Last Disco' and hung up of decorations around the sign reading 'Nahal Oz is Home.' It’s so sad to think about it. At the time, there were lots of disturbances in the sector, and that weekend in particular was quiet. We ate together, laughed and sang. We didn’t want the evening to end.' I got up at 3:30 for a war room shift. The rockets started at around 6:30. The siren in the war room was incessant and we saw people running to the fence, a huge pickup truck crossing the fence. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. We declared an infiltration, and we gradually started saying invasion. It was scary just saying it out loud.' 'We’d never drilled directing the soldiers in a scenario on this scale. There was just one force in the field and one on base. In my sector, there were already several infiltration points. My friend, the late Sgt. Yael Leibushor, who was sitting next to me, saw dozens of terrorists on their way to us and to Kibbutz Nahal Oz. The commanders started huddling around her counting the terrorists on their way to the outpost. They saw them turn and go it and saw the battle at the outpost gate. I didn’t watch. I couldn’t.' 'We were scared, but we knew the only thing we could do was function. I didn’t think of myself at that moment. I told myself that I was serving in a position.' 'About a quarter of an hour to 15 minutes later, the terrorists got past the gate and got into the outpost and we watched them go to the war room. We were told to hide in our officer, the late Capt. Shir Eilat’s office. We sat there one on top of the other. There was no space. One girl would straighten her legs, then one would crouch down. We managed to stay in contact with our friends in the shelter, until around 7:30 when they stopped responding. At the time, we thought reception was down.' 'The siren in the war room was incessant and we saw people running to the fence and a huge pickup truck crossing the fence. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. We declared an infiltration, and we gradually started saying ‘invasion’, It’s scary just saying that out loud.' Maya and her friends hid out for six hours straight in the office in the war room, as the heroic battle was raging around them, fighting to the last bullet. Fifty-two male and female soldiers fell at Nahal Oz that morning. 'I remember at some stage, the language changed from ‘We need reinforcement’ to ‘We need rescuing’. We could hear terrorists talking, going up to the war room roof, shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’. They shot at the war room from outside and threw grenades in. When they realized they couldn’t get in, they set it on fire, with all of us inside.' 'Smoke came in and it was hard to breathe. We tried blocking the office entrance to stop the smoke from coming in, but it didn’t help. We started coughing and choking and everyone left. I remember trying, and being unable, to talk. I’d open my mouth, and I’d get smoke in my mouth.' 'I knew I had to carry on walking, I heard one of the officers shouting, ‘Get out through the bathroom window’. I fell several times on the way. My eyes were burning up and I told myself I had to force myself to open them to find the bathroom. When made it there, the sink had been broken by whoever had used it before me to get out. I just legged up and jumped from the window.' 'I got out, sat down and waited. One of the male soldiers came out of the other window. He had been severely affected by the smoke. My throat was burning up too. There was gunfire, sirens and no one around. Where were the girls?' 'We moved 40 minutes later to hide somewhere else – between the bushes and the concrete barricade blocks. We spent almost two hours there, until the paratroopers came to rescue us.' Seven people were rescued from the burning war room. Maya was the only lookout. At the Nahal Oz outpost, 15 lookouts were murdered on October 7, and seven were kidnapped. The late lookout, Noa Marciano, was murdered in Hamas captivity and Ori Magadish was rescued from Gaza by IDF forces. Five lookouts are still in captivity: Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev. 'I do think why me, and whether it could have ended differently. When I got out of there, I still held onto the hope that they might have somehow escaped, and that I hadn’t seen them. As for the girls in the shelter, I just couldn’t believe they’d hurt them like that in their pajamas, with no guns. Whenever I’d hear about another girl, my hope would burst a little more. On the day they told me about the late Sgt. Ronni Eshel, my hope completely shattered. Ronni was the last one listed as missing. ' 'I’m beginning to rehabilitate, but it’s hard. I had plans. After my discharge in August, I was going to go to Sinai or Eilat with the girls – whatever we’d decide. But there’s no way I’m going without them. I try finding some kind of routine, but it’s hard. It’s especially hard when they’re still there. I know that in the meantime, I can recover 75-80% tops, but I can only make up those last points when they come back, only when they all come back.'

God save the Tsar!': Putin receives first wishes for 72nd birthda...	God save the Tsar!' was one of the first public birthday wishes for President Vladimir Putin who turns 72 on Monday and who has been Russia's paramount leader for nearly quarter of a century. The greeting came from ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin on his Telegram messaging channel minutes after midnight. Dugin, 62, has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories in a vast new Russian empire, which he wants to include Ukraine. Putin, who ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in 2022, won a record post-Soviet landslide in a March election. His new six-year term, if completed, would make him Russia's longest-serving leader for more than 200 years when tsars and empresses ruled the country.

IDF names fallen soldier in north as Hamas fires rockets at borde...	The terror group attacks Gaza border communities at the exact hour the massacre began one year ago and while a moment of silence was observed in memory of the victims; Master Sergeant Etay Azulay killed on Lebanon border, two others injured The IDF said on Monday that Master Sergeant Etay Azulay, aged 25, from Oranit, a soldier in Unit 5515, fell during combat on the Lebanese border. Two other soldiers were wounded and taken to hospital. Since the start of the war one year ago today, 728 men and women in service have fallen. Gaza rockets targeted the border area communities at 6:30 am, the exact time the Hamas massacre began last year and when residents in the south and families of those massacred, marked a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the atrocities. The rocket fire came after the military said it was attacking Hamas rocket launchers and terror targets in the Strip. Moments of silence were observed elsewhere in Israel as the day of commemoration of those who were slaughtered began. Earlier in the early morning hours, the military said it intercepted two hostile aircraft heading to central Israel from the east. Sirens blared in Rishon Lezion, south of Tel Aviv as the drones were nearing Israeli airspace. No injuries were reported. Overnight the IDF struck Beirut's Dahieh quarter while Haifa, Tiberias and surrounding areas came under attack. One man suffered serious injuries from shrapnel and a number of others were also hurt.

Florida braces for Hurricane Milton on the heels of Helene	Florida prepared on Sunday for its largest evacuation since 2017 as Hurricane Milton intensified in the Gulf of Mexico on its path toward the U.S. state's western coast, coming on the heels of the devastating Hurricane Helene. Milton, which strengthened from a tropical storm to hurricane on Sunday, was projected to make landfall on Wednesday morning, most likely hitting near the heavily populated Tampa Bay area, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The new hurricane has the potential to affect areas already hit hard by Helene, which made landfall further north on the coast on Sept. 26. Kevin Guthrie, director of Florida's emergency management division, urged people to prepare for the 'largest evacuation that we have seen most likely since 2017 Hurricane Irma.' Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned of a potentially higher storm surge and more power outages from Milton compared to Helene, and said destruction from Helene could be compounded. Mexico issued a hurricane watch for the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, the center added. In the United States, North Carolina, Florida and much of the South were still recovering from the massive destruction caused by Helene, which killed more than 200 people across six states.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1dlafx11e	2024-10-06T15:20:55-07:00

Netanyahu holds hostage deal meeting on eve of October 7	For first time in a month, PM convenes security discussion on 'new ideas' to break deadlock in hostage negotiations; sources privy to details say Sinwar not responding; intelligence reports suggest half of 101 hostages alive but in critical conditions On Sunday evening, on the eve of the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas massacre, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an unusual meeting to address the stalemate in negotiations for the release of hostages held in Gaza for a full year. The Prime Minister's Office reported that the meeting included security chiefs, hostages and missing persons coordinator Gal Hirsch, and several government ministers. During the meeting, security officials presented an intelligence assessment previously disclosed by Netanyahu, indicating that about half of the 101 hostages held by Hamas are alive, but their condition is dire. 'The captors have made their conditions much worse. There are clear instructions for the captors that if they sense danger and that the IDF is approaching, they are to execute the hostages, as happened in Tel Sultan (in Rafah) with the six hostages who were murdered.' Officials in the meeting claimed: 'As time passes, there is less and less intelligence on the hostages, which is very concerning.' Sources familiar with the details added that no discussion on the hostages had taken place for an entire month, and Sunday evening's meeting was the first held in the last month. They suggested Netanyahu convened the meeting on the eve of the October 7 massacre anniversary 'to fulfill an obligation' and to avoid accusations of neglect. According to them, mediators are distancing themselves from the Israeli position, and Qatar is leaning more toward Hamas. 'The U.S. just wants to avoid escalation and lives in a fantasy that everything can be settled with Iran, the north and Gaza by resolving everything together,' a mediator said. Negotiations for a deal are at an impasse. There is no progress. Sinwar is entrenched. Knowledgeable sources also stated that the Israeli-American argument that they do not know the whereabouts of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and thus cannot make a deal, is inaccurate, as discussions can still occur with senior Hamas figures abroad. 'There is an impression that no one is dealing with this, not even the mediators, and everyone has given up. The feeling is that it is no longer a priority, overshadowed by the fear of regional war,' a source said. Despite the significant pessimism from these sources, Israel has been considering new ideas regarding the deal in recent weeks, and mediators are also exploring different ideas with Hamas, but everything remains stalled, and Sinwar has not responded. Meanwhile, there are questions about whether Sinwar is even alive or if he is out of contact for another reason. 'Negotiations for a deal are at an impasse. There is no progress. Sinwar is entrenched,' a source familiar with the details said Sunday evening. 'We are waiting for the impact from the north and, in the meantime, we are considering ideas about what can be done,' a source added, referring to the current battles in the ground operation in southern Lebanon. Netanyahu himself has publicly assessed that a severe blow to Hezbollah would also help increase pressure on Sinwar to reach a deal. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met with hostage families at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, ahead of the Salon Otef event marking the anniversary of their loved ones' abductions. 'The families expressed to the minister the deep pain they are experiencing in these difficult days and asked him to remind all Cabinet ministers and the government that the war's ultimate goal is the return of the 101 hostages,' the Hostages and Missing Families Forum reported. However, Gallant noted the Cabinet has not discussed the hostage issue for two weeks. 'In addition, the families expressed grave concern over the IDF's return to fighting in the northern Gaza Strip as, unfortunately, we have seen that military pressure kills hostages. The Defense Minister stated that the issue of the hostages' presence in the area is a top priority for the IDF, and the entire security system is committed to returning all the hostages home,' the headquarters reported. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syi1xdgj1g	2024-10-06T15:09:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/20/BkGH2oOQC/BkGH2oOQC_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Iran's Quds Force chief out of contact since strikes on Beirut su...	Senior Iranian officials have confirmed that contact with Esmail Qaani, the general who replaced former Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, has disappeared since the IDF's Beirut attack targeting Nasrallah's successor; Senior official in Hezbollah said that the terrorist organization is also 'trying to check what the truth is' Iran's Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani, who travelled to Lebanon after the killing last month of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike, has not been heard from since strikes on Beirut late last week, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters. One of the officials said Qaani was in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as Dahieh, during a strike that was reported to have targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine, but the official said he was not meeting Safieddine. A Hezbollah official said Israel was not allowing a search for Safieddine to progress after it bombed Beirut's southern suburbs on Thursday. The officials said the group would only announce Safieddine's fate when the search concluded. Safieddine is seen as a likely successor to Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike on Dahieh on September 27. The Iranian official said Iran and Hezbollah had not been able to contact Qaani, named by Tehran as the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas military-intelligence service, or Quds Force, after the United States assassinated his predecessor Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020. Israel has been hitting multiple targets in Dahieh as it pursues a campaign against Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. The second Iranian official also said Qaani had travelled to Lebanon after the killing of Nasrallah and the Iranian authorities had not been able to contact him since the strike against Safieddine, who was widely expected to be the next Hezbollah chief. Asked about reports that Qaani may have been killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut, Israeli military spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said the results of the strikes were still being assessed. He said that Israel had conducted an attack late last week against Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut. 'When we have more specific results from that strike, we will share it. There's a lot of questions about who was there and who was not,' he told a briefing with reporters. The Quds Force, the overseas arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, oversees dealings with militias allied with Tehran across the Middle East, such as Hezbollah. A senior Hezbollah official who was interviewed by an Iraqi media channel Sunday evening was asked about Qaani's disappearance, and replied: 'I have no information, we are also looking for the truth in this issue.' Iran International, an opposition channel to the Ayatollah regime that broadcasts in Persian from London, reported Sunday that Qaani's family members confirmed that they have no details about his condition or his whereabouts - and that they are worried about his fate. Earlier Sunday, the New York Times also reported on the disappearance of Qaani and it was claimed that the purpose of his trip to Beirut was to help Hezbollah officials recover from the wave of attacks in Lebanon. A member of the Revolutionary Guards stationed in Beirut said that the silence of the officials in Iran around Qaani has caused panic among the junior members of the Revolutionary Guards.

Terrorist shoots down IDF drone, civilian medic seen in battle: N...	On the eve of the anniversary of the Hamas massacre, the IDF has released exclusive footage from the heroic battles at Kibbutz Re’im and the Sderot police station The IDF Spokesperson's Unit on Sunday released new footage from the battles on October 7, marking the anniversary of the massacre and the outbreak of the war. In footage from Kibbutz Re'im, forces from the 888 Multidimensional Unit are seen fighting terrorists, alongside Border Police forces who joined the battle in the kibbutz. In the dramatic footage, a civilian is shown tending to a soldier during the fighting, while a terrorist can be seen shooting at an IDF drone. The video also captures soldiers taking cover behind houses, engaging with terrorists even as a grenade is thrown at them, and the Border Police forces linking up with IDF soldiers at the kibbutz. Additional footage released by the IDF shows a tank crew from the 401st Brigade of the 162nd Division engaged in the fierce 20-hour battle at the Sderot police station. On October 7, forces from the 162nd Division fought in several areas in southern Israel, including Sderot. One of the toughest battles occurred at the police station, where reservists from the 188th Brigade, engineers from the Southern Command, and officers from the 401st Brigade, led by then-Brigadier General Beni Aharon, fought as a tank team alongside other security forces in a grueling battle against terrorists who had taken over the station. The station was only fully liberated at 3 a.m. after intense exchanges of fire. Southern District Commander Amir Cohen had earlier ordered that the situation be resolved at all costs, even if it meant destroying the station. Around 10 p.m. on October 7, a bulldozer began demolishing part of the station. The following day, bulldozers finished destroying the remainder of the station. IDF Chief of Staff's letter for October 7: 'We will persist in this war – and we will win' On the eve of the war's anniversary, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi sent a letter to IDF soldiers and commanders, stating: 'We are fighting! For a year now, we have been in the midst of a complex, multi-front war, with many significant and extensive achievements. Many challenges still lie ahead. IDF soldiers are deployed and fighting with strength on all fronts without stopping. 'This is a long war, measured not only by capabilities but also by the willpower and perseverance over time. For our enemies – every month, every week, and every day is worse than the one before. Even after the campaign ends, we will need to maintain our achievements, and our enemies will know, beyond any doubt, there will be no revival for those who seek to destroy us. 'A year has passed since October 7th, the day we failed in our mission to protect the citizens of the State of Israel. We are now in the Ten Days of Repentance. October 7th is not only a day of remembrance, but also a call for deep introspection. A recognition of our failures and a commitment to learning from them, while assessing the challenges, both those we have faced and those that still await us. 'We began this year from a difficult and painful point, but we regained our composure, advanced forward to fight, and grew stronger – from this combat, a generation of warriors and commanders has emerged – with unparalleled combat experience and unwavering courage, leading the IDF in one of the most complex wars we have known. People are the key to fulfilling these difficult missions. Alongside us are the reservists, fighting with unparalleled dedication, over a long and challenging period. Each and every one of you is part of this campaign, of our just war. Today, I want to say to you – your commitment, courage, and steadfast spirit demonstrated over the past year are a source of deep pride for every citizen of Israel and for me as your commander. 'A year has passed, and we have defeated the military wing of Hamas, and we continue to fight against the organization’s terrorist capabilities; We have dealt a severe blow to Hezbollah, which has lost all of its senior leadership. We are not stopping – we fight, debrief, learn, and improve. We are taking an offensive, tactical, and proactive approach on all fronts, adapting our defensive strategies on all borders, and understanding that the IDF must be a greater army that takes good care of its people. We are destroying our enemies’ capabilities, and we will ensure that these capabilities are not rebuilt, so that October 7th is never repeated. 'Many challenges still lie ahead in achieving the war’s objectives – defeating the enemy, returning the hostages – an urgent mission of the highest moral value – and returning the civilians to their homes. Let us remember the words of the author of Ecclesiastes: 'Whatever it is in your power to do, do with all your might.' It is in our power, in your power, to take action and to succeed. Remember those who sacrificed their lives for the homeland – the fallen, their families, and the wounded, in both spirit and body, who face the consequences of their heroism every day – thanks to them, we are here. We will continue to walk with them and in their light. 'At the start of the new year, let us remember and remind ourselves and our enemies – this is a war for our right to be a free people in our land, as well as for our values, beliefs, and the righteousness of our path. We will persevere, and we will win. 'Continue with this strength, the eyes of the entire nation are upon us. 'I am with you at every step.'

Rockets fall in Haifa area, no known casualities	After a barrage of fice rockets were fired from Lebanon at the Carmel area, a square in the city was hit directly and a lot of destruction was caused there, also to a nearby garden - with many scattered fragments. Haifa residents report that a rocket fell near the Maxim restaurant, the same restaurant where a suicide attack took place in 2003, during the second intifada, in which 21 people were murdered. According to Magen David Adom, there are no known casualties in the fall.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjohudgkke	2024-10-06T13:57:38-07:00

This is where our daughters met hell': Parents of fallen IDF loo...	The ruined structures, burned fields and memorial established at the base's observation point piece together a puzzle of the horror soldiers went through in the Hamas attack; Fathers and mothers continue to question IDF for its failures a year later An abandoned empty room stands at the entrance to the lookout soldiers’ barracks at the Nahal Oz base. Until almost a year ago it was known as the 'old timers’ room,' where the longer serving lookout soldiers whose IDF release date was imminent lived. The last women to live there before the Hamas attack were the late Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani and the late Staff Sgt. Noa Price. The empty space between its walls serves as a reminder that, on the morning of October 7, it was from there that they left for hell. 'Shahaf’s discharge date was due a few days following that Shabbat, after which Noa would have been the most veteran serving soldier, i.e., the next in line for discharge,' says her mother, Sigal Price. 'She’d already started making preparations and had bought the girls goodbye presents.' 'Nahal Oz is home' reads the bold inscription at the entrance. 'In the beginning, we’d come here to feel closer to her' Price continues. 'We were mainly focused on the shelter where her life ended. It was a desperate attempt to feel closer to her and those awful moments of horrific agony she endured. But as time went by, I wanted to feel closer to the living side of her and the girls. 'I know how important this place was for her, how proud she was of her role but, most importantly, I know how special her friendships with the other girls were. It was her and their second home. It’s important that this place should continue to exist not because they died here, but rather because these special, talented young women lived here.' Fifty-two male and female soldiers, including 15 lookout soldiers, died at Nahal Oz on the morning of October 7 in one of the first and harshest battles fought that day. Seven lookout soldiers were kidnapped from the shelter after hours of being forced to watch their dead friends lie beside them. The late Cpl. Noa Marciano was murdered in Hamas captivity and Ori Megidish was rescued from Gaza by Israeli forces at the end of October. Five lookout soldiers, Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, and Naama Levy have been in captivity for nearly a year. 'What are we doing here?' asks Mira, the late Sgt. Aviv Hajaj’s mother, at the entrance to the mobile shelter. 'Almost a year has gone by, and we can’t take in what happened here. It’s just incomprehensible that this place, the safest for my daughter, became such a horrific place. Aviv served close to 10 months at the outpost and I was never afraid when she was here, and neither was she.' 'Her fear was for the soldiers. That feeling that if anything were to happen to a single solder, it would be on their conscience for the rest of their days. That’s what she said and that’s what the girls felt. That was their worst nightmare – that something would happen on their watch.' At 6:29 a.m., they ran in their pajamas from the barracks to the shelter – a few breachable concrete walls designed to protect them from rockets and mortars. With no guns, the female soldiers had no way of defending themselves. Through the gaps in the ceiling, they could see terrorists paragliding and landing in Israeli territory. For over an hour, they heard the fighting around them and the terrorists drawing closer, and then drawing further away. Some managed to send their families farewell messages. Seven were killed in this shelter safe room: Sgt. Shai Ashram, Sgt. Aviv Hajaj, Cpl. Hadar Miriam Cohan, Cpl. Noa Abramovitch, Cpl. Shirat-Yam Amar, Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani and Staff Sgt Noa Price. Also killed were Capt. Eden Nimri and Staff Sgt Sivan Asraf. No IDF investigation of the outpost battle has yet been published, but the parents have done it themselves. They spent months cross-referencing every morsel of information gathered from soldiers who survived, with video clips uploaded to social media and messages the girls were able to send. On their own, they put together the puzzle of Nahal Oz on October 7. 'They believed they'd be rescued' 'According the video clip we got from 6:45 a.m., Noa was standing with a group of girls,' says Sigal Price pointing at a shelter wall. 'Here were Daniella, Aviv, Shahaf and Shai sitting all together. They passed Shahaf’s phone from one to the next, and each contacted her parents. They started getting messages, apparently from the war room, that there had been an infiltration. Noa wrote that there was a lot of shooting and everyone was frightened. At around 7:30 a.m., she wrote to us that there were terrorists inside the outpost, and that it was very scary. She said there were two female soldiers with guns. She parted from us saying she didn’t know what would happen. I didn’t manage to contact her after that. She wasn’t answering.' Price points at one of the shelter entrances and says: 'This is where the first grenade was thrown from. A female soldier was standing here and she shot the terrorist who was trying to enter. They then threw another grenade, went in and shot the girls.' Mira Hajaj, Aviv’s mother, says: 'We got the last message from her at 7:38 a.m. She wrote: 'Mommy, it’ll be ok, please God. Recite Psalms.' Footage of the lookouts' abduction from Nahal Oz base — viewer discretion advised: Yigal Cohen, Hadar Miriam’s father points to another spot in the shelter. 'She sat here with Ori Megidish and they screamed together. When we went to visit Ori, she told us that Hadar’s last words, a minute before the hell started, were, 'May God protect our soldiers.' Until then, they could hear gunfire, screaming and shouting ‘Allahu Akbar.' But they were still optimistic about being rescued. 'They didn’t believe the terrorists would get in here. She was concerned for the male soldiers. These were her last words. Then the terrorists got in, threw in hand grenades that exploded right there. That’s what killed her. They then confirmed their kills.' A video of the kidnapping from Hamas terrorist’s bodycams filmed in the shelter was released last May. It’s hard to watch. The girls are wounded, cuffed and terrified. 'The girls were kidnapped from this wall,' says Cohen. 'They sat here for hours watching their friends drenched in blood. In the video, as they are led outside, you suddenly hear gunfire break the silence. That’s their confirmed kills. It’s the worst sound we could possibly hear.' Haggai, father of Yael Leibushor, who was killed in the war room says: 'The kidnapped girls were their friends and I’m sure that, if they were here, the most important thing for them now would be to do everything to get them back. So, we’re doing that bigtime. We want them here as quickly as possible.' Dror Ashram, Shai’s father says: 'If I’d have known what was going on here, I’d have been here in five minutes. I keep thinking about her last thoughts. I want to know what she thought. She sent a good friend of hers two messages: ‘You should know that I love you, and that you’re my best friend’ and ‘Take care of my father and mother.' That’s the end of the conversation.' Lookout soldiers’ families appealed to the Supreme Court last month against the IDF, demanding the voice communications and log of their daughter’s final shifts. 'Why am I demanding the recordings? To hear her voice,' says Ashram. 'I have SMS messages on the phone, but I don’t have her voice. I didn’t record my last conversation with her. I want to hear these things. For us, it’s more than just knowing what happened that day.' The soot and scents remain At the shelter entrance, the words, written in pink, 'Look how calmly she walks, as if Gaza isn’t next to her,' now seem like a kick in the stomach. This sentence, that appears in the videos from that morning, came about when the girls saw a woman by the kibbutz fence, a few hundred meters from the border. 'It became their slogan,' Cohen explains. 'It well describes the relationship between the girls and the kibbutzim. They saw everything – what was going on here, and what was going on in Gaza. Their aim was to allow the residents to have lives as normal and peaceful as possible as danger lurked across the fence. They saw the dangers. And yet there was life going on there, and life going on here,' according to Cohen. A few dozen meters from there is the war room building that was supposed to be the safest at the outpost – in which 15 soldiers were killed, including 15 lookout soldiers, Capt. Shir Eilat, Sgt. Leibushor, Sgt. Ronni Eshel, Sgt. Shirl Mor, Sgt. Shira Shohat, Staff Sgt. Yam Glass, Staff Sgt. Adi Landman and CPL Mia Vialovo Polo. Two operations officers, Staff Sgt. Shirel Haim Pour and Sgt. Osher Simha Barzilay were also murdered. Adi was in the shelter at about 6:40 a.m. and went across to the war room,' says her father, Barak Landman. 'She came in here in her pajamas. I wrote her that morning asking if everything was okay.' This is his first visit to the outpost since October 7. Adi was assigned to Nahal Oz the month preceding the massacre after completing commander training and Barak visited her there shortly after that. 'I haven’t been able to come back her since what happened. I didn’t have the strength,' he explains. 'I’ve seen the pictures and the videos, and had a general idea of what it looks like, but seeing the state of the burnt-out war room, all this blackness, the smell, just feeling it – it’s all so distressing.' He's right. You can’t go into the war room without feeling a sense of dread. There’s still a stench in the air, and the total darkness illustrates what the soldiers went through in their final moments. This room that, until that Shabbat, served as the State of Israel’s eyes on the North Gaza, with its smashed screens that were constantly watched by lookout soldiers, has been entirely destroyed. Smoke. Heat. Darkness. There was a six-hour battle between the terrorists who had broken in and the IDF soldiers on site before reinforcements showed up. Four of these soldiers fought to the last bullet from inside the war room. 'They tried breaking down this door to get in,' explains Eyal Eshel, the late Ronni’s father. 'The battle was conducted from here. It’s important to remember the names of the four soldiers who fought and fell here: Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba, Staff Sgt. Daniel Rashed, Lt. Yochai Duchan and Staff Sgt. Itai Ron. We can say which lookout soldier was positioned at which station. They could see everything through the cameras from the early hours of that morning. They reported and directed the forces. The war room operated here until the very last minutes.' At some stage, the terrorists set the war room on fire and the lookout soldiers hid in officer Shir Eilat’s office. 'They were here for a few hours, until everything filled up with smoke,' says Haggai Leibushor. 'At a certain stage, they decided they had to get out because of the heat and the smoke. The electricity went out and there was total darkness. They couldn’t see anything and simply felt around what was familiar to them.' He points at a narrow corridor leading to a tiny window. 'They tried getting out of here toward the bathrooms. Only seven made it. The others choked on the smoke and fell along the way,' he said. 'One of the very worst and most painful parts of this story is that here, behind, there’s a communications room that isn’t burnt-out, with all the servers and computers, but they didn’t have the key to this room,' according to Eshel. 'Just think what would have happened if they had been briefed as to how to get in there in case of emergency. Had that happened, I think we’d be in a very different place right now. One of the soldiers who was here told me that they could hear the girls crying and that their voices then went silent.' Every Saturday at 6:30 a.m. The lookout soldiers’ parents walking around the outpost now have answers to almost every question about what happened during those hours, as well as during the following 11 months. They can’t comprehend, however, how for so many hours no one came to rescue their daughters. 'I think they had faith until the very last moment that, just as they perform their duties, there would be a plan of action, and that they would be rescued any minute,' says Mira Hajaj. 'But no one came.' Sharon Eshel, Ronni’s mother says: 'Coming to the outpost is hell. That’s what they went through that day. That’s what they felt. We’re dealing with endless pain and sadness. Actual physical pain. It’s a longing you can’t deal with. It’s not natural for a parent to lose their child, and the cliché about time healing all wounds is wrong. As time goes by, it gets harder and hurts more. You can’t fight something like this. It will be with us for the rest of our lives. A part of hearts has been torn out.' The parents have set up a memorial to the soldiers a few minutes’ drive from the outpost at a lookout point from which you can see the sector they watched. 'Where we’re now sitting, there were terrorists. Right here,' says Shirat-Yam’s father, Moshe Amar. 'They took our flowers from us.' Shirat-Yam arrived at Nahal Oz two days before October 7. 'Everything we know about the warnings the girls gave, about how they were ignored, we only heard afterward from the parents of girls who’d been there longer. She hadn’t even gotten into her role. If I’d have known one-tenth of what I know today, she wouldn’t have been here at all. I’d have come here physically and taken her away.' Dror Ashram says: 'We, all the families together, set up the memorial. Neither the state nor the army helped us with anything. We chose this spot because of the lookout. This is the right place.' Shahaf Nissani’s mother and sister, Ilana and Sapir, decided not to go to the outpost itself, but rather to meet the others at the memorial. They had visited the outpost on October 6, bringing the girls food for Shahaf’s discharge party that night. 'I haven’t been at the outpost, and I’ll never go in there' says Ilana. 'I want to remember the place and the girls as they were on October 6 – a sunny day with a blue sky and white clouds, and the girls laughing, happy and as alive as can be. I don’t want to remember the place as it is today, like an extermination camp. We’re a year on and it’s still very hard for me. It’s hardest on Shabbat mornings 6:30 a.m.–8:00 a.m. It doesn’t get any easier. Every little thing reminds me of her. I miss her so much it drives me crazy.' 'Dad, get ready. There’s going to be a war’ It's been a year since the October 7 attack and no commission of inquiry has yet been set up to investigate the circumstances, events and failures that led to the disaster. In recent months, the families of the lookout murdered soldiers murdered at Nahal Oz have been fighting for a state commission of inquiry. 'The lookout soldiers knew. Their commanders knew. Everyone knew and warned,' says Noa Marciano’s father, Avi. 'They saw them training, saw a sign reading ‘We’re on our way to you, Nahal Oz.' During Sukkot, over dinner, Noa said to me, ‘Dad, get ready. After the holidays, there’s going to be a war.' And that’s what happened. On the last day of the holidays, the war began.' 'With the few exceptions of those who’ve resigned, the leaders, both military and political, of October 6 are those leading us today. The more time elapses, the more details fall away, evidence disappears, people forget things. As time passes, the harder it is to investigate the truth. There’s a sense that there’s a hot potato going around here. 'Everyone’s passing the buck onto someone else and, in the end, it all dissolves and no one takes responsibility for what happened there. The fact that a state commission of inquiry hasn’t been set up yet burns every day anew. I spend a lot of time at the cemetery. And I talk to Noa each time. I first tell her that I’m sorry. I’m sorry that those who brought about your death, still haven’t started being brought to justice.'

Defense Minister will hold one-day visit in Washington, where he will meet with senior officials in the Pentagon and advisers to the president at the White House Against the backdrop of preparations for an attack on Iran and amid ongoing tensions in the Middle East, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant will go on a one-day visit to the U.S. Gallant will meet with senior officials in the Pentagon and with advisers to the president at the White House . The stated goal is to strengthen cooperation on the 'issues at hand' and to continue the dialogue with the U.S. and its security forces. Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder announced on the X network that Gallant will make an official visit on Wednesday 'to discuss ongoing Middle East security developments' and said that U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin 'looks forward to welcoming the Minister back to Washington DC.' The visit will take place amid severe tensions in the region in anticipation of an Israeli attack against Iran. The IDF promised 'significant action' in response to the extensive ballistic missile attack launched by the Islamic Republic last week. According to reports, Israel has already threatened to 'directly' hit oil or nuclear facilities in Iran if attacked, but the U.S. is exerting pressure to moderate the response - and so far is is not clear how it will look. Meanwhile, the Iranian news agency Mehr reported citing an official in the country that 'all flights have been canceled at Iran's airports from until Monday at 6:00 a.m.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkttc8gjye	2024-10-06T12:11:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/25/Syz9TbddLA/Syz9TbddLA_0_132_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Prominent Israel haters among 2024 Nobel Peace Prize contenders	As the Nobel Prize announcements begin, attention in Jerusalem is drawn to Friday's Peace Prize announcement, which could stir controversy; Top contenders, including UNRWA, the ICC, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres, have sparked tension with Israel For ardent enthusiasts of Nobel Prize announcements, this week is a thrilling time, particularly with the buzz surrounding Friday's revelation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. This announcement holds special significance, coinciding with the anniversary of October 7. This year, speculation swirls around several high-profile nominees, some of which will most definitively raise some Israeli eyebrows. Among these are the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which Israel criticizes and accuses of complicity in the October 7 violence; the International Criminal Court, which is pursuing cases against Israel; and UN Secretary-General António Guterres, recently declared unwelcome by Israel for not strongly condemning Iran's attack and for saying that October 7 'did not happen in a vacuum.' The Nobel Peace Prize committee, known for its unpredictability, might surprise us yet again this year. Historically, the prize has been withheld 19 times, the last time in 1972. Dan Smith, a peace researcher from Stockholm, suggests that perhaps this year the committee might opt not to award the prize to anyone, highlighting the global climate of conflict. With 286 candidates vying for recognition, this year's roster includes prominent figures including Pope Francis and David Attenborough. Speculation also surrounds figures like the late Alexei Navalny and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, though geopolitical complexities make their wins unlikely. Julian Assange, Elon Musk, and former U.S. President Donald Trump are also reportedly in the mix, with the latter recognized for his role in the Abraham Accords. Experts suggest that, given the tumultuous events of 2024 – from the Middle East's ongoing conflicts to the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the humanitarian crisis in Sudan – the prize might go to humanitarian activists aiding those in war-torn regions. UNRWA emerges as a potential candidate for its efforts to assist Palestinians amid the Gaza conflict, although such a choice could be contentious due to allegations of involvement in violence. Meanwhile, the committee might also focus on reinforcing the post-WWII global order, hinting at potential recognition for Guterres or the International Criminal Court. Other nominees reportedly include organizations like EcoPeace and Women Wage Peace, lauded for promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Palestinian and Israeli groups documenting human rights issues also feature among the contenders. Despite the possibility of no award being given, as noted by Dan Smith due to rising military investments worldwide, others argue that the prize remains crucial for advocating peace. Nobel announcements begin on Monday with the prize for medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, and literature throughout the week, culminating with the prize for economics next Monday. The Peace Prize, unique in its Oslo announcement, remains the highlight for many Nobel enthusiasts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjcqpexkyg	2024-10-06T11:16:35-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2022/06/09/HkZm4NkYc/HkZm4NkYc_0_155_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

The Prime Minister's Office reported that Netanyahu 'reiterated Israel's position that given Iran's support for all parts of its axis of terrorism, Israel expects its friends to stand behind it and not impose restrictions that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil.' It was also reported that 'Israel's actions against Hezbollah are creating an opportunity to change the reality in Lebanon in favor of stability, security and peace in the entire region.' The two leaders agreed to advance dialogue on the issue during the visit of the French Foreign Minister, who is scheduled to come to Israel, according to the PMO statement. Later, the Elysee Palace also published a statement about the telephone conversation between the two leaders, and it was described by Paris as an 'honest' conversation. Macron, it was reported, told Netanyahu that 'arms shipments, extending the war in Gaza and extending it to Lebanon' will not provide Israel with the security it desires. Macro also told Netanyahu that it was necessary to reach a cease-fire immediately. 'We must immediately take decisive action that will allow us to advance the political solutions that are necessary for the security of Israel and everyone in the Middle East,' Macron reportedly said. The conversation between Netanyahu and Macron comes after the public exchange between the two men Saturday night . Netanyahu, who was enraged at Macron's call for an arms embargo, published a videotaped statement in which he said his 'shame will continue long after the war is won.' In the video, Netanyahu said in comments directed at Macron that Israel is fighting on seven fronts against the enemies of civilization, and 'yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them. Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace! Israel will win with or without their support.' An official at the Elysee Palace responded Saturday night to Netanyahu's words and said: 'Macron is committed to Israel's security and demonstrates it. France mobilized its military resources in the face of the Iranian attack on October 1, as it had already done in April. The French president personally told the Iranian president about his attachment to Israel's security. He reiterated that France will not allow Iran or any of its representatives to attack Israel.' According to him, Macron 'believes that an immediate cease-fire is necessary in Gaza as in Lebanon, in order to curb the increase in violence, release the hostages, protect the populations and find political solutions necessary for the security of Israel and everyone in the Middle East. In this context, the president calls for an end to the export of weapons intended for use in Gaza. We must return to diplomatic solutions. France is an unwavering friend of Israel. Netanyahu's words are exaggerated and not related to friendship between France and Israel.' Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot is on a four-day trip to the Middle East. Paris is seeking to play a role in reviving diplomatic efforts as the Gaza war has widened to Lebanon. Government officials were not surprised by Macron's words, which are a direct continuation of the French line, which already supported the non-binding resolution initiated by the Palestinians at the UN General Assembly on September 18, which called for the imposition of an arms embargo on Israel. France has not supplied weapons or military systems to Israel since the beginning of the war, and the weapons it provided in the past were also marginal and insignificant to the Israeli fighting effort. In the last decade, France annually exported military equipment to Israel amounting to 20 million euros. This is a drop in the ocean, considering the fact that France is in second place in the world in defense exports after the U.S. and its defense exports were estimated at 27 billion euros in 2022. Most of the things sold before the war were electronic components such as infrared sights and thermal sensors. About 700 defense licenses were granted for export to Israel per year.

Harris reiterates support for Gaza cease-fire as conflict escalat...	Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Washington will continue to pressure Israel and other players in the Middle East to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza even as advocates say that the United States has not thus far used its leverage over its ally. In an interview with CBS news show '60 Minutes,' Harris said that diplomatic work with Israel is 'an ongoing pursuit,' according to a clip released on Sunday. Harris sidestepped a question in the interview on whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a 'real close ally.' 'I think with all due respect the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people and the answer to that question is yes,' Harris said. Harris reiterated Washington's position to support Israel's right to self defense against Iran and Iran-backed terror groups like Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzacexk1x	2024-10-06T09:30:50-07:00	
UNICEF chief warns Gaza kids face 'post-generational challenges'	After a year of military operations between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the head of UNICEF warned that children there will face 'post-generational challenges' due to the conflict. 'If you look at Gaza really through the eyes of a child, it is a hellscape,' UNICEF's executive director Catherine Russell told CBS News' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, noting the toll of family deaths and displacements, as well as ongoing lack of food and clean water. 'They are so traumatized by what's happening,' Russell said of the kids. 'Even if we can get more supplies in there, the trauma that these children are suffering is going to have lifetime and even post-generational challenges for them.' Russell said it remains 'very dangerous' to move humanitarian aid in Gaza. However, she credited her organization with a 'success story' of vaccinating thousands of children for polio in the area. On the latest Israeli military operations in Lebanon targeting Iran-backed group Hezbollah, the UNICEF director said 'the speed and intensity is shocking' and that 'it makes it challenging for us' to reach the approximately 1 million displaced people there.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/synzc4gy1x	2024-10-06T09:28:26-07:00	
Iran: We have a counter-response ready if Israel attacks	In response to potential Israeli action, Tehran has prepared its defensive strategy, promising a swift counterattack while Israel considers direct strikes on Iranian facilities as Biden administration pleads for moderation In response to potential Israeli military actions within Iran's borders, Tehran has reportedly finalized a counter-response strategy, as revealed by Iranian media on Sunday, citing a military source. The source informed the Tasnim News Agency that 'the necessary response plan for any possible Zionist action is fully prepared. If Israel acts, the Iranian counterattack will be executed.' The Israel Defense Forces have vowed a 'significant response' to the extensive ballistic missile attack launched by the Islamic Republic last week. Reports suggest Israel has threatened to directly target Iranian oil or nuclear facilities if provoked, although the United States is applying pressure to temper the response, leaving the specifics of the Israeli action unclear. The military source speaking to the Iranian news agency claimed that'Tehran has a list of numerous Israeli targets,' and highlighted that 'the operation demonstrates our capability to destroy any point we choose.' Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday visited the Nevatim Air Force Base, which sustained damage during the attack. His office reported that he received a briefing from the base commander, Brigadier General Yotam Sigler, regarding squadron operations in combat zones, and emphasized the need to bolster preparedness for potential offensive operations in additional theaters. 'The actions of the Air Force, both in defense and offense, are vital to the safety of Israeli citizens,' Gallant stated in discussions with pilots, air crews and ground teams. 'The Iranians have not even scratched the capabilities of the Air Force; no squadron has been harmed, no aircraft damaged, no runway rendered unusable, and there is no disruption to our operational continuity. Anyone believing that attempting to harm Israel will deter us from responding should observe developments in Gaza and Beirut.' Gallant subtly referenced an Israeli response to the missile attack, stating: 'We are strong in both defense and offense, and we will manifest this strength in the manner we choose, at the time we choose, and in the place we choose. This is not merely a statement or a direction for us, but an actionable plan. You know what to do, we know what to do and, ultimately, we will ensure victory in this conflict, secure the return of hostages, and bring Northern residents back to their homes with significant deterrence in place, as clearly demonstrated over the past month.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy00u6ge1jx	2024-10-06T09:21:46-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/06/S1kGmyeJyg/S1kGmyeJyg_1_87_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Tamar's son fell in Lebanon; her husband was killed in a terror a...	Thousands paid their final respects to Captain Harel Ettinger of Eli, who fell while fighting in the Egoz unit; 'Your dedication and unwavering sense of purpose were the magic you shared with Dad, I'm sure you're catching up now,' his sister said in her eulogy Thousands, including friends and family, gathered Sunday at the Eli cemetery for the funeral of Captain Harel Ettinger, a commander in the Egoz unit of the IDF Commando Brigade, who fell on the eve of Rosh Hashana during a heroic battle fought by his unit in southern Lebanon. His sister, Efrat, said in her eulogy: 'How can you condense a life into a single page? How can you write anything about you? My soul is bound to yours. To me, you are coming back in a week or two. I’m waiting for you. Every time you called from some remote outpost with your soldiers and said, 'Send me recipes,' and you’d share a picture of some matbucha you’d made, I was amazed. When we were kids, you listened to songs about this land and the heroes who fought for it. We teased you, but it was in your heart. Whenever I wanted to set you up on a date with someone, you would say: 'I’m married to the army.'' Captain Ettinger's father, Rabbi Achiad Ettinger was killed in a terrorist attack at the Ariel junction in the West Bank in March 2019. The rabbi fired at the terrorist after stopping his car and getting out, saving many civilians at the junction. 'Your dedication and determination were the source of both your and Dad's strength,' Efrat said. 'What pride you must have up there – Dad must be beaming with joy, and now you’re catching up. You’re telling him all about our family and how we grew up.' 'Harel, my beloved child, pure, humble and brave. God chose both your father and you, and He chose us, too, because He knows we have the strength, Harel’s mother, Tamar said. 'He gave, gives and will continue to give us strength, joy and life. I am returning to You the pure soul You entrusted to Achiad and me 23 years ago. I’m returning the child You placed in my hands,' she said. 'I did my best to raise him with love and joy as much as I knew how, but I ask You, Master of the Universe, for redemption, mercy and kindness – that we may see Your compassion.' Lieutenant Colonel A., commander of the Egoz unit, addressed the Ettinger family: 'We stand here today, stunned, struggling to come to terms with this tremendous loss. Harel fought a heroic battle in southern Lebanon, protecting his homeland, his soldiers, and his comrades with his own body. Harel, you’ve joined your father, who also rushed to confront terrorists five and a half years ago, not far from here.' Regarding the heroic battle, Lt. Col. A. recounted: 'When you heard there was fighting on the radio, you charged toward the conflict, leading your men. When you realized your comrades were in danger, you came to me and said, ‘I’m going to outflank them, take out the terrorists, and save my friends.’ You didn’t hesitate for a moment. You fought like a hero, risking your life out of true camaraderie and commitment to defending the homeland. In that flanking maneuver, you broke the terrorists’ position and prevented further casualties and losses. We will carry on your legacy, which will continue to inspire us all.' Ido, one of Captain Ettinger’s team members, also paid tribute: 'My dear brother, from the moment we first met, I knew I was standing before someone special. For the first time in my life, I understood how it’s possible to be the best and still be humble and modest. You finished the officer’s course in the midst of the war, and from the very beginning, your soldiers admired you. It always bothered you that you weren’t fighting on the front lines – you told me, ‘Brother, I’m so happy that finally I’m doing something’ – and then you went into battle.'

A year into war, the shocking civilian toll since October 7 revea...	On eve of Hamas massacre's first anniversary, National Insurance Institute data shows 885 civilians, including 53 minors and 72 foreign nationals, killed, 70,000 wounded and 1,000 orphaned; of 101 hostages in Gaza, 73 are civilians, 52 believed to be alive One year after the October 7 massacre and the onset of war, Israel’s National Insurance Institute reported Sunday that 885 civilians were killed in terror attacks over the past year. These figures exclude security forces, who are handled by the Defense Ministry. Of the 885 victims, 581 were men, 304 were women, 72 were foreign nationals and 53 were under the age of 18. The report revealed that during the war year, four infants and toddlers aged 0-3 were killed, as well as two children aged 3-5, three children aged 5-8, nine children aged 8-12, eight adolescents aged 12-14 and 27 teenagers aged 14-18. The war left 921 people orphaned, including 291 minors, and 226 individuals widowed, with 47 men and 179 women losing their spouses. Additionally, 1,078 parents became bereaved, including 581 mothers and 498 fathers. Among them, 120 have lost all their children. A total of 1,880 civilians lost siblings, including 998 men and 882 women. Twelve families experienced multiple losses (not including families that have been wiped out completely). Following the October 7 massacre, 217 civilians were kidnapped to Gaza (not including security forces), with 143 civilians returned so far. Among them, 116 were released alive (92 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals), while 27 were returned as deceased. Currently, 74 civilians remain held hostage, including 52 believed to be alive and 22 presumed dead. In total, 101 hostages are in Gaza, including those from the security forces, as well as Russian Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov who has been held in Iraq by pro-Iranian militias since March 2023. The National Insurance Institute also reported that over 70,000 civilians have been treated as victims of terrorism since the war began. Of the total victims this year, 647 were foreign nationals affected by the October 7 attack in southern Israel. More than 12,700 have applied for permanent disability benefits, with 11,760 cases based on psychological trauma. Over the past year, the institute paid more than NIS 2.4 billion ($630 million) in compensation and support for bereaved families and terror victims. The government has also distributed financial aid to residents in northern and southern Israel affected by the conflict, totaling NIS 3.5 billion ($920 million). 'We mourn the lives cruelly taken by a merciless enemy, and we will continue to support the victims of terror. We will not rest until all hostages are returned home,' Labor Minister Yoav Ben-Tzur said on the tragic passing year. 'Our staff works tirelessly to assist bereaved families, terror victims, hostages and the displaced, while continuing our regular services such as nursing care, unemployment benefits and elderly pensions. We see this work as a public mission of the highest order,' said National Insurance Institute Acting Director Zvika Cohen.

Biden's statement Israel shouldn't bomb Iran's oil and nuclear f...	Speaking to Ynet, Mike Evans, one of the world's prominent Evangelical leaders and Trump advisor, pans US president for lack of 'moral clarity' as 'Israel is facing an existential threat' Mike Evans, one of the world's prominent Evangelical leaders and a staunch supporter of Israel, said in a recent interview with Ynet that 'Israel is facing an existential threat. President Biden's statement to Israel that it shouldn't bomb Iran's oil and nuclear facilities is disgraceful.' His remarks came ahead of a solidarity event marking one year since the October 7 attack, which will take place on Sunday at the Friends of Zion Museum in Jerusalem and will be broadcast to millions of viewers on social media. Evangelical leaders, representing a quarter of a billion Evangelicals worldwide, including 70 million in the U.S., will participate in the event in Jerusalem. 'This is the largest solidarity event in the history of the State of Israel,' Evans said. Among the participants will be leaders from the two largest Evangelical denominations: the Southern Baptist Convention and the Assemblies of God. Evans, considered to be an advisor to former U.S. president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Evangelical matters, said, 'Evangelicals stand behind the State of Israel. Never in Israel's history has there been a time when a quarter of a billion Evangelicals are united behind it.' 'Evangelicals believe in the Ten Commandments, not the Ten Suggestions. In other words, they believe in moral clarity and in good versus evil—they believe Israel represents good and Iran represents evil. It's a battle between light and darkness,' he stressed. Evans also addressed U.S. President Joe Biden’s words, saying, 'It's truly disgraceful. It's like George Bush sending a message to Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks that America shouldn't attack him in certain areas. It's completely wrong.' 'Friends of Zion around the world are committed to fighting these battles alongside Israel. The vast majority of Zionists in the world aren't Jewish, yet they stand united, unconditionally, with the Jewish people in Israel,' Evans added. On Friday, Biden addressed Israel's expected response to the Iranian missile attack saying, 'If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.' Trump later said he believed Israel should strike Iran's nuclear facilities. 'I think he's [Biden] got that wrong, isn't that the one you're supposed to hit? It's the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons. When they asked him that question the answer should have been, 'Hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.''

Police spokesperson Aryeh Doron said that searches are ongoing for potential accomplices. 'We urge anyone in the area of the central bus station who doesn’t need to be there to stay away until we conclude our sweeps and secure the area. If anyone spots a suspicious vehicle or individual, they should call 100,' he added. 'It's too early for conclusions; we are still in the midst of the incident.'

UN chief in letter to Netanyahu: UNRWA is in danger	Antonio Guterres in urgent appeal to prime minister asks to repel proposed bill that would remove immunity and benefits organization receives in Israel UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sent an urgent letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during Rosh Hashana expressing his deep concern about legislation in the Knesset targeting UNRWA. He warned that if the legislation passes, UNRWA will be unable to continue operating and would then need to raise the issue at the UN General Assembly. The bill, which severs Israel's ties with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), is expected to be approved on Sunday by the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. According to the proposed law, all government representatives would be prohibited from engaging with UNRWA. This means that the foreign and interior ministries would not be able to issue entry visas for UNRWA staff and customs officials won’t process goods imported by the agency. Tax benefits granted to the organization would be revoked. The Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is now discussing the proposed law and representatives from the National Security Council (NSC) have requested that the details be classified. Some Knesset members, however, oppose the proposed bill. The bill stipulates that ties with UNRWA will officially cease starting on Monday, and the agency will lose its diplomatic status and immunity, which it has enjoyed since 1967. Another clause in the bill specifies that UNRWA employees involved in Hamas’ October 7 attack won’t enjoy diplomatic immunity under Israeli law, meaning they could be prosecuted for their crimes. In his letter to Netanyahu, Guterres wrote, 'It’s deeply concerning that legislation is being considered in a member state of the United Nations that would fundamentally contradict the principles of the UN Charter.' 'The draft legislation currently under discussion in the Knesset, if passed, could prevent UNRWA from continuing its operations in the occupied Palestinian territories, thereby denying Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank the essential aid and protection that UNRWA has provided them since 1949,' he said. 'UNRWA operates in nearly 400 schools and more than 65 health clinics in the occupied Palestinian territories, providing education to more than 350,000 children and over 5 million medical consultations annually. UNRWA also provides vital assistance to the poor and social services,' Guterres wrote. 'Amid the current crisis in Gaza, UNRWA is the backbone of the UN’s humanitarian organization, offering lifesaving aid, shelter and support to the vast majority of Gaza’s nearly 2.3 million residents, all of whom are affected by the conflict.' 'Given the gravity of the matter, I will need to bring it to the attention of the General Assembly if the draft legislation is adopted,' Guterres explained. 'This would be a deeply concerning development in the UN's history, where a member state passes legislation requiring no contact between its authorities and a United Nations entity, in this case, UNRWA. It’s impossible to separate UNRWA from the UN. It is an integral part of it.' In his letter, Guterres emphasized that UNRWA's privileges and immunities would continue to apply to its staff, regardless of the legislation passed by the Knesset. 'I hope it will be possible for your government to take the necessary steps to avoid the adoption of this legislation,' he concluded. In response to the letter, Israel's Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said, 'The State of Israel has provided the UN with information on over 100 UNRWA employees who participated in the October 7 massacre. The UN’s own internal investigation determined that some UNRWA employees are Hamas terrorists.' 'UNRWA has failed both professionally — in building educational and economic infrastructure — and morally, by allowing free access for Hamas terrorists to use its resources to carry out a barbaric and brutal massacre. The UN would do better to focus its efforts on severing UNRWA’s ties with Hamas, rather than worrying about visas and tax benefits for terrorists. UNRWA has become a part of Hamas and it’s time the UN recognizes that,' he added.

Under massive fire: IDF’s tactical play in Jabaliya	Numerous terrorists eliminated in surprise overnight northern Gaza operation, as forces reinforced in anticipation of potential attacks on troops in Gaza or rocket fire, possibly reaching central Israel, on October 7 anniversary The IDF launched an intense overnight raid on Jabaliya in northern Gaza, striking from two directions and inflicting heavy casualties on terrorist, the IDF reported on Sunday. The operation, led by the 162nd Division, began late Saturday after troops redeployed from the Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian border to northern Gaza, with the military indicating it would last for several days. 'The operation will continue as long as necessary to systematically destroy terrorist infrastructure,' the IDF said, adding that it has drawn and implemented lessons learned from the execution of six hostages in Rafah by Hamas terrorists after Israeli forces approached their location. In Rafah, where the 162nd Division handed control to Gaza Division forces, operations to locate and destroy terror tunnels continue. Meanwhile, the Netzarim Corridor has been expanded toward Wadi Gaza to the south and the southern neighborhoods of Gaza City to the north. 'We are in a strong position to act against Hezbollah with forces we have shifted from the south while simultaneously striking in Gaza,' the IDF said. 'Decisions will need to be made regarding an alternative to Hamas governance, as Hamas' civilian authority is weakened and its control capabilities are elsewhere.' Ahead of the anniversary of the October 7 attack, Southern Command has bolstered its forces to reinforce security amid concerns of possible terror attacks. The military warned of potential rocket fire or assaults from Gaza-based terrorist groups. 'Our forces are operating in the north, south and center of Gaza, conducting numerous strikes and eliminating terrorists,' Southern Command head Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman said. 'Southern Command is on high alert for the coming days.' Palestinian media reported widespread strikes in the Jabaliya area, while the IDF announced a targeted airstrike on a Hamas complex in the city. According to the military, air force jets struck Hamas terrorists operating from a command and control center previously used as a UNRWA facility. 'The command center was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute attacks against IDF forces and Israel,' the IDF said, noting that precautions were taken to minimize civilian harm, including the use of precision munitions and aerial surveillance. The IDF confirmed that the 162nd Division's troops encircled Jabaliya and are actively engaging in operations to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Prior to and during the raid, the Air Force conducted multiple strikes on military targets, including weapons depots, underground facilities and terrorist cells. Meanwhile, Hamas' Interior Ministry urged residents of northern Gaza to stay in their homes, defying Israeli warnings to evacuate to the south.

Trojan horse inside Hezbollah: New details on Lebanon pager attac...	New report sheds light on explosions of thousands of communications devices held by Hezbollah which detonated in an operation attributed to Israel's Mossad The Washington Post published a report Sunday overnight providing more details into the pager attack in Lebanon against Hezbollah which is attributed to Israel. 'Also invisible was Mossad’s remote access to the devices. An electronic signal from the intelligence service could trigger the explosion of thousands of the devices at once,' the report read. The new details of the operation attributed to the Mossad were gathered from interviews conducted by the outlet with Israeli, American and Arab security officials, politicians and diplomats briefed on the events and official Lebanese sources and individuals close to Hezbollah. According to one source, Hezbollah’s terrorists needed to press two buttons simultaneously to read the encrypted message. 'In practice,' the source noted, 'this meant using both hands.' He added that in the explosion triggered by reading the message, the pager holders would almost certainly 'wound both their hands,' and thus 'would be incapable to fight.' The sources described a years-long plan conceived at Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, ultimately involving a team of agents and operational partners from various countries, many of whom were unaware of the larger mission. According to the outlet, the operation sparked a debate between Israel's security officials. A political source summarized the anxiety over the operation with a sarcastic remark during a meeting with Mossad officials: 'We cannot make a strategic decision such as an escalation in Lebanon while counting on a toy,' referring to the pagers. Reportedly, Israeli decision-makers weren’t aware of the plan until September 12, five days before it was carried out. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then convened a meeting with intelligence officials, who revealed the preparations. Other attendees were concerned about approving the Mossad’s plan, fearing it could lead to full-scale war. Some noted that 'there were some risks,' but intelligence officers warned that Hezbollah, in light of the rising tensions, might take additional precautions and discover the explosives. The Mossad saw the chance to carry out 'something more intense,' according to The Washington Post. The devices were designed by the Mossad and assembled in Israel. The Israeli agency had worked to infiltrate Hezbollah using electronic surveillance and human informants for years, the Washington Post reported. Over time, Hezbollah leaders became concerned about their vulnerability to Israeli surveillance and cyberattacks, fearing even ordinary phones could be used for eavesdropping and monitoring under Israeli control. As a result, the idea emerged in Israel to create a type of communication device that would serve as a 'Trojan horse,' a political source told the outlet. Hezbollah sought a cyberattack-resistant electronic network, and the Mossad devised two plans that would lead the terror organization to acquire communication devices that seemed perfect for the job — equipment designed by the intelligence agency and assembled in Israel. As part of the operation’s first phase, the booby-trapped communication devices began arriving in Lebanon via the Mossad nearly a decade ago, in 2015. These portable two-way radios contained relatively large battery packs, hidden explosives and a transmission system that gave Israel full access to Hezbollah's communications. Sources interviewed by the newspaper said Israel was content with eavesdropping on Hezbollah for nine years, while maintaining the ability to turn the radios into bombs in a future crisis. But then a new opportunity arose with a new product: a small pager equipped with powerful explosives. Since the terror organization’s leaders were cautious about the possibility of sabotage in the radios they purchased, the pagers couldn't be manufactured in Israel, the U.S., or any of Jerusalem's allies. In 2023, Hezbollah began receiving offers to purchase large quantities of communication devices from Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company known for its trademark and global product line which had no ties to Israeli or Jewish interests. According to the sources, the Taiwanese company was unaware of the plan. The offer came through a sales representative with ties to Gold Apollo, who was trusted by Hezbollah. This sales representative, whose identity and country of origin officials refused to disclose, was a former sales representative for the Taiwanese company in the Middle East. She later started her own company and received a license to sell pagers under the Apollo brand. At some point in 2023, she offered Hezbollah a deal on one of her company’s products, the reliable AR-924 device. 'She was the one in touch with Hezbollah, and explained to them why the bigger pager with the larger battery was better than the original model,' an Israeli official briefed on the operation's details told the outlet. According to him, one of the key selling points of the AR-924 was that it was 'possible to charge with a cable. And the batteries were longer lasting.'

Doron Katz Asher shares joyful news on Instagram, calling it her 'triumph'; former Hamas captive, freed after 48 days with her daughters, previously joked that since her return, her partner has agreed to everything, including having more children Doron Katz Asher, who was taken hostage by Hamas with her daughters during the October 7 massacre and later released as part of a hostage-prisoner exchange in November, announced she is expecting a baby, calling it her 'true triumph' in a heartfelt Instagram post. Katz Asher, who was released after 48 days in captivity, shared the emotional news, writing, 'Bringing new life, a year after nearly losing my own, is the greatest gift for the new year. It’s my ray of light in the darkness.' The 34-year-old accountant from central Israel was visiting her mother at Kibbutz Nir Oz with her daughters, Raz, 5, and Aviv, 3, when the attack began. Her mother was killed, likely by friendly fire, while her brother was murdered by terrorists, and his body was taken to Gaza. Her mother's partner, Gadi Moses, was also taken hostage and remains in Hamas captivity. Reflecting on her return, Katz Asher previously shared in a social media post, 'What is it like to come back from captivity with two little girls, you ask? It means Yoni [her partner] agrees to everything I ask,' she joked, adding that he had agreed to have more children, 'as many as I want.'

France says Netanyahu overreacts to Marcon on arms embargo	Netanyahu calls Macron's call for a halt to arms sales a disgrace and says countries that should stand by Israel and do not should be ashamed as Israel is protecting them as well Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response to a French arms embargo on Israel is excessive, the Elysee Palace said late on Saturday. Netanyahu called the call to halt arms sales a 'disgrace,' after French President Emmanuel Macron advocated for the move. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,' Macron told broadcaster France Inter. In a message to Macron, Netanyahu said all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel in its fight against Iran and its proxies. 'Shame on you,' he said. Netanyahu said with or without the help of these countries, Israel will win the battle against terrorists, for its sake and the sake of the world. A French official said Macron was committed to Israel's security and has shown that. He said France used its military assets to thwart Iran's attack on Israel last week as it had done when Iran struck Israel in April, adding the French president personally told Iran's president that his country would not allow Iran or its proxies to attack Israel. The official said Macron believes that for the sake of Israel's security and that of everyone in the Middle East there must be an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon, a release of the hostages held by Hamas and protection for civilians. France is an unwavering friend to Israel and Netanyahu's comments are excessive and disconnected from the friendship between the two nations, he added. Macron's comments have no real-world significance because France has not supplied arms to Israel since the war began and past weapons sales have been minimal to the war effort. France's military exports to Israel totaled some 20 million euros over the past decade, a drop in the ocean compared to the U.S. military aid, which is estimated to have been 27 billion euros in 2022. French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said in March that French military exports to Israel only include mechanical components including to the Iron Dome missile defense system, through third-party vendors while pro-Palestinian groups in France claimed optic components for drones were also delivered. Officials involved in Israeli-France relations said Macron's comments came amid political turmoil in Paris after the last elections increased the parliamentary power of the far-left which launched an effort to oust Macron from office. Macron wants to be seen as an advocate for the Palestinian struggle and does not want far-left politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon to be the only one representing it. Sources in Jerusalem said France wants to be a central player in Lebanon and is joining the growing anti-Israel sentiment. As the only European permanent member of the UN Security Council, it believes it has a role to play in the European Union and the West. It recognizes the current American weakness, ahead of the presidential elections next month, and believes it is time to show initiative. After his statement, Macron will find it hard to gain Israel's trust, although no none in Jerusalem will say so officially.

Countdown to retaliation: Key Iranian targets in Israel’s crossha...	New report outlines potential targets Jerusalem may strike in Iran, focusing on country's military capabilities, economic infrastructure and nuclear program As war rages in Israel against Hamas and Hezbollah, global attention has shifted to Jerusalem's potential retaliation against Iran after the country's largest-ever ballistic missile strike on Israeli territory. But which possible targets is Israel likely to target in the event of such an attack? According to NBC, the Israeli Air Force's technological superiority, combined with Iran's relatively weak air defense, could enable Israel to strike a broad array of sites across the Islamic Republic. Military targets Potential targets range from military bases and intelligence facilities to oil refineries and even nuclear sites. NBC also assessed that Israel could receive U.S. intelligence support, leveraging satellite data and other sources to enhance precision. 'There are so many things they can hit, and they’re going to be able to hit all those with great effectiveness. Iran’s not going to be able to stop them,' a former senior U.S. military source familiar with the region told the network. However, the report stressed that Israel would need to consider potential Iranian retaliation, which could include attacks on nearby U.S. military bases across the region. The most probable targets, NBC suggested, are those linked to Iran's missile strike on Israel, such as command centers, missile launch sites and key military figures involved in Iran's ballistic missile program. The report also suggested Israeli strikes could extend to intelligence centers, often located in military bases, in response to Iran's stated attempt to strike the Mossad headquarters. Israeli strikes could also extend to air defense bases and drone facilities to safeguard Israeli fighter jets during any operation. Energy production facilities In addition to military targets, energy production facilities are also in Israel's potential crosshairs. A primary target could be the Persian Gulf Star oil refinery in Bandar Abbas, which supplies 40% of Iran's oil consumption. Striking this refinery could severely cripple Iran's economy, already burdened by U.S. sanctions. Other targets might include petrochemical plants, power stations and key oil export terminals, such as the Kharg Island terminal, through which 90% of Iran’s oil exports pass. Estimates suggest Iran can export up to 7 million barrels of oil daily through Kharg, though official reports from Iran claim lower numbers. Tehran's recent decision to move some of the oil tankers there suggests it is likely preparing for a potential attack on its oil infrastructure. A senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that Israeli energy infrastructure would be a primary target in response. Nuclear facilities Despite U.S. President Joe Biden’s opposition to an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, speculation remains about whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may opt to target these key sites. The Fordow and Natanz uranium enrichment facilities, both heavily fortified underground, and other nuclear-related sites, such as the Isfahan centrifuge factory and a reactor in Khondab, could be on Israel’s radar. Mossad has been linked to several sabotage actions in Iran in recent years, such as the powerful explosion in the Natanz facility in 2021. Still, executing a large-scale attack on these sites would be far more challenging and complex. Iran has several other sites related to its nuclear program, including a large facility outside Isfahan responsible for various activities, such as producing centrifuge parts and uranium metal — a material that could be used to build the core of a nuclear bomb. Additional potential targets include a partially built heavy water reactor plant in Khondab and research centers in Tehran.

IDF thwarts drone strike off coast	Military says two drones coming from the north are shot down by a naval vessel and one by the Air Force; IDF also says it struck Hezbollah targets in Beirut's Dahieh sector overnight hitting weapons storage facilities after warning civilians to leave The IDF said on Sunday that the Navy intercepted two UAVs launched from the north, in the northern Mediterranean. 'In addition, a UAV launched from the East was intercepted by the IAF off the coast of the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.' The military said no sirens were activated and no injuries were reported. Earlier a barrage of some 40 rockets targeted the northern city of Kiryat Shmona while the IDF was reported to launch strikes on Beirut's Dahieh quarter, the Hezbollah stronghold in the city. The military said its Air Force conducted numerous targeted strikes against Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and terror infrastructure after steps were taken to prevent civilian casualties, including calls to evacuate. At least eight strikes rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late on Saturday including close to the airport. Massive consecutive strikes hit the Dahieh, for 30 minutes, visible from several kilometers away eyewitnesses told Reuters. The strikes came after days of bombing by Israel of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city's international airport that was reported to have targeted him.

International investigation: Iran used criminals and drug dealers...	Joint investigation reveals how Iran operated terror cells on European soil using figures from the criminal underworld to try and orchestrate massive attacks Late last year, Roey – an Israeli citizen who lives and works in France – received a terrifying message from local security officials: An Iranian-directed terror cell plans to kill you. The French authorities received the warning from what they referred to as 'a foreign intelligence service' and, according to a subsequent report in the German media, it was none other than the Israeli Mossad that had alerted a number of intelligence agencies across Europe. The Mossad itself declined to confirm the report, responding to Shomrim’s request for comment by saying that 'intelligence agencies are constantly engaged in dialogue and cooperation to deal with threats.' In the months that followed, Roey received several more such alerts and French authorities even suggested that he leave the country. He took these warnings with the utmost seriousness. He and his wife spent much of the next few months in Israel and, during the short periods when they had to be in France, they moved between no fewer than six different apartments. Even though they took extraordinary precautions to remain safe, the stress was intense. In April this year, therefore, Roey’s wife contacted the DGSI – France’s internal security agency and the equivalent of Israel’s Shin Bet – to report an untoward incident. She told the French authorities that someone claiming to be a courier rang at the intercom of the family apartment. Since she was not expecting a delivery, she did not open the door – but she did manage to capture images of the individual on the intercom camera. The DGSI looked into the incident and concluded that the individual in question was probably a courier after all. A few days later, members of the terror cell were arrested by French authorities. Documents and testimony regarding the cell’s operations, which are being revealed here for the first time, provide a rare glimpse into the workings of Iranian terrors cell in Europe which use figures from the criminal underworld: low- and high-ranking members of the local criminal class, gangs, drug smugglers, former convicts and others. This is not a 'symbolic' modus operandi which takes advantage of frustrated and disenfranchised immigrants. Rather, these cells are planning and carrying out attacks and assassinations on a large scale. The cell that was arrested in France also planned to kill three other Israelis who work alongside Roey and three senior members of the Jewish community in Germany, in addition to being dispatched to set fire to buildings in the south of France belonging to Israeli-owned companies. In order to maintain a degree of separation from the terror cells it operates in Europe and to ensure plausible deniability, there is no direct contact between Tehran and members of the cells. In the case of the recently detained French cell, instructions on where and when to carry out attacks were relayed via international networks of criminals and drug smugglers. The investigation is based on documents from various European intelligence agencies obtained by independent French investigative online newspaper Mediapart, which were then analyzed by the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) organization and journalists from nine outlets, including Mediapart, Der Spiegel in Germany, Spanish outlet Infolibre and organizations from the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Belgium. Shomrim’s Daniel Dolev was the Israeli partner in the project. According to an internal document, the French security establishment believes that, after they took measures to ensure the safety of Roey and his family, the cell decided to move on and focus on its next targets. Roey – whose real name, like those of the cell’s other targets, is not being published for security reasons – has not responded to requests for comment sent to him via several channels. The owner of the company that employed Roey, a former member of the security services, told Shomrim that he had not been contacted by any officials on the matter. 'I have no idea what you are talking about,' he said. 'If someone were to tell me that it’s real, it would be very scary – but apart from that I don’t feel that way.' A decade of collaboration with the underworld Iran’s use of members of the criminal underworld and drug deals to carry out acts of terror is nothing new. In May, the Mossad revealed that a terror cell had been operating in Europe under the leadership of Rawa Majid, known as 'the Kurdish Fox,' who also spearheaded a Swedish organized crime ring called Foxtrot. According to various reports in Israel, which cited Mossad officials, Majid fled from Turkey to Iran, where he was recruited after being arrested by Iranian police. Israeli security officials told Shomrim that the Swedish cell and the French cell were activated separately and that there was no communication between them. The first evidence that Iran was using criminals in Europe emerged a decade ago. The main goal of the Islamic Republic was to assassinate members of the exiled Iranian opposition, as well as Jewish and/or Israeli targets. Since 2015, around 20 such attempts have been uncovered (see map). One of the first successful assassination came in December 2015, when Mohammad-Reza Kolahi Samadi, an activist in the People’s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) who was convicted of planting a bomb at the Tehran headquarters of the Islamic Republican Party that killed more than 70 officials in 1981 – and had been in living in the Netherlands under an assumed identity ever since. He was murdered by local criminals, aided by Dutch and Belgian drug-smuggling gangs. 'When it comes to exiled opposition figures, the Iranians have been running amok – unhindered and for years,' says Yoram Schweitzer, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies and the director of its Research Program: Terrorism and Low-Intensity Conflict. 'When it comes to Israelis, there are periods when there is more intense activity. We are currently in just such a period and have been for several years.' The Iranian modus operandi began to change around 2018, when a senior Iranian official diplomat called Assadollah Assadi was arrested and convicted of plotting to bomb a big rally organized by an Iranian exile opposition group in France. Assadi, who lived in Europe on the pretext that he was a diplomat working at the Iranian Embassy in Vienna, was sentenced to 20 years in prison – but subsequently released as part of a prisoner-exchange deal. Even though the Iranians had used criminal organizations to carry out terror attacks before this, they decided in the aftermath of the Assadi affair to make this a key part of their strategy. 'There has been a very noticeable uptick in the use of criminal elements to carry out terrorist attacks,' Schweitzer adds. 'The guiding principle for countries that support and orchestrate terror attacks is maintaining plausible deniability. 'Because, notwithstanding all of its violations, it still operates within a set of international norms and wants to maintain a façade of decency. So, the most important part of the process is to maintain that deniability and using the criminal element adds another degree of separation. Another layer of protection. That allows Iran to claim that these assassinations are criminal in nature, not political.' Former Mossad agents, who agreed to talk to Shomrim on condition of anonymity, also commented on the connection between Iranian terror and the criminal underworld. They also pointed out that the international trade in narcotics is a significant source of income for the Islamic Republic – as it is for Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'Our surveillance of the drug-smuggling trade as Hezbollah’s key economic lifeline reveals that the group is connected to all the [criminal] organizations, whether it’s in the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden or Sri Lanka. There, they are on the same field as the big players,' one former Mossad agent told Shomrim. At the same time, he added, 'if they have, let’s say, a smuggling route to Paris which brings in $10 million a year, and they use that money to carry out a terror attack, then it’s gone. And still, this connection creates relationships and the possibility of getting to know and then recruit people who are not directly connected to the smuggling operation but are from the criminal underworld.' Former Mossad: 'Our surveillance of the drug-smuggling trade as Hezbollah’s key economic lifeline reveals that the group is connected to all the [criminal] organizations, whether it’s in the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden or Sri Lanka. There, they are on the same field as the big players,' On the seam line between criminal activity and terrorism are international drug dealers. Earlier this year, the United States and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on an Iranian narcotics trafficker called Naji Ibrahim Sharifi-Zindashti. According to American authorities, Zindashti and his network enjoy protection from the regime in Tehran and, in exchange, have carried out assassinations and kidnappings (some of which were foiled) for the Iranian Intelligence Ministry in the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, Turkey and even the United States. Another similar case is that of Ramin Yektaparast, who, while not involved in trafficking narcotics, was a senior member of a German motorcycle gang and who German authorities suspected of murdering a member of a rival gang before fleeing to Iran. A court in Dusseldorf found that Yektaparast was responsible for organizing a Molotov cocktail attack on a synagogue in Bochum and that he was probably also responsible for a shooting attack on another synagogue, this one in nearby Essen. Yektaparast was shot dead in Tehran early this year in an operation that has been attributed to the Mossad. Yoram Schweitzer: 'The most important part of the process is to maintain that deniability and using the criminal element adds another degree of separation. Another layer of protection. That allows Iran to claim that these assassinations are criminal in nature, not political.' The gang leader fled to Iran French authorities believe that the terror cell operating on their soil was headed by a major drug dealer from the Lyon area called Umit Bulbul, who, as far as they are aware, is currently in Iran. Bulbul, who was born in Pau in southwestern France, had two known aliases. One of these was Ilan Isaac Hadjaj, a French-born Jew. Another was a fictitious Turkish national called Harun Öztürk. The cell’s operations were carried out by an Algerian-born French national known as Abdulkarim S., who was also known as Krimo. His full name cannot be published due to reporting restrictions in France. Krimo is well-known to French law-enforcement bodies, having served time for involvement in a gang warfare double murder in Marseilles and drug trafficking. As part of Iran’s efforts to keep the various members of the network apart, Bulbul and Krimo were never in direct contact. Acting as their intermediary was Sedat (whose name cannot be published for similar reasons), who has a rich criminal record involving violence, theft, extortion and drug trafficking – and who is currently serving time in a French prison. It was almost natural that he would be selected as the go-between: he was one of Bulbul’s lieutenants in the gang’s narcotics enterprise and was a former cellmate of Krimo. Krimo’s activation shows how the cell operated and what the Iranians were planning – including the fact that Tehran’s hit list included three senior members of the Jewish communities in Berlin and Munich. Although Krimo was barred from leaving France because of the conditions of his release from prison, acting on Iranian orders he traveled at least twice to Germany to collect intelligence on the targets. On one occasion, he traveled to Munich by train, having purchased a ticket using his brother-in-law’s identification documents and not before remembering to turn off his cellphone before leaving French territory. When he reached his hotel, he used his phone with a local SIM card. During his time in the city, Krimo visited the quiet neighborhoods of the Au-Haidhausen borough. Not exactly a hot tourist destination – but Krimo had other intentions. Au-Haidhausen is the location of businesses belonging to two of the intended assassination victims. He walked past the premises several times, even entering the internal courtyard and taking videos and photographs of the surroundings, the entry door and the back and front entrances of adjacent buildings. He had no idea, of course, that he was being followed by undercover German intelligence agents the whole time. Krimo spent a total of two days in Munich before returning to France. A week later, he once again boarded a train to Germany. When he alighted in Munich, on April 21st, he was stopped by local police and his documents were photographed. Even though he was under surveillance, this was actually a routine and random stop – but it concerned him. In a voice message he sent to an unknown recipient, he complained about the large police presence and returned to France two days later. European authorities continued to surveil Krimo and members of his cell, but then something unexpected happened: German magazine Focus reported on the Mossad warning mentioned at the start of this article and added that a manhunt was underway for Krimo. Investigators were worried that he would flee and, the next day, he was arrested along with his wife, who was suspected of abetting him. Under questioning, Krimo claimed that he had been working on behalf of a former cellmate, a young man of Turkish heritage called Emre, whose surname he never knew. He claimed that he met Emre in Lyon to get instructions and money from him – 1000 euros to take photographs of buildings in Germany. He said that Emra told him that the offices of companies that had defrauded a friend of his were located in these buildings. Although the story sounds far-fetched, it is not impossible that Krimo had no idea he was working for the Iranians. Subsequently, according to Krimo’s testimony, Emre asked him to set fire to several buildings in southern France, explaining that it was for the purposes of insurance fraud. Krimo claimed that he had not carried out the arson attacks himself but had introduced Emre to other criminals. The buildings in question were torched in late November and early January and all were connected in some way to Israeli-owned companies. By the time of the arson attacks, the cell’s operations were known to French security authorities. What remains unknown for the time being is whether members of the cell managed to go under the French radar to carry out these firebombings or whether authorities allowed them to do so in order to keep monitoring the cell, collect more intelligence and avoid revealing their sources. Another unresolved question is whether 'Emre' is a name that Krimo invented to shield Sedat and Bulbul from incrimination. When shown photographs of the two men, Krimo claimed he had never met them. However, there is evidence that suggests a connection. In November 2023, a seven-second phone call was made from a device used by Sedat to Krimo’s wife’s cell phone. Furthermore, after Krimo and his wife were arrested, authorities searched Sedat’s prison cell and found a USB drive and three cell phones – at least one of which he had been using. That device contained Bulbul’s contact information in the Facebook Messenger app, while Krimo’s contact was saved in the Telegram app. During questioning, Krimo’s wife confirmed that she had heard him mention Sedat’s name. Krimo and his wife are currently awaiting trial in France. Responses The Prime Minister's Office, which is responsible for the Mossad, issued the following statement: 'Since October 7, there has been an increase in the threat level to Israelis and Jews across the world from terrorist organizations. Responsibility for protecting every Israeli citizen or Jewish person in a foreign country rests with the local intelligence, security and law-enforcement services. Intelligence agencies are constantly engaged in dialogue and cooperation to deal with threats.' France’s General Directorate for Internal Security refused to answer questions on the issue and officials said that they are prohibited from discussing the case since legal proceedings are still underway. The Iranian embassy in the Netherlands issued the following response: 'Iran strictly abides by international law and respects the sovereignty of all states. Allegations that Iran is involved in directing or supporting attacks in Europe are unfounded and ridiculous. This is part of a campaign of deception aimed at damaging relations between Iran and European countries. It is unfortunate that such accusations are given credence, as their sole purpose is to sow division and mistrust.' Attorneys representing Krimo said that 'Mr. S. is currently the sole defendant (alongside his wife, whose involvement he denies) in a case whose severity is only becoming apparent to him when he is presented with the evidence. The failure to identify and/or arrest the assassins from the terrorist squad forces him to assume a role that is far too big for him. 'Mr. S. has been consistent during questioning. This shows, on the one hand, that he did not know the targets of the people who approached him and, on the other hand, that he bears no resentment whatsoever toward the Jewish community. There are no signs of radicalization or anything that could suggest that he is antisemitic. Nonetheless, he has been held in solitary confinement for more than three months. 'The severity of Mr. S.’s involvement is incalculably lower than the main players’, who are located above and below him in the criminal plan. Their arrest would allow him to return to his rightful position and allow him to be dealt with in accordance with his relative involvement in the affair.' Attorneys for Krimo’s wife said that: 'Our client knows nothing about the crimes she is alleged to have committed. She has no criminal past and is not known to the legal system. She has two children and is pregnant with a third and holds no radical views. These facts are not challenged but, nonetheless, she was incarcerated before her trial and countless requests for her release have been denied. She is likely to give birth to her third child behind bars. 'There is a terrible situation when it comes to cases classified as ‘terrorism’: individual freedoms and basic democratic principles such as the presumption of innocence are pushed aside in the name of ‘caution,’ which, in this case, is based on nothing but the security context of the case.' Shomrim was unable to obtain responses from Sedat and Umit.

Anniversary of Gaza war draws thousands of pro-Palestinian protes...	Thousands of pro-Palestinians protestors take to the street in the U.S. and Europe calling to end Israel's war in Gaza as soon as possible Thousands of protesters took to the streets in several major cities around the world on Saturday to demand an end to bloodshed in Gaza, as the war in the Palestinian enclave approaches its first anniversary and spreads in the wider region. About 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London while thousands also gathered in Paris, Rome, Manila and Cape Town. The war was triggered when the Palestinian terror group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023 in an attack that killed 1,200 people and in which about 250 were taken as hostagess. 'Unfortunately, in spite of all our goodwill, the Israeli government does not take any notice, and they just go ahead and continue their atrocities in Gaza, now also in Lebanon and in Yemen, and also probably in Iran,' said protestor Agnes Kory in London. 'And our government, our British government, unfortunately is just paying lip service and carries on supplying weapons to Israel,' she added. In London, pro-Israel supporters waved flags as pro-Palestinian marchers walked by. There were 15 arrests on the sidelines of the protests, according to police, who did not specify whether those detained were from either group. In Rome, police fired tear gas and water cannons after clashes broke out. Around 6,000 protesters defied a ban to march in the city center ahead of the October 7 anniversary. In Berlin, a demo drew about 1,000 demonstrators, who bore Palestinian flags and chanted 'One Year of Genocide', a term which Israel disputes, saying it is defending itself. The demonstrators also criticized what they said was police violence against pro-Palestinian protesters in Germany. Israel supporters in Berlin protested against rising antisemitism and scuffles broke out between police and pro-Palestinian counter-protesters. Over the past year, the scale of the killing and destruction in Gaza has drawn some of the biggest global protests in years, in a wave of anger that defenders of Israel say has created an antisemitic climate in which protesters question Israel's right to exist as a nation. The war in Gaza has spread to the region, drawing in Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq. Israel has sharply escalated a campaign against Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah in recent weeks and Iran launched a barrage of missiles against Israel this week. In Paris, Lebanese-French protestor Houssam Houssein said: 'We fear a regional war, because there are tensions with Iran at the moment, and perhaps with Iraq and Yeme. We really need to stop the war because it's now become unbearable.' While its allies such as the United States support Israel's right to defend itself, Israel has faced wide international condemnation over its actions in Gaza, and now over its bombarding of Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted criticism and argued his government is acting to prevent a repeat of the October 7 assault by Hamas. International diplomacy led by the United States has so far failed to clinch a ceasefire deal in Gaza. Hamas wants an agreement that ends the war while Israel says fighting can end only when Hamas is eradicated. In Manila, activists clashed with anti-riot police after they were blocked from holding a demonstration in front of the U.S. embassy in the Philippine capital in protest at the United States supplying Israel with weapons. Demonstrations to mark the first anniversary were due to take place later on Saturday in other cities across the world, including the United States and Chile. Some demonstrations in support of Israel are also planned over the weekend.

IDF dismantles Hezbollah tunnel meters away from border	Military spokesperson uncovers footage of forces operating inside Radwan Force deep underground complex before collapsing it The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Saturday revealed footage of forces operating in Lebanon inside of a large terror tunnel utilized by the terror group’s Radwan Force found 300 meters (984 feet) away from the border with Israel. 'The Paratroopers Brigade, Yahalom Unit and the Northern Command Combat Engineering Unit, under the command of the 98th Division, destroyed 250 meters of underground terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon,' the military said in a statement. 'The underground infrastructure was identified and investigated during cross-border operations conducted in recent weeks in coordination with special units. IDF troops uncovered command centers, terrorist combat packs, and a large number of weapons designated to be used in an invasion by Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces into Israel. They also found living quarters equipped with showers, a kitchen, and stockpiles of food,' the statement added. According to the military, 'The underground infrastructure did not cross into Israeli territory and was sealed by the Northern Command Combat Engineering Unit and the Yahalom Unit in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense Department of Engineering and Construction.' The IDF added that forces are continuing to operate in the area in search of additional threats against Israel. 'Inside a Hezbollah stronghold used by the terrorist organization as a base to carry out attacks on Israeli civilians, the soldiers uncovered hundreds of weapons. The soldiers also eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and directed aerial strikes,' the military's statement read.

Ambulances with terrorists: Hezbollah's 'Medical Corps'	Hezbollah utilizes tactic similar to Hamas in Gaza and hijacks civilian medical complexes to carry out terror attacks and smuggling operations Lebanon reports hits on hospitals, medical teams and ambulances, but avoids addressing how medical personnel are assisting terrorists or dealing with Hezbollah's use of civilian and medical facilities. Like Hamas, the terror organization extensively uses civilian infrastructure, and reports say terrorists and weapons are being transported via ambulances and medical vehicles. To highlight the issue in international media, a headline in the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese outlet Al-Akhbar published on Saturday read, 'Six hospitals between complete and temporary closure — the enemy begins its war on health facilities.' Further, the number of Lebanese reports about medical personnel injured or killed in Israeli strikes has risen in recent days. Hezbollah is also a political entity that operates medical services in Lebanon, with its medical body being the Islamic Health Authority. Established in 1984 and licensed by the Lebanese Interior Ministry in 1988, it provides healthcare services in Lebanese society, runs education and training programs, promotes medical projects and supports Hezbollah's terror activities. This is in practice Hezbollah's 'Medical Corps,' serving its military wing under the guise of a civilian organization. Reports of casualties from the Islamic Health Authority were also during the war. Other organizations besides Hezbollah operate medical personnel. The Amal Movement, which has been fighting against Israel near the border in recent months and suffered casualties, has its own medical team under the name Islamic Al-Rissala Scout Association. The Islamic Health Authority released the names of 11 casualties from Israeli strikes in various areas in southern Lebanon on Friday. Reports of medics killed and wounded have been steadily coming in from Lebanon over the past two days, adding to the numbers mentioned last week by Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad, who reported 97 medical and emergency personnel killed since the start of the war and 188 wounded. He also claimed 9 hospitals had been targeted and 45 healthcare centers affected. Reports on Friday said that 5 hospitals, 4 of them in southern Lebanon, were rendered inoperative due to Israeli strikes, including the Marjayoun Governmental Hospital which closed its doors after an Israeli strike targeted two ambulances at its main entrance, the Meiss Ej Jabal Hospital, which ceased operations due to road closures and disrupted supply lines and Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil. Hezbollah, much Hamas in Gaza, uses civilian infrastructure including hospitals for terrorism. The IDF Spokesperson Unit reported on Saturday that the Israeli Air Force 'with the direction of IDF intelligence, struck Hezbollah terrorists who were operating within a command center that was located inside a mosque adjacent to the Salah Ghandour Hospital in southern Lebanon. 'The command center was used by the Hezbollah terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel.' The statement also added Hezbollah continues to illegally use hospitals in the country. Salah Ghandour Hospital issued a statement on Friday acknowledging the Israeli strike after receiving an evacuation warning beforehand. It said that nine medical staff were injured and that most of the medical staff had been evacuated. The statement didn’t address any Hezbollah activity inside the hospital. Hezbollah’s use of ambulances is also well-documented. A few months ago, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit revealed that Hezbollah uses ambulances from the Islamic Health Authority to transport terrorists and weapons. 'In recent days, we have observed increasing use of rescue vehicles to transport operatives and weapons by Hezbollah,' IDF Spokesperson for Arabic Media, COL Avichay Adraee, said on Friday. 'The IDF warns against this practice and calls on medical teams to distance themselves from the terror organization's operatives and refrain from cooperating with them. Any vehicle proven to carry an armed terrorist will be attacked regardless of its type,' he added.

Hezbollah rocket hits Karmiel home, no injuries reported	Terror group focuses fire on northern Israeli city, managing to damage one building amid intense rocket barrages; mayor calls on residents to adhere to Home Front Command guidelines A Hezbollah rocket on Saturday fell in Karmiel, located in northern Israel, following a barrage aimed at the country from Lebanon. No injuries were reported in the incident, however, the rocket hit a local building causing significant damage to it and the surrounding area. Karmiel Mayor Moshe Koninsky called on the city’s residents to strictly adhere to the IDF Home Front Command wartime guidelines shortly after the hit was reported. 'We find ourselves after several barrages aimed at the city. Most have been intercepted, but a direct hit was seen at one home. I ask again, enter your safe rooms as soon as you hear alert sirens sounding.' The Lebanese Iran-backed terrorist group intensified its launches against Israeli cities as far as Haifa Bay following IDF strikes across Lebanon aiming to weaken its firing capabilities and targets its operatives. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Friday that the IDF eliminated about 250 Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon in the last four days. During the operation, more than 2,000 military targets were attacked, including terrorist infrastructure, military complexes, warehouses, weapon caches and launch pads. According to the IDF, among the killed terrorists were five battalion commanders, ten company commanders and six platoon commanders. It was also reported the forces eliminated terrorists who were entrenched in buildings close to the border.

Macron urges halt to arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza	French president criticizes Jerusalem's wartime policies in Gaza and adamantly calls on nations to stop supplying Israel with weapons and military equipment French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday urged a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, which has been criticized over the conduct of its retaliatory operation in Gaza. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,' Macron told broadcaster France Inter. 'France is not delivering any,' he added during the interview recorded early this week. The United States provides about $3 billion in weapons to Israel each year. In May, the State Department said it did not have enough evidence to block shipments of weapons but that it was 'reasonable to assess' that Israel has used arms in ways inconsistent with standards of humanitarian law. In September, the UK said it was suspending some arms exports to Israel, citing a 'clear risk' that they could be used in a serious breach of international humanitarian law. Macron reiterated his concern over the war in Gaza that is continuing despite repeated calls for a cease-fire. 'I think we are not being heard,' he said. 'I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel,' he said, adding that the war was leading to 'hatred.' Macron also said avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a 'priority.' 'Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza,' he added. On Monday, Israel marks the first anniversary of the devastating October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the Gaza war and has now engulfed neighboring Lebanon, creating a perilous regional crisis. The confirmed death toll from the attack, including hostages killed in captivity, has reached 1,205 on the Israeli side, most of them civilians.

US fears of Israeli retaliation 'going too far' against Iran, rep...	International outlet reports the Biden administration worries it can't influence Israeli decision-making against Tehran which could impact the November elections American news outlet Bloomberg published an extensive report on Friday detailing Washington’s frustration over the 'lack of influence' the U.S. has on Israel regarding its military actions, especially in light of Israel's ground entry into southern Lebanon. Two sources familiar with U.S. policy said Israel is aware it has a 'window of opportunity' to take action before the presidential election on November 5. Amid a potential Israeli attack on Iran in response to its ballistic missile strike against the country, crude oil prices surged on Thursday after U.S. President Joe Biden said Israel was considering striking Iran's oil facilities and advised against it. Higher oil prices could threaten the Biden administration's hopes of keeping fuel costs low for Democratic voters. 'If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields,' Biden told reporters, adding that Israel hasn't yet decided on its response. A senior U.S. State Department official told CNN on Friday that Israel has not given the Biden administration any guarantees that it won't target Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the Iranian attack. A source familiar with the administration's policy was quoted by Bloomberg expressing concern in Washington from Israel 'going too far' in in retaliation against Tehran. Senior IDF officials clarified on Saturday the response to the ballistic missile strike will be 'significant.' The report also addressed Israel's ground entry into southern Lebanon, suggesting that Israel's previous maneuvers in the country developed into 'deadly quagmires,' and that the last U.S.-led effort to change the Middle East — the 2003 invasion of Iraq — only made the region less stable. 'We should all understand that this war will get wider, that it may involve the United States in ways we wish it would not, that it may change oil prices for America as we head toward the winter,' said Wendy Sherman, a veteran diplomat who left the U.S. State Department after serving as deputy secretary of state in 2023. Biden's special envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein, who has tried for months to prevent war in the north, said on Friday the U.S. did not give a 'green light' for an Israeli ground operation in Lebanon. 'Ultimately, only a diplomatic resolution will allow residents to return home. We continue to work [with the] governments of Israel & Lebanon on [the] best path to restore calm,' he said. Biden had little choice but to try to exert whatever influence he had left on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A senior Western diplomat said some allies are considering the prospect of a 'Samson option' — a scenario where a Kamala Harris victory would allow Biden to cave under pressure and cut off arms supplies to Israel to force a cease-fire. But with U.S. polls showing the race between Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump is close, the option seems irrelevant for now, meaning the White House will likely continue its effort to temper Israel's expanding military actions seemingly.

Sky News: Israel confirms Safieddine, Nasrallah's successor, kill...	Amid rocket barrages all over northern Israel, causing extensive damage to several homes in the Galilee and Haifa region, Arabic-speaking Sky News channel reports that Israel has supposedly confirmed a successful strike on Hassan Nasrallah's would-be successor to head Hezbollah In a significant escalation of regional tensions, two distinct rocket barrages originating from Lebanon activated sirens across a wide swath of northern Israeli communities, stretching from the Haifa region and into both the Lower and Upper Galilee. Concurrently, Israeli security officials confirmed on Saturday to the Arabic-language Sky News network that Hashem Safieddine, a prominent figure in Hezbollah's leadership as the head of its Executive Council and the intended successor to his cousin, Hezbollah's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, had been eliminated in an Israeli strike in the Dahiya quarter of Beirut. Lebanese security sources informed Reuters shortly before that since the series of attacks in the Beirut district, Safieddine has been 'unreachable.' Furthermore, three security sources noted that Israeli Defense Forces attacks on the outskirts of Beirut are impeding rescue teams from accessing the heavily targeted areas. Saudi television channel Al-Hadath previously reported, citing unnamed sources, that Israel, while not officially commenting on the operation attributed to it, received confirmation of Safieddine's demise. Sources indicated that the magnitude of the strike in Beirut, specifically targeting Hashem Safieddine, left 'no possibility of survival.' By midday, Al-Hadath further reported that Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers were also killed alongside him. It was asserted that 'Hashem was killed in the strike with aides, Iranian commanders, and replacement field commanders of Hezbollah.' Israeli intelligence sources, in discussions with The New York Times, revealed that the attack aimed at an underground bunker hosting senior Hezbollah officials. Reports suggest that Safieddine and the head of the intelligence department of the Shia militant organization were present at the meeting, held at a considerable depth, as noted by Al-Arabiya network. Various Saudi networks have raised questions regarding the whereabouts of Ismail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, who according to Arab reports, has been 'missing' for several days. It's noteworthy that following the strike that killed Nasrallah in Dahiya, rumors surfaced about Qaani's potential presence, though the Iranian Mehr news agency clarified, amid circulating rumors, that the Iranian Quds Force commander was not harmed in the attack on Hezbollah's central headquarters. These extraordinary strikes, reportedly targeting Safieddine, occurred minutes after IDF announced the evacuation of several buildings in the Beirut district. 'It was a ring of fire, Israel attacked 11 times consecutively,' a source close to Hezbollah relayed to AFP. Officially, neither the terrorist organization nor Israel has yet addressed the strike or the fate of the high-ranking Hezbollah official closely associated with the Ayatollah regime in Tehran, who is also the son-in-law of Qassem Soleimani. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1mr9iaar	2024-10-05T05:41:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2017/05/20/7792688/7792688_0_0_750_422_0_small.jpg

Sky News Arabic reported, citing Israeli security sources, that the death of senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine has been confirmed. He was identified as the successor to Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last week. Early Friday morning, IDF confirmed that it conducted a targeted attack in the Dahiya neighborhood of Beirut.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1sa4sccr	2024-10-05T04:38:03-07:00	
Cadence, tone, inflection and topics: What characterized Nasralla...	Hassan Nasrallah's speeches were characterized by their structured nature and emotional delivery, as he carefully detailed agenda points and repeated key ideas; His presentations often included slow, calm speech punctuated by moments of raised voice for emphasis, evoking strong reactions from his audience The recently-slain Hassan Nasrallah was known for his speeches, which Israel closely monitored. These speeches, sometimes fiery, ended with his elimination, concluding years of lengthy broadcasts since the Second Lebanon War. These speeches were shown on giant screens to his supporters, who reacted as directed by their leader from his bunker. In recent years, Nasrallah didn't speak live in front of crowds. His speeches were broadcast from his hiding place, yet he maintained control over his audience, and not just them. The Arab world, the Western world, and Israel watched every word, emphasis, and hint from Nasrallah, trying to understand the leader of the terror organization, Iran's ally, and his future plans. Not all of his speeches focused on Israel. Some addressed Lebanon, regional issues, and religious topics. When he did address the issue of Israel, Nasrallah demonstrated extensive knowledge of internal Israeli issues, internal struggles, politics, the general atmosphere, and the Israeli media. Nasrallah usually spoke in a very organized manner, outlining the agenda at the beginning of each speech. He often spoke slowly and calmly, with a half-smile—even when his organization was in distress—and ensured his ideas were repeated. Occasionally, he raised his voice to threaten, earning cheers from the crowd. The background behind him in the broadcasts changed from speech to speech, depending on the topic, circumstances, and date. What remained almost unchanged was Nasrallah's attire and appearance. 'Nasrallah taught us to take his speeches seriously, and we followed him blindly. It became a ritual. Nasrallah speaks, and everyone rushes to read, interpret, and explain,' said Orna Mizrahi, former deputy head of the National Security Council and a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies. 'Nasrallah created a certain clarity for us. You could read the speeches, understand what he wanted, the directions, and the strategy. Now we need to learn anew where to find the signs of the organization's strategy if there is one at all.' Mizrahi said that in her view, the appearances of Nasrallah that will be remembered are mainly the 'Spider Web' speech in May 2000, after the IDF's withdrawal from Lebanon, and the 2006 interview after the Second Lebanon War, where he said that if he had known what the abduction of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev would lead to, Hezbollah would not have carried it out. Nasrallah, as Mizrahi described, didn't just deliver speeches—he also occasionally gave interviews to channels associated with his terror organization. In July 2022, marking 40 years of Hezbollah, he was interviewed by the Al-Mayadeen channel and spoke about the 'end of Israel,' envisioning a future where people would be seen with suitcases heading to airports, ports, and border crossings with Egypt and Jordan. Nasrallah claimed then that Israel is an 'entity with no future' and asserted that it wouldn't take 40 years for this to happen. Currently, it is worth noting that those who have fled and sought refuge are Nasrallah's own people, from the Shiite towns, from the southern Lebanon villages, from the Al-Bekaa area in southern Lebanon, and from the Dahiya district. Nasrallah used them over the years as human shields, hid weapons in their villages, and exposed them, without hesitation, to the threat of war. As lies turn to embarrassment Nevertheless, Mizrahi described that in his last speech, Nasrallah presented the complexity of assessing his enemy. 'In his last speech, he continued with threats but acknowledged Israel's technological superiority. He had a positive appreciation of the enemy on one hand—and also a burning hatred and desire to do everything to make us disappear from his sight,' she said. 'He had a relatively restrained approach—understanding Hezbollah's limitations of power.' Nasrallah's speeches were indeed characterized by emotional displays. In a speech on Laylat al-Qadr this year, he mentioned the commandment of 'Shahada' and the 'martyrs' killed fighting Israel, spoke with a choked voice—and the audience cried together with him. In 2018, he broke into tears during a speech for Ashura ceremonies, condemning the custom among Shiite believers of cutting children's faces during mourning rituals. 'The whole world sees what's happening here—and I ask you to exercise restraint and stay away from anyone trying to create a negative impression of us,' he said then. Nasrallah also tended to lie. 'I don't know if he believed his lies or not,' Mizrahi said. 'It was very noticeable that in his early speeches, he talked about the many casualties in Israel and the deaths Israel is hiding. He talked about large numbers. Gradually, he talked less and less about these topics.' According to Mizrahi, Nasrallah lied when embarrassed: 'When it was hard for him to explain things, like October 7, he lied about things that happened that day.' Hezbollah's response to the elimination of Fuad Shukr, for example, led the terror organization to promote lies that Israel is hiding a significant attack at the Glilot base, with dead and wounded. The organization even provided 'accurate' numbers—far from reality. 'I don't know if someone whispered in his ear or if he tried to build a narrative,' Mizrahi said. 'In his speeches, he tried to build narratives. The narrative of 'Israel is weak,' for example, to build it, he also used internal tensions in Israel.' According to Prof. Eyal Zisser, an expert in the modern history of Lebanon and Syria and Deputy Rector at Tel Aviv University, Nasrallah's speeches were essentially the tool through which he outlined policy. 'In recent decades, he wasn't publicly active, so his speeches were both for his supporters and his enemies, the only way to gauge moods, intentions, and plans,' he said. According to him, 'Since he is the one who makes the decisions and he was central, the speech was something that summarized for us how he sees things, what he thinks, and what his plans are. It became the tool through which he and his organization say where we came from and where we are going.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/r1hztcacc	2024-10-05T04:17:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/08/19/H1jIAYset/H1jIAYset_0_55_2500_1408_0_small.jpg

Commando Brigade's combat team fighters continue operating in southern Lebanon as part of the focused ground activity that began this week, in villages where extensive parts of their infrastructure have been converted into Hezbollah terror targets. This was reported by IDF spokesperson, who noted the fighters are conducting raids based on intelligence guidance on terror infrastructures both above and below ground in mountainous, complex, booby-trapped areas, and in dense, built-up areas. Forces have located and destroyed weapon caches, observation posts, missiles, and launch sites aimed at Israel, and have eliminated dozens of terrorists in cooperation with the Air Force.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpb3k0rc	2024-10-05T02:51:57-07:00	
Most intensive aerial campaign in the world outside Gaza in the ...	Since the IDF maneuver began in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has issued around 100 claims of responsibility for actions against Israel and its forces, including within Lebanon; In this period, IDF operations have resulted in the elimination of more than 250 terrorists, including 21 commanders, over four days of focused activity Since the IDF began its maneuver in southern Lebanon last Monday, Hezbollah has issued approximately 100 'claims of responsibility' for actions against Israel and IDF specifically, including within Lebanon. In some statements, the Shiite terrorist organization claimed it fired at gathering areas on the northern border where IDF troops were preparing for a ground entry into Lebanon for the first time since 2006. In recent days, there has been a significant increase in Hezbollah's claims of responsibility, with some turning out to be false or at least inaccurate. The terrorist organization's apparent aim is to project 'achievements' on the ground, likely due to distress following a series of senior eliminations in Lebanon. Alongside attacks against IDF soldiers maneuvering in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah continued its relentless firing toward Israeli territory, which also expanded to additional areas. After launching a rocket aimed at Tel Aviv for the first time last week, Hezbollah this week launched its first major barrage toward the country's center, triggering alarms in Tel Aviv and surrounding region. According to the terrorist organization, this was firing at 'Base 8200 in Glilot and Mossad headquarters' and at 'the airbase in Sde Dov.' Firing toward Haifa, surrounding towns, the Lower Galilee, and the bases in these areas, which was considered unusual until a few weeks ago, has become much more frequent over the past week and the one before. For comparison, until the beginning of Operation 'Northern Arrows' in the middle of last month, alarms were heard in Haifa only twice since the start of the war. In contrast, over the past two weeks, no fewer than 14 alerts have been activated throughout the city. Since the maneuver began this week, according to IDF data, more than 700 launches from Lebanon to Israel have been identified. Since the IDF entered Lebanon on the ground, Hezbollah has claimed in several statements that it managed to cause casualties among the fighting forces on the ground and described 'clashes with IDF forces' in other statements. However, many of these announcements have been found to be inaccurate. 250 terrorists eliminated, over 2,000 targets attacked Alongside the difficult incidents and the heavy toll, IDF is recording achievements in the fighting in southern Lebanon. During four days of focused activity in southern Lebanon, more than 250 terrorists have been eliminated, according to the IDF, including 21 commanders. IDF spokesperson updated that among the eliminated commanders, there are five at the battalion commander level, ten company commanders, and six platoon commanders. Additionally, the army estimates that the entire southern Lebanon region has been evacuated of population, with a total of about 600,000 having left and reached north of the Litani River. Forces operate in southern Lebanon in brigade formation attacks, combining aerial activity alongside tanks and artillery. The IDF added that during the activity, forces are eliminating terrorists entrenched in buildings and locations close to the fence, locating and destroying weapons storage, ready-to-launch launchers, and Hezbollah's charges left behind. The forces' activity has so far been carried out from controlling areas over six villages, focusing on Hezbollah operatives and weapon stockpiles, even underground. 'We are combing with iron combs and finding much more than we knew. We located dozens of large weapons caches. We found many more underground infrastructures than we knew, including supply tunnels of 40-50 meters—and we have begun destroying those infrastructures. The Paratroopers Brigade eliminated 15 terrorists who emerged from shafts and hideouts in the last 24 hours,' IDF relayed. 'The most intense aerial combat in the world in the past 20 years' Additionally, Air Force operates above and around ground forces—at all hours of the day. From preemptive strikes against military targets in the raid destinations to removing threats in the area through collection and attack missions. So far, more than 2,000 military targets have been attacked, including terror infrastructures, military buildings, weapons storage, and launchers. According to reports in Lebanon and IDF announcements, the main target areas of the Air Force are southern Lebanon, the Al-Bekaa area in the east, connecting Lebanon with Syria, and the Dahiya of Beirut. Data published last night on CNN showed that Israel is bombing across Lebanon more than the US at the peak of its fight against ISIS and at a higher rate than the US military attacked in its war in Afghanistan. According to data from the Lebanese Ministry of Health, more than 1,400 people have been killed in the country in the past three weeks due to the massive airstrikes. Additionally, more than 7,500 others were injured. However, data from the Ministry of Health in Lebanon are not always accurate, as not all casualties reach treatment in various hospitals. It should be noted that Israel, for its part, sends messages to civilians in Lebanon before attacking certain areas. Just last week, several such warnings were sent to residents of the Dahiya district and its surroundings, where Israel attacked significant weapon stockpiles. In that district, as known, a number of senior Hezbollah officials, including the organization's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, were eliminated in an airstrike about a week ago. According to Airwars, which monitors and collects data on airstrikes in conflict zones, 'Israel's bombings, which it says are aimed at Hezbollah strongholds, mark the most intensive aerial campaign in the world outside Gaza in the past two decades.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hybgporcc	2024-10-05T02:48:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/05/B1UKmBAC0/B1UKmBAC0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Saudi FM: 'No diplomatic relations with Israel without two-state ...	Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud says that while normalization with Israel was imminent before October 7, their position has now shifted, saying that without a two-state solution and a divided Jerusalem, the Saudi government will not agree to formalize diplomatic relations with Israel Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud articulated in the Financial Times why Riyadh paused its normalization with Israel, which was nearly finalized before October 7. He emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, warning of the region's dangerous escalation and the necessity for 'courage and leadership' to forge a sustainable peace amidst the devastation and despair. He declared, 'The time has come to embark on an irreversible path to a solution, culminating in two states—Palestinian and Israeli—living side by side.' Farhan underscored Saudi Arabia's enduring commitment to resolving the conflict, noting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's strong condemnation of Israel's actions. 'Saudi Arabia will tirelessly work towards establishing an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without this condition,' he wrote. He stressed that an independent Palestinian state, in Saudi Arabia's view, would provide regional stability, integration, and prosperity. 'A two-state solution is not merely an ideal; it is the only viable path to ensuring Palestine, Israel and the region’s long-term security,' he argued. 'Uncontrolled escalatory cycles are the building blocks of wider war. In Lebanon, we are witnessing this first hand. Peace cannot be built on a foundation of occupation and resentment; true security for Israel will come from recognizing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.' Farhan noted that the barriers to peace are not the 'It is essential to understand that the true obstacles to peace are not the Palestinians and Israelis who yearn for stability and coexistence, but rather the radicals and warmongers on both sides who reject a just resolution and seek to spread this conflict across our region and beyond.' He emphasized the importance of a PA-administered civilian control of Gaza: 'We have witnessed the perseverance of the Palestinian Authority in maintaining calm in the occupied West Bank despite unrelenting obstacles. Its commitment to non-violence and co-operation must be supported. A lasting resolution cannot be achieved without both Gaza and the occupied West Bank being under PA control.' He further argued that Israel's interest are not as benign as it claims, supposedly more interested in offense than defense. 'It has been clear for too long that self-defence is not Israel’s primary goal in this war. Instead, it seems the objective is to eliminate the conditions for life with any modicum of dignity for decades to come. By continuing the assault on Gaza that has killed over 40,000, according to Palestinian health officials, and displaced almost 2mn, expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank and imposing movement restrictions, Israel creates a reality that diminishes prospects for a sovereign Palestinian state. 'Merely recognizing Palestine is not enough. We must demand more accountability in line with International Court of Justice opinions. This includes the implementation of UN resolutions, the imposition of punitive measures against those that work to undermine Palestinian statehood and incentives for those who support it.' 'A global alliance of UN member states and international organizations now supports diplomatic efforts for a permanent ceasefire, the release of hostages and detainees, and addressing the humanitarian suffering of Gaza's residents,' he added. 'This alliance will seek to advance concrete measures to uphold international law, end the occupation, and realize the two-state solution on a clear timeline.

I'll be the first to return': Female Northern Command officer ev...	Lieutenant Colonel S., the the IDF’s first female offensive operations at the IDF's Northern Command, recounts northern conflict and says actions against Hezbollah is critical Lieutenant Colonel S., the IDF’s first female offensive operations head at the military’s Northern Command, had been evacuated from her home at the onset of the Gaza war on October 7. 'We can’t get used to a situation of families being evacuated from their home for a year,' She told Ynet. Since the outbreak of the war, S. has also been working to change this reality. The officer has been responsible in recent months, among other things, for dozens of plans aimed at eliminating Hezbollah commanders and reducing the organization's capabilities. She took up her position about a month ago, stepping directly into Operation Northern Arrows, much of which she conceived during her previous roles in the Northern Command. In the long months leading up to the IDF's operation against Hezbollah, she operated in her previous position executing attack plans against Hezbollah's rocket array. These actions degraded the terror army’s capabilities, making it harder for them to fire mortars and rockets as planned toward northern communities. One of these communities is Kibbutz Matzuva, near the border in the western Galilee, where S. herself lives. She was evacuated from there a year ago with her three small children and her husband, Major B., who also serves as a Northern Command intelligence officer. As a result, the two have become a constant point of inquiry from their friends in Kibbutz Matzuva and the nearby town of Shtula, where she grew up. 'I can't tell them what we're doing, but I assure them that we are practically restoring security and that we've taken away many of Hezbollah's capabilities. We can’t get used to a situation of families being evacuated from their home for a year, but we're at a point where we will be able to return home safely very soon — and I'll be the first to return to the house we built in the kibbutz,' she said. Lieutenant Colonel S. stressed that weakening Hezbollah and the heavy blows inflicted by her comrades in the Northern Command didn't start last month but have been ongoing, with thousands of targets being hit daily over the past year from the air and the ground, directed by the Northern Command’s operation center. 'We know how to fire at exact locations, with full control and creative ideas from all offensive sources, including the Navy, which is working with us,' she said. 'We've been formulating these plans for years and suddenly executing them is thrilling and gives an adrenaline rush when you see it happen before your eyes. The reality here won't be what it was before.' Before Operation Northern Arrows began, S. and B/ managed to visit her parents briefly to support them, hinting that they'd be gone for a long period of time. 'For months now, my parents have taken full responsibility for raising the kids, doing homework with them and supporting us from afar,' she said. 'We're at a critical juncture and we're actively restoring the sense of security for all northern residents. Hezbollah has weak points and we know exactly where to strike. We're shaking Hezbollah and the reality that existed here on October 6 won't return,' she added. 'Our home hasn't been damaged and we had just finished building it before the war. We managed to visit briefly to water the plants and make sure it remained intact, but we'll return to it to raise our children without a doubt.'

Israel eyes retaliation on Iran: ‘They will pay with interest’; I...	Sources say Israel planning strong response against Tehran soon, placing Islamic Republic under 'immense pressure'; US official says 'Israel can rest assured it has our backing'; Israel may also target Iraq militias after deadly drone strike American officials indicated on Friday that an Israeli strike on Iran is likely imminent, following Iran's launch of over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. The main question now, they said, is what role the U.S. will play in response to the Iranian attack. While U.S. aircraft are not expected to participate in the strike, there will undoubtedly be coordination between Washington and Jerusalem, officials said. However, they added that this could still change, emphasizing that the U.S. is focused on protecting its forces and highlighting America’s role in intercepting Iranian missiles earlier this week. 'Miscalculations can happen,' one official noted. 'We are certainly trying to prevent this from escalating into a regional war, but it’s clear the U.S. could be drawn in.' The officials also underscored their understanding of Israel's need to respond, though they acknowledged the complexity of a potential strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. 'It’s not as simple as eliminating Iran’s nuclear infrastructure with a single bombing run. It’s very complicated,' they added. Regardless, the officials made it clear that Israel has the U.S.’s full support. 'Israel will do what it needs to do—but they don’t want a regional war either. Israel can rest assured it has our backing, and we’re in sync with them,' one official said. A senior State Department official told CNN that Israel has not promised the Biden administration that an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites is 'off the table' in response to the Iranian missile strike. 'We hope to see wisdom alongside strength, but there are no guarantees,' he said. When asked if Israel might strike Iran on the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack, the official responded: 'It's hard to say. In some ways, I think Israel would want to avoid that timing, so if anything happens, it will likely be before or after.' He added, 'The U.S. has worked for nearly a year to prevent this conflict from escalating into a larger war—and so far, we’ve managed that. But now we’re on the edge.' President Joe Biden also addressed the situation on Friday, saying 'If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.' Unexpectedly joining the White House daily press briefing, Biden further said, 'Israel won’t make an immediate decision; we’ll wait to see when they want to talk. The key thing right now is to avoid a full-scale war and rally our allies to contain it.' Iran's state news agency SNN reported Friday that a senior official from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard warned, 'If Israel makes a mistake, we will target its gas and energy facilities.' This came after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, during a visit to Beirut where he met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, said, 'We are determined to support Hezbollah, the government and the people of Lebanon. Israel is committing war crimes, and Arab and Islamic nations must mobilize international organizations against Israel.' He later added, 'The attack on Israel was legitimate self-defense; we have no plans to continue—unless Israel decides to strike us.' In response, Israeli sources familiar with the situation said that Israel is planning a severe retaliation against Iran. 'Their threats don’t affect us at all. We see tremendous pressure in Tehran—they’re panicking. Israel will strike hard, and they can keep threatening, but they will pay the price, with interest,' the source said. Meanwhile, the IDF reported that two Israeli soldiers were killed Tuesday night in northern Golan by a drone launched from Iraq. The victims were identified as Sergeant Daniel Aviv Chaim Sofer, 19, from Ashkelon, a communications officer trainee with Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion, and Corporal Tal Dror, 19, from Jerusalem, a communication specialist with the same battalion. Twenty-four other soldiers were injured, including one in serious condition, one in moderate condition, and 21 with minor injuries. Another drone was launched that night but was intercepted. The pro-Iranian militia group Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they carried out 'three drone strikes on targets in the north.' This marks the first time that drone strikes from Iraq have resulted in Israeli casualties. Regarding the militia's actions in Iraq, sources said, 'We will find the appropriate response, both for the drone attack on our soldiers in the Golan and otherwise. It's clear that Iran is activating all possible fronts, and we must be prepared for more surprises.' This incident follows a similar escalation from Yemen when a drone strike led to the death of an Israeli civilian. In response, the IDF struck the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah in Yemen. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared, 'The first time they struck an Israeli, we retaliated. The fire is spreading across the Middle East.' Iran behind attacks on Israeli embassies As anticipation mounts for Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack, the opposition channel Iran International reported that Tehran is behind recent armed assaults on Israeli embassies in Sweden and Denmark. A well-informed source told the channel that 'the Islamic Republic used local criminal elements to carry out these terror attacks on embassies and continues its efforts to target tourists and Jewish and Israeli centers across Europe.' Referring to the arrest of a criminal gang in June responsible for shooting at the Israeli embassy in Sweden, the source said, 'Investigations revealed that this group was also directed by agents of the Islamic Republic.' Following that incident, Swedish intelligence warned that the Iranian government was recruiting Swedish gang members to carry out violent acts against groups and individuals in the country. The source emphasized that 'hiring criminals to execute terror attacks on behalf of the republic against perceived enemies is one of Tehran’s preferred methods.' This approach, he added, allows Iran to distance itself from acts of terror and portray them as 'mere criminal activities.'

According to estimates, the Air Force jets dropped 73 tons of bombs on the bunker in the Dahieh district in Beirut, which was classified as the main intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah. The target was reportedly in the bunker with other senior officials.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkov0rpar	2024-10-04T14:34:12-07:00

Hezbollah undecided on when and where to bury Nasrallah, report	According to a source close to Hezbollah, the terror organization has yet to decide on where and when to bury the former Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by the IDF last week in Beirut. The source denied the reports that Nasrallah had already been buried. In the meantime, the IDF has yet to confirm if Thursday's assassination attempt on Nasrallah's replacement, Hashem Safieddine was successful.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkz003t0c	2024-10-04T12:20:36-07:00	
IDF forces clash with Hezbollah terrorists in close range battles...	IDF soldiers notice that Hezbollah operatives prefer to fight up close instead of shooting from a distance like Hamas after having encountered terrorists in several incidents Unlike the Hamas terrorists in Gaza, most of whom fled their positions during the IDF maneuver in the Gaza Strip and shot mainly from afar, Hezbollah operatives remain to fight in blank-range battles with the IDF soldiers, who entered southern Lebanon for limited targeted raids on Monday. In the first days of the limited operation in southern Lebanon, during which more than 250 terrorists were eliminated, the IDF noticed a recurring pattern among the Hezbollah operatives. The Hezbollah terrorists do not engage the IDF soldiers until they are close and fight in close-range battles. For example, the paratrooper brigade, who were the first to cross the border, reported six point-blank range encounters with Hezbollah terrorists in the first four days of the operation. In all of these encounters, according to the reports, Hezbollah was defeated and its operatives were eliminated, despite having lost some soldiers and others sustaining injuries. The Hezbollah squads are quite small, ranging from one to a few terrorists in each cell. On Thursday, for example, in another encounter by one of the forces, a terrorist hid in a building and opened fire at soldiers who entered to search it. The soldiers use drones to locate and attack the terrorists instead of risking themselves. In the case of the late Captain Ben Zion Falach, the paratroopers realized quickly, as part of their extensive experience in Gaza, that the terrorists were operating from a combat complex integrated into a tunnel shaft. That prompted the IDF to destroy the complex with engineering means. The soldiers also noticed that the Hezbollah operatives only act if they see soldiers approaching. The IDF's attacks in the region have severely damaged Hezbollah's supply lines and combat capabilities. For example, the IDF destroyed the regional headquarters in the Bint Jbeil Municipality building during the holiday which shows the terror organization's initial signs of erosion. Despite Hezbollah's forces being diminished and its infrastructure damaged, its operatives managed to fire a barrage of mortar bombs at the troops in one of the neighboring villages. There were no casualties to the IDF forces in this incident. Hezbollah's great losses accumulating the last year in IDF airstrikes, the pager and communication device explosions and the recent limited raid, prove to be weighing the terrorist organization down. However, the IDF's objective in the southern Lebanon villages is to rid the area of Hezbollah and allow the northern residents to return home eventually. Earlier, the IDF spokesperson informed that during the last four days of operations in southern Lebanon, more than 250 terrorists were eliminated, including 21 commanders. According to his statement, the 250 operatives included five battalion commanders, ten company commanders, and six department commanders. In addition, the IDF estimates that the entire southern Lebanon population evacuated and about 600 thousand left and arrived north of the Litani river. The IDF continues to operate in southern Lebanon which combines air activity alongside limited targeted raids with tanks and artillery. The IDF added that during the operation, the forces eliminated terrorists entrenched in buildings adjacent to the fence, located and destroyed weapon caches, launchers ready for launch, and Hezbollah IEDs that were left behind. Since the beginning of the operation in southern Lebanon, eleven IDF soldiers have been killed in combat. The eleven soldiers are: Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, Staff Sergent Almken Terefe, Staff Sergent Ido Broyer, Captain Itai Ariel Giat, Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, Captain Harel Etinger, Sergeant First Class Nazar Itkin, Captain Ben Zion Falach, Corporal Tal Dror, and Sergeant Daniel Aviv Haim Sofer.

A day after the assassination attempt of Hashem Safieddine, who was designated as the successor of former Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, reports indicate that the terror organization's head of the intelligence unit was present at the meeting that was attacked. Also, according to the reports, it can be estimated that all those present were killed as a result of the collapse of the bunker or toxic gases that were emitted into the tunnels. Israel estimates that is how Nassrallah was killed last week.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h182qqt0a	2024-10-04T09:47:10-07:00

Inbar's baby looks for his murdered mother at night	Inbar Segev Vigder was murdered on the night of the Iranian missile strike in a shooting attack in Jaffa; She died protecting her 9-month-old son: 'He will not want for anything' Yaari Vigder, whose wife Inbar was murdered in the shooting attack in Jaffa on the eve of the Iranian attack, told Ynet, 'I don't know where we will continue our lives, in Jaffa or in Tel Aviv. It depends on our ability to contain the event.' Inbar was murdered on the light rail, while she was protecting their son Ari who was in a carrier. 'I got there and started turning over Zaka bags. I was looking for Inbar and Ari. I didn't listen to the police who told me to go to the safe zone because of the missiles,' Yaari said. 'I arrived at the hospital and I was upset there as well. I searched for them like crazy. Our story is very special, but I'm leaving out the details because it already feels excessive to me.' He described that despite the chaos, Ari is in good hands. 'He is surrounded from all sides. This is my new life mission, to make sure that he does not want for anything. The warmth of love, first-class treatment and the education that Inbar wanted him to receive. I receive help from my parents these days, my mother tries to feed Ari at night,' he said. His son Ari, only nine months old, is still breastfeeding and was sleeping with his mother in the same bed until her death. 'I feel that he is managing to adapt. I put my bed next to his bed to get up at night, to hear Ari. When he woke up I fed him and he didn't want to eat. I saw that he didn't fall asleep so I picked him up and put him with me, on a mattress on the floor. He used to wake up several times at night, but today he woke up only at half past five in the morning,' he added. Several women from all over the country donated breast milk to Yaari's son. 'He started daycare in September and Inbar pumped for him. He started eating solids but drank only her pumped milk. The nights were also all Inbar's, she would put him to sleep by breastfeeding. I would see them asleep together. At night he looked for her. I feel that the mother's milk supported him and gave him comfort. We have a lot of supplies in the freezer and also in the milk bank. I respond to women that we don't need milk anymore.' 'I didn't take for granted that people would mobilize to help us, but an amazing thing is happening here. People are coming together for a common goal. Here is our personal tragedy that has received national attention. Everyone feels a part of this pain. I thank every mother who heard about our story and offered to give the most intimate thing between her and her baby. The giving surrounds us, it is so symbolic of my Inbar,' he said. However, he explained that he still does not know when he will use the donated milk. 'Breastfeeding, beyond the nutritional values, is the personal and deep connection between Inbar and Ari. Today it is less relevant. We need to understand how to make the transition because this period will be saturated with changes.' The shiva, which is not held due to the holiday, will be held for a few days next week in an alternative mourning ceremony. At the same time, parents all over the country have taken part in the social media trend to post photos with their babies in carriers in Inbar's memory. 'Ever since Ari was born, he was in a carrier,' said Yaari. 'Inbar would have been very happy to see this campaign. She would like to strengthen the bond between mothers and their babies.' In addition, Inbar and Yaari's friends launched a fundraising campaign to raise donations. 'Little Ari lost his mother Inbar, who was murdered in the terrible attack in Jaffa. At the age of 9 months, he has to learn to live without a mother, and we want to ensure that his life will be as good and stable as possible,' the campaign page reads.

Where is safer, Lebanon or Syria? the dilemma of refugees fleeing...	Syrians who escaped their country and the abuse of the regime, now forced by the Beirut government to return home; Assad remains quiet in his palace overlooking Damascus expressing a tepid regret at Nasrallah's assassination Long lines move slowly toward the Masnaa border crossing between Lebanon and Syria as Syrian civilians try to make their way out of Lebanon's war with Israel. It costs $100 for anyone over 18 to cross, children are free. 17-year-old Shatilah describes how her father begged the Syrian border officials to agree to only half that sum because it was all he had. Those crossing are mainly women and children. Syrian men between 16 and 35 years of age, do not enter Syria, fearing being sent to military training camps. The regime called them to come home but did not elaborate on the fate that awaited them. There is a slow evacuation of Syrian refugees, who escaped their own country in recent months or the past year or two ago, fleeing Israeli attacks and the abuse of the Syria regime. Syrian soldiers board the buses on the border and search them, pulling people out for more intensive investigations before instructing the driver to continue on to Damascus where more searches and questioning will take place. Buses heading to Idlib, carry those identified as supporters of the opposition to Assad and they will remain in the city which is surrounded by government troops, and will be unable to leave. Their names are registered and they will face their punishment later, according to Adalah, a 20-year-old Syrian who said that was why he intended to stay on the Lebanese side of the border. Some 1.5 Syrian refugees were in Lebanon. A staggering figure for a country with a population of just 5 million. They were willing to do any work, for any pay, just to survive. When the exodus from South Lebanon began, and the IDF dropped leaflets warning of the pending attacks, the Syrians packed up quickly. They did not decide to go home. It was the decision of the Lebanese government. Syrian President Hafez al Assad remains in his secluded palace overlooking Damascus. He's heard the rumors that his brother Mahr was killed in an Israeli strike on his home where he hosted senior Iranian military officials. He commands the Syrian military's 4th division but is also in charge of the security detail that protects the president. He also maintains strong ties to his counterpart in Iran. Assad has not uttered one public word since Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, whom he admired. The messages of condolence from the Syrian regime were tepid. Assad's wife Asma is fighting cancer again and may be in Russia for treatments and his mistress was killed in mysterious circumstances last July, probably at the hands of Iran, shortly before escaping to Russia.

Military says anti-tank missiles, rockets and launchers found inside homes by forces on the ground to remove Hezbollah threat from north, trucks carrying concrete brought in to block Hezbollah attack tunnels Massive amounts of munitions remain in South Lebanon and cameras placed by Hezbollah operatives in the terrain, provide terrorists with intelligence on IDF troop movements and deployment. The forces that began a ground incursion into Lebanon earlier this week, have already uncovered many advanced anti-tank missiles. The IDF revealed on Friday that its troops operating in South Lebanon have found massive amounts of weapons and terror infrastructure inside villages and homes. The ground operations aim is to remove them and prevent the terror group from using them to attack northern Israel. 'Over the past 24 hours, the troops discovered rocket launcher munitions, anti-tank missiles, and rockets - inside a residential home,' the military said in a statement. 'The weapons were found by a bed and a picture of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The troops also located and confiscated dozens of weapons left behind in buildings and civilian homes in southern Lebanon. The weapons located include rocket launchers aimed at Israeli territory, anti-tank missiles, firearms, observation posts, and an explosive device buried by the enemy in the area.' The IDF said it was transporting truckloads of concrete to block tunnels, and blowing up others, while at least 100 terrorists have been killed. Israel also suffered casualties after nine soldiers were killed in the fighting. The military said it has observed increasing Iranian efforts to arm Hezbollah and has therefore launched strikes on the border region between Lebanon and Syria including destroying underground tunnels used for arms smuggling. On Thursday, the air force attacked a border crossing point at Masnaa, operated by the Lebanese government claiming it was used to bring in arms for Hezbollah. IDF Arabic language spokesperson Major Avichay Adaree said that since Israel attacked Hezbollah run border crossings late last month, which were the main access point for weapons, the Masnaa border, became the primary source of weapons being brought into Lebanon.

Nasrallah was pearl of Lebanon, Khamenei says	Iran's Supreme leader says October 7 massacre justified, missile strike on Israel, minimal response to its crimes; source says Nasrallah buried in temporary grave fearing Israeli attack on mass funeral Iran's Supreme leader Ali Khamenei said on Friday that the Hamas massacre of October 7 was justified. The Iranian leader spoke in a rare appearance leading Friday prayers in Tehran, speaking in Arabic. He also said the Iranian missile attack on Israel was minimal in light of its crimes and said Iran and its regional proxies would not back down from Israel. 'The brilliant action of our armed forces a couple of nights ago was completely legal and legitimate', Khamenei said. He referred to slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as 'a dear brother and source of pride.' calling him the pearl of Lebanon and claiming his influence went beyond the borders of Lebanon and the Arab world. 'Nasrallah was the flag of resistance, the voice of the oppressed. Under his leadership Hezbollah grew one step after the other. The enemy thought it could defeat it by killing its leaders, by destruction and harm to civilians but it was unable to hurt Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic Jihad and other movements', Khamenei said. An official close to Hezbollah told the AFP earlier that Nasrallah had been temporarily buried in a secret location fearing Israel would target a large funeral. 'Hassan Nasrallah has been temporarily buried until the circumstances allow for a public funeral,' the source said. The Iranian regime came under criticism after Nasrallah's assassination for failing to respond to Israeli attacks including the killing of senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last July. Friday's appearance was the first time in four years that the Supreme leader chose to lead prayers in Tehran, after the assassination of Quds force commander Qasem Soleimani by the United States, and his speech in Arab made clear that it was directed at Iran's proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. 'Al-Aqsa Flood was the Palestinian's natural right,' he said referring to the massacre on October 7. 'Defense of the people of Lebanon, and Gaza is legitimate and no one can have the right to condemn it. So was the latest Iranian operation,' he said. He then addressed the Hezbollah's armed terrorists and said defense of that country was the duty of all Muslims. 'The bloodshed must not weaken your resolve. The resistance will not back down because of the death of its people, and victory will be hers.' Khamenei said the U.S. aims to turn Israel into the source of energy for the West and to import Western goods into the Middle East. 'Reality shows us that all the attacks against our enemies are a service to the entire region and to humanity.'

Israel attacks Lebanon civilian border crossing to Syria	IDF says after Hezbollah-run crossings are attacked late last month, Masnaa crossing run by government becomes primary source of arms flowing for into Lebanon for use by terror group Israeli strikes sealed off Lebanon's main border crossing with Syria early on Friday, hours after an intense Israeli attack on Beirut's southern suburbs that is thought to have targeted the heir apparent to Hezbollah's slain secretary general. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen Network said traffic at the Masnaa crossing, going both ways across the border, which had seen some 300,000 people, mostly Syrians, flee Lebanon to Syria, was stopped. Lebanese Transportation Minister Ali Hamieh said the attack near the border crossing created a large crater forcing people to walk across the frontier. Israeli officials said that the crossing was used to bring in arms for Hezbollah although weapons will likely still make their way across the border to replenish the arsenal of the Iran-backed terror group after much of its armaments were destroyed in Israeli attacks. IDF Arabic language spokesperson Major Avichay Adaree said that since Israel attacked Hezbollah run border crossings late last month, which were the main access point for weapons, the Masnaa border, operated by the Lebanese government and used by civilians, has been the primary source of weapons being brought into Lebanon. The military returned to strike heavy machinery that was brought in to repair the crossings that were attacked. 'Hezbollah's 4400 unit began transporting weapons, we believe is for use in South Lebanon,' Adaree said. 'We attacked a truck carrying weapons on Wednesday and it was full of armaments, judging by the secondary explosions, we saw,' he said.

The strike described as powerful comes soon after IDF's Arabic Language spokesperson Major Avichay Adaree, warns residents of the area to quickly evacuate to safety if they were near Hezbollah infrastructure or assets Air Force fighter jets dropped some 73 tons of bombs on the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut, the Dahieh, overnight in the strike targeting the presumptive new leader-to-be of the terror group Hashem Safieddine. According to a report in the New York Times, a high-level meeting of senior members of Hezbollah had been taking place in an underground bunker there when the strike occurred. Officials in Israel believe Hashem Safieddine, designated to replace slain Hassan Nasrallah, may have been in the bunker that was attacked although his fate early on Saturday, remains unknown. Military officials said the targeted attacks on Hezbollah leaders, disrupt the terror group's ability to re-arm and command its troops to action. The strike that began close to midnight on Thursday was described as powerful and came soon after IDF's Arabic Language spokesperson Major Avichay Adaree, warned residents of the area to quickly evacuate to safety if they were near Hezbollah infrastructure or assets. A source close to Hezbollah said the IDF strike formed a ring of fire around the targeted area and at least 11 waves of bombings took place, one after the other. More strikes on the Dahieh were reported in the later overnight hours. Rescue operations continued throughout the morning.

Rescued Yazidi captive says life in Gaza unbearable	Fawzia Amin kidnapped as a child by ISIS and trafficked to Gaza tells reporters of her horrific journey; had contacted Israeli reporter asking for help Yazidi woman Fawzia Amin, who was rescued from Gaza told CNN that she was kidnapped as a child when ISIS captured Iraq's northern city of Sinjar and since then was trafficked across several counties over the next few years. 'We ended up in Al-Hol camp [in Syria] before we were smuggled to Idlib in 2019, and from there, we went to Turkey. In 2020, they arranged a passport for me in Turkey so I could fly from Istanbul to Hurghada, Egypt, and then to Gaza,' she said. For the past year, she had been in the southern part of the Gaza Strip in Rafah where life, she said was unbearable until she was rescued. 'Hamas constantly harassed me due to my Yazidi background and contact with my family, even going so far as to format my phone during their investigations,' she said. Amin contacted Roi Kais, an Israeli journalist with Kan Broadcasting Authority, and sent him a photo of her fake I.D. identifying her as Mariam Mohamed. She said she had been abducted by a group she could not name and was in Mouassi in Khan Younis, on her own. To show she was there she then turned her camera on the destruction around her that she said was caused by Israeli attacks and asked for help to get out of there. She asked Kais not to report on her story. According to the IDF, her rescue marks a complex political-diplomatic process carried out with the aid of Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). Fawzia was taken from her home in Iraq to Syria after she was kidnapped, where she was purchased by a Palestinian ISIS supporter who brought her to Gaza. She was forced to bear his children, and he later returned to Syria, where he was reportedly killed in an attack. However, the terrorist’s family continued to hold the woman hostage until her recent release. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sido’s release, now 21 years old, noting that it was carried out 'via a joint effort with the international intelligence service,' without mentioning Israel's role or the fact she was held in Gaza. According to Iraq’s foreign ministry, the release was coordinated 'in close collaboration with the U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Amman, as well as Jordanian authorities, after over four months of efforts and monitoring.' The ministry also mentioned that Sido was moved between several countries before being released. Her family said they were able to be in contact with her and that she told them she was in Gaza but claimed she had been brainwashed and asked them to leave her there. The Israeli Foreign Ministry’s digital diplomacy division head David Saranga announced the rescue on Thursday and said, 'Fauzia was held captive by a Palestinian Hamas-ISIS member for years. Now, she has reunited with her family. Her story is a reminder of the cruelty faced by Yazidi children who were taken by force. Some 101 Israelis are still held hostage in Gaza.'

US President Biden does not believe there will be 'all-out-war' i...	I think we can avoid it. But there is a lot to do yet, a lot to do yet,' Biden tells reporters as global oil prices surge, amid traiders concern over potential supply disruptions U.S. President Joe Biden said he did not believe there is going to be an 'all-out war' in the Middle East, as Israel weighs options for retaliation after Tehran's largest-ever assault on its arch-enemy. However, Biden said more needed to be done to avoid a Middle East war, as Israel's military hit Beirut with new air strikes in its battle against Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Asked by reporters in Washington on Thursday how confident he was that such a war could be averted, Biden said, 'How confident are you it's not going to rain? Look, I don't believe there is going to be an all-out war. I think we can avoid it. But there is a lot to do yet, a lot to do yet.' While the United States, the European Union, and other allies have called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire in the Israel-Lebanon conflict, Biden said the U.S. was discussing with Israel its options for responding to Tehran's assault, which included Israel striking Iran's oil facilities. 'We're discussing that,' Biden told reporters. His comments contributed to a surge in global oil prices, and rising Middle East tension has made traders worry about potential supply disruptions. 'There is nothing going to happen today,' Biden added. Asked later if he was urging Israel not to attack Iran's oil installations, Biden said he would not negotiate in public. On Wednesday, the president said he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites. A U.S. official said Washington did not believe Israel had decided yet how to respond to Iran. Israel says its operations in Lebanon seek to allow tens of thousands of its citizens to return home after Hezbollah bombardments during the Gaza war forced them to evacuate from its north. Early on Friday, Lebanon's health ministry said 27 people were killed and 151 wounded over the prior day. Hezbollah says it has repelled several land operations by Israeli troops, with measures such as ambushes and direct clashes. The group said it killed 17 Israeli military personnel in combat in southern Lebanon on Thursday, citing its field and security sources. Israeli forces did not comment on the claim.

Israeli strikes on Beirut target potential new Hezbollah chief	Israeli officials tell U.S. media outlets attacks on Hezbollah's stronghold in the Lebanese capital were to go after Hashem Safieddine in an underground bunker after residents urged to leave the area The Air Force conducted targeted strikes on Hezbollah's stronghold in the Dahieh sector of Beirut overnight, targeting Hashem Safieddine, rumored successor to its assassinated leader Hassan Nasrallah, in an underground bunker, according to reports. After warning residents in the area to evacuate, The IDF bombed an underground bunker using bunker-busting munitions, to eliminate him. Arab media reports claimed Safieddine. His fate remains unknown. Designated as Nasrallah’s successor since the 1990s, Safieddine was brought back to Beirut from his studies in Iran to head Hezbollah’s Executive Council just two years after Nasrallah assumed leadership. He is also related by marriage to Qassem Soleimani, the former commander of Iran’s Quds Force, who was killed by a U.S. strike in 2020. Safieddine, on the U.S. terror list since 2017, has managed Hezbollah’s education system, finances and foreign investments, leaving military and strategic matters to Nasrallah. He has maintained close ties with Tehran and supports the Iranian regime, with his brother Abdullah serving as Hezbollah’s envoy to Iran. Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel reported on Monday that Hezbollah's Shura Council has chosen Hashem Safieddine as the organization's new secretary-general.

Israeli jets strikes in West Bank city of Tulkarem	Israeli fighter jet targeted a house with terrorists following a parade for a recently released prisoner; Among the dead was the commander of the terror organization in the Tulkarm refugee camp The IDF carried an airstrike on Thursday targeting a house with terrorists in the West Bank city of Tulkarm. According to Palestinian reports, 16 people were killed in the attack, including Raed Radwan, the commander of the terror group in the Tulkarm refugee camp. Palestinians claimed that shortly before the strike, a parade had been held for a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, who had been released from Israeli prison after 20 years. The event was attended by many armed individuals. This is the first airstrike in Tulkarm by a fighter jet since the Second Intifada. Until now, in the few instances where the IDF has used airstrikes in the West Bank, they targeted Jenin and Nablus. In August, the head of the terror group in the Nur Shams refugee camp, Mohammed Jaber (Abu Shujaa), was killed. He had been involved in multiple attacks, including the June attack in Qalqilya that killed Amnon Mukhtar, 67. Jaber commanded around 30 terrorists in the camp. Security officials have noted a significant difference between the popularity of terrorists on social media, particularly those from refugee camps, and their relatively low level of local support. For terror groups, social media is a crucial tool for glorifying attackers and recruiting young followers. The most recent IDF airstrike in Jenin was in May, targeting a terror operations center. Islam Khamaiseh, a wanted terrorist, was killed in that strike. For years, since the end of Operation Defensive Shield, the IDF refrained from airstrikes in the West Bank. However, due to the surge in terror attacks last year — even before the current war — that policy has shifted, and aerial targeted killings in the area have resumed.

We won't let Hezbollah resettle on the border' IDF chief says	IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi says the main goal of the Lebanon operation is to establish security in the north and allow the returning of the residents to their homes after over a year of being displaced During the holiday on Thursday, IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, conducted a situational assessment at the command centers of the IDF’s 98th and 36th Divisions, both of which are currently operating in southern Lebanon. In his remarks, Halevi said: 'Throughout the holiday, the IDF continues to operate intensely in Lebanon and in other arenas. I met with the commanders and soldiers of the 98th Division and the 36th Division, who are operating in Lebanon for a very important mission — establishing security in the north and returning the residents to their homes after over a year of being displaced.' 'Returning the residents means destroying the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah has built near the border so they could raid our communities and kill Israeli civilians when given the order. We are very determined to destroy this infrastructure and eliminate anyone present there. We will not allow Hezbollah to settle in these places. The damage to Hezbollah in all sectors — Beirut, the Beqaa Valley, and southern Lebanon — will continue.' 'Our troops in Lebanon are eliminating more and more terrorists — every encounter ends with us having the upper hand. Our troops are more prepared and trained than ever, bearing the experience from the operations in Gaza, and their advantage in the combat arena is clear. The troops are supported by aerial and ground firepower capabilities, and they are operating courageously. 'I heard the initial findings from the battles in which we lost brave soldiers who fell heroically while fighting Hezbollah terrorists. I saw commanders who advanced in the face of fire, leading their soldiers forward, and courageously defeating the enemy. We will continue to fight in light of the heroism of these soldiers, and we will support and embrace their beloved families. 'Today, I also met with the reservists, who left their homes, families, and jobs and are here with us, bringing much experience, knowledge, and a strong spirit. I have great appreciation for the reservists, the soldiers, and the commanders in regular duty, as well as for their families.

Drug sale flyers distributed in schools across Tel Aviv	Parents in Tel Aviv discovered that flyers offering a menu of drugs for quick orders were distributed in many schools; 'The children also received messages from blocked numbers' says coordinator of the high school forum at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Parents' Committee Drug sale flyers were found in several schools across Tel Aviv, offering a list and prices for a quick order of various drugs. The list included cocaine, 2C-B psychedelic drugs, ketamine, and ecstasy. After several children brought the flyers home to ask their parents about them, alarmed parents reached out to the city council and the police, revealing that this is a widespread issue. 'This is not just a phenomenon in Tel Aviv; it's happening all over the country,' said Shira Imraglik, coordinator of the high school forum at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Parents' Committee. 'We've been contacted by dozens of parents from across Tel Aviv. Flyers were distributed at school entrances, in nearby parks, and at community centers. It spread from child to child. In addition to the physical flyers, children are receiving messages on WhatsApp from anonymous numbers. This is a life-threatening issue that could lead children into serious drug trafficking or use. Parents were horrified.' According to her, 'The person behind the phone number on these specific flyers was quickly apprehended by the police, but we know that drug trafficking continues to take place around schools. Couriers are coming on bikes and exploiting the naivety of children.' The Israel Police stated, 'The Israel Police is actively combating the scourge of drugs in all its aspects, utilizing all available means and resources across various platforms to ensure the safety and health of citizens, especially young people.'

Heroic Egoz commandos Lebanon battle thwarted abduction of fallen...	The Egoz troops stormed to a building and engaged in point-blank combat to prevent any possibility of an abduction; This scenario was trained for years to counter such incidents in Lebanon, especially during preparations for ground operations Initial details from the intense combat in southern Lebanon early Wednesday revealed that Egoz commandos stormed a building to engage Hezbollah terrorists at close range, aiming to prevent any potential abduction. At the same time, Israeli air forces targeted vehicles from Hezbollah's Radwan unit, which were approaching the site—likely in an attempt to capture the fallen soldier's body. Shortly after the initial clash inside the building where the battle began, one of the fallen soldiers was lying near surviving Hezbollah terrorists. Fearing the body might be taken, the soldiers quickly encircled the building. The fallen soldier’s comrades stormed the building, engaging in close combat with the terrorists. Meanwhile, Egoz Unit's drone team identified reinforcement vehicles from the Radwan unit approaching, possibly to seize the body and escape. The vehicles were struck by air, and the terrorists inside were neutralized. For years, Israeli forces have trained for combat scenarios in Lebanon, including the threat of soldier abductions, especially during preparations for ground operations. Hezbollah has long viewed abductions as a potential strategic achievement in its battles with Israel. Consequently, specific guidelines were given to the soldiers, outlining how to respond to such scenarios under all circumstances—both during advances and in direct combat with terrorists. These procedures were thoroughly tested by IDF 'red teams' tasked with simulating abductions during Lebanon-related drills. In Wednesday's Egoz battle, weather conditions were harsh, with heavy fog and complete darkness. The Israeli Air Force bombarded nearby routes and buildings, including a mosque where some of the terrorists had fled. The mosque was destroyed, with at least 30 terrorists killed in the strike. Around 30 Israeli soldiers were wounded in the battle, and at least four injured soldiers continued to fight. The fallen Egoz soldiers are Captain Harel Etinger, 23, from Eli, and Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, from Modi'in Maccabim Re'ut, both served as squad commanders in the elite Egoz Unit of the Commando Brigade; Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir Tzur Yigal, Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, 21, from Beit Aryeh-Ofarim, and Sergeant First Class Nazaar Itkin, 21, from Kiryat Ata, all soldiers in the Egoz Unit; Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from Shoham, an officer in the Yahalom Unit of the Combat Engineering Corps.

Watch: Fox News reporter walks in Hezbollah tunnel	American outlet correspondent Trey Yingst joins IDF soldiers in overnight After the IDF reported on Thursday it had eliminated 15 Hezbollah terrorists in a southern Lebanon air and ground operation, Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst, who accompanied the troops overnight, revealed footage of himself with the forces inside a tunnel in southern Lebanon. 'It’s in tunnels and rooms like these, the Israelis say they are finding Iranian weapons that were smuggled first to Syria and then into southern Lebanon,' Yingst said while walking through the tunnel which he said is located less than a kilometer from the Israeli border. According to him, soldiers who walked ahead of him had to cross minefields and navigate difficult terrain to reach it. 'Our war is not with the Lebanese civilians,' one of the soldiers inside the tunnel told the Fox News reporter. 'Our war is with Hezbollah, who after the 7th of October began firing almost 10,000 rockets at Israeli civilians. Unlike them, we do not target civilians, we target terrorist infrastructures.' The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit addressed the overnight operation, saying, 'The IAF, with the direction of the IDF Northern Command, struck approximately 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in Lebanese territory, including terrorist infrastructure sites, terrorists, weapons storage facilities, observation posts, and additional terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon.'

Yazidi woman kidnapped by ISIS in Iraq rescued from Gaza by Israe...	Foreign Ministry says Fawzia Amin Sido was taken captive at 11 and sold to terror group supporter in Gaza, where she was held for 10 years before being reunited with her family Fawzia Amin Sido, 21, a young Yazidi woman kidnapped from her home in Iraq by Islamic State terrorists in 2014 when she was just 11 years old, was rescued from Gaza by IDF forces and reunited with her family in her home country. The woman’s rescue marks a complex political-diplomatic process after which Sido was released after ten years in captivity with the aid of Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). According to various reports, Fawzia was taken from her home in Iraq to Syria after she was kidnapped, where she was purchased by a Palestinian ISIS supporter who brought her to Gaza. She was forced to bear his children, and he later returned to Syria, where he was reportedly killed in an attack. However, the terrorist’s family continued to hold the woman hostage until her recent release. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sido’s release, now 21 years old, noting that it was carried out 'via a joint effort with the international intelligence service,' without mentioning Israel's role or the fact she was held in Gaza. According to Iraq’s foreign ministry, the release was coordinated 'in close collaboration with the U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Amman, as well as Jordanian authorities, after over four months of efforts and monitoring.' The ministry also mentioned that Sido was moved between several countries before being released. The Israeli Foreign Ministry’s digital diplomacy division head David Saranga announced the rescue on Thursday and said, 'Fauzia was held captive by a Palestinian Hamas-ISIS member for years. Now, she has reunited with her family. Her story is a reminder of the cruelty faced by Yazidi children who were taken by force. Some 101 Israelis are still held hostage in Gaza.'

A year of war: Israel's struggles and triumphs on multiple fronts	Failures of October 7 yet to be investigated; with 101 hostages in captivity, political dawdling on Gaza's future and displaced northern residents, uncertainty persists; yet the IDF’s recovery offers hope; a look back to a year that changed everything I’m optimistic this Rosh Hashana because of the tremendous motivation demonstrated by the masses who wanted to fight alongside the Gaza border region residents and rescue them from the inferno on October 7. I’m optimistic because of the motivation of regular and reservist soldiers I’ve seen in all the fighting sectors; because of the civilian general public’s motivation to help the wounded and conserve the Third Temple as a Jewish and democratic state. My long years of experience reporting wars have proven to me, beyond doubt, that the winner is the side that’s motivated, and determined to fight to live. So, I believe we’ll be here for generations to come. A year on since October 7, 2023, and the best comfort, perhaps the best medicine, is the rapid recovery, within hours or days, of Israel’s civilian population and the IDF from the shock and rage. Hundreds of reservists and civilians on that terrible Shabbat were driven by grief and horror to come to the aid of the communities under attack. Along with the IDF’s faltering response, this was Israel’s counterattack against the two commando divisions Hamas sent into Israeli territory. Were it not for this counterattack by security squads, IDF special forces units, at their own initiative running into fire, civilians who took up weapons and came from great distances to help the Gaza Periphery residents, the disaster could have been many times worse. Hamas could have conquered considerable territory in the south and the losses, horrors and damage immeasurably greater. But the lessons of October 7 and the failures that led to it should be left to the IDF’s authorized commissions of inquiry. We’re still in the midst of the Iron Swords war, referred to by some as an existential war, and from a strategic perspective, the ability to exist in the region as a sovereign Jewish state, it is indeed an existential war. So, it’s worth trying to understand where Israel has succeeded and where, somewhat less. In A Year of War, a series of articles for Rosh Hashana, Ynet surveys the results of the war to this point, starting with the terrible failure, through the achievements and mistakes, through to the picture right now. ******************************************************************************************* After October 7: The IDF's six successes that shaped the war Following the military's colossal failure during Hamas' attack on southern Israel, it quickly recuperated and acted decisively against Israel's enemies; these are its greatest achievements so far READ HERE ******************************************************************************************* The IDF’s five major setbacks following October 7 Over 60,000 Israelis remain internally displaced by Hezbollah, revealing the army's struggle to fight on two fronts; meanwhile, Hamas still holds hostages, with Sinwar rejecting every proposal as he hopes for a regional war that will shift the balance in his favor READ HERE ******************************************************************************************* Israel’s complex battle across multiple fronts since October 7 Reeling from the Hamas massacre, the IDF focused on Gaza while gradually wearing down Hezbollah in the north before launching a ground offensive; meanwhile, Israel works to contain West Bank unrest, as Iran’s assault presents new regional opportunities READ HERE ******************************************************************************************* The IDF’s four force multipliers after October 7 Amid harsh war in Gaza and growing conflagration on the northern border, the military counted on four critical components to bolster itself READ HERE Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by9kge2cr	2024-10-03T03:48:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/BJKNKwYCC/BJKNKwYCC_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF, Shin Bet confirm Sinwar confidant Rawhi Mushtaha eliminated	Military says precise strike in Gaza eliminated Hamas' government head in the enclave alongside two other senior terror group officials The IDF and Shin Bet confirmed on Thursday that the terrorist Rawhi Mushtaha, who headed Hamas’ government in the Gaza Strip, was eliminated in a joint strike in the enclave. Two other terrorists, Sameh al-Siraj who held the security portfolio on Hamas' politburo and Hamas' Labor Committee — and Sami Oudeh, commander of Hamas' General Security Mechanism were also killed. 'IAF fighter jets struck and eliminated the terrorists while they were hiding in a fortified and equipped underground compound in the northern Gaza Strip. The compound served as a Hamas command and control center and enabled senior operatives to remain inside of it for extended periods of time,' the IDF and Shin Bet said in a statement. 'The compound was managed by senior members of Hamas' General Security Mechanism and functioned as a hideout for the Hamas leadership, led by Mushtaha.' Hamas hasn’t officially announced the officials’ death in order to avoid lowering the morale of its operatives, as it did with the cases of Mohammad Deif and other eliminations in Gaza. 'Rawhi Mushtaha was one of Hamas' most senior operatives and had a direct impact on decisions relating to Hamas' force deployment. Mushtaha was involved in military decisions while also acting as the Head of Hamas Civil Governance in the Gaza Strip and holding the Prisoners Affairs Portfolio. He also formerly held the finance portfolio,' the military added. Mushtaha served a 22-year prison sentence in Israel before being released in the Gilad Shalit release deal in 2011. He was arrested by Israel for his involvement in the abduction of two IDF soldiers in 1988. 'Mushtaha, alongside Yahya Sinwar, established Hamas' General Security Mechanism. They served a prison sentence together in an Israeli jail. Mushtaha was considered to be the most senior figure in the Hamas political bureau in the Gaza Strip, and during the war maintained civil control of the Hamas regime, while simultaneously engaging in terrorist activity against Israel. Mushtaha was Sinwar's right-hand man and one of his closest associates,' the IDF and Shin Bet’s statement read. 'The IDF and ISA will continue to pursue all of the terrorists responsible for the October 7th massacre and will operate against anyone who threatens the State of Israel.'

Military reports it targeted over 200 Hezbollah assets across Lebanon in overnight ground and air operation including in Bint Jbeil The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Thursday that air and ground units targeted Bint Jbeil’s municipality complex and eliminated 15 Hezbollah terrorists inside it overnight. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization systematically violates international law, while brutally exploiting government and civilian buildings as well as the population as human shields for terrorist activity, in order to harm IDF soldiers and the civilians of the State of Israel,' the military said in a statement. 'The IAF, with the direction of the IDF Northern Command, struck approximately 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in Lebanese territory, including terrorist infrastructure sites, terrorists, weapons storage facilities, observation posts, and additional terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon,' it added. The IDF also added Air Force fighter jets targeted 'terrorists who fired missiles yesterday toward the area of the Ramim Ridge alongside terrorists who fired projectiles at IDF soldiers operating in southern Lebanon.' 'Furthermore, IDF soldiers identified terrorists that launched projectiles toward additional IDF soldiers operating in southern Lebanon. The IAF swiftly struck and eliminated the terrorists,' the military said. 'This morning, over the past few hours, two Hezbollah terrorists fired at soldiers from the Golani Brigade operating in the area. The IAF swiftly struck the terrorists and no IDF injuries were reported.' The strike comes after Lebanese reports said the IDF struck central Beirut Thursday overnight, killing at least 46 terrorists.

The IDF’s four force multipliers after October 7	Recap: Amid harsh war in Gaza and growing conflagration on the northern border, the military counted on four critical components to bolster itself 1. Israeli Air Force: The Israeli Air Force's systems and capabilities have remained the primary factor enabling Israel to handle a multi-front war successfully for nearly a year. This includes strategic levels (repelling Iran's missile attack and carrying out strikes in Yemen), operational levels (executing strikes in Gaza and pushing Radwan forces away from the northern border), and tactical levels (eliminating a terrorist cell that planted an explosive on a busy road near Tulkarm). It's important to stress the almost unimaginable interception capabilities of Israel’s air defense systems, which protect the home front and give lawmakers flexibility in reaching operational decisions. Another noteworthy point is the Air Force headquarters' ability to plan and execute quality operations in record time based on emerging military intelligence. Examples include the elimination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in his Beirut bunker and the strikes in Yemen. An equally significant achievement was the management of ammunition and resources, allowing Israel to maintain diplomatic freedom of action even in cases of disagreements with the U.S. There are two critical lessons from the Air Force's outstanding success: first, the Air Force must continue to rely on advanced, manned fighter jets and helicopters for the coming years. Drones are important but can't provide the same flexibility and diverse operational options as a manned air fleet. The second conclusion is that the Air Force must be closely involved in border defense, as it currently operates alongside ground forces in Gaza and the northern border. The large forces now defending the borders must include an integral air support. 2. The Intelligence Corps: Over the past year, especially following October 7’s failures, the IDF intelligence target gathering unit has stood out. Its deployed array, alongside the Shin Bet, has provided high-quality, detailed and reliable strategic and tactical intelligence. The intelligence network delivers information to the firepower and ground units, directing operations both above and below ground. The effective cooperation between the Shin Bet and the Military Intelligence Directorate, which has grown tighter, produced human intelligence of a quantity and quality that contributed significantly to defeating Hamas. This was crucial not only in locating key underground tunnel shafts but also in supporting efforts to free hostages and recover bodies. This cooperation likely stemmed from a shared sense of guilt among the leadership of both agencies over the failures that led to the massacre. 3. Combat engineers and special units: During the war in Gaza, combat engineers, along with special forces from both compulsory and reserve units became a significant force multiplier by destroying Gaza's main underground fighting systems. IDF Southern Command Chief Major General Yaron Finkelman realized that Hamas and Islamic Jihad would retain the ability to wage endless guerrilla warfare even after their battalions were dismantled and half their terrorists were killed should these abilities remain in place. The challenge was identifying the correct tunnel shaft through military intelligence, descending into it without soldiers being harmed by explosives or ambushes, and then moving through the tunnel to uncover what's inside — documents, computers, command posts, money and other items that could advance the release of hostages. Along the way, forces had to deal with thick metallic blast doors, explosives and rigged explosives. Combat engineers and special units continue to operate in this manner in an accelerated manner. 'We're seeing this mission through,' said Southern Command's combat engineering chief COL Avshalom Dadon several months ago. 'We can almost see the end but it'll take some time. You need to be careful and act according to guidelines when it comes to combat engineering operations above and below ground, or people could get killed.' 4. Advanced technology: The war saw massive and intensive use of advanced technologies across all fronts —from tiny drones that identified Hamas terrorists hiding in rooms and planting explosives, to sophisticated radars and various robots that enabled special forces to fight underground successfully. Moreover, intelligence flows directly from the IDF Intelligence Corps forces on the field. This gains importance given the previous criticism of over-reliance on technology before October 7. It was then thought that technological means could replace a strong, manned military presence to protect the border. Israel in this war saw that technology was a blessing if used correctly. Ultimately, it's the people who determine victory or defeat. This reliance on technology was key to the phenomenal military successes of Operation Northern Arrows.

Israel’s complex battle across multiple fronts since October 7	Recap: Reeling from Hamas massacre, the IDF focused on Gaza while gradually wearing down Hezbollah in the north before launching a ground offensive; meanwhile, Israel works to contain West Bank unrest, as Iran’s assault presents new regional opportunities Gaza: An offensive rollercoaster The IDF's ground offensive in Gaza, initially slow but later accelerated, has been both a success and a source of frustration for field commanders. It is now clear as day that without a ground incursion, it would have been impossible to dismantle the threat. This is primarily because Hamas had a strategic advantage it built for itself in the form of underground tunnel networks, where it hid, fired rockets, produced weapons and managed its war operations. The IDF knew these networks were not necessarily measured by miles but by 'strategic centers of gravity.' As long as these remained intact, Hamas could survive. And as long as it survived, it could recover and launch another attack on Israel. The above-ground structures, located within civilian areas, were also built as regional centers of gravity. The IDF needed to physically reach these sites to eliminate the terrorists operating from them, who defended the shafts leading to the underground. The IDF launched an operation involving three divisions fighting in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. A senior IDF commander remarked, 'If you don’t initiate and attack, at best, you end up with a draw.' This was not a decision made lightly. In the weeks following the massacre, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with various former officials, including retired Major General Yitzhak Brik, who warned him that the IDF was unprepared and incapable of carrying out the mission, which would result in thousands of casualties. The Americans also tried to caution Netanyahu and the IDF General Staff that a ground offensive in Gaza would not only result in losses but would also lead to destruction that Israel would struggle to withstand in the face of global public opinion. What tipped the scales was the insistence of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Operations Directorate Commander Major General Oded Basiuk. They convinced decision-makers that after several weeks of preparation, the IDF would be capable of executing a successful offensive to take control of Gaza, dismantle Hamas' military capabilities and then maintain the achievement through a security perimeter along the Palestinian enclave’s edges and targeted raids on areas where Hamas would attempt to rebuild its forces. The motivation, initiative, rapid mobilization and combat readiness displayed by both the reserves and regular ground forces during the preparation period boosted the confidence of the IDF's top brass, who had been demoralized by the sense of responsibility they felt for the failures of October 7. For the sake of caution, they decided to adhere to the IDF's traditional operational concept—attacking one main front, the center of gravity, while holding off on others. This approach was taken despite the fact that the Air Force could have divided its strength and operated with full force in both the north and the south, as initially planned. Historians will ultimately decide whether the decision to act in Gaza while holding off in the north, and evacuating residents, was justified. But it clearly ensured an efficient use of the IDF's assaulting forces and a prudent management of the military’s stockpile of munitions and equipment. During the waiting period for the ground offensive, the IDF—together with the Shin Bet—refined its tactical approach for coordinating ground and air forces to operate effectively in a large, vertical battlefield, fighting both above and below ground. In the opening phase, it was decided to attack along several axes with tank battalions, infantry and engineering units, closely coordinated with air and ground fire support. One of the innovations was the immediate availability of air support—whether from fighter jets, drones or helicopters—at every stage of the battle, supporting both mounted and foot soldiers. The Air Force was integrated from the planning stages through to the ground combat. Precision munitions of various sizes were dropped on buildings and compounds where intelligence identified enemy forces, sometimes just 100 meters from IDF troops. In thousands of sorties and strikes, there were four cases of friendly fire that injured IDF soldiers. The simultaneous assault on the terrorists' centers of gravity, both above and below ground, initially progressed slowly. The IDF had already informed the political leadership that dismantling the terrorist armies built by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad over decades would take about a year, but the slow pace—especially with the aid of the Engineering Corps’ D9 bulldozers—frustrated some field commanders early on. The underground operations, in particular, advanced heavily and sluggishly. On the other hand, the above-ground fighting unfolded far more effectively and quickly, following the Air Force’s intense so-called 'belt of fire' strikes on high-rise buildings and Hamas resistance hubs before the ground offensive even began. Initially, Hamas battalions emerged from tunnels and launched large-scale counterattacks on the advancing forces, using new types of deadly RPG launchers and proximity explosives attached by militants to tanks and armored vehicles. However, the Trophy active protection systems proved their worth and reduced casualties. Counterattacks—such as at the Force 17 outpost in the Jabalia area and elsewhere—failed. Afterward, terrorists shifted to small-unit tactics, emerging from tunnel shafts to attack, but these proved far less effective. The relatively low number of IDF casualties during the fighting in Gaza and the north was due not only to the protection provided by the armored vehicles and the Trophy systems but also to the defensive tactics the IDF employed. Crucially, rapid evacuation—coupled with life-saving medical care—played a significant role in reducing the toll. A total of 346 IDF soldiers fell during the ground offensive in Gaza, out of 715 killed in the entire war. Some 4,481 were wounded, including 2,298 in Gaza; of those, 20 remain hospitalized in serious condition, 145 in moderate condition and four with minor injuries. The five-phased plan in the north It is now known that for several days, Hassan Nasrallah seriously considered capitalizing on the momentum and shock caused by Hamas' attack to execute Hezbollah's operation to conquer the Galilee, led by the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force. Hezbollah has been planning this operation for at least ten years, and by October 8, 2023, they had 2,400 Radwan fighters and 500 Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives ready for action, heavily armed with explosives to breach concrete walls and fences, as well as ladders for scaling into border-adjacent Israeli communities and IDF outposts in the north. Had this plan been carried out, it would have been catastrophic—far worse than Hamas' attack. However, the rapid deployment of three IDF divisions to the northern border and the efficient defensive preparations, despite the IDF’s primary focus on Gaza, likely caused Nasrallah and Hezbollah’s commanders to decide against exploiting Israel’s confusion and shock following the deadly October 7 attacks in the south. Hezbollah’s plan is prepared, effective and far more dangerous than Hamas’, but the Gazans stole the spotlight. It took a few days for the IDF to be convinced that Nasrallah was content with supporting Hamas through rocket fire and fiery statements of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, despite having the capability to launch a ground invasion into the Galilee. Radwan Force fighters, supported by Hezbollah’s firepower, were positioned right on the border. What also helped restrain Hezbollah was the Israeli Air Force’s readiness for action in the north, as well as the swift deployment of IDF reservists to strategic positions, effectively blocking potential enemy routes. Northern Command faced two primary threats. The most dangerous was the Radwan Force, positioned mere hundreds of feet from Israeli communities and outposts, posing an immediate threat. The second was Hezbollah’s extensive missile arrays, hidden in southern Lebanon and aimed at northern Israel, roughly up to the Haifa-Tiberias line. With the political and military leadership deciding to focus on Gaza as the active front while holding the line in the north, Northern Command, under the guidance of Major General Ori Gordin, formulated a phased action plan. The broad goal was to erode Hezbollah’s strength and prepare the ground for a future operation that would involve aerial bombardments and ground maneuvers, set to launch once the General Staff advised the political echelon to shift the focus from the south. In line with this plan, the IDF initially concentrated on neutralizing the immediate threat posed by the Radwan Force. An additional effort was made to repel infiltration attempts by militant cells from various Palestinian organizations. Since the political and military leadership decided that Gaza would be the active front while the north would be contained, Northern Command, under the guidance of Major General Ori Gordin, developed a phased action plan. The primary goal was to wear down Hezbollah and prepare the ground for a future operation, involving airstrikes and ground operations, to be executed when the General Staff recommended shifting the focus from the south. According to this plan, the IDF first concentrated on eliminating the immediate threat posed by the Radwan Force. Another key effort was repelling infiltration attempts by terrorist cells from various Palestinian organizations. The danger posed by the Radwan Force and the intensified short-range firepower of Hezbollah’s anti-tank missiles and myriad rockets was the reason for the massive evacuation of approximately 60,000 residents from their homes in the Galilee along the border. Some evacuated on orders, while others did so voluntarily. They have yet to return home. In the first phase, Northern Command succeeded in pushing a significant portion of the Radwan Force 3-5 miles away from the border through airstrikes and artillery fire. Hezbollah fighters abandoned their well-fortified positions—some in bunkers and some in trenches—concealed within Lebanon’s mountainous terrain. In the second phase, according to reports, the IDF began sending small ground forces on covert raids into these positions to seize weapons and equipment left behind. Meanwhile, the IDF improved its ability to locate and neutralize Hezbollah's anti-tank missile launchers, forcing them to retreat and reducing their effectiveness. Hezbollah’s attempts to strike with its suicide drones and heavy Burkan and Falaq rockets, based on Nasrallah’s 'eye for an eye' doctrine, met with limited success. In the third phase, alongside efforts to counter drones and rockets, Northern Command focused on eroding Hezbollah’s command and control structure in preparation for a potential ground incursion into Lebanon, possibly reaching the Litani River or beyond. Hezbollah’s field commanders began disappearing in large numbers, as the IDF, using precise intelligence and airstrikes, systematically eliminated them one by one. The fourth phase began in August: Operation Northern Arrows. The opening strike, which stunned Hezbollah and the world, involved the detonation of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies—an action attributed to Israel. But the peak came with the assassination of Nasrallah last Friday. The fifth phase commenced overnight Tuesday this week, with the IDF conducting a limited ground operation aimed at clearing Hezbollah’s rocket-launching sites and Radwan Force positions near the border. The objective is to prevent Hezbollah fighters from launching direct, short-range fire on Israeli border communities and IDF outposts. Once this goal is achieved, the ultimate aim of the war can be pursued: ensuring that the residents of northern Israel can safely return to their homes. West Bank: Avoiding a third Intifada Alongside the fighting in Gaza, Central Command launched an aggressive campaign in the West Bank. The objective was to prevent terrorist groups, inspired by Hamas and Iran, from organizing in refugee camps to attack settlements and targets inside Israel, and to avert the outbreak of a full-scale third Intifada involving the entire West Bank population, which would overwhelm the already stretched IDF forces. This effort has so far been successful. The Iranian offensive: The birth of a regional defense network A significant achievement in the war came during the night of April 13-14, when Iran and its proxies launched a barrage of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and explosive drones at Israel. To repel this attack, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and the IDF General Staff executed a detailed plan that exceeded expectations in its effectiveness. This success laid the groundwork for a potential regional air defense system, which could involve Sunni Arab states in defending against missiles, drones and possibly even Iran's future nuclear capabilities.

Satellite images reveal damage to Israel’s key Air Force base aft...	International outlet presents new photos of Nevatim air base following Iranian missile assault; IDF stresses no damage done to Air Force capabilities Satellite images published released by the international news agency Associated Press (AP) on Thursday revealed the damage caused by Iran's ballistic missile attack on the IDF’s Nevatim air base near Be'er Sheva. The images, taken on Wednesday, show a large hole in the roof of a hangar near the base’s main runway. Debris from the roof is also scattered around the structure. AP noted the IDF has not clarified what caused the damage seen in the images. In addition to the satellite photos, a CNN analysis claimed that missiles launched from Iran struck the Mossad headquarters or near it, as well as Nevatim and the Tel Nof air bases. The IDF confirmed damages were caused to buildings at the bases but stressed that there were no casualties and no aircraft were hit. The attack didn’t affect the Israeli Air Force's operational integrity, as missions could be launched immediately after the assault. A dramatic video recorded on the night of the attack in the Negev Desert — near Nevatim base, which according to foreign reports was targeted by Iran alongside other Air Force bases —showed multiple missile strikes in quick succession. Nevatim, the largest and most critical Air Force base in Israel, was also one of the primary targets of Iran's previous attack in April. The base, located east of Be'er Sheva, hosts three F-35 fighter jet squadrons, as well as transport squadrons operating Super Hercules and Hercules aircraft. It is also home to the Wing of Zion, Israel’s state aircraft.

IDF strike in Gaza eliminates terrorist involved in Ramallah lync...	Military confirms Abdel Aziz Salha killed in targeted strike in the Strip 24 years after proudly showing his bloody hands after murdering two IDF reservists Arab media outlets reported on Thursday that Abdel Aziz Salha was eliminated in an Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah, located in the central Gaza Strip. Salha, who was released as part of the Gilad Shalit release deal in 2011, is remembered for his role in the brutal lynching of IDF reservists Vadim Nurzhitz and Yosef Avrahami in October 2000 in Ramallah, when he presented his bloodied hands outside of a window. On October 12, 2000, Nurzhitz and Avrahami mistakenly entered Ramallah on their way to a military base near the West Bank, instead of bypassing the city through the Hizma checkpoint. As soon as they entered the Palestinian city, they were identified as Israelis by their yellow license plates and a Palestinian mob began pelting their vehicle with stones and attacking them. At one point, they were stuck in a traffic jam, preventing them from driving away. Palestinian policemen took them to the Al-Bireh police station, all while threatening them with rifles. Along the way, the reservists were subjected to brutal violence by the mob, with no attempt by the officers to protect them. Even when the reservists arrived at the police station, the crowd gathered outside, demanding to pull them out and murder them. Eventually, the doors were opened and the crowd, along with Palestinian policemen, beat the two men to death with extreme violence. Their bodies were then thrown into the street, where further abuse continued. Salha, originally from the village of Deir Jarir near Ramallah, admitted during his 2001 arrest that he was part of the mob that stormed the police station and strangled one of the soldiers while others beat him. When he saw his hands covered in the soldiers' blood, he went to the window and proudly displayed them to the crowd below. In 2004, he was convicted of the murder of Corporal Vadim Nurzhitz and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2011, however, he was one of the terrorists released as part of the Shalit release deal.

The IDF’s five major setbacks following October 7	Recap: Over 60,000 Israelis remain displaced by Hezbollah, revealing the army's struggle to fight on two fronts; meanwhile, Hamas still holds hostages, with Sinwar rejecting every proposal as he hopes for a regional war will shift the balance in his favor 1. It’s hard to decide what’s worse: the fact that tens of thousands of residents of the north haven’t been able to return to their homes for almost a year, or the failure of not bringing back the hostages still in Hamas' hands. Either way, in strategic terms, the fact that Hezbollah managed to uproot 60,000 Israelis from their homes and create a broad strip of fire several miles wide along the northern border is a serious failure, unseen since the War of Independence. It has one major root cause: The IDF couldn’t conduct fierce fighting on two fronts. 2. The hostages. The failure isn’t that we haven’t managed to create the conditions and military pressure to make a fanatical religious murderer like Hamas leader Yahyah Sinwar agree to a second deal to release the hostages. I’m not getting into an argument as to whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the security Cabinet missed opportunities for deals, but the basic conditions are rather basic: Hamas can absorb heavy losses such as the destruction of its capabilities and military and civil infrastructure, and still keep functioning as a guerilla organization. Terrorist organizations don’t run a war with clear objectives, and if their forces are seriously harmed, they can’t advance. But terrorist organizations in general, and in Gaza in particular, strive to survive. In this respect, survival in Gaza is victory. This is what Sinwar is going for at this stage, and he’s refusing any deal offered to him. He still believes that a regional war will ease the pressure on him and force Israel, which he believes will be defeated in such a war, to accept his conditions and allow him to restore his, and Hamas’s power. He wants to be like Al Qaida and ISIS, presently restoring themselves under the Taliban in Afghanistan. This is the main reason there’s no hostage deal right now. Sinwar’s views may change or soften in the future in light of the blow dealt to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ongoing successes there - even more so if Iran doesn’t join in the war. Then, he’ll be willing to negotiate a new deal 3. Not managing to bring down Hamas’ civilian control of Gaza and allow Israel to control humanitarian aid going into Gaza would allow the IDF to achieve one of the war’s objectives. This failing is Netanyahu’s and that of the Security Cabinet who have opposed every initiative presented by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the IDF to find ways to set up an alternative civilian government. Netanyahu and his coalition partners from the Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit parties oppose collaborating with the Palestinian Authority regarding civilian rule in Gaza on ideological grounds. And right now, there’s no better alternative to Hamas on the horizon. 4. The well-publicized quarrels with the American administrations that have harmed, and continue to harm, deterrence, efforts to release the hostages and the war effort in general. In most cases, both sides are guilty: The Americans for internal election considerations, and due to incorrect international strategy, keep trying to tie Israel’s hands. I’m not talking about agreeing to the humanitarian effort Washington is forced on us. In this respect, U.S. President Joe Biden probably did us a favor, as if Israel had demoed the evacuees, huddled in 'open shelters,' humanitarian aid, our international legitimacy to fight in Gaza and in the north would have completely eroded and we may be facing sanctions by now. But the Americans weren’t satisfied with waving humanitarian aid in the faces of the right-wing coalition parties, but also tried influencing the war’s path by repeatedly demanding a ceasefire, long before the IDF got as far as Rafiah. They tried this by public warnings of hurting the city’s civilian population, despite the IDF proving to them that it could vacate the population before taking control on the ground. But going into Rafiah, mainly because of the Americans, was put off for months, taking the pressure off Sinwar and harming operational success. 5. We haven’t managed to stop the international wave of delegitimization against the just war conducted so that the residents of the north and south of Israel may safely return home, to be free for years to come, of the threat of mortar fire from surrounding terror armies Most Israelis still struggle to understand how world public opinion can have abandoned them, how they’re trying to bind its hands and accuse them of war crimes after the horrors of October 7. They need to be told that this is not only the outcome of Israel’s failure in public diplomacy and simply that Islamic elements arriving as refugees to Western countries have, over the years, taken hold of politics and changed the cultural-academic conversation to one hostile to Israel, even in places Israel had generally been supported since the 1948 War of Independence. The cultural conversation distorting history, portraying Israel as an evil colonial element, spearheading Western imperialism, overlooking the complex historical facts of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is the primary cause of the collapse of legitimacy. Just as Israel found a way to turn things around military in Lebanon, it needs to find a way to turn things around in terms of international legitimacy.

Israel strikes central Beirut 'for first time since 2006'	Military moves to target Hezbollah assets in the center of Lebanon's capital with local reports claiming at least six were killed in attack The IDF struck at the heart of Lebanon’s capital of Beirut Thursday overnight with local reports alleging the attack also involved Israeli warships. It was later reported the military targeted a complex belonging to the Hezbollah-owned Islamic Health Organization with local media saying at least six were killed and seven wounded as a result. CNN reported the attack was the first one executed against the center of the capital since 2006 and added a loud explosion was heard following the strikes. Many families left the area after the incident, according to reports. Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahieh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. The southern suburbs came under more than a dozen IDF strikes on Wednesday. The IDF also struck Baalbek located in eastern Lebanon overnight, with local authorities reporting at least 46 individuals were killed and 86 injured in Wednesday’s attacks. The military urged residents of Lebanese villages who have evacuated their homes not to return until further notice. 'IDF raids are continuing,' spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X on Thursday.

After October 7: The IDF's six successes which shaped the war	Recap: Following the colossal failure of Hamas' attack, the military quickly recuperated and acted decisively against Israel's enemies; these are its greatest achievements so far 1. Firstly, the rapid recovery by the IDF and the civilian population. These recovered within hours, and by October 8, the army and volunteer civilian organizations in all fields were already up and running. The IDF began conducting an organized war to repel Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists still within Israeli territory and volunteer organizations started taking care of evacuees and the reservists who mobilized in droves, mostly without being drafted. They simply showed up. In the first hours and days, the government and its leader weren’t functioning at all, or very partially, and they weren’t responding to the needs of those under attack. At the same time, the IDF felt that Hezbollah would exploit the momentum of Hamas’s success, and also try storming the Galilee and that attention and available IDF forces would have to be divided between the two sectors. All this occurred within days. Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were repelled back to the Gaza Strip and started receiving aerial bombardments and artillery fire. Three, primarily reservist, divisions were deployed on the northern border, from the mountainous Hermon thickets and Har Dov across to Rosh Hanikra in the west. They positioned themselves in defensive formations, protecting Israel from a northern version of the October 7 massacre. I believe the IDF and civilian population’s rapid recovery is far and away this past year’s best achievement. This is what prevented a serious disaster and the slow collapse of the State of Israel. Military theory states that, after absorbing a surprise attack in which the enemy penetrates lines of defense, the defensive army retreats to a second line and prepares for containment. But there was no second line on October 7. The civilian communities were at the front and Israel managed to stop the Hamas attack and avert much worse results along the border. 2. The ground operation above and below ground in Gaza, in which the IAF, special forces units together brought about the dismantling of Hamas and Islamic Jihad’s fighting force. Out of 23 Hamas battalions, only one or two remain in the central camps, where Israel is not operating due to the assessment that most of the hostages are there are two million displaced Gazans living in 'open shelters' in the area. The IDF doesn’t control the entire Gaza Strip, but can move to any area it chooses within hours, sometimes minutes. It can also gather intelligence and deter Hamas military organization almost unimpeded. A static presence in the area could still expose IDF forces to anti-tank missiles and devices left by Hamas as part of guerilla warfare. Rocket fire, however, even mortar shelling, into Israel has almost completely stopped. Hamas has, effectively, ceased being an immediate threat to Israel’s residents as it was before October 7. 3. The dramatic reversal of the Israel-Hezbollah power balance as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows.' The intelligence community, IAF and Northern Command managed to land a series of precision shocks on all Hezbollah power components, believed to have destroyed over half its capabilities of endangering the Israelis in the Northern Galilee in particular, and Israel’s home front in general. These shocking moves, based on precise intelligence provided by the intelligence community were ready for operation some time ahead. They were implemented at the right time, after the weight of the fighting force had been transferred from Gaza where, as mentioned good security control has been achieved. 4. Repelling April 13-14 and October 1 Iranian attacks. Primarily the first practical realization of Israeli-American operational collaboration that proved extremely effective in whose framework, practical infrastructure was laid for a regional defense coalition against the Shiite axis. 5. IDF Central Command, in aggressive operation, managed to avert, at this stage, a third Intifada in Judea and Samaria There have been terrorist attacks, mainly on roads, in and around Jewish communities, but the IDF has raided refugee camps, harming the battalions inside them (with the help of the Air Force and the Yamam Counter-Terrorism Unit) and has managed to maintain an almost normal fabric of life, reducing terrorist attacks, and preventing them from spilling over to within the Green Line. 6. Restoring Israel's and the IDF's general deterrence in the region, particularly against the Iran-led axis. This deterrence, greatly eroded October 7, has been restored thanks to the surprise operations and cognitive blows the intelligence community and the IDF landed on Hezbollah in Lebanon, no less than dismantling Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. The terrible destruction in Gaza, resulting from fighting terrorists from within a civilian population, and the use of explosive devices, constitutes a deterrent to the same extent that it causes public and political to Israel across the world. Deterring the Iranian attack, which produced no results, alongside achievement in the north, has not only restored deterrence but raised it a notch compared to before. Until then, deterrence had been localized, against the countries surrounding us. We’re now talking about regional deterrence with even global implications. The IAF’s surprise attacks in Lebanon have proven how good we are on the offensive. And repelling 200 ballistic missiles on October 1 proves we’re a defense powerhouse too. But we shouldn’t be resting on our laurels.

Biden says US would not support Israeli strike on Iran nuclear si...	U.S. president urges Israel to act 'proportionally' following intense Iranian bombing of country, described attack as 'ineffective' as Jerusalem mulls retaliation U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its missile attack and urged Israel to act 'proportionally.' Biden spoke a day after Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in a move that he previously described as 'ineffective.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack. 'We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us (G7 nations) agree that they have a right to respond but they should respond proportionally,' Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One. Some analysts said Israel's response would likely be sharper than when Iran fired missiles and drones at Israel in April, suggesting this time it could target Tehran's nuclear or oil facilities. Asked whether the U.S. would back any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Biden told reporters: 'The answer is no.' Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak soon with Netanyahu. 'Obviously, Iran is way off course,' he said. U.S. Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell said the administration was seeking to align its position with Israel on any response to Iran's attack but also recognizes the Middle East is on a 'knife's edge' and a broader escalation could imperil both Israeli and U.S. interests. Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Washington-based think tank Carnegie Endowment, Campbell repeated the U.S. view that what Tehran has undertaken was 'deeply irresponsible' and that there must be a 'return message.' 'I think we tried to underscore our support for some of the actions that Israel has taken,' he added. 'We have real wariness about an extended or substantial ground set of operations in Lebanon,' Campbell said. The Israeli army is locked in combat at its northern border with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. On Wednesday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed -- the deadliest suffered by Israel's military on the Lebanon front in the past year of border-area clashes between Israel and Hezbollah. Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over, barring further provocation.

3 killed in Israeli airstrike on Damascus, reports say	Targeted building in Syrian capital's Al-Mazzeh neighborhood reportedly often visited by Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders; 2 of victims not Syrian Three people were killed Wednesday afternoon in an airstrike targeting a building in the Al-Mazzeh neighborhood of Damascus, reportedly frequented by Hezbollah commanders and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. According to local reports, two of the victims were non-Syrian. At least four others were wounded in the strike, which hit a three-story building. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition group, reported seven casualties in the attack. The Syrian Defense Ministry confirmed the airstrike occurred at 5:25 p.m., stating that Israel targeted a residential building, killing three civilians and injuring three others, while causing significant damage. Syrian outlet Voice of the Capital reported that the building targeted in the strike was located near a site previously attacked in January, where senior Hezbollah commander Youssef Omayed Dar, also known as 'Haj Sadiq,' and two of his aides were killed. Sources suggested Wednesday's strike was an assassination, though the target remains unknown. Last Friday, Syrian state media reported that five soldiers were killed in an Israeli airstrike near Damascus. The attack, launched from the Golan Heights around 1:35 a.m., targeted a military post near the Syria-Lebanon border. In Lebanon, a drone strike last week reportedly killed three people in southern Lebanon when the drone targeted a vehicle on the Wadi al-Ayoun road between Sarbine and Beit Lif villages. That same night, Israeli airstrikes were reported in several locations in Lebanon, including the village of Jwaya, where multiple casualties were reported. Earlier this month, reports also emerged of an Israeli strike on a vehicle near Damascus International Airport, with several members of the pro-Iranian Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah militia reportedly killed.

Yedioth Ahronoth Group to host special broadcast marking October ...	Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth to air special broadcast on October 7, 2024, to mark one year since Hamas attack; program will feature interviews, reports and discussions on war's impact, focusing on victims, families and recovery efforts On October 7, 2023, at 6:29 a.m., Israel was shaken by a surprise Hamas attack, plunging the nation into chaos. What was meant to be a festive Simchat Torah turned into a day of horror, with numerous deaths, injuries and kidnappings. Among the hostages, 101 are still held captive by Hamas. That day changed Israel forever. The newsroom of Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth faced an unprecedented journalistic challenge, as reporters and editors worked around the clock to provide swift and accurate coverage of the unfolding events. Little did they know, the tragedy would strike close to home, with the murder of their own photographer, Roy Edan, and his wife, Smadar. Their children, Michael and Amalia, hid for hours in a closet, while their daughter, Abigail, was kidnapped to Gaza and later released in the first hostage exchange. For the past year, Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth have continuously covered the developments on the frontlines and home front, focusing on the victims, hostages, families and communities that were displaced. The news teams have faced professional challenges while maintaining journalistic ethics and sensitivity to the complex issues at hand. To mark the anniversary, on Monday, October 7, 2024, Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth will host a special broadcast day, featuring live programs from the heart of the newsroom and key locations across Israel. The broadcast will include interviews with key figures and discussions on the pressing issues that have shaped the past year of conflict, which shows no signs of ending. Highlights include Israel Prize laureate Ron Ben-Yishai, who has witnessed every Israeli war, reporting from Gaza and summarizing the year of war; leading commentators Nahum Barnea, Nadav Eyal and Ronen Bergman will discuss critical decisions and exclusive revelations in a special panel; military analyst Yossi Yehoshua will conduct a hard-hitting interview with a senior IDF official; journalist Hen Artzi Sror will have an emotional conversation with children who lost a parent in the war; photographer Ziv Koren will present his most powerful images and Avi Issacharoff will assess Hamas' condition and what comes next. In the field, reporters will meet key figures in the north battling to defend the region, and survivors from the Nova music festival massacre, kibbutzim and southern cities will recount their harrowing experiences and ongoing recovery. The program will also spotlight families of reservists, wounded heroes on the frontlines and the reconstruction of the damaged Alumim dairy farm, restored with the support of volunteers and the Dairy Farmers Fund by Tnuva. Guests scheduled to appear include Yossi Shelley, Director-General of the Prime Minister’s Office and head of the Recovery Directorate; regional council heads Yossi Keren, Alon Davidi and Tamir Idan; Metula council head David Azulai; Osem Nestlé CEO Avi Ben Assayag; Chaim Taib, president and founder of the Menomadin Foundation and Brigadier General (res.) Amir Avivi, chairman and founder of the Israel Defense and Security Forum. The special broadcast, hosted by Alexandra Lukash and Sharon Kidon, will air live on Ynet starting at 9:00 a.m. (Israel time) and will also be available in English here on Ynetnews.

The United States organized a flight from Beirut to Istanbul on Wednesday to allow Americans to leave Lebanon amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

Hamas says responsible for Tel Aviv shooting attack	Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades claim responsibility for deadly terror attack and confirm two terrorists were affiliated with terror group The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing, claimed responsibility for the shooting attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday in which seven Israelis were murdered. According to the terror group’s statement, the two Hebron terrorists were members of the terror organization. The IDF surrounded the Palestinian town in the West Bank after initial investigation suggested the terrorists originated from there. The attack has heightened alert levels across the country, particularly in the West Bank after it was suspected the terrorists infiltrated the area via a breach in the West Bank barrier. Tensions in the area have escalated ahead of Rosh Hashanah and the upcoming October 7 anniversary. Security forces have already mapped the homes of the two terrorists and seven suspects have been arrested as part of the investigation into the attack, which indicated the two infiltrated from an area close to Jerusalem, leading the IDF Central Command to reinforce the border during the holiday period. Three additional IDF battalions were recently deployed to the West Bank. Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, the military’s open-fire policy has been updated, specifically regarding illegal infiltrators attempting to cross into Israel, resulting in several shooting incidents. The Central Command is deeply concerned about the activities of terrorist organizations along the West Bank barrier. Both the Shin Bet and the IDF are aware of persistent efforts by Iran and Hamas to smuggle weapons into refugee camps and armed terrorists through the eastern border. One major concern suggests Iran might stir unrest among Jordanian residents, like the situations in Gaza and Lebanon, challenging Israel along another border. Jordan is closely monitoring these developments with deep concern, as several attempts have been made to arm and embolden residents near the border to act against Israel. Reinforcements are in place along near the West Bank border, Hebron and the West Bank proper, where large forces from the Judea and Samaria Division are operating. The upcoming holiday period and the significance of October 7 also raise tensions in the area. Over a month has passed since the Central Command initiated a campaign aimed at dismantling terrorist infrastructure in the northern West Bank to prevent attacks inside Israel. So far, around 100 terrorists have been eliminated and many more have been arrested. The Shin Bet and IDF, however, still warn about Hamas and Iran's intent to carry out attacks. At the same time, the Palestinian Authority is attempting to project its governance in West Bank cities like Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm.

Under fire and heavy fog: 30 terrorists killed in heroic Lebanon ...	Egoz soldiers clash with Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanese border village, taking heavy fire; casualties evacuated under harsh weather conditions; at least 30 soldiers wounded in fighting, 7 seriously; 2 soldiers killed by anti-tank fire in separate incident Six IDF commandos were killed in intense combat in southern Lebanon early Wednesday morning, as a detachment of elite Egoz Unit soldiers launched an assault around 4:30 a.m. and encountered Hezbollah terrorists in a building near the border. The soldiers were met with heavy fire from small arms, anti-tank missiles and mortars. Despite the harsh weather conditions, medical teams and Unit 669 rescue forces, along with ground and air support, worked heroically under heavy fire to evacuate the wounded. Two Golani Reconnaissance Unit soldiers were killed by an anti-tank missile in a separate incident. Seven more soldiers were severely wounded. Poor weather conditions, including heavy fog and total darkness, complicated the operation. The Air Force carried out strikes on nearby roads and buildings, including a mosque where some of the terrorists had fled. The mosque was destroyed in the attack, and at least 30 Hezbollah fighters were reportedly killed. Around 30 Israeli soldiers were wounded in the incident, with several continuing to fight despite their injuries. Egoz Unit's drone team provided crucial support, guiding forces and launching missiles to fill gaps caused by the low visibility for Air Force aircraft. Earlier encounters on Tuesday saw Egoz commandos eliminate six Hezbollah terrorists without Israeli casualties. Since the beginning of Israel's ground operation on Monday night, the IDF has reported the killing of around 50 Hezbollah terrorists by commando forces. In the months leading up to the ground assault, Israeli forces had targeted 650 Hezbollah positions in the sector near the Upper Galilee. Despite this, Hezbollah’s elite Radwan force had concealed underground rocket launchers and command centers, waiting for the IDF’s ground incursion. On Wednesday evening, the IDF named the eight soldiers that were killed in two separate incidents: Captain Harel Etinger, 23, from Eli, and Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, from Modi'in Maccabim Re'ut, both served as squad commanders in the elite Egoz Unit of the Commando Brigade; Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir Tzur Yigal, Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, 21, from Beit Aryeh-Ofarim, and Sergeant First Class Nazaar Itkin, 21, from Kiryat Ata, all soldiers in the Egoz Unit; Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from Shoham, an officer in the Yahalom Unit of the Combat Engineering Corps; Staff Sergeant Almken Terefe, 21, from Jerusalem, and Staff Sergeant Ido Broyer, 21, from Ness Ziona, served in the Golani Brigade's Reconnaissance Unit. During the clash that claimed the lives of the six Egoz soldiers, a commando officer and four other soldiers were severely injured. The fighting unfolded as the commando unit entered a building in a Lebanese village near the border, leading to an extended firefight. The difficult weather and heavy mortar fire made the evacuation and rescue operations highly challenging, with air support providing crucial assistance in isolating the battlefield and extracting the wounded. Two soldiers were killed, likely by anti-tank missiles or mortar fire. The battle included close-quarters combat with Hezbollah terrorists, supported by tank and artillery shelling from the IDF. In another incident during the day’s fighting, a Golani Brigade medic from the 51st Battalion was critically injured in northern combat operations.

Iran's Khamenei warned Nasrallah of Israeli plot to kill him, sou...	Supreme leader feared Hezbollah was compromised and infiltrated but Nasrallah was confident in his security and trusted his inner circle completely Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Hezbollah leader Syyed Hassan Nasrallah to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike and is now deeply worried about Israeli infiltration of senior government ranks in Tehran, three Iranian sources said. In the immediate aftermath of the attack on Hezbollah's booby-trapped pagers on Sept. 17, Khamenei sent a message with an envoy to beseech the Hezbollah secretary general to leave for Iran, citing intelligence reports that suggested Israel had operatives within Hezbollah and was planning to kill him, one of the sources, a senior Iranian official, told Reuters. The messenger, the official said, was a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who was with Nasrallah in his bunker when it was hit by Israeli bombs and was also killed. Khamenei, who has remained in a secure location inside Iran since Saturday, personally ordered a barrage of around 200 missiles to be fired at Israel on Tuesday, a senior Iranian official said. The attack was retaliation for the deaths of Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement. The statement also cited the July killing of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Israel's attacks on Lebanon. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death. Israel on Tuesday began what it labeled as a 'limited' ground incursion against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Iran's foreign ministry and the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which oversees the country's foreign intelligence agency Mossad, did not reply to requests for comment. Nasrallah's assassination followed two weeks of precise Israeli strikes that have destroyed weapons sites, eliminated half of Hezbollah's leadership council and decimated its top military command. Iran's fears for the safety of Khamenei and the loss of trust, within both Hezbollah and Iran's establishment and between them, emerged in the conversations with 10 sources for this story, who described a situation that could complicate the effective functioning of Iran's Axis of Resistance alliance of anti-Israel irregular terror groups. Founded with Iran's backing the 1980s, Hezbollah has long been the most formidable member of the alliance. The disarray is also making it hard for Hezbollah to choose a new leader, fearing the ongoing infiltration will put the successor at risk, four Lebanese sources said. 'Basically, Iran lost the biggest investment it had for the past decades,' said Magnus Ranstorp, a Hezbollah expert at the Swedish Defense University, of the deep damage caused to Hezbollah that he said diminished Iran's capacity to strike at Israel's borders. 'It shook Iran to the core. It shows how Iran was deeply infiltrated also: they not only killed Nasrallah, they killed Nilforoushan,' he said, who was a trusted military adviser to Khamenei. Hezbollah's lost military capacity and leadership cadre might push Iran towards the type of attacks against Israeli embassies and personnel abroad that it engaged in more frequently before the rise of its proxy forces, Ranstorp said. Iran makes arrests Nasrallah's death has prompted Iranian authorities to thoroughly investigate possible infiltrations within Iran's own ranks, from the powerful IRGC to senior security officials, a second senior Iranian official said. They are especially focused on those who travel abroad or have relatives living outside Iran, the first official said. Tehran grew suspicious of certain members of the Guards who had been traveling to Lebanon, he said. Concerns were raised when one of these individuals began asking about Nasrallah's whereabouts, particularly inquiring about how long he would remain in specific locations, the official added. The individual has been arrested along with several others, the first official said, after alarm was raised in Iran's intelligence circles. The suspect's family had relocated outside Iran, the official said, without identifying the suspect or his relatives. The second official said the assassination has spread mistrust between Tehran and Hezbollah, and within Hezbollah. 'The trust that held everything together has disappeared,' the official said. The Supreme Leader 'no longer trusts anyone,' said a third source who is close to Iran's establishment. Alarm bells had already rung within Tehran and Hezbollah about possible Mossad infiltrations after the killing in July of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike on a secretive Beirut location while meeting an IRGC commander, two Hezbollah sources and a Lebanese security official told Reuters at the time. That killing was followed a few hours later by the assassination of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran. Unlike Haniyeh's death, Israel publicly claimed responsibility for the killing of Shukr, a low-profile figure who Nasrallah nonetheless described, at his funeral, as a central figure in Hezbollah's history who had built its most important capabilities. Shukr was key to the development of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precision-guided missiles, and was in charge of the Shi'ite terror group's operations against Israel over the past year, Israel's military has said. Iranian fears about Israeli penetration of its upper ranks stretch back years. In 2021, former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the head of an Iranian intelligence unit that was supposed to target agents of Mossad had himself been an agent for the Israeli spy agency, telling CNN Turk that Israel obtained sensitive documents on Iran's nuclear program, a reference to a 2018 raid in which Israel obtained a huge trove of top secret documents about the program. Also in 2021, Israel's outgoing spy chief Yossi Cohen gave details about the raid, telling the BBC that 20 non-Israeli Mossad agents were involved in stealing the archive from a warehouse. Pager warning Khamenei's invitation to Nasrallah to relocate to Iran came after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah blew up in deadly attacks on Sept 17 and 18, the first official said. The attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, although it has not officially claimed responsibility. Nasrallah, however, was confident in his security and trusted his inner circle completely, the official said, despite Tehran's serious concerns about potential infiltrators within Hezbollah's ranks. Khamenei tried a second time, relaying another message through Nilforoushan to Nasrallah last week, imploring him to leave Lebanon and relocate to Iran as a safer location. But Nasrallah insisted on staying in Lebanon, the official said. Several high-level meetings were held in Tehran following the pager blasts to discuss Hezbollah and Nasrallah's safety, the official said, but declined to say who attended those meetings. Simultaneously, in Lebanon, Hezbollah began conducting a major investigation to purge Israeli spies among them, questioning hundreds of members after the pager detonations, three sources in Lebanon told Reuters. Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, a senior Hezbollah official, was leading the investigation, a Hezbollah source said. The probe was progressing rapidly, the source said, before an Israeli raid killed him a day after Nasrallah's assassination. Another raid earlier last week had targeted other senior Hezbollah commanders, some of who were involved in the inquiry. Kaouk had summoned for questioning Hezbollah officials involved in logistics and others 'who participated, mediated and received offers on pagers and walkie-talkies,' the source said. A 'deeper and comprehensive inquiry' and purge were now needed after the killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, the source said. Ali al-Amin, the editor-in-chief for Janoubia, a news site that focuses on the Shi'ite community and Hezbollah said reports indicated that Hezbollah detained hundreds of people for questioning after the pagers saga. Hezbollah is reeling from Nasrallah's killing in his deep bunker in a command HQ, shocked at how successfully Israel penetrated the terrorgroup, seven sources said. Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy research director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut with a focus on Iran and Hezbollah, described the offensive as 'the biggest intelligence infiltration by Israel' since Hezbollah was founded with Iran's backing in the 1980s. The current Israeli escalation follows almost a year of cross-border fighting after Hezbollah began rocket attacks in support of its ally Hamas. The Palestinian terror group killed 1,200 people and seized 250 hostages in an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, according to Israeli tallies. Loss of trust The Israeli offensive and fear of more attacks on Hezbollah have also prevented the Iranian-backed terror group from organizing a nationwide funeral on a scale reflecting Nasrallah's religious and leadership status, according to four sources familiar with the debate within Hezbollah. 'No one can authorize a funeral in these circumstances,' one Hezbollah source said, lamenting the situation in which officials and religious leaders could not come forward to properly honor the late leader. Several commanders killed last week were buried discreetly on Monday, with plans for a proper religious ceremony when the conflict ends. Hezbollah is mulling the option of securing a religious decree to bury Nasrallah temporarily and hold an official funeral when the situation permits, the four Lebanese sources said. Hezbollah has refrained from officially appointing a successor to Nasrallah, possibly to avoid making his replacement a target for an Israeli assassination, they said. 'Appointing a new secretary general could be dangerous if Israel assassinates him right after,' said Amin. 'The group can't risk more chaos by appointing someone only to see them killed.'

Military confirms several bases received concentrated fire in Iranian strike, stresses Air Force remains fully operational The IDF reported Wednesday that several Air Force bases were damaged in Tuesday's Iranian missile attack but emphasized that no aircraft were harmed, and upcoming missions remain unaffected. The army credited its long-standing defense and operational integrity plan for successfully mitigating the impacts, highlighting the effectiveness of air defense systems like Iron Dome and Arrow, as well as infrastructure protection and emergency deployment strategies. The Israeli Air Force praised the public’s response, describing their adherence to Home Front Command instructions as 'heroic,' which helped prevent casualties. 'Defense is based on knowing thousands of missiles and rockets will be fired while continuing operations without harm to personnel or aircraft,' the military said. 'No aircraft were damaged. Only administrative buildings and peripheral components were hit, with the core of our operations remaining secure.' Meanwhile, a CNN analysis revealed that missiles launched from Iran struck or landed near sensitive sites, including Mossad headquarters and Air Force bases in southern and central Israel. The IDF added that while Iran used its most advanced missiles 'without restraint,' it did not deploy hypersonic missiles, which Tehran does not possess despite claims to the contrary. 'Iran knows, and we’ve proven, that we can strike any point in Iran. We won’t respond directly but will act against them as we always have and will continue to do so according to our considerations,' the IDF added. 'The Iranian attack failed because it targeted our home front, not our military capabilities.'

They are: Captain Harel Etinger, 23, from Eli, a Squad Commander in the 'Egoz' Unit, Commando Brigade; Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, from Modi'in Maccabim Re'ut, a squad commander in the elite Egoz Unit of the Commando Brigade; Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from Shoham, an officer in the 'Yahalom' Unit, Combat Engineering Corps; Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir Tzur Yigal, a soldier in the 'Egoz' Unit, Commando Brigade. Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, 21, from Beit Aryeh-Ofarim, a soldier from the 'Egoz' Unit, Commando Brigade; Sergeant First Class Nazaar Itkin, 21, from Kiryat Ata, a soldier from the 'Egoz' Unit, Commando Brigade; Staff Sergeant Almken Terefe, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier from the Golani Reconnaissance Unit, Golani Brigade; Staff Sergeant Ido Broyer, 21, from Ness Ziona, a soldier from the Golani Reconnaissance Unit, Golani Brigade. Since the war in Gaza broke out on October 7, 346 soldiers fell during operations in the Strip, with the latter eight being the first ones to fall in the IDF’s operation in Lebanon. Early reports into the incident in which the Egoz Unit’s soldiers were killed revealed the forces entered a building in a Lebanese village near the border. Inside, they encountered Hezbollah terrorists, resulting in injuries to the soldiers. This was followed by prolonged fighting and evacuation under challenging weather conditions, with heavy mortar fire directed at the troops. Military helicopters evacuated the wounded while Israeli aircraft provided support fire to isolate and rescue the injured. Two soldiers were killed in the incident, likely by an anti-tank missile or mortar. The fighting involved close-quarters combat with terrorists alongside tank and artillery shelling.

A terrorist pointed his gun at my head, I was sure he'd blow my ...	For 54 days, Itay Regev endured a nightmare in Hamas captivity—shot, bleeding and subjected to abuse; speaking to Ynet, he recounts his near-death experience and shares how he’s rebuilding his life as a model and actor, turning trauma into resilience Itay Regev endured a harrowing 54 days in captivity at the hands of Hamas terrorists in Gaza, surviving brutal conditions and constant psychological torment before his release. Without the aid of special effects, his story is one of remarkable endurance and courage, made all the more extraordinary given the physical and emotional toll he faced. The 19-year-old, who sustained severe leg injuries during his abduction on October 7, was bleeding and in constant pain during his captivity. He was also separated from his sister, Maya, a torment in itself. Throughout his ordeal, his captors sought to break him, mocking him, playing cruel mind games and subjecting him to both physical and mental abuse. Yet, despite the unimaginable circumstances, Regev’s spirit remained unbroken. Regev vividly recalls a chilling moment early in his capture. 'A minute after I lay on the road, one of the terrorists came and stood on my back with the barrel of gun pointed at my head for two minutes. Those were two minutes of paralyzing fear. I was sure he'd blow my head off any second. I said goodbye to life.' After tying his hands, his captors transported him and others, including his uninjured friend Omer Shemtov and Maya, in a van. Inside the vehicle, the abuse escalated. 'They acted like animals. Each one screamed, and every terrorist took turns looking us in the eyes and cursing us up close,' Regev said. 'I was slapped repeatedly, and they violently pulled Maya's hair. They took pleasure in mocking us. There was a moment when a terrorist asked us if we loved Israel. We said no, and he looked me in the eye and said, 'Liar, liar,' and slapped me. There were nine terrorists there, with Omer and me lying in the van, and they continued cursing and spitting.' Regev’s injuries worsened, requiring hospital treatment. 'There were seven armed terrorists in the room with me, each one more terrifying than the last. They looked at me with evil smiles,' he recounted. A terrified doctor, under the terrorists' watchful eyes, removed a bullet from Regev’s leg—without anesthesia. 'There was someone else in doctor's clothes, sweating, scared, terrified. Before he approached my leg with the forceps, one terrorist told me, 'Be quiet, or we will kill you.' The doctor took the forceps and removed the bullet from my right leg. I realized he was going to do it without anesthesia, without pain relief. I wanted to scream but bit my lips,' he recalled of the excruciating pain. Now free, Regev is beginning to rebuild his life, starting his first acting role in a youth series and using sports as a means to cope with his trauma. He finds solace in boxing and training but admits that the attention he’s received has been difficult. 'Suddenly, everyone knows me. At first, it felt good—the State of Israel loves me—but after a while, you just wish no one knew about you and people would see you as a regular person. When strangers talk to you, it's like they're speaking a different language.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sj8aqnyrc	2024-10-02T07:41:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/ryWKTDlDR0/ryWKTDlDR0_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

The Iranian missiles behind the attack on Israel	Iranian expert reveals three types of missiles launched at Israel, including one reportedly equipped with maneuverable warhead; Israeli officials deny Iran possesses hypersonic missile capabilities Three types of advanced ballistic missiles from Iran's arsenal were deployed in the powerful missile strike on Israel, Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported on Wednesday, citing Iranian media. An Iranian military expert told the paper that the missiles used in the attack were the Fattah-1, Emad and Ghadr-110H models. On Tuesday, Iran launched nearly 200 missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, though some landed in central and southern Israel. Israeli officials vowed a severe response to the large-scale attack, while Iran continued issuing threats. A video was released showing Revolutionary Guard Commander Hossein Salami ordering the operation, dubbed 'Operation True Promise 2,' following a similar attack in April of the same name Iranian military expert Morteza Al-Masawi informed the Qatari newspaper that the Fattah-1 missile has a range of 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) and is equipped with a maneuverable warhead. 'One key advantage of these missiles is their ability to be launched from commercial ships, submarines, warships, Russian Su-24 aircraft and Iranian F-4 planes,' he noted. The Fattah-1 was unveiled by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in June 2023, with then-president Ebrahim Raisi in attendance. Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May, called the missile 'a pillar of national strength.' The Iranian missiles behind the attack on Israel The missile is 44.6 feet long, 31.5 inches in diameter, and travels at speeds between Mach 13 and Mach 15. It is also reportedly capable of evading radar detection. Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, through the news agency Sabreen News, also claimed the Fattah-1 was used in Tuesday’s attack. Al-Masawi claimed that Iran joined the club of hypersonic missile nations in November 2022, though Israeli officials have repeatedly denied that Tehran possesses hypersonic missile capabilities. Regarding the Ghadr-110H, Al-Masawi described it as a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), a modernized version of Iran's Shahab-3 missile. The Ghadr measures 52 feet in length, 4.1 feet in diameter, and carries a warhead weighing between 700 kilograms and one ton (1,550-2,200 pounds). It travels at Mach 9, is capable of evading radar, and can be launched from mobile platforms, the expert added. Al-Masawi also explained that the Emad is an advanced variant of the Ghader surface-to-surface ballistic missile, with a range of 1,700 kilometers (1,060 miles). Weighing 1.75 metric tons (3,860 pounds), the missile has enhanced guidance and control capabilities, allowing for precise targeting. The Emad was developed by Iran's Defense Ministry and was first revealed in October 2015.

From mosque to massacre: How the Tel Aviv attack unfolded	New footage prior to deadly attack in which 7 Israelis were murdered shows terrorists enter a Jaffa mosque and threaten worshippers not to leave before exiting to execute massacre New details about the terror shooting attack in Tel Aviv that took place on Tuesday, in which seven Israelis were murdered, reveal that the two Palestinian terrorists who illegally entered the country entered the Al-Nuzha Mosque in the city minutes before the attack began. 'No one leaves the mosque; whoever leaves, risks their own head,' they threatened. D., who was praying at the mosque on Tuesday, recounted that the two entered the mosque with large backpacks, hid them near the restrooms and pulled out weapons and a knife. 'They threatened us not to leave, then exited the mosque heading west, saw the train stopping at the station from afar and started shooting people at point-blank range. I saw it myself because I ran after them. People fell on the spot. They murdered Jews, they murdered Arabs.' Ali, the person in charge of the mosque, said that one of the terrorists 'opened the closed door with an M-16 rifle in his hand. He just stuck his head in and said, 'No one will leave, whoever does will be responsible for their deaths,' and then left. The other one waited for him outside. We closed the doors, called the police and heard the gunfire.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said following the attack he would demolish the mosque if it was discovered the terrorists made use of it to hide or escape. Police investigation revealed that the worshippers weren’t suspected of any wrongdoing. 'We've been living together for 70 years. Is he here to create hate between Arabs and Jews? He should stay in his place,' Ali said in response to Ben-Gvir’s words. After leaving the mosque, the terrorists ran down the Jaffa’s main street and entered a light rail car that had stopped at a nearby station. There, they opened fire at point-blank range on the passengers including Shahar Goldman and Inbar Segev-Vigder. Another victim was Ilia Nozadze, a Georgian national. The terrorists continued along the city’s Jerusalem Boulevard, shooting at passersby until they were neutralized by security forces at the scene. The two terrorists — Mohammed Masek, 19, and Ahmed Al-Haimoni, 25 — were armed with M-16 rifles, magazines and a knife. Masek was killed at the scene, while Al-Haimoni was seriously injured. They crossed into Israel from the West Bank but the exact timing of their infiltration is still unknown. A joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Israeli Police Tel Aviv District revealed that the two terrorists hadn’t been previously arrested. One of them was known for a public disturbance incident. The IDF imposed a closure on the West Bank city of Nablus, began making arrests and raided Al-Haimoni's house in the Palestinian town overnight. Footage showed the arrest of his family members, including his father and several brothers. The detainees, suspected of assisting the terrorists in obtaining weapons and entering Israel, were transferred to Shin Bet custody for questioning.

Foreign Minister Israel Katz bans UN secretary-general from entering Israel after denouncing 'broadening of Middle East conflict' without mentioning Tehran Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Wednesday declared UN Secretary-General António Guterres a 'persona non grata' in Israel, banning his entry into the country. Katz condemned Guterres in an X post for his failure to unequivocally denounce Tuesday's Iranian missile attack on Israel, which targeted Israeli civilians, instead condemning 'the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation' without mentioning Tehran. 'Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as almost every country in the world has done, does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,' he wrote. He also criticized Guterres for not condemning the October 7 Hamas attack, which saw widespread violence and atrocities, and for failing to lead efforts to declare Hamas a terrorist organization. 'A Secretary-General who gives backing to terrorists, rapists, and murderers from Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran—the mothership of global terror—will be remembered as a stain on the history of the UN,' he further wrote. An Israeli official further said that Guterres 'crossed all the lines,' citing his refusal to designate Hamas as a terror group and his defense of the UN’s Palestinian relief agency, UNRWA, despite its alleged ties to Hamas in Gaza.

What Israel did to Hezbollah in a week, a US-led coalition could...	Brig. Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi praises Israel’s 'shock and awe' military successes in Lebanon but said that addressing the Iranian threat itself will take global support The last several days of Israeli military operations in Lebanon have been remarkable. In a matter of days, Israel pulled off the pager plot, killing dozens of Hezbollah members in a highly targeted operation, and took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and numerous other officials in a strike on the group's headquarters. Brig. Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi stated that the situation has been very different since last April. 'The strategy was to focus on Gaza and not open other fronts, the response then was very pinpointed. One month ago Israel reached the point where the terms for the destruction of Hamas were set. Hamas as a military organization is dismantled. Israel was able to shift from the South to the North, understanding that dealing with Hezbollah would mean dealing with Iran.' When asked what kind of response will Israel carry out, Avivi said Israel has been preparing for this for a long time with many different capabilities. It's not just going to be one attack, and not just with airplanes. Israel needs to deal with Iran's nuclear plans. 'The Iranians have Shahab 3, the Sajil, and the Haibar missiles,' he explained. 'Each ballistic missile carries half a ton of explosives. Ballistic missiles go through space and back to the atmosphere. Israel's Arrow 3 and Arrow 2 deals with it in space. If the Arrow misses the missiles, Iron Dome is the backup.' Avivi also said that similarly bold successes against Iran are possible—if the international community is willing to take part. 'Israel at the moment is almost by itself dismantling all the proxies of Iran,' Avivi, who heads the Israel Defense and Security Forum, said. 'But I think that dealing with Iran, it’s a global issue. It’s a regional issue that should be led by the U.S. What Israel did in seven days against Hezbollah, a global coalition can do in three days in Iran. This is not about boots on the ground. It’s not about spending 20 years in Iraq or Afghanistan. This is about a major airstrike to take out all their major capabilities.' Doing so would protect 'the whole Western society' from a nuclear Iran, Avivi said. Avivi explained the exceptional success of Israel’s recent military efforts against Hezbollah by noting the extensive planning that went into them. 'Israel has been preparing for 18 years for a war in the north and really building amazing capabilities,' he said. The planning paid off over the past several days as Israel carried out what Avivi called a shock and awe military strategy in Lebanon. 'This is what Israel has done,' he said. 'And at the peak of this amazing process, the toppling of all the leadership of Hezbollah in their main headquarters, destroying completely, really, the heart of the command and control of Hezbollah and eliminating Nasrallah himself. I think that the whole world, certainly the Middle East, is looking at it amazed and shocked.' But eliminating Hezbollah’s leadership may not be enough to secure Israel’s northern border. 'We need to really dismantle the whole organization. And in order to bring back safely the 60,000 Israelis who have been displaced for so long, 11 months, we need to push Hezbollah out of south Lebanon,' he said. The violence in northern Israel, Avivi said, is the result of an international failure to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1701, the resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War and made Hezbollah's presence in southern Lebanon illegal. 'We have all the right to do everything needed to really restore security to Israel. And I think that at the moment, the only realistic, theoretically speaking, the only force that can really impose 1701 is Israel,' he said. If Hezbollah does not surrender, Israel will carry out a ground operation in Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure and create a buffer zone, Avivi said. 'When the Israeli citizens return home, they need to see IDF on the other side. They need to see Israeli flags,' he said. 'They need to know they’re safe, that they’re not going to experience a danger like the south on the 7 of October.' Avivi said that Israel’s biggest challenge, the threat of a nuclear Iran, still lies ahead. He called on Israel’s allies to take action against Iran. So far, securing American support has been complicated. Avivi confirmed that the U.S. was not made aware of plans to assassinate Nasrallah before he was taken out, but that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris expressed their support after the fact. One key point of contention between the U.S. and Israel is the question of a cease-fire. 'The cease-fire doesn’t work for Israel,' Avivi said. 'We need to win decisively on all fronts and eliminate these dangers on our borders. A cease-fire is not going to solve our problems.' He called on the U.S. to get behind the Israeli effort to eliminate the threats facing it, including the Iranian threat. 'The administration needs to understand Israel is not going to stop until we really win in this war,' he said. As the northern front continues to develop, the war in Gaza is also nearing the one-year mark. Avivi listed three goals the Israeli military has for Gaza: dismantling Hamas as a military and governmental entity, returning all the hostages, and creating a reality in Gaza where forces like Hamas cannot come to power. So far, Israel has managed to dismantle Hamas as a military entity, Avivi said. That achievement is made clear by the fact that Hamas has not fired a single rocket into Israel in response to Nasrallah’s assassination. However, Hamas still exists as a governing body and 101 hostages are still held in Gaza. 'We have a lot to do yet in Gaza, and one of the things we need to do is really take control of the humanitarian aid, prevent this aid from Hamas, make sure that it goes only to citizens, and start doing a siege on areas where there are no citizens while supplying the citizens in the humanitarian zone,' Avivi said. 'But do a siege on the terrorists, really get them to surrender and not continue their aggression.' According to Channel 12, Israeli intelligence knew at one point where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was but chose not to target him due to hostages being in his proximity. Avivi said he could not confirm that report. 'I do know that Israel is doing everything to really find him and also everything to release the hostages,' he said. Avivi said that the war in Gaza was 'not a win' at this point. 'Winning is achieving the goals of war,' he said. 'We haven't achieved all of them yet.' 'Enhance the military pressure on Hamas, deal with the humanitarian aid, and eventually I think there will be victory and we’ll bring back our hostages,' he said. While noting that Israel’s current focus is in the north, Avivi said that he expects continued military pressure will eventually break Hamas and result in the release of the remaining hostages. 'I think that what’s happening in the north will impact dramatically also the south,' he said. 'I mean, when Hamas sees the way Israel is destroying Hezbollah, they understand that it’s game over for them. They hope that the original war will shift everything in their favor, and it’s working exactly the opposite.' Avivi's vision for Gaza the day after the war involves leadership by local clans, without the involvement of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or the Palestinian Authority. Israel will continue to have security oversight of Gaza to ensure that new terror armies don't spring up, he said, noting that the process of dismantling terror infrastructure and deradicalizing the population will take years. For now, as the war in Gaza enters its second year, many Israelis still want to know why Israel was not prepared for the Hamas invasion, especially after witnessing the very capable plan carried out in Lebanon. Avivi said that hyperfocus on the northern threat was part of what allowed October 7 to happen. 'Israel really thought that the main war would be in the north and not in the south, and didn’t prepare properly,' he explained. 'We’re paying for this, and it’s a big lesson for the next time to understand that we really need to be prepared on all fronts, invest intelligence on all fronts, and not allow a terror army to attack us like that.'

What’s at stake as Netanyahu and Gallant face ICC arrest warrants...	International Criminal Court expected to decide on request for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders soon; critics say Israel missed chance for voluntary appearance The International Criminal Court (ICC) is close to deciding whether to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, following a request by Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan. Speculation suggests the decision could coincide with the anniversary of the October 7 massacre, though a delay remains possible. Israel has filed two objections, hoping to halt the process. One challenges the ICC’s jurisdiction over the case, while the other accuses the prosecutor of violating court protocol by not allowing Israel to investigate the allegations independently. While these objections have briefly delayed the court's decision, there is little optimism in Jerusalem that they will succeed. Should the ICC move forward with arrest warrants, Israel is expected to appeal. However, the appeal process could take months, and an appeal does not guarantee that the ruling will be overturned. If warrants are issued, all 123 ICC member states would be obligated to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant if they enter their territories and extradite them to The Hague. The question of immunity for sitting officials remains unresolved, with past cases, such as deposed Sudanese despot Omar al-Bashir, illustrating the complexities of enforcing such warrants. The implications extend beyond the individuals targeted. The ICC decision could strain Israel’s diplomatic relations, especially with key allies like France, Germany and the UK, which may advise Netanyahu and Gallant to avoid visits to prevent legal entanglements. Non-member states could also choose to arrest and extradite them, increasing the international pressure. The issuance of warrants would imply that Netanyahu and Gallant are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which could damage Israel’s already fragile international standing. Countries such as Canada might even be pressured to sever ties with Israel’s leadership. Furthermore, it could impact Israel’s military operations, raising concerns about international sanctions and arms embargoes. Israel’s options to prevent the warrants are limited. One potential avenue is the formation of a state commission of inquiry into the events of October 7. However, Netanyahu has rejected the attorney general’s recommendation to establish such a commission, leaving the country without a mechanism to assert it is investigating the matter internally. If the warrants are issued, they could haunt Netanyahu and Gallant for life, limiting their international travel and exposing them to arrest, even after their terms in office end. While Netanyahu could still travel to non-ICC member states such as the U.S. or Russia, ICC warrants would severely curtail his diplomatic reach. The warrants would likely end any dialogue between Israel and the ICC. Netanyahu has accused Prosecutor Khan of political bias, and the Israeli government claims the ICC’s actions are politically motivated. Israel has made it clear that it will not negotiate or extradite its leaders to The Hague. One factor that could influence the court’s decision is the broader regional context. Significant developments, such as the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah or Netanyahu’s role in brokering normalization with Saudi Arabia, could weigh on the court’s deliberations. A source familiar with ICC operations suggested that arrest warrants would make Netanyahu a 'persona non grata' in many Western nations, potentially forcing leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron to distance themselves. Critics argue that Israel’s handling of the ICC has been flawed. Though it does not formally recognize the court, Israel has engaged with it by submitting legal documents. Observers have noted that Israel missed an opportunity to negotiate a voluntary appearance for Netanyahu and Gallant, which could have allowed them to continue serving in their roles. The situation recalls the 2014 case involving Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who faced charges at the ICC. Kenyatta temporarily relinquished his powers to attend a hearing, denying the charges and maintaining his role. His lawyer at the time, Karim Khan, is now the ICC’s chief prosecutor. The trial continued in Kenyatta’s absence, allowing him and then-Vice President William Ruto to retain their leadership positions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpvrfkra	2024-10-02T02:53:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/20/Byd300yYQR/Byd300yYQR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Trump says Israel-Iran hostilities 'like two kids fighting in the...	‘Sometimes you have to just let it go a little bit, we'll see what happens,’ Republican presidential hopeful remarks after Iran missile attack on Israel; running mate Vance accuses Biden of unfreezing funds Tehran used to arm itself In the wake of Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on the escalating conflict, equating the animosity between the two nations to 'two kids fighting in the schoolyard.' 'This has really been bad, but they have to finish that process. Think of it like two kids fighting in the schoolyard. Sometimes you have to just let it go a little bit, we'll see what happens,' Trump remarked. However, he also said, 'I’ve been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don’t want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. But they are very close to global catastrophe.' Meanwhile, Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance took a more direct approach, accusing President Joe Biden of enabling Iran’s aggression by releasing frozen funds. 'Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration,' Vance said in a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz. 'What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well.' Walz, vowed there 'will be consequences' for Iran’s actions but did not provide specific details. Tuesday’s vice presidential debate, likely the last before the November 5 election, saw Walz and Vance clash in New York just hours after Iran’s missile attack. The debate began with a question on whether the candidates would support a U.S. attack on Iran. Walz emphasized Israel’s right to self-defense, while Vance avoided a direct answer but criticized the Biden administration for allowing Iran’s nuclear program to advance. 'Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place,' Walz retorted. 'So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. The debate, though contentious, did not deliver a clear winner. A CBS poll showed viewers were split, with 42% favoring Vance and 41% backing Walz, while 17% called it a draw. Unlike the Harris-Trump debate, microphones were not muted, though CBS hosts exercised that option once during a heated exchange on immigration. Vance dodged a question about separating undocumented immigrants from their U.S.-born children, instead attacking Harris for what he called chaos at the southern border. Walz countered by blaming Trump for blocking bipartisan immigration reform. Another key moment came during a clash on abortion. Vance denied supporting a federal abortion ban, despite past statements to the contrary. Walz responded, 'We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors.' The debate peaked when Walz attacked Trump’s refusal to accept his 2020 loss. 'He lost the election,' Walz said. 'This is not a debate. It's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world, because, look, when Mike Pence made that decision to certify that election, that's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage.' Vance, like Trump, refused to directly acknowledge Biden’s 2020 victory, instead insisting that Trump had ensured a 'smooth transition.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjmwedqac	2024-10-02T02:19:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/02/B14rPHqCC/B14rPHqCC_0_0_3000_2003_0_small.jpg

IDF expands ground operation in southern Lebanon with elite divis...	Army says 36th Division joins 98th Division in fighting as it issues evacuation warning for dozens more Lebanese villages; nearly 100 rockets fired from Lebanon since morning The IDF announced on Wednesday that its 36th Division, including the Golani Brigade, the 188th Armored Brigade, the Etzioni Brigade and other units, has joined the ground offensive in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah terror infrastructure. The operation is supported by airstrikes and artillery fire from the 282nd Fire Brigade. Following a situational assessment, the army declared Tuesday night that the border towns of Dovev, Sasa and Malkia in the Upper Galilee were a closed military zone, with entry to these areas strictly prohibited. The move followed a similar closure in the border communities of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi. Meanwhile, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee issued a warning to residents of 24 villages in southern Lebanon, urging immediate evacuation due to Hezbollah activity. 'For your safety, you must leave your homes immediately,' the statement read, adding that any civilian near Hezbollah fighters, facilities or weapons risks their life. The IDF instructed residents to move north of the Awali River and avoid heading south. The directive comes a day after the army had ordered residents of 29 southern Lebanese villages to evacuate. Israel launched what it described as a 'limited' ground incursion into its northern neighbor overnight Tuesday after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with the Iranian-backed terrorist group. Images and videos of IDF forces in southern Lebanon were released Tuesday, with the army confirming that the 98th Division had raided Hezbollah terror infrastructure. Northern Command chief Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin held a situational assessment near the border with 98th Division Commander Brig. Gen. Guy Levy as forces advanced on their targets in Lebanon. Under the command of the 98th Division, units currently fighting in Lebanon include the Paratroopers Brigade, the Commando Brigade and the 7th Armored Brigade. 'During the raids, paratroopers uncovered dozens of weapons and combat positions, while fighters from the Egoz unit located and destroyed a Hezbollah rocket-launching and explosive storage site,' said the IDF. The Air Force supported the ground operation with over 100 strikes on Hezbollah targets in the last 24 hours. 'We are carrying out a focused operation led by the 98th Division against Hezbollah’s Radwan forces and offensive positions threatening northern Israel,' Gordin told commanders during the situational assessment. 'Our goal is to neutralize them and pave the way for the safe return of northern residents. We are determined, and you are leading the way—keep going.' Earlier Tuesday, the IDF revealed that more than 70 covert operations had been conducted in southern Lebanon this year, destroying thousands of Hezbollah weapons and over 30 tons of explosives intended for use in an invasion of the Galilee. These weapons had been hidden in tunnels and bunkers along the border and were part of Hezbollah’s plan to occupy parts of northern Israel. These revelations were partially intended to provide legitimacy for Israel's ground operation in southern Lebanon, which began with a covert entry under the cover of massive air and artillery bombardment. The 98th Division, which entered Lebanon from three separate battle groups that had previously fought in Gaza, has since secured key positions in the region. The Paratroopers Brigade, Commando Brigade and 7th Armored Brigade are now engaged in combat in Lebanon, facing resistance from Hezbollah fighters, including advanced anti-tank threats. However, the IDF's extensive preemptive strikes on hundreds of targets in the area over the past year are expected to ease their path during the ongoing operation. The IDF called up four reserve brigades and additional forces for operational tasks in northern Israel on Tuesday. 'Their mobilization will support the ongoing combat efforts against Hezbollah and the achievement of the war's objectives, including the safe return of northern residents to their homes,' a statement said. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has fired nearly 100 rockets from Lebanon toward northern Israel since early Wednesday in more than 20 separate salvos. In one such attack, the Iranian-backed terrorist group fire approximately 20 rockets toward the Haifa Bay region, landing in unpopulated areas. Earlier, about 30 rockets were launched toward the Galilee, most of which were intercepted. Short-range Burkan missiles struck the border villages of Shtula and Zar’it in the Upper Galilee, causing damage to homes and vehicles, but no injuries were reported. Residents of the area had been evacuated last October at the start of the war. In the border town of Metula, at least ten homes were damaged in a barrage of a dozen rockets. Meanwhile, Saudi outlet Al Hadath reported that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) conducted 17 bombing raids on the Dahieh district of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. Four apartment complexes were reportedly destroyed. 'IAF fighter jets carried out a series of targeted strikes in Beirut against weapons production facilities and other terrorist infrastructure,' the IDF said in a statement. 'Steps were taken to minimize civilian casualties, including issuing advance warnings to residents in the area.' Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al Akhbar reported that IAF jets also attacked targets in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, while artillery fire struck several villages in southern Lebanon. The paper also reported that an Israeli drone targeted a motorcycle in Bint Jbeil, a town in southern Lebanon. Lebanon's National News Agency reported Wednesday that three people were killed in an Israeli airstrike targeting a house in the town of Dibel, near Bint Jbeil. Earlier on Wednesday, the IDF said Hezbollah had fired a rocket at central Israel, but it landed in an unpopulated area with no damage or injuries. No sirens were activated. The IDF Homefront Command instructed residents of the Upper Galilee, including Safed, to remain near shelters and avoid travel or large gatherings, anticipating further rocket fire in the coming hours. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhmqd9ra	2024-10-02T01:32:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/02/HkfttDv5AR/HkfttDv5AR_1_94_1601_901_0_small.jpg

The missile wemt through the living room': In threatened norther...	In Lebanon border town of Shtula, Ora Hatan remains steadfast, cooking for soldiers and maintaining hope despite constant Hezbollah fire; 'Since IDF took off the gloves, people here have started to smile' The blaring siren didn’t distract Ora Hatan from her cooking duties, nor did the explosion that followed moments later. After all, she was responsible for feeding 250 soldiers for the holiday, plus a journalist who arrived to a table laden with chicken and rice, grilled eggplant and homemade pickles. Having stayed in the moshav of Shtula in the Western Galilee, right on the Lebanese border, since the onset of the war, she had grown accustomed to it all. Her young son Yair, soon to celebrate his 11th birthday, has also gotten used to the sirens and explosions. When the blast echoed, he dashed to the balcony to watch the smoke rising from the impact site. When I asked Ora if she feared for his safety, she replied, 'Let’s ask him. Yair, are you scared?' To which he said, 'I’m only afraid of the jackals.' 'Two months ago, a rabid jackal bit him. We rushed to the hospital for a vaccine. Luckily, we weren’t here then, because the neighboring house was hit by an anti-tank missile that day. All my windows shattered, and the outer wall was pocked with shrapnel. By the way, I’m sure Hezbollah knows me by now. There’s probably some guy in the village with binoculars saying, 'There goes that crazy lady again.'' When she tells the story of her mother, Sarah Hatan, who lit a torch at the Independence Day state ceremony and at age 70 traveled alone on a journey to Kurdish Iraq, hitchhiking and taking taxis, you begin to understand where Ora inherited her courage. Ora and her sister eventually found their mother, sipping tea in a hotel lobby on the Turkish border. 'If my mother were alive, she’d say, 'I didn’t come from Kurdistan 80 years ago just to leave our home and become refugees again.'' Ora, one of 14 siblings, is a single mother, a home-based business owner, and a law student. She took me to see the family restaurant, destroyed by a rocket strike. Fifteen minutes after we left, two mortar shells landed where we had been standing. Shtula is a small farming community of about 300 residents, nearly all of whom have evacuated. It alert squad members have been on call for a year. Those off-duty were enjoying a cup of Kurdish black tea with cinnamon. They heard the news of Nasrallah's elimination through their radio. Orly Hajbi, their operations coordinator, reported that his body was found intact in the rubble. Someone quipped, 'He’s lightly dead.' 'Since the IDF took off the gloves, people here have started to smile,' says Eliyahu Galil, a member of the small town's alert squad member, just before the ground incursion began that night. 'Until now, we played ping-pong with them. We’ve moved to chess. And now they’ve lost their king. When we got the message, we danced and sang Sabbath songs. We even allowed ourselves a little beer.' Eliyahu, 42, married with five children, has a personal vendetta against Nasrallah. His house, located at the edge of the moshav just yards from the border, was hit by two anti-tank missiles. 'When the first missile was fired, I had just come home to pick up some things,' he recalls. 'It sounded like a truck barreling toward you. I had a few seconds to reach the shelter and close the door. The missile went through the living room and kitchen.' In his case, it ended with property damage. His friend in the emergency squad, Lior Hatan, lost his cousin, Eyal Uzan, who was killed in early December by an anti-tank missile while checking his peach and apple orchards near Moshav Netu’a. Lior owns a guest villa that has been abandoned since the war began. 'I have clients who used to come every year, and now they write to me: 'We’re on vacation abroad; bring your family and come to us. Our home is your home.'' Noam Elimelech, a 28-year-old medic from Kfar Yona, has been attached to the emergency squad since July. Before that, he fought in Gaza. 'We started in the northern Gaza Strip, then moved to the central camps and Khan Younis. In my first hour in Gaza, I treated a badly wounded soldier from an explosion on our force. We were supposed to start a rotation in Rafah, and I said: enough is enough. I came here to gather some strength for the next round. I’m already due at the Nitzanim Corridor.' Israel Levi, 68, is the oldest member of the emergency squad. 'We came here in '69 from the Lachish region. My mother is from the Hatan family. She’s in her 80s, married at 14. Now she’s evacuated to Nof HaGalil.' Carrot or stick Shlomi Hatan, 55, has been the security officer of Shtula for 20 years. 'This is one of the most threatened communities in the area because of the topography and the hostile village opposite us,' he explains. 'There are terror squads that pop up, shoot and flee. Our demand is simple: move them from the frontline opposite Shtula. By brains or by force, it must be done, even if it means establishing a security zone on the other side. Only this way can we bring back the residents, especially families with children.' Ora, whose home is located next to the site of the 2006 kidnapping of IDF soldiers by Hezbollah that led to the Second Lebanon War, fears a repeat. 'We mustn't enter Lebanon,' she says, 'Absolutely not. My heart is with the soldiers' mothers and their wives and children. Nasrallah and his cronies have set up many traps. At the end of the day, there will be a settlement. So what's the point? It's a shame for every soldier killed. We need to reach an agreement, but one that will be enforced. Not by the UN or other forces. Until then, we must continue bombing them from the air, and the IDF is doing it beautifully, leaving no trace of their leadership.' Ahead of Rosh Hashanah, Ora went to clean the abandoned synagogue. 'It should be clean, even if there are no worshipers. I prayed: 'God, let the hostages return to their families.' I don't care about anything else. Let them come home first.' This was the only time during the interview that this fearless woman teared up. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hy00artfc0	2024-10-01T22:47:44-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/yk14100436/yk14100436_0_0_945_697_0_small.jpg

Thief breaks into homes while residents shelter from missiles	Security cameras capture the man entering a Tel Aviv building, enters apartments after residents leave amid sirens warning of incoming strike While residents of Tel Aviv were in shelters during Iran's missile strike on Tuesday, having just learned about the murderous terror attack in Jaffa, one man chose to break into their homes and steal their property. When we returned home after the all-clear, we realized we were robbed,' Idan Matalon said. 'Security cameras captured a man entering the stairwell when the sirens began.' He said that when the thief saw people leaving their apartments to go to the shelter, he went up to the first floor and stole computers, a wallet and a bag, before escaping the building. 'We are still checking to see what else is missing.' Iran fired 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in the attack that began shortly after seven people were murdered in a deadly terror strike in Jaffa. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryymyuqr0	2024-10-01T22:33:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/BJmzHsTFCA/BJmzHsTFCA_0_47_1186_668_0_small.jpg

The gifted dancer from Lod is survived by her husband, parents and three sisters; baby saved after mother killed by terrorists identified as Hebron residents that were killed on site Thirty-year-old Shahar Goldman, a dancer from Lod was one of the seven victims of Tuesday's terror attack in the Jaffa quarter of Tel Aviv. She was survived by her husband, parent and her three sisters. Her mother Esthar, is an educator and well known in the mixed Jewish and Arab city. Her sister Meirav, is a musician in the Philharmonic Orchestra in Berlin, where she received the devastating news. A IDF soldier was critically hurt in the attack that also wounded 15 people. The terrorists who opened fire on civilians in Jaffa were identified as Mehmed Khalaf Saher Rajab and Hassan Mohammed Hassan Tamimi, both from the West Bank city of Hebron, in Israel illegally, were killed on the scene. The IDF imposed a closure on Hebron in the wake of the deadly terror attack. An initial investigation revealed that one of the terrorists was armed with an M-16 rifle and the other with a knife. They opened fire on people leaving the city's light rail on Jaffa's main street, then shot at other passersby. The wounded were transported to the Wolfson Hospital in Holon and the Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv. Among the victims was a young woman who was carrying her baby when she was shot. The infant was picked up by a survivor of the attack who brought her to hospital. 'The money hugged her baby, that was the most powerful image,' 22-year-old Arik Mrchenkov who was wounded by shots to his back, said. 'The baby was covered in blood. It is a miracle he survived.' Paramedic Eran Nissan who lives in Jaffa ran out to administer to the wounded. He was treating a woman who had taken a shot to her arm when he heard more gunfire. 'Along with two others, we dragged the girl to a back room and blocked the door,' he said. 'There were others who were lightly injured with us there, but I treated the girl who was conscious the entire time.' He said police and more medical teams arrived quickly and he helped the girl into an ambulance outside. 'I so hope she survived,' he said. Nissan made it home to his wife just in time for the Iranian missile strike on Israel >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk0tj8q00	2024-10-01T21:52:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/02/SJWpcJ50C/SJWpcJ50C_0_45_720_405_0_small.jpg

Israel threatens direct strikes on Iran’s nuclear or oil faciliti...	Israel reportedly conveys message to Iran, saying it would retaliate by targeting strategic facilities in Iran for any strike on its territory, 'no matter how small or large'; Netanyahu: Iran has made a 'grave mistake' Israel has reportedly warned Iran of direct retaliation targeting its nuclear or oil facilities following Tehran's large-scale missile attack, The Wall Street Journal report Tuesday, citing Arab officials. The report claims that Iran had alerted regional Arab officials of its plan to launch the missile barrage, which prompted Israel to send a clear message, saying it would respond to any attack on its territory, regardless of the scale or casualties. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Tuesday night that Iran had 'made a grave mistake' and would 'pay the price' for the attack. According to IDF, Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, many of which were intercepted, though some hit various locations across Israel. Israeli officials reportedly emphasized that the country would retaliate for any strike, 'no matter how small or large' the impact, and even if there were no casualties. Earlier in the day, military analysts indicated that Israel is seriously considering striking Iran’s nuclear facilities, a possibility under greater discussion than at any point in the past decade. Ynet analyst Nadav Eyal noted that Iran's two main deterrent forces, Hezbollah and Hamas, have been severely weakened, limiting Tehran's ability to respond to a potential Israeli strike. 'But that could change for the worse,' Eyal wrote, adding that political timing—especially the current U.S. administration's reluctance to veto Israeli actions—could be a factor. He argued that the recent Iranian attack might strengthen voices in Israel advocating for a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. The IDF announced plans for significant retaliatory strikes across the Middle East, though it did not specify if these would target Iran. 'There is no damage to the Air Force’s capabilities—neither to aircraft, defense systems, nor detection systems. Tonight, and in the coming hours, the Air Force will strike throughout the Middle East with force,' a military spokesperson said. Senior Israeli officials vowed a strong response to the Iranian missile attack. A defense official promised a 'severe reaction,' while another Israeli official warned that 'what Iran has experienced so far is a fraction of what it will face now.' 'The Iranian regime does not understand our determination to defend ourselves' Netanyahu declared that Iran’s missile barrage targeting Israel had failed, crediting the country's advanced air defense systems. 'Iran once again attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles. This attack was thwarted thanks to Israel’s air defense, the most advanced in the world. I commend the IDF for this impressive achievement. Iran made a grave mistake tonight—and it will pay for it,' Netanyahu said. Netanyahu emphasized Israel’s resolve in defending itself. 'The Iranian regime does not understand our determination to defend ourselves or to retaliate against our enemies. Sinwar and Deif didn’t understand it, Nasrallah and Mohsen didn’t understand it, and apparently some in Tehran don’t either. They will understand. Our rule remains: those who attack us will be attacked in return.' Foreign Minister Israel Katz also vowed a strong response to the attack, saying, 'The mullah regime crossed a red line—Israel will not remain silent in the face of Iran’s criminal assault on our citizens. The entire free world must stand with Israel to stop Iran’s axis of evil before it’s too late.' Katz also expressed gratitude for the support of Israel’s allies, particularly the United States, and noted that, according to a CNN report, Jordan’s air force also participated in intercepting the missiles. 'The solidarity and support from many countries and leaders will not be forgotten. We know who our friends are,' Katz said. Iran, for its part, claimed the missile attack was in retaliation for the recent assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Iranian general Abbas Nilforoushan and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said the missiles targeted 'military bases' near Tel Aviv and warned of further attacks if Israel retaliated. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted a message in Hebrew on Twitter, saying, 'With God's help, the blows of the resistance front will become stronger and more painful against the worn and decaying body of the Zionist regime.'

The street was strewn with injured people': Witnesses describe h...	They spotted a guy near the barbershop and asked if he was Arab. He said, ‘Yes, yes, I’m Arab,’ and they moved on,' says eyewitness Witness accounts from the scene of Tuesday's deadly shooting in Tel Aviv's Jaffa quarter paint a picture of chaos and fear amid the highest security tensions since October 7. Nadia, a Jaffa resident, was cycling along the boulevard when gunmen opened fire. 'When I reached the Ehrlich station, gunfire erupted. I threw my bike and hid behind an electrical box. I saw two men with long guns firing continuously. They spotted a guy near the barbershop and asked if he was Arab. He said, ‘Yes, yes, I’m Arab,’ and they moved on,' she said. Moti, the owner of a nearby kiosk, described the relentless gunfire. 'We heard endless rounds of shots in every direction. We rushed outside in panic and saw figures running down the street, likely the attackers. It was hard to watch,' he recounted. Roy, who was in a nearby supermarket, said, 'The gunmen fired indiscriminately at a shop. I later saw them fleeing toward northern Jaffa. The street was strewn with injured people.' Mohammed El-Sayed, a florist on the street, witnessed the light rail stopping in front of his shop. 'A woman got off the train screaming. I ran inside and saw a wounded baby, other injured people, and some who were dead. It’s a terrible feeling to witness this scene. It’s a sad and difficult day. Everyone was heading home, preparing for the holiday, and they didn’t make it back. We tried to help as much as we could. We were selling flowers for the holiday, and then this tragedy happened,' he said. Israel Police Commissioner Daniel Levy arrived at the scene, calling it 'a difficult event' and saying, 'Every call we receive is being checked. We had no prior intelligence on this attack. We know the identity of the gunmen and are handling the matter with the Shin Bet security service.' Tel Aviv District Police Commander Peretz Amar provided further details, confirming that the two attackers boarded the light rail, opened fire inside, and then continued shooting on the street. 'The attackers were neutralized by rail security guards, the municipal Special Operations Unit, and police officers,' Amar said. The shooting, which took place on Jerusalem Boulevard, left seven people dead and 16 others injured, some critically. A preliminary investigation revealed that the attackers first opened fire on light rail passengers before targeting pedestrians. Security forces shot and killed the two gunmen. The wounded were transported by Magen David Adom teams to Wolfson Medical Center in Holon and Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, police ruled out the presence of additional gunmen at the Sharon Hotel in Herzliya, following earlier concerns.

Sullivan: Iranian missile attack on Israel 'defeated and ineffect...	US national security advisor says attack successfully thwarted thanks to professional response of IDF and coordinated efforts of US military forces U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel did not result in any deaths or known damage to aircraft or strategic military assets. 'Based on what we know, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,' Sullivan said during a White House briefing. Sullivan emphasized that the U.S. military worked closely with Israel in the defense effort, which included American naval destroyers assisting in intercepting the missiles. He added that the U.S. continues to work with the IDF and Israeli authorities to assess the full impact of the attack. Iran launched over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening, and Israeli and American officials are investigating the reported death of a Palestinian in Jericho, believed to be linked to the missile fire. Sullivan credited the limited damage and lack of casualties to the professionalism of the IDF and the joint defense preparations with U.S. forces. 'We will consult with Israelis on the next steps, including how to respond and monitor further threats from Iran and its proxies,' he said. Earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden warned Iran of severe consequences if it attacked Israel. 'This is a significant escalation by Iran,' Sullivan told reporters. 'It is equally significant that no one was killed in this attack, thanks to our coordinated efforts with Israel. We have made it clear that there will be severe consequences for this attack.' International condemnation followed the strike. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock strongly condemned Iran’s missile barrage, urging an immediate halt to the attack and warning of its dangerous escalation. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office also condemned the missile strike, calling for de-escalation across the region. Starmer reportedly spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan’s King Abdullah II, according to Sky News. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqt5ttrr	2024-10-01T13:20:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/SJT40TKC0/SJT40TKC0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Blast rocks Tel Aviv, wall of fire in Negev: Dramatic footage fro...	Ballistic missile interceptions from Iran captured across Israel; multiple impacts recorded in Negev, while blast wave damages restaurant in northern Tel Aviv; large crater found at heavily damaged school in Gedera Approximately 180 ballistic missiles were launched from Iran toward Israel on Tuesday, sparking widespread defense operations across the country. The attack mirrored a similar large-scale strike in April, with dramatic footage emerging from various locations, including Gaza and Jordan, showing Israel’s defense systems intercepting the missiles and documenting some of the impacts. One particularly striking video from the Negev in southern Israel, which was reportedly targeted by Iran, showed a series of explosions lighting up the night sky, with multiple plumes of smoke resembling a wall of blasts. Footage of high-altitude missile interceptions, similar to those from April’s attack, was captured across Israel, including in Samaria, Jerusalem and southern regions. In another scene, filmed from the coastal city of Herzliya, a large explosion was visible, though no direct impact was reported in the city. However, a missile struck an open area in northern Tel Aviv, with the blast wave causing significant damage to a restaurant. In Gedera, a missile made a direct hit on the Chabad Flame School, leaving a large crater outside the building and causing heavy damage. The school, part of a growing network of Chabad institutions, educates nearly 400 students. 'Just thinking about how hundreds of students were here just hours ago, learning about Rosh Hashanah—it’s a huge miracle,' said the network’s director Rabbi Eliyahu Krichovsky. The Magen David Adom ambulance service (MDA) reported that two people in the Tel Aviv area were lightly wounded by shrapnel. Minor injuries were also reported nationwide, mainly from people running to shelters or suffering from shock. The missile interceptions and impacts were widely shared on social media, even in Gaza and Jordan. In the West Bank, large missile fragments were found in the town of Sanur near Jenin, while in the Jericho area, a Palestinian worker from Gaza was reportedly killed by a missile strike. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement: 'We carried out numerous interceptions, and there have been only a few direct hits. We do not detect any additional aerial threats at this time, which is why we have issued instructions to leave the shelters.' He urged the public to refrain from sharing information or footage, adding, 'We are maintaining a high level of readiness and will continue to protect Israel's citizens.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk727tk0c	2024-10-01T12:56:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/SybAN3KA0/SybAN3KA0_0_276_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
IDF mobilizes 4 reserve brigades to fight on Lebanon front	Army says mobilization will support ongoing combat efforts against Hezbollah and achievement of war objectives, including safe return of northern residents home The IDF has called up four reserve brigades and additional forces for operational tasks in northern Israel, the army said on Tuesday following a situational assessment 'Their mobilization will support the ongoing combat efforts against Hezbollah and the achievement of the war's objectives, including the safe return of northern residents to their homes,' a statement said. Earlier, the IDF revealed that over the past few months, 70 covert operations were conducted inside Lebanon to disrupt Hezbollah's preparations for its plan to conquer Israel's Galilee region. According to the IDF, special forces crossed the border dozens of times, destroying Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure, including underground facilities. The forces gathered intelligence and neutralized advanced weaponry, including Iranian-made arms. 'During these operations, IDF forces neutralized more than 700 targets,' the spokesperson said. Troops raided villages and dense terrain, breached underground sites along the border and uncovered weapon caches, terrorist staging areas and more. Throughout these missions, the forces gathered valuable intelligence and systematically destroyed weapons and sites, including underground infrastructures and advanced arms, many of which were Iranian-made. 'Over the course of 200 nights and hundreds of days, and through dozens of operations in enemy territory, the forces uncovered, neutralized and destroyed underground complexes, struck thousands of military targets and dismantled weapon storage facilities, including tons of explosives, terrorist hideouts, and command centers,' the army added. Some of the weaponry was brought back to Israel. The IDF continues to degrade Hezbollah's capabilities and infrastructure and push the group away from the border, ensuring the safe return of northern residents. In a special briefing, the IDF displayed a map found in one of the sites, showing Hezbollah's plans for a Galilee invasion. 'The map includes a legend marking Israeli communities and targets for attack, all of which Hezbollah intended to capture,' an army spokesperson said. 'Their plan was to invade Israeli territory, much like Hamas did. Our operations throughout the war have severely damaged their ability to carry this out. Israel has made clear that Hezbollah's attacks will have severe consequences, yet the group continues to risk Lebanon in a broader conflict.' Findings from the covert operations included massive explosives meant to breach the border wall, along with thousands of rockets and weapons hidden in tunnels and basements along the border, intended for Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces to invade Israel. 'We've dealt a heavy blow to Radwan, but the threats have not been fully eliminated, which is why we've launched divisional operations,' the spokesperson said. Earlier on Tuesday, sirens sounded across a series of towns in Gush Dan, the Sharon region and Samaria. For the first time in this war, a significant barrage was fired at central Israel from Lebanon. According to the IDF, three to five rockets were likely launched, some of which were intercepted. Magen David Adom (MDA) reported three injuries, including a bus driver in his 50s who was hit by shrapnel in the head near Highway 444, close to the Horashim interchange. Two other people sustained light injuries. Hezbollah has fired rockets at several northern communities, including Safed. The terror group claimed that some of the attacks targeted IDF troop gatherings. No injuries were reported, though impacts and interceptions were recorded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyi3vtkr0	2024-10-01T12:14:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/S1WC88UFA0/S1WC88UFA0_0_205_1970_1108_0_small.jpg

Israeli officials vow Jerusalem will not stand idle following barrage of over 200 missiles fired across country; Tehran says 'fully prepared for any retaliation' Senior Israeli officials made it clear Tuesday evening that Israel will not remain silent in response to Iran's massive missile attack. A security official vowed that 'there will be a severe response,' while another Israeli official stated, 'What Iran has faced so far is just a fraction of what it will face now.' A high-ranking government official added, 'Israel has every legitimacy to deliver an unprecedented strike on Iranian soil—now is the time to strike at the head of the Iranian snake.' Preliminary assessments suggest that tonight’s Iranian attack involved the launch of over 200 ballistic missiles. In recent days, Israel repeatedly warned that any attack by Tehran would be met with a harsh response, and earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. also warned Iran of 'severe consequences' if it launched an attack. Against this backdrop, Israel issued its retaliatory threats this evening. Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, adding that Tehran 'is fully ready for any retaliation,' and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei remains in a secure location after Tehran fired missiles at Israel. Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards added that they launched tens of missiles toward Israel and warned that if Israel retaliated Tehran's response would be 'more crushing and destructive', Iranian state TV reported. 'After a period of restraint, Iran has targeted the heart of the occupied territories with tens of missiles following the martyrdom of (Hamas leader) Ismail Haniyeh ... the intensification of the Zionist regime's attacks on Lebanon and Gaza, the martyrdom of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and (of) Guards Commander Abbas Nilforoushan.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkb3z2f0c	2024-10-01T11:14:35-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/Syyf2oYAR/Syyf2oYAR_0_133_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF uncover vast Hezbollah weapons, infrastructure in 70 Lebanon ...	Military spokesperson says troops uncovered and destroyed underground infrastructure, struck thousands of targets and hundreds of weapons storage facilities, tons of explosives 'Since the beginning of the war, the IDF has conducted dozens of targeted operations in areas near the border in southern Lebanon in order to dismantle Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure that pose a threat to Israeli civilian communities in northern Israel,' The IDF said on Tuesday. The announcement was made a day after IDF troops began a land offensive, described as limited in scope, into Lebanon. Some of the operations were carried out up to 10 kilometers north of the border and according to military plans, 15 years in the making. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's plan was for Radwan units numbering 4,000 to 6,000 men, disguised as civilians, to enter the area where equipment had been placed awaiting them to invade border area communities and abduct soldiers. They were divided into groups, each numbering hundreds in battalions responsible for specific locations along the 135-kilometer (84 miles) border from the shore to the foothills of the Golan Heights. The military said that based on precise intelligence, troops conducted targeted operations against Hezbollah compounds to dismantle the military capabilities of the terror group's Radwan force and prevent them from invading Israel as Hamas did on October 7. 'The soldiers identified and breached underground access points near the border area, exposed extensive weapon caches, assembly areas for terrorist operative operations, and more. During these operations, the troops also collected valuable intelligence and methodically dismantled the weapons and compounds, including underground infrastructure and advanced weaponry of Iranian origin,' the statement went on to say. 'The troops also uncovered and destroyed underground infrastructure, struck thousands of targets and hundreds of weapons storage facilities, tons of explosives, and hundreds of living areas for operatives, command centers and more. Some of the weapons were recovered and taken by the soldiers back into Israeli territory.' The IDF believes a few hundred Radwan troops remain active in the area and some 1,000 are further north near the Litani River and the coast. Most Radwan fighters fled north of the Litani, the military said. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that there are many villages in the border region of South Lebanon that have terror infrastructure in them and that the military's offensive was ongoing although he could not say how long it would last. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryziyuk0a	2024-10-01T06:32:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/BJziXXvYR0/BJziXXvYR0_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

IDF intercepts drone Houthis say was aimed at 'military target in...	Military reports Yemeni threat intercepted kilometers off of Israel's shores; terror group says launched five drones toward several Israeli areas The IDF reported early Tuesday morning that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) intercepted a UAV over the Mediterranean Sea, dozens of kilometers west of Israel's coast in the central part of the country. On Tuesday, Yemen’s Houthis said they had launched a total of five drones overnight, four toward Eilat and another toward a 'military target in Jaffa.' In the Houthis' statement, they claimed to have attacked an 'Israeli military target in Jaffa (Tel Aviv area)' using a 'Jaffa' drone model. They also claimed to have aimed at 'military targets in Eilat using four 'Samad 4' model drones.' The Houthis' drone launches toward Israeli territory took place just over a day after another extensive Israeli strike in Yemen, approximately 1,800 km (1,118 mi) from Israel. The IDF Spokespersons Unit reported the strike was a large-scale operation involving dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets, refueling planes and intelligence aircraft which, under the guidance of the IDF Military Intelligence Directorate, attacked military targets used by the Houthis. Power stations and a seaport used for importing oil were targeted in the attack. Further, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported the Houthis transferred Iranian weapons to the area as well as supplies for military needs and oil using the targeted infrastructure and ports. 'The strike was carried out in response to the recent attacks launched by the Houthi regime against Israel,' the IDF said in a statement. In response to the strikes, the Houthis began issuing threats against Israel, while also attempting to downplay the strike’s outcomes. 'The Israeli strikes on Hodeidah port and the power station won’t cause Yemen to stop its military operations,' a source told the Lebanese network Al-Mayadeen. 'Attacks on civilian targets will be met with attacks on civilian targets and the enemy should be aware of this. Yemen's bank of targets deep inside Israel is large and strategic,' the terror group added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1s3buyc0	2024-10-01T05:29:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/19/SJY973vuR/SJY973vuR_0_181_535_302_0_small.jpg
Mediators try to entice Sinwar to make deal in light of Israeli a...	U.S. State Department spokesperson says no contact with Hamas leader for weeks despite efforts by mediators to receive response to proposals; Officials say the Hamas chief may see Iran desert Hezbollah and reconsider ; Assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is message to Sinwar that Israel will reach him too Israel was trying to leverage its latest achievements in its war against Hezbollah in Lebanon to prompt Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to agree to a cease-fire and hostage-release deal. Although rumors that he had been killed persist, and on Sunday the IDF released a photo showing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi at his desk with an infographic in the background featuring a picture of Sinwar with a question mark over his face, Israeli officials believe he is alive. It appears that a deal that would see the return of 101 Israelis dead and alive, who are still captive in Gaza, is not currently possible but the mediators are trying to entice Hamas, although they are getting no response. U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller also said in a briefing to reporters on Monday that the terror group has been unresponsive. He said talks with Israel were continuing but that Hamas has been incommunicado for weeks. Sinwar had hoped for a multi-front war against Israel that would drag the region into a broader conflict that includes missile fire from Iran, Israeli officials said. they believe that is why he would be in no hurry to make a deal. The assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is a message to him that Israel will reach him too and that by agreeing to a cease-fire deal he may be able to save his life. But much depends on Iran's actions. If it is deterred and does not shower Israel with missiles, Sinwar may conclude that just as Tehran turned its back on Hezbollah, its most valued proxy in the north, he too would be abandoned. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skqknlfc0	2024-10-01T05:24:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/02/22/Syb3UZ0Nhp/Syb3UZ0Nhp_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Soldiers hurt in Nablus raid as IDF eyes potential surge in West ...	Military bolsters deployment ahead of the Jewish High Holidays and anniversary of Hamas massacre while pushing ahead with anti-terror operations that have already killed 100 terrorists An IDF soldier was seriously wounded and three others suffered moderate injuries when troops clashed with terrorists during an operation in Nablus that began on Sunday. The military said the forces killed Abed Shahin, a terrorist responsible for attacks against forces, in the West Bank and for enlisting more operatives in the area around Nablus to carry out more attacks. The counter-terrorism operations on the West Bank are not slowing down. On the contrary according to the Head of the Central Command Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth. Since the military launched its efforts to counter the surge of terror attacks late in August in attacks that murdered seven Israelis, some 100 terrorists have been killed and many others arrested. Since then security forces have responded to the growing use of IED in the refugee camps. Troops confiscated materials that can be used to produce explosives such as fertilizers, destroyed explosives labs and arrested terror operatives connected with the supply chains that enable the production of such weapons. The military regard their achievement as critical and the IDF has bolstered its troop deployment to the area and currently has 25 battalions dedicated to the West Bank. The events in Gaza and Lebanon, including the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, impact the events on the ground, a security official. But the coming month of Jewish holidays and October 7, which will mark a year since the Hamas massacre, are of greatest concern for the IDF, over efforts to destabilize security on the West Bank and the security forces including the Shin Bet are concentrating their efforts to prevent any such events. Palestinian sources said that in the past month dozens of armed terrorists have surrendered to the Palestinian Authority Security Services (PA) including in the Nablus and Jenin refugee camps. The PA is trying to project to the world an ability to rule over the West Bank cities, to legitimize its possible future rule over Gaza after the war. Palestinian officials are concerned over the sanctions imposed on them by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich that have financial ramifications for the PA, and his threats to penalize Israeli banks that service the PA, which would cause further harm. A security official said there is currently a tense routine. 'We've seen marches of armed men and attempts to enlist support for Hezbollah and Hamas continues ceaselessly to control the Palestinian street and prompt mass riots. Until now, those efforts have not succeeded by but that does not mean they won't later. We are facing tense days. The West Bank can ignite at any moment.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2qqxycc	2024-10-01T04:01:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/yk14100932/yk14100932_0_0_468_264_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah turned villages into bases': IDF captures key areas in...	Limited ground operation in Lebanon begins with forces and tanks entering southern Lebanon alongside air support; IDF top spokesperson reviews move, criticizes UN inaction The IDF’s ground operation in southern Lebanon began overnight between Monday and Tuesday with a covert crossing under the cover of heavy air and artillery strikes that lasted throughout the night. Forces consisting of three brigade combat teams that previously fought together in the Gaza Strip have secured dominant areas in southern Lebanon in the initial move. The combat teams are expected to encounter resistance from Hezbollah terrorists, as well as advanced anti-tank threats. However, the fact that the IDF has been attacking hundreds of targets in the areas into which the forces entered for nearly a year is expected to ease their operations during the fighting. 'The Israel Defense Forces is conducting limited and targeted raids along Israel’s northern border against the threat that Hezbollah poses to civilians in northern Israel. These localized ground raids will target Hezbollah strongholds that threaten Israeli towns, kibbutzim and communities along our border,' IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement to the foreign press on Tuesday. 'Hezbollah turned Lebanese villages next to Israeli villages into military bases all ready for an attack on Israel. Hezbollah had prepared to use those villages as staging grounds for an October 7-style invasion into Israeli homes. Hezbollah planned to invade Israel, attack Israeli communities and massacre innocent men, women and children. They called this plan ‘Conquer the Galilee,'' he said. Hagari also criticized the UN, the international community and Lebanon. 'For decades, UN Security Council resolutions have called on Lebanon to make sure that its territory is free of non-governmental armed groups. UN Security Council resolution 1701 from 2006, agreed upon by Israel and Lebanon, requires that there be no armed personnel assets and weapons other than those of the government of Lebanon and UNIFIL in southern Lebanon. Eighteen years after 1701, Hezbollah is the world's largest non-state army, and southern Lebanon is swarming with Hezbollah terrorists and weapons.' 'If the State of Lebanon and the world can't push Hezbollah away from our border, we have no choice but to do it ourselves. I want to make it clear: Our war is with Hezbollah, not with the people of Lebanon. We do not want to harm Lebanese civilians and we're taking measures to prevent that. We will not let the 7th of October happen again on any one of our borders. We will continue doing whatever necessary so that Israeli families can return to their homes in safety and security,' he added. The limited ground operation in Lebanon was approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet Mondaynight. During the discussion, ministers expressed frustration over leaks that reached the U.S. about the maneuver after they were briefed on the matter by Israel. Some ministers questioned why the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit addressed the maneuver even before the cabinet discussion and were told it was necessary to address various reports in the foreign media. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ohcntrc	2024-10-01T03:06:30-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/rkHa8QtRA/rkHa8QtRA_0_153_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

This is the new cruise missile Hezbollah claims it used against I...	Terror group says fired Nour ballistic missile for first time toward the Galilee; Arab reports suggest missile isn't ballistic but anti-naval munition supplied by Iran; Here's what it can do Hezbollah announced on Monday that it fired one of its Nour missiles at Israel for the first time, claiming it was used in an attack on the Galilee. The terrorist organization didn’t provide specific details about the missile, but an Iranian missile carries the same name, which Tehran is believed to supply to its proxies including Hezbollah. According to a report by the Saudi television network Al Arabiya, the terrorist group had previously unveiled its Nour missiles last year, showing a video of anti-ship missile launch platforms in its possession. Al Arabiya added technical details about the missile. According to previous Iranian reports, the Nour missile is an Iranian cruise missile designed for anti-ship combat – an improved version of the Chinese C801 and C802 missiles. The missile is considered one of the earliest models in Iran's military industry, having been introduced by Iranian forces in 1991. Additionally, the missile has a range of up to 170 kilometers (105 miles), a length of 6.38 meters (20.9 feet), a diameter of 36 centimeters (14.2 inches), and a weight of 715 kilograms (1,576 pounds), including a warhead weighing 165 kilograms (364 pounds). The missile operates on solid fuel and has an estimated speed of 0.9 Mach. Al Arabiya claimed that Hezbollah used Nour missiles to strike the Israeli Navy ship INS Hanit in 2006. Boaz Shapira, a researcher at the Alma Research and Education Center focusing on security challenges on Israel’s northern border, said the missile flies at a relatively low altitude over the sea, making detection and interception difficult. According to the institute, the missile has undergone modifications over the years, extending its maximum range to 200 kilometers (124 miles) and improving its guidance systems. It can be launched from sea, air or land platforms. Despite reports from some sources suggesting that the Nour missile used by Hezbollah was a ballistic missile, it seems to be the known Iranian cruise missile, which isn’t ballistic. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by0snxfr0	2024-10-01T02:01:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/H1QiZzIeRR/H1QiZzIeRR_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Tehran fumbles as world wonders about integrity of its 'axis of r...	International outlets raise doubts about Tehran's decades-long project across the Middle East, reporting that it is crumbling amid Nasrallah's assassination International reports have been covering Israel’s war since October 7, 2023, which also involved its conflict against Iran-backed Hezbollah on the northern border. Now, with Hezbollah leadership decimated and amid IDF entrance into Lebanon, the outlets are wondering whether Tehran's 'axis of resistance' made up of its proxies across the Middle East is falling apart. 'Iran came up with the strategy and invested tremendous resources to build each group’s fighting abilities and connect them to one another,' a New York Times article on the topic published on Monday read. 'But the axis’ response as Israel has pummeled Hezbollah in Lebanon in recent weeks — killing many of its commanders and assassinating its leader — has so far been feeble, suggesting that the axis is weaker and more fragmented than many in the region had expected and that Iran feared that widening the war could cause Israel to turn its firepower on Tehran,' it added. According to the American outlet: 'The idea was simple: When a big war with Israel broke out, all the members of the Iranian-backed network of militias in the Middle East known as the ‘axis of resistance’ would join the fight in a coordinated push toward their shared goal of destroying the Jewish state.' Hezbollah was a senior member of Iran’s axis, and the terror organization's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike last week, was a leading figure. He had close ties to Iran and served as a 'role model' for leaders of other pro-Iranian militias. According to the outlet, his assassination 'badly shaken' the remaining members of the axis, who were likely unprepared for Hezbollah to suffer such significant losses. At this point, the international community still hasn't fully understood why other members of Iran’s alliance didn’t aid Hezbollah in recent weeks. It appears that most of them believed the Shiite terror organization from Lebanon 'could hold its own against Israel.' Additionally, Iran's vague and unclear response following the strike has left doubts in other members of Tehran’s spiderweb. The New York Times reviewed the involvement of these militias and noted it took Syria two days to issue a statement on Nasrallah's death, despite Hezbollah sending thousands of terrorists to help them fight the country’s civil war which set off in 2011. Hamas, after a year of fighting in Gaza, is incapable of doing much to help. Yemen’s Houthis and militias in Syria and Iraq launched attacks on Israel or U.S. bases in the Middle East, but most were thwarted. Two pro-Iranian militias’ commanders in Iraq said that they 'had received no instructions from Iran on how to respond. Everyone was still in shock at Nasrallah’s killing.' NBC also addressed the issue in an article titled 'Is Iran's ‘axis of resistance’ collapsing under Israeli attacks?' In an extensive report on the activities of Iran's pro-Iranian militias, the outlet wrote that 'Israeli airstrikes that wiped out Hezbollah’s top leadership and left its internal security in tatters are a devastating blow to Iran’s decades-long project.' This project, according to former U.S. intelligence officials who spoke with NBC, took decades to build and aimed to project power in the Middle East via Iran's proxy network. Iran viewed Hezbollah as a cornerstone of its strategic plan to arm proxies in various regions across the Middle East. In addition to arming Hezbollah and terror groups in Gaza, militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen were also armed, allowing Iran to one day attack Israel through its proxies and avoid direct confrontation. According to former intelligence officials, however, Iran miscalculated Israel's response to the events and overestimated the strength of the proxy network it built — leading to its collapse. According to NBC, Israel began targeting the Iran-backed Houthis after it dealt heavy blows to Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This Iranian militia in Yemen had made numerous threats against Israel since the war began, attacked ships connected to Israel and launched missiles and drones toward Israeli territory. However, they were also hit twice in significant airstrikes by Israeli fighter jets in retaliation. Meanwhile, as Iran's militias suffer consequent blows, Tehran shows no willingness or intent to intervene in the conflict directly. Although they frequently threaten Israel with a harsh response, they also stressed Hezbollah's capabilities, asserting the terror group can handle the situation alone. 'All the resistance forces in the region support and stand alongside Hezbollah,' Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said following the terror group chief’s death. ' The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront.' According to former intelligence and defense officials, however, this decision could cost Tehran dearly as it raises questions among other militias about Iranian support when it’s needed. The New York Times reported on growing uncertainty surrounding Iran's response to Nasrallah's assassination, which represents the most severe blow Israel has delivered not only to the terror group but also to Iran's entire axis. According to the report, there are disagreements within the Ayatollah regime on the nature of the response against Israel, with more extreme factions calling for a swift retaliation to 'deter' Jerusalem, while more moderate elements, including Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, advocate avoiding what they claim is an 'Israeli trap.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkplxmkcc	2024-10-01T00:26:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/09/By6dSUhn0/By6dSUhn0_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg

The statement came hours after U.S. President expressed reservations about a ground operation when asked by reporters whether he was 'comfortable' with Israel's plans to enter Lebanon. 'I’m more aware than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now,' he said on Monday. Austin made it clear that Washington supports Israel's right to defend itself and reiterated that 'a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border.' The Defense Secretary also made it clear that the US intends to protect its people and allies in the region against threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations, and that it is determined to prevent any player from exploiting the tensions or expanding the conflict. Austin once again warned the regime in Tehran, in the shadow of his threats, discussing with Gallant 'the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel.' The White House also expressed support for the limited ground operation in Lebanon, officially confirmed overnight by the IDF. However, the White House referred to what it called the 'risk' of a prolonged invasion which is currently defined as a 'targeted' operation.' The administration said it is holding discussions on the issue with Israel and is pushing for a diplomatic solution. Austin reiterated this in his conversation with Gallant, saying that 'a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border.' He and Gallant 'discussed the importance of ultimately pivoting from military operations to a diplomatic pathway to provide security and stability as soon as feasible.' The IDF announced overnight that it had begun a 'targeted ground operation' against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, after the political-security cabinet approved on Monday night the next phase of the operation in Lebanon. The IDF spokesman said in a statement that overnight the IDF began 'limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon. These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel.' 'The IDF is operating according to a methodical plan set out by the General Staff and the Northern Command which IDF soldiers have trained and prepared for in recent months. The Israeli Air Force and IDF Artillery are supporting the ground forces with precise strikes on military targets in the area. These operations were approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon. Operation Northern Arrows' will continue according to the situational assessment and in parallel to combat in Gaza and in other arenas,' the IDF also said. 'The IDF is continuing to operate to achieve the goals of the war and is doing everything necessary to defend the citizens of Israel and return the citizens of northern Israel to their homes,' it concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1i11qlta0	2024-09-30T21:58:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/HkUSscu0C/HkUSscu0C_0_34_800_450_0_small.jpg

Ground op in Lebanon will be more complex then Gaza, IDF says	Amid reports that IDF has crossed Lebanese border, senior IDF officer tells Ynet: 'The soldiers felt like caged lions. Everyone understands that there is no other way to return northern residents to their home except to physically remove Hezbollah from the border' The 36th Division of the Northern Command have already had time to forget about its maneuvers in Shejaiya neighborhood of Gaza City at the beginning of the year and the opening of the Netzarim Corridor for the first time in November. The fighters of the Golani and 188th Brigades deployed on the Lebanese border in recent months have completed the final preparations to cross the border for the first time since the summer of 2006, and they are not alone. The IDF's elite 98th Division, which led the raids in the Gaza Strip as part of the third phase of the fight against Hamas, was diverted to the north in the last month, and in recent days the IDF has made several significant decisions and changes regarding its preparations, the purpose of which was to speed up and complete the preparations for the ground operation against Hezbollah. 'We have crossed the Rubicon; battalions and brigades are deep in combat procedures, entire reserve units have carried out successful brigade exercises and adjustments from Gaza to Lebanon. We are far from a decision to enter Lebanon,' a senior IDF officer assessed earlier Monday in a conversation with Ynet. 'The soldiers are determined and alert; We also trained under fire in the north and there are fighters here who performed Sisyphean defense tasks and felt like caged lions. The great IDF trained and prepared and equipped over the years for the mastermind of enemy number one - Hezbollah.' At the political level there are those who are still debating and hesitating about whether to use the ground punch against Hezbollah in addition to the blows that the Shia terrorist army keeps taking from the Air Force. The IDF, for its part, presented to the cabinet renewed confidence in the infantry and tank soldiers who fought inside Gaza for many months and, despite the great attrition, many of the regiments, regular and reserve, have been re-energized and strengthened. 'The soldiers understand that there is no choice and this is the feeling among the commanders as well - there is no other way to return the residents of the north to their homes other than physically removing Hezbollah from the border area, and this can only be done with a ground entry,' said the senior officer. Two preliminary signs of the operation have arrived in recent days: a report in the Wall Street Journal indicating that elite units of the IDF conducted preliminary raids in southern Lebanon, and a call by the IDF to the few residents remaining in towns and villages, such as in the Mount Dov area, to evacuate. The IDF is also expected to convince the political echelon that the conditions for such a move are much better today than in October or November, based on the following data: the thousands of regular daily attacks by the Northern Command on Hezbollah's infrastructure and positions in southern Lebanon that have depleted a high percentage of the capabilities with which it was prepared to operate against the IDF; The removal of thousands of skilled Radwan force operatives to the north of the Litani River (one can assume that their movement back south will be detected by the IDF and will result in them being fired on); the evacuation of most of the Lebanese and Israeli citizens from the border areas and the severe blow that Hezbollah suffered in the pager attack and the elimination of its senior commanders which fatally damaged its command and control capabilities on ground combat operations against the IDF. And yet, the IDF states, this will be a more difficult and complex maneuver than the one against Hamas, since Hezbollah has not yet used some of its capabilities, including the underground bunkers reserved for fighting against the IDF. It is estimated that the IDF has several options for ground action: the largest Includes an extensive reach up to the center of Lebanon, where Hezbollah has military outposts in the form of many launchers of precision missiles and long-range rockets and probably also facilities for the production of weapons. Last month, the IDF announced for the first time that its plans also include the possibility of operations deep in Lebanon. The forces of the 98th Division, including the regular and reserve paratrooper brigades as well as the commando brigade (which went up almost entirely to the north) have the ability to perform with the capabilities of a prolonged independent stay in enemy territory without supplies. Another alternative is a limited operation, in the style of Operation Protective Edge in Gaza in 2014, to clear Hezbollah's presence in the kilometers adjacent to the border and occupy the territory in them until a cease-fire agreement is reached that will include the full withdrawal of the Lebanese army to these areas that observe and control the rockets trained on the Israeli side. 'That's the only way, when the residents see it with their own eyes and don't just hear about assassinations from afar and numbers of targets that were attacked from the air, trust will allow the return of the children to their homes after what happened on October 7,' a security official said Monday. There are those in the political elite who hesitate and hope that the international community led by the U.S. and France will now impose a cease-fire that will include implementation of UN Resolution 1701 from the end of the Second Lebanon War, which prohibits the presence of Hezbollah south of the Litani River. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has already hinted that his position is similar to that of the IDF, and he pushed with all his might to approve a ground operation against Hezbollah. The IDF will demand to proactively and aggressively enforce any such agreement in the future, even in days of calm, and to damage the establishment of a renewed position or presence of Hezbollah near the border; this goes against the government's policy of containment over the years, which allowed the Shiite terrorist organization to fully establish itself in southern Lebanon and its terrorists to reach the perimeter fence, alongside the establishment of dozens of terrorist outposts in front of the houses of Shlomi, Kiryat Shmona and Metula. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s18k9f00ca	2024-09-30T15:02:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/HkeWQ6pM0C/HkeWQ6pM0C_0_43_1601_901_0_small.jpg

CNN reporter flies aboard Israeli tanker during Yemen strike	Nic Robertson was granted special permission to board a refueling plane that took part in the Yemen strike operation against the Houthis, Israel's longest-range mission in nearly 40 years; 'I had no idea what the destination was, an hour and a half after takeoff they showed me the map and then I realized - it's Hodeida port' CNN correspondent Nic Robertson received special permission to board a refueling aircraft that was part of Israel's strike mission in Yemen on Sunday. These are some of his impressions about the unique experience: 'Aboard an aging Boeing 707, thousands of feet above the Red Sea, I don a set of high-tech 3D goggles and stare at the small TV monitor recessed in a bank of retro dials and switches,' he said. 'Saudi Arabia’s amber desert slides by to my right, Egypt’s coast to my left, and then a monstrous F35 fighter jet fills the tiny screen. I am with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) – the first foreign journalist to be taken on a combat mission more than a thousand miles from Israel aboard a fighter jet refuel tanker,' he continued. 'Israel’s invitation to join this mission came with no detail about the plane’s destination. As I climb the plane’s rickety steps, I have no idea where I am going or what this IDF flight will reveal about military operations.' 'Israeli Air Force security regulations are so tight neither I nor Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, the IDF spokesman accompanying me, are allowed to bring our cellphones aboard. Neither am I allowed to bring a camera or photojournalist.' 'Except for the cockpit, I have access to the more than 50-year-old former commercial airliner, and its commanders, under the condition that they not be named. Flying 1,200 miles (1,500 kilometers), the refueling mission I discover I am joining is the IDF’s longest-range combat mission since a 1985 raid on Tunis,' Robertson said. 'For more than an hour and half, Israeli F35 fighter jets, each worth more than $100 million, close in behind the 707 tanker, nudging toward its trailing fuel pipe. The squadron commander, a 15-year refueling veteran, stares through his 3D goggles, merging two camera images. He jockeys the two long levers beside his seat and steers the nozzle toward the gas-hungry fighter jet’s fuel port.' 'When he shows me a map of the mission, I realize we are on the way to Hodeidah Port in Yemen, controlled by Houthi rebels, backed by Iran. Shoshani tells me the reason for this mission, is that over the past two weeks the Houthis have fired three long-range missiles, all intercepted near Tel Aviv.' 'As the last of the F35s decouple from the fuel feed, the squadron commander visibly eases in his seat, pushes back his goggles, and stretches his shoulders. Each jet is on the nozzle for about 3 minutes, requiring intense focus,' he continued. 'We begin circling, waiting for fighter pilots to deliver their payloads. Any attack from the ground could cost them vital fuel as they try to evade being shot down and require a refill to get back to base.' 'Twenty minutes later we’re headed north, no top-ups needed. I ask the lead pilot on the tanker, a reservist veteran aviator, about the challenges of such a mission and his feelings when civilians are killed. 'We don’t want to kill civilians, he tells me, and we use all the intelligence we have to avoid it.'' 'On the flight, Shoshani told me the message was for Iran too, a warning that while Israel is bracing for retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah in Lebanon, they want the group’s sponsor, Iran, to stay out of the fight,' he concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy72ey000a	2024-09-30T14:01:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/ByzKO06DCR/ByzKO06DCR_405_226_561_316_0_small.jpg

Ground operation in Lebanon begins with heavy artillery, tank fir...	After over 11 months, IDF goes on attack: US announces Israel is 'carrying out limited ground activity along border'; Residents of Kiryat Shmona and surrounding area ordered to stay near protected area Almost a year after the beginning of Hezbollah's incessant fire at Israeli communities, the IDF is crossing the northern border; according to the U.S. State Department, Israel is 'currently carrying out limited operations along the border.' On the Saudi Al-Hadath network a report said that there is 'Israeli preparation for the entry of ground forces and commando forces, in order to locate Hezbollah targets and blow them up.' Another Saudi network, Al-Arabiya reported that tanks penetrated Rmaich in southern Lebanon, but later deleted that report. Residents of Kiryat Shmona and other localities in the area were called to stay near a protected area, against the backdrop of the dramatic developments, which come after the series of assassinations in Lebanon including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. According to reports in Lebanon, the Lebanese army has cleared positions along the border and videos have been published of the withdrawal of troops from border posts to some neighboring villages. Shas chairman Aryeh Deri was the first politician to allude to the ground move when he posted on Twitter the prayer for the welfare of IDF soldiers. A U.S. official told the Washington Post earlier Monday that Israel was preparing to launch a ground attack in Lebanon imminently, but it is expected to be limited. 'Israel’s planned campaign would be smaller than its last war against Hezbollah in 2006 and would focus on clearing out terrorist infrastructure along the border to remove the threat to Israeli border communities,' the source said. The report came as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that 'the next phase will begin soon.' Another U.S. told the CBS news network that Israel has informed the U.S. that it intends to begin the ground maneuver phase, and that it 'may take place within hours.' At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a cease-fire. When asked if he 'feels comfortable' with Israel's plan, he said: 'I’m more worried than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now.' The New York Times cited U.S. officials who said that they believe they have succeeded in convincing Israel not to launch a major ground attack in Lebanon, after long talks held over the weekend. In the United States, signs were detected that Israel intended to launch a maneuver in Lebanon and that it could come soon. Special units in the IDF have already carried out such raids in recent days, in order to remove combat positions from which Hezbollah planned to target the northern settlements. According to the report, officials in Israel assured their counterparts in the United States that they do not plan for these raids to lead to a major attack by ground forces with the aim of occupying parts of southern Lebanon. The American officials said that they estimate that the commando units will withdraw immediately after the operations is over. However, according to the report, it is still unclear whether this is the final Israeli decision and if there is still a possibility of a large-scale attack. Another hint that the incursion could happen at any moment was given by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who met Monday with mayors of Israeli northern border communities. In a conversation with them, Gallant said that 'the next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon; it will be a significant factor in changing the security situation and will allow us to complete the important mission of returning the residents to their homes.' Earlier Monday, Gallant met with armored fighters on the northern border, and gave another hint when he told them: 'The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the end. In order to return the residents of the north, we will use all our capabilities, including you.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1u3xkdra	2024-09-30T13:06:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/Hkg00wvuuA0/Hkg00wvuuA0_0_233_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Iranian hackers claim to breach nuclear research center system in...	The group Handala claims to have stolen nearly 200 gigabytes of data from the Soreq Nuclear Research Center; PM office says the 'incident is known and under investigation' An Iranian hacker group known as Handala announced on Sunday that it had allegedly breached the Soreq Nuclear Research Center and stolen 197 gigabytes of data. The group is believed to be a cyber arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the attack was purportedly in retaliation for the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. While no evidence has been provided to confirm the attack or its success, Handala's claims are considered credible, and it often releases proof of its hacks. However, the group has, on occasion, falsely claimed successful attacks by recycling old data. For example, the group recently re-released private images supposedly stolen from the phones of former Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, former Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak. They also claim to possess sensitive communications and emails from these officials, though without offering any proof. The aim: Psychological impact Handala was behind a cyberattack on Sheba Medical Center three months ago, when data was stolen from a biotechnology company associated with the hospital. The group has also targeted other entities within Israel, often publishing the stolen data. Its primary objective appears to be psychological warfare –creating public anxiety and pressure. This tactic is popular among countries like Iran and Russia, the latter being considered a mentor to Iranian cyber tactics. The Soreq Nuclear Research Center serves the civilian and academic sectors, providing research infrastructure for companies and universities. Its research spans fields such as food safety, electro-optics, laser development, nuclear testing and air pollution detection. Founded in 1958 near Yavne with U.S. support, the center is not involved in defense activities but represents the cutting edge of Israeli scientific research. At this stage, until the hackers release verifiable data, their claims should be treated with caution. However, given the group's track record, it cannot be dismissed outright. Israeli authorities take the protection of such critical infrastructure seriously and, hopefully, this is either an empty boast or one that does not involve sensitive information. The Prime Minister's Office, speaking on behalf of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, said in a statement: 'The incident is known and under investigation. The Soreq Nuclear Research Center maintains the highest level of information security protocols, in line with national security regulations.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjkqmvda0	2024-09-30T12:38:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/S1hhQGuAC/S1hhQGuAC_0_264_2560_1440_0_small.jpg

Two 16-year-old boys arrested for attempting to rob a taxi driver in Ashkelon after they were seen in footage pulling out a knife and holding it to his neck; They were caught last week at the end of a police manhunt following the failed robbery Police arrested two 16-year-old boys Sunday on suspicion that they tried to rob a taxi driver in Ashkelon at knifepoint. The incident happened last week, overnight between Thursday and Friday. They will be brought before the Ashkelon Magistrate's Court with a request to extend their detention. In the footage of the attempted robbery, three suspects are seen getting into the back seat of the taxi wearing hoods over their heads and trying to hide their faces. Then one of the suspects pulled out a knife and held it to Nahar Hamoni's neck. Another suspect held a knife to the driver's arm. The police said that a manhunt was underway for the suspects who escaped from the taxi after the unsuccessful robbery attempt. Ashkelon police investigators began an investigation upon receiving the report, while collecting evidence at the same time as conducting an intelligence effort that led to the identification of the suspects.

The source did not specify which Iranian attack might take place, or what steps the U.S. is taking, but noted that the Americans and Israel are preparing to repel such a possible attack. At the same time, the IDF published footage from the refueling planes that were on their way to attack Yemen on Sunday. With that, the IDF sent a message to Iran, saying that 'the refueling planes of the Air Force operate in the war in all sectors and allow the fighter planes flexibility in attacks and activity in any airspace, at any distance.' The assassination of the Hezbollah leader is considered the most severe blow that Israel has dealt not only to the Lebanese terrorist organization but also to Iran's host of proxies. On Sunday, international media outlets reported difference of opinions in Iran regarding the Iranian response to Israel's recent transgression. The radical fundamentalists are calling for an immediate response to deter Israel while the moderate camp, including Iranian President Massoud Pezeshkian who calls to avoid falling into Israel's trap. According to the report in the New York Times, which is based on four Iranian sources, the assassination of Nasrallah, the long-time ally of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was received in Tehran with shock and great concern among the regime's top brass. Iranian officials even wondered if Israel's next target was Iran's Supreme Leader, prompting the regime to move him to a safe location. While deliberating whether or not to attack Israel and possibly start an all-out war, an IRGC source commented anonymously. 'All of the forces in the resistance stand by Hezbollah,' he said. 'It will be Hezbollah, at the helm of the resistance forces, that will determine the fate of the region.' Although Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson has said that Iran 'will not leave any of the criminal acts of the Zionist regime' unanswered, international estimates suggest Iran will not join the fray and directly attack Israel. According to them, Iran will focus on rebuilding Hezbollah in Lebanon and keeping its network of proxy organizations in operation for as long as possible, hinting at an expected increase in movement in Iraq and Syria with convoys and transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Due to Hezbollah's part in the Syrian Civil War, the terrorist organization controls several tunnels near the border that connects the two countries. Since Israel's strike, many Hezbollah field commanders have fled to Syria with their families. According to the source, amid the security escalation, Iran may try to transfer thousands of combatants to the border areas of Lebanon and Syria. In the last two months, thousands of operatives left Iraq for Syria, which implies that Tehran was preparing to strengthen its forces in the region. Meanwhile, the world urges both sides to de-escalate the situation to avoid a full-scale war. The Washington Post reported on Sunday that American estimates say that Israel's intensive campaign to dismantle Hezbollah's leadership in the past two weeks will challenge the terror organization's ability to respond. The U.S. even advised Israel against a ground incursion and claimed that it may produce adverse results. An American official that they see an opportunity to strengthen the Lebanese government at the expense of Hezbollah's political power. Lebanon is currently embroiled in a political crisis as they have not elected a president for two years. It remains unclear how Nasrallah's assassination will affect Lebanon's political situation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryhdlkd0c	2024-09-30T11:49:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/r1fGSrKbRR/r1fGSrKbRR_0_161_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israel told US ground operations against Hezbollah limited, State...	Israel has told the United States it is conducting limited ground operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon near the border with Israel, the State Department said on Monday. 'This is what they have informed us that they are currently conducting, which are limited operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure near the border,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. Asked to confirm they were limited ground operations, he said: 'That is our understanding.' A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters the positioning of Israeli troops suggested a ground incursion could be imminent. After two weeks of intensive airstrikes and a string of assassinations of Hezbollah commanders, Israel has suggested ever more strongly that a land invasion is looming. Miller said that the United States continues to support a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah but added that military pressure can at times enable diplomacy. He cautioned that military pressure can also lead to miscalculation and unintended consequences.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bysexuurc	2024-09-30T11:38:35-07:00	
Mossad infiltrated Iranian intelligence unit established to spy o...	Former president of Iran tells CNN Turk that the man who headed the Islamic Republic's division meant to thwart Mossad operations was found in 2021 to be an Israeli spy, and 'another 20 members were Mossad agents'; They stole Iran's nuclear documents The former president of Iran made an amazing claim in an interview Monday with the CNN network in Turkey. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that Tehran established a unit meant to thwart the operations of Israel's Mossad, and it later became clear to them that the man who headed it was a Mossad agent. Ahmadinejad said that in 2021 it became clear to them that the most senior person in the country whose job it was to deal with Israel's intelligence operations in Iran was a Mossad agent. 'Israel organized complex operations inside Iran. They could easily obtain information. In Iran they are still silent about this. The man who was in charge of the unit in Iran against Israel was an Israeli agent,' he said. And he, according to Ahmadinejad, was not the only one. Besides the head of the Iranian intelligence unit, another 20 members of that unit turned out to be Mossad agents. Ahmadinejad claimed that they were the ones who managed to steal the Iranian nuclear documents in 2018, and were also responsible for the elimination of Iranian nuclear scientists. Ahmadinejad was the president of Iran until 2013. He was succeeded by Hassan Rouhani, and his former chief of staff - former intelligence minister Ali Younesi - admitted in an interview in 2022: 'The Mossad has infiltrated many government departments in the last 10 years, to such a degree that all the country's top officials should fear for their lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj11tfdorc	2024-09-30T11:29:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/02/B1drMsYNC/B1drMsYNC_0_159_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Turkey's Erdogan says UN should recommend use of force if Israel ...	Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that the United Nations General Assembly should recommend the use of force, in line with a resolution it passed in 1950, if the U.N. Security Council fails to stop Israel's attacks in Gaza and Lebanon. NATO member Turkey has halted all trade with Israel and applied to join a genocide case against Israel at the World Court, which Israel rejects. 'The U.N. General Assembly should rapidly implement the authority to recommend the use of force, as it did with the 1950 Uniting for Peace resolution, if the Security Council can't show the necessary will,' Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara. The resolution says the U.N. General Assembly can step in if disagreements among the Security Council's five permanent veto-wielding powers - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - mean they fail to maintain international peace.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry7edwdra	2024-09-30T11:05:36-07:00

Israel begins demolition of Hamas-damaged homes in Kibbutz Kissuf...	Residents of Kibbutz Kissufim, where 18 members were murdered on Oct. 7, relocated to a new neighborhood in the town of Omer; 'The demolition brings back memories of October 7. It’s very emotional, but there’s also a sense of renewal,' says a kibbutz member overseeing the reconstruction efforts The demolition of buildings in Kibbutz Kissufim began on Monday, nearly a year after the October 7 massacre. Over the coming months, around 24 structures damaged by the Hamas attacks are set to be demolished and rebuilt. The first to go was the 'Artists' House,' which had also served as a second home for 86-year-old Shlomo Mansour, the oldest hostage still being held in Gaza, with no sign of life from him since the abduction. The Artists' House was located in a building that once served as the kibbutz's children's home, where local artists from Kissufim created and displayed their work. Tal Shaul, a kibbutz native who left and later returned to help with the rebuilding efforts, is overseeing the demolition and reconstruction process. 'This was our children's house. There are so many memories here. Seeing the building come down takes me back to what I saw on October 12, when I first returned after the massacre,' he said. 'It’s incredibly emotional, but at the same time, there’s an element of renewal,' Shaul added. 'As painful as it is, there's also a lot of hope in this. That’s what matters. We’re going to rebuild a new educational center on these ruins. Today marks the beginning of our recovery.' Shaul also leads the 'Odem' program at the Defense Ministry, which trains systems engineers for Israel’s defense industry. Alongside the reconstruction efforts, 78 families from the kibbutz community were resettled Sunday in the town of Omer as part of a temporary housing plan developed by the Tkumah Directorate. New housing units were built for the families, along with seven public buildings, including kindergartens, offices and a playground. The cost of building the Kissufim neighborhood is estimated at over 140 million shekels. On October 7, Hamas terrorists breached the gates of Kibbutz Kissufim, killing 18 residents. The kibbutz's rapid response team engaged in heroic battles with over 70 terrorists. Mansour, one of the kibbutz’s artists, was kidnapped after being handcuffed. His wife, Mazal, survived, and witnesses reported that Mansour was taken from their home after being restrained. Two weeks ago, some members of Kibbutz Be’eri also moved into temporary housing after a new neighborhood was constructed for them at Kibbutz Hatzerim near Be'er Sheva. The first to move were families with children, ahead of the new school year, which began earlier this month. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1f2ibdrr	2024-09-30T09:49:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/HyaxDedAA/HyaxDedAA_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israel planning to launch ground operation in Lebanon at any mome...	The operation is expected to be limited, according to the Washington Post, citing a US official; the New York Times reports that the US was able to convince Israel not to launch a major ground attack Israel is preparing to launch a ground attack in Lebanon imminently, but it is expected to be limited, an unnamed U.S. official told The Washington Post Monday, in a report which has been corroborated by other media outlets. The report comes as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that 'the next phase will begin soon.' 'Israel’s planned campaign would be smaller than its last war against Hezbollah in 2006 and would focus on clearing out terrorist infrastructure along the border to remove the threat to Israeli border communities,' the U.S. official told the Post. Another U.S. told the CBS news network that Israel has informed the U.S. that it intends to begin the ground maneuver phase, and that it 'may take place within hours.' At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a cease-fire. When asked if he 'feels comfortable' with Israel's plan, he said: 'I’m more worried than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now.' The New York Times cited U.S. officials who said that they believe they have succeeded in convincing Israel not to launch a major ground attack in Lebanon, after long talks held over the weekend. In the United States, signs were detected that Israel intended to launch a maneuver in Lebanon and that it could come soon. After the talks, they said that they now estimate that the planned attack is small and will include targeted raids in southern Lebanon. Special units in the IDF have already carried out such raids in recent days, in order to remove combat positions from which Hezbollah planned to target the northern settlements. According to the report, officials in Israel assured their counterparts in the United States that they do not plan for these raids to lead to a major attack by ground forces with the aim of occupying parts of southern Lebanon. The American officials said that they estimate that the commando units will withdraw immediately after the operations is over. However, according to the report, it is still unclear whether this is the final Israeli decision and if there is still a possibility of a large-scale attack. Another hint that the incursion could happen at any moment was given by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who met Monday with mayors of Israeli northern border communities. In a conversation with them, Gallant said that 'the next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon; it will be a significant factor in changing the security situation and will allow us to complete the important mission of returning the residents to their homes.' Earlier Monday, Gallant met with armored fighters on the northern border, and gave another hint when he told them: 'The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the end. In order to return the residents of the north, we will use all our capabilities, including you.' The Pentagon said on Monday that the US and Israel are still in discussions 'about the best way forward' when asked by reporters whether Israel was planning a ground offensive in Lebanon. 'We're continuing to engage with them, trying to learn more. We continue discussions on the best way forward,' Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told a news briefing.

German foreign minister criticizes Israel for assassinating Nasra...	Annalena Baerbock says the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah was an action that 'does not contribute to Israel's security' while her ministry says Israel was exercising self-defense German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock spoke out Sunday against the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a Friday strike on the Dahieh district of Beirut. 'This action leads to significant instability in the region and does not contribute to Israel’s security – in fact, the opposite,' she argued. Baerbock also warned of an escalating security situation and called on Israel to accept a U.S.-backed 21-day cease-fire proposal supported by France, Germany and several Arab nations to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. However, the German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said it was an act of self defense. 'Hezbollah is of course a terrorist organization and it was obviously a meeting of the top leadership of Hezbollah, from which one can assume, even from a distance, that they were planning their further operations,' the spokesperson said. 'So in this respect, there are also reasons to believe that the right to self defense was exercised here,' he added. Public reaction in Germany was notably different. Many saw the Israeli operation as a positive step for the Middle East and a rightful exercise of Israel’s self-defense. 'Since when is Hezbollah a pillar of stability in the Middle East?' quipped Marie-Louise Beck, a former Green Party MP, in response to Baerbock's remarks. Other politicians criticized Baerbock for her silence during Hezbollah’s 11-months of rocket attacks on northern Israel. 'Eliminating the leader of your greatest enemy – an enemy that launches daily rockets at Israel – surely helps Israel’s security,' said Frank Müller-Rosentritt, a foreign policy expert from the FDP, one of the coalition parties. A commentary piece went further, questioning Baerbock's public stance: 'How can we take our foreign minister seriously when she expresses such views and shows no relief over the death of a notorious terrorist? The region has been unstable for years, and this man contributed to that instability, with blood on his hands from both Israel and the Syrian Civil War. Her comments are an invitation for terror to reestablish itself. But this isn’t surprising – back in April, after an Iranian attack on Israel, Baerbock tweeted, ‘Everyone in the Middle East wants to live in peace.’ That was her response.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjptwx00ra	2024-09-30T08:36:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/17/ryxzFB6lR/ryxzFB6lR_0_123_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Shin Bet says foiled several Iranian assassination attempts in Is...	In an unusual message from the country's security agency, the Shim Bet, asks the public to be vigilant and report suspicious activity; says Iran has stepped up it efforts The Shin Bet has made an unusual announcement, accompanied by a serious warning and a request for public assistance. The security service warned on Monday of an Iranian intention to carry out 'assassination attacks in Israel,' announced that 'significant countermeasures' had recently been carried out and demanded that 'whenever a doubt or suspicion arises, report it immediately to the security services.' 'In recent weeks, the Shin Bet has detected a significant rise in Iran’s efforts to advance assassination attacks against targets in Israel,' the agency announced. In response, the Shin Bet carried out countermeasures described as 'very significant' against the planned attacks, some in very advanced stages of planning and readiness. The Shin Bet added that the details of some of these planned attacks have not yet been released to the public. Two weeks ago, the Shin Bet revealed Hezbollah's attempt to assassinate former Chief of Staff Moshe (Bogie) Ya'alon in Yarkon Park, and that it had foiled another attack by the terrorist organization against a former security official. Two hours after that announcement by the Shin Bet, thousands of pagers exploded in Lebanon, in what foreign publications reported was the opening salvo to the blows that Hezbollah has suffered. In its announcement on Monday, the Shin Bet reported that Iran is working to recruit Israeli civilians to harm senior Israeli officials , as was recently revealed in the investigation and arrest of Ashkelon resident Moti Maman, against whom an indictment was recently filed for serious security offenses. In addition, the Shin Bet said, the Iranians are working even harder to recruit Israeli citizens via the Internet. Iranian officials are trying to locate Israelis on various websites and platforms on the Internet, with an emphasis on websites and channels dealing with cryptocurrency, finance and on-line job searches. Iranian authorities offer those Israelis contacted on the internet a large payment to carry out various tasks, including hiding money and phones in various places in Israel, distributing flyers and writing graffiti, setting fire to vehicles and physically harming people. In many cases, at the time of establishing the relationship and at its beginning, the same Iranian officials present themselves as those who seek to 'employ' the same Israeli citizen to carry out seemingly innocent tasks for payment. But in a short time the requested 'tasks' become dangerous, threatening the security of the state and its citizens. 'The Shin Bet asks the public to pay increased attention and take extra caution in any case where suspicion arises, in accordance with the detailed procedures, especially when the sums involved are large and are not suited to the nature of the requested tasks, or if the requested tasks are unusual,' the agency say. 'If such doubt or suspicion arises , must be reported immediately to the security services.' 'The Shin Bet works to thwart Iranian activity within Israel and throughout the network, views with great severity any action by Israeli citizens on behalf of Iranian entities, whether minor or serious, and will work to exhaust justice with all the tools at its disposal, with anyone who comes into contact with those entities or acts to carry out tasks for them,' the organization clarified. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1qqdedc0	2024-09-30T08:09:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/rkvv8onTC/rkvv8onTC_0_0_1000_665_0_small.jpg

US to announce over $300 million in aid for Palestinians in Gaza,...	The United States on Monday will announce nearly $336 million in additional humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, according to a U.S. Agency for International Development statement seen by Reuters. The funding, first reported by Reuters, will enable USAID's partners to continue to provide humanitarian aid, including food assistance, health care, nutrition and other services, according to the statement. The funding will also support emergency shelter assistance to displaced Gazans ahead of winter, the statement said. 'Over the last year, this conflict has cost the lives of innocent Palestinians and Israelis and has left Gaza and the West Bank in a state of humanitarian crisis and dire humanitarian need,' the statement said. 'The United States continues to call on all parties to agree to a ceasefire deal and an immediate release of hostages, and to allow for the immediate scale-up of humanitarian aid moving into and throughout Gaza.' A USAID spokesperson said that agency partners have continued to reach people in Gaza with aid, but added that 'barriers to access and insecurity prevent the necessary scaling of assistance to adequately meet the needs of the 2.3 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in Gaza.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjt88e00rc	2024-09-30T07:33:41-07:00

Iran is likely seeking to avoid a regional war, and security officials in the US and several Middle Eastern countries suggest Nasrallah's assassination is unlikely to trigger such a conflict, Bloomberg also reports As the world speculates about Iran's 'next move' in the wake of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's assassination, concerns grow over potential retaliation. Meanwhile, reports from the U.S. indicate preparations for a possible attack from Iranian territory. However, according to a report by Bloomberg, Iran is likely seeking to avoid a regional war. Current and former officials in the U.S. and several Middle Eastern countries suggest Nasrallah's assassination is unlikely to trigger such a conflict. Instead, Iran is expected to focus on rebuilding Hezbollah and keeping its proxies across the region active for as long as possible. Bloomberg highlights the severe blow Hezbollah, and by extension, Iran, suffered with the assassination of Nasrallah and Hezbollah's top leadership. They also note a cautious statement issued by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who declared that the region's future will be shaped by the 'forces of resistance,' but stopped short of issuing a direct threat against Israel. A source familiar with the operations of Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria said Hezbollah’s allies in these countries are now expected to play a central role in smuggling resources to the Lebanese terror group. The same source added that Iran will now also try to move thousands of fighters to the border areas of Lebanon and Syria and, according to him, thousands of fighters have already moved from Iraq to Syria in recent months - a move that probably indicates that Iran is preparing to strengthen its forces in the region, apparently for the purposes of 'deterrence.' Bloomberg also reports that since Hezbollah began assisting the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war in 2012, the Shiite terrorist organization has built bases and a 'sophisticated' network of tunnels in various areas of Syria close to the border with Lebanon. A source familiar the details noted that many Hezbollah field commanders recently fled Lebanon to Syria along with their families. Meanwhile, a drone exploded on Monday at a horse farm in Merom Golan, meters from kids, injuring horses on Golan Heights. No sirens were activated anywhere nearby, to warn of the attack. There were no injuries reported but a fire broke out and was handled by the local emergency response team. Two horses were injured by shrapnel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkznbmo0a	2024-09-30T07:23:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/10/HyCp5SszC/HyCp5SszC_0_14_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Head of Lebanon Branch of PFLP terror group eliminated, IDF says	During a joint IDF and ISA intelligence-based activity, the Israeli Air Force struck and eliminated the terrorist Nidal Abdel-Aal, head of the Lebanon Branch of the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) terrorist organization, the IDF announced on Monday afternoon. The terrorist Imad Odeh, who was the head of PFLP's Military Office in Lebanon, was eliminated alongside him. Abdel-Aal led PFLP’s efforts to plan and carry out terror attacks against the State of Israel and directed the organization's terror activities in the West Bank. He operated to establish terror infrastructure in the West Bank to use in attacks on Israeli targets. Nidal Abdel-Aal directed the bus bombing attack in Beitar Illit on March 9, 2023, and the shooting attack from a passing vehicle at the Huwara Junction on March 25, 2023, during which two IDF soldiers were injured. The two terror cells that carried out the attacks were apprehended by the ISA.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6taq00ca	2024-09-30T06:57:46-07:00	
CERN ends cooperation with Russian scientists	The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) will end cooperation with up to 500 scientists affiliated with Russian institutions, it said on Monday, because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Swiss-based CERN, best known for its studies in particle physics and its Large Hadron Collider, will not renew its cooperation agreement with Russia when it ends on November 30 2024.The decision means around 400 to 500 scientists linked to Russian laboratories will no longer be able to collaborate with CERN, a spokesperson said. Cooperation with around 15 Belarussian scientists has also been stopped. 'CERN is an international organization, but it is not an island. It's not acceptable to support scientific research when wars are taking place between countries which once had staff who worked together at CERN,' the spokesperson said. Russian scientists will be able to continue to work at CERN if they are affiliated with non-Russian institutes, with around 90 having done so.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjo0000xdac	2024-09-30T06:33:28-07:00

In a videotape message in English, the prime minister tells Iranians to imagine a prosperous country at peace; 'The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly addressed the Iranian people and told them that the Iranian leadership does not care about them and is not protecting them. Netanyahu released a videotaped message in English on Monday afternoon, saying: 'I speak a lot about the leaders of Iran. Yet at this pivotal moment, I want to address you – the people of Iran. I want to do so directly, without filters, without middlemen.' 'Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you, makes fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza. Yet every day, that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness and deeper into war. Every day, their puppets are eliminated. Ask Mohammed Deif. Ask Nasrallah,' he said, referring to Israel's killing of leaders of Iranian terror proxies. 'There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country. With every passing moment, the regime is bringing you — the noble Persian people — closer to the abyss. The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn't care a whit about them. If it did care, if it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East. It would start improving your lives,' he said. 'Iran’s tyrants don’t care about your future; But you do,' he added. He described a world in which Iran and Israel are at peace, instead of Iranian citizens living in 'endless poverty, repression and war.' 'Don't let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams. You deserve better. Your children deserve better. The entire world deserves better,' he said, concluding: 'The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you. May we together know a future of prosperity and peace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjao11x00c0	2024-09-30T06:22:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJ9L7sUCA/HJ9L7sUCA_437_313_2139_1204_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah drone explodes meters from kids, injures horses on Gola...	No sirens activated in the drone strike; Fires break out at a horse farm while children are present, causing terror, shock; horses wounded from shrapnel, no harm to humans A drone exploded on Monday at a horse farm in Merom Golan, a kibbutz in the western Golan Heights. No sirens were activated anywhere nearby, to earn of the attack. There were no injuries reported but a fire broke out and was handled by the local emergency response team. Two horses were injured by shrapnel. Mozi Anidjar, a member of the kibbutz, described that a children's lesson was taking place in the stable about 20 meters from the impact site. 'I was in my food truck when I heard the boom. I immediately drove to the stable to see if any help was needed for the injured, heaven forbid. A major disaster was avoided; if it had fallen 20 yards closer to the stable, it would have been a disaster in the same level as what happened in Majdal Shams.' The horse trainer and riding instructor mentioned seeing the drone hovering before it hit, saying, 'It just dropped and fell.' He added, 'The children are okay, just a bit in shock.' Michal Laufer, who had been evacuated from Kibbutz Dan in the Upper Galilee to Merom Golan, told Ynet that she heard a loud explosion while in the area, preparing for another move to the center. She explained that after three months, due to the difficult situation and lack of educational frameworks, they decided to leave Merom Golan as well. 'We sent our son to the center and came here to pack up the apartment we rented. We went to the hotel to do laundry with other evacuated friends, and with a laundry basket in hand, I heard a boom and a crazy explosion. Another mother, children, and I went into the bomb shelter. Some of the children were at the hotel entrance with an instructor who said they saw the drone and heard its noise. Then it exploded. I'm shaking all over. The explosion was about a hundred yards from me.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj9vy11d0r	2024-09-30T05:15:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/r1eCIguAC/r1eCIguAC_442_126_431_243_0_small.jpg

Hurricane Helene kills at least 90 in US; homes and memories wash...	Officials fear more bodies would be discovered, after cellphone towers down across the region, and hundreds of people have yet to make contact with loved ones and are listed as unaccounted for The Southeastern U.S. began a huge cleanup and recovery effort on Sunday and the death toll climbed to 100 after Hurricane Helene knocked out power for millions, destroyed roads and bridges and caused dramatic flooding from Florida to Virginia. The storm's winds, rain and storm surge killed at least 90 people in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia, according to a Reuters tally of state and local officials. Officials feared more bodies would be discovered. With cellphone towers down across the region, hundreds of people had yet to make contact with loved ones and were listed as unaccounted for. Damage estimates ranged from $15 billion to more than $100 billion, insurers and forecasters said over the weekend, as water systems, communications and critical transportation routes were affected. Property damage and lost economic output will become clearer as officials assess the destruction. In North Carolina, nearly all the deaths were in Buncombe County, where 30 people died, Sheriff Quentin Miller told a video conference call with reporters. County Manager Avril Pinder said she was asking the state for emergency food and drinking water. Streets in the picturesque city of Asheville were submerged in floodwater. 'This is a devastating catastrophe of historic proportions,' Governor Roy Cooper told CNN. 'People that I talk to in western North Carolina say they have never seen anything like this.' Search and rescue teams from 19 states and the U.S. government have converged on the state, Cooper said, adding that some roads could take months to repair. In Flat Rock, North Carolina, there were widespread blackouts, and people waited hours in line for gas. 'Grocery stores are closed, cellphone service is out,' Chip Frank, 62, said as he entered his third hour waiting in line. 'It all depends on these gas stations. You're not going to be able to go nowhere, and it's just a scary feeling.' Roughly 2.7 million customers throughout the South were without power on Sunday, a U.S. Energy Department official said, down 40% from Friday after unprecedented storm surges, ferocious winds and perilous conditions extended hundreds of miles inland. South Carolina reported 25 dead, Georgia 17 and Florida 11, according to the governors of those states. CNN reported a total of 93 dead across the South, citing state and local officials. President Joe Biden plans to visit affected areas this week, once he can do so without disrupting emergency services, the White House said. 'It's tragic,' Biden told reporters on Sunday, pledging recovery assistance after declaring major disasters in Florida and North Carolina and emergencies for Florida, North Carolina Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama. 'You saw the photographs. It's stunning.' Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris planned to cut short a campaign trip in Nevada on Monday to take part in briefings in Washington on the hurricane response and will visit the region when doing so won't impede the response, a White House official said. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will visit Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to receive a briefing on storm damage and 'facilitate the distribution of relief supplies,' his campaign said. Helene slammed into Florida's Gulf Coast on Thursday night, triggering days of driving rain and destroying homes that had stood for decades. In Horseshoe Beach, on Florida's Gulf Coast about 70 miles (120 km) west of Gainesville, Charlene Huggins surveyed the debris of her blown-out house, pulling a jacket out of the rubble on Saturday. 'Five generations lived in this house, from my grandmother, my father, myself, my daughter, son and my granddaughter,' Huggins said, holding a chipped glass cake stand. 'So there's a lot of memories here. It just breaks your heart.' Not far away, James Ellenburg stood on the property where his own family has lived for four generations. 'I took my first step right here in this yard.' The roof of one home sat flat in the dirt, its walls blown away. In coastal Steinhatchee, a storm surge â€' a wall of seawater pushed ashore by winds â€' of eight to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 meters) moved mobile homes, the weather service said. Other areas saw a storm surge of 15 feet (4.5 meters). In the nearby tiny community of Spring Warrior Fish Camp, people were surveying the damage on Saturday and still waiting for emergency or first responder aid. 'No one thinks of us back here,' said David Hall, as he and his wife dug through seagrass and dead fish in the office of the hotel they owned. Many of the community's homes are built on stilts because of a local ordinance and survived heavy damage. Kristin Macqueen was helping friends clean up after their house was destroyed in nearby Keaton Beach. 'It's complete devastation,' she said. 'Houses have just been ripped off their slabs.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1mdoeo0a	2024-09-30T05:09:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/Hybs1Gd00/Hybs1Gd00_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Nasrallah deputy: 'If Israel decides to enter by land, we're read...	As Hezbollah are primed to name Hashem Safieddine as Nasrallah's successor, the organization's number two accuses the Biden administration of backing Israel's actions and says they will not be deterred by an IDF ground invasion Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem, in his first public address since Israel assassinated the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah last week, said the movement is ready to confront any Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon. 'Israel will not achieve its goals', he said. 'We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.' Qassem accused the United States for 'providing Israel with unlimited support in carrying out the massacre.' Hezbollah's Deputy Secretary-General, threatened Israel once again: 'We will emerge victorious from this battle. Contrary to what the enemy claimed - there was no meeting of 20 leaders. Israel is committing a massacre throughout Lebanon, leaving no home without signs of aggression,' he said. 'Israel will not achieve its goal with its brutality. The path of resistance continues, and Hezbollah pursues its objectives and jihad. The leadership continues precisely as Nasrallah established. We will continue to support Gaza and defend Palestine - at the same pace. What we are doing is the minimum, as part of the plan to continue the battle and what the field demands. We know the battle will be long, and we are ready to face any event. The enemy will not achieve its goal.' Qassem also claimed in his speech that Hezbollah struck targets 90 miles deep inside Israel. 'The enemy is going mad because it cannot match our capabilities,' he said. 'We will win as we did in 2006. Within Hezbollah's structure, there are deputy commanders and ready replacements for when a leader is injured, in every role. We will elect the Secretary-General as soon as possible and according to the approved mechanism. Victory is ours, patience is needed, we are ready.' Israeli forces have dealt multiple blows to Hezbollah in a two-week wave of attacks on targets in Lebanon that have eliminated top commanders, destroyed infrastructure and depleted the terror group's arsenal of weapons. The possibility that Israel's next move might be to send ground troops and tanks over the border is on many minds. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Tehran would not leave any of Israel's 'criminal acts' go unanswered. He was referring to the killing of Nasrallah and an Iranian Guard deputy commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who died in the same strikes on Friday. Lebanon's Health Ministry says more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without specifying how many were civilians. One million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes, the government says. The escalation has put Beirut on edge, with Lebanese fearful that Israel will expand its military campaign. 'There is nothing else to say or add, except God save Lebanon,' Beirut resident Nawel said. 'What will happen to me is the same as what can happen to anyone.' Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he was prepared to deploy his army to the border with Israel. He said Lebanon was seeking an immediate cease-fire. After meeting with Lebanese Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, Mikati said a special parliamentary session to elect a new president will be held as soon as a cease-fire in in effect. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfkqeucr	2024-09-30T04:04:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/Sk00WYyuA0/Sk00WYyuA0_67_0_723_407_0_small.jpg

Syrian civil war opened doors for Israel's deep dive into Hezboll...	The iinternal strife created a unique intelligence opportunity for Israel to leverage technological superiority; Israel gathered extensive insights, reshaping its strategic approach and maintaining a vigilant stance against potential threats The Syrian civil war played a pivotal role in enabling Israel's extensive intelligence penetration into Hezbollah, effectively transforming it into a vast repository of insights on Hezbollah operatives, according to an in-depth report in the British Financial Times. In the article titled 'How Israeli Spies Infiltrated Hezbollah,' a former senior Lebanese politician said Hezbollah operatives had to 'expose themselves in Syria,' sharing information with Assad's corrupt intelligence services or the Russian intelligence agencies, which were under constant American surveillance. Following the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Israel recalibrated its intelligence strategy towards Hezbollah. This refocus was accompanied by technological advancements that became 'insurmountable,' including satellites, advanced drones, and even capabilities to hack mobile phones, transforming them into listening devices or, as Hassan Nasrallah noted in one of his speeches, into agents. When Hezbollah deployed its forces to support Assad against the uprising and later to combat ISIS, Israel seized the opportunity. An 'intelligence tapestry' emerged, detailing the roles and responsibilities within Hezbollah, identifying who advanced, who was deemed 'corrupt,' and who precisely returned from ambiguous travels. According to the Financial Times, once Israel identified Hezbollah operatives, their daily behavioral patterns were meticulously logged into a database, drawing data from their vehicle, locations, and even their spouse's mobile phone. Israeli sources told the FT that security footage or the operative’s voice recorded nearby could also be exploited by Israel. Any deviation from the norm, as reported, triggers alerts for Israeli intelligence officers, enabling them to assess whether these operatives intend to launch an attack. The Syrian civil war, as described by the former senior Lebanese politician, was the 'price of supporting Assad,' forcing operatives to expose themselves. The Financial Times further said that in recent months or years, Israeli intelligence refined a technique that intermittently allowed them to pinpoint the location of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated last Friday at the main underground command center of the terrorist organization in the Dahieh. The British publication said that throughout more than ten months of ongoing conflict, Israel concentrated on lower-ranking Hezbollah operatives, a focus to which senior figures in the organization had grown accustomed. Between the two sides, well-defined red lines appeared to exist, and Hezbollah hoped the campaign would conclude with a ceasefire. However, Israel did not dismiss the potential for a massacre akin to that of October 7 occurring in northern communities—and acted accordingly. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryzjw0dc0	2024-09-30T03:04:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/r1bTjzKL0A/r1bTjzKL0A_0_230_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israeli special ops breech Hezbollah tunnels near border, report	Repeated incursions into Hezbollah's underground tunnel system in South Lebanon aimed to gather intelligence and diminish the terror group's military capabilities ahead of a possible ground offensive IDF special ops fighters entered Hezbollah rockets along the Lebanese border with Israel to gather intelligence and in preparation for the military's possible land offensive that could come as early as this week, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. In the report, the raids took place in recent months as part of the IDF's attempts to diminish Hezbollah's military capabilities along the border. Officials told the paper that the timing of an IDF ground offensive could change and that The Israeli government was under heavy pressure from the Biden administration, to avoid an extensive operation. On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden said a broader conflict must be avoided and that he along with French president Emmanuel Macron and other allies were working hard to secure a temporary cease-fire that would allow for a diplomatic solution to the conflict to be agreed. ABC News reported on Sunday that the military may soon launch small scale attacks across the border into Lebanon to debilitate Hezbollah's positions there. American officials told the network that a ground offensive if launched, would be limited in scope.'

Hezbollah's lone surviving old generation commander	Talal Hamiyah, one of Hezbollah's senior commanders who is responsible for attacks against Jews and Israelis abroad, avoids assassination after being absent from the bunker bombed by Israel; has a 7 million dollar bounty on his head Following Hezbollah's Shura Council tapping of Hashem Safieddine as the organization's new secretary-general after Hassan Nasrallah's assassination, Israel and the U.S. look for Talal Hamiyah, a senior Hezbollah official who did not attend the last meeting for more than 20 Hezbollah commanders. Hamiyah heads Unit 910 in charge of targeting Israelis and Jews abroad. So far, Talal Hamiyah has successfully dodged attempts on his life, knowing Israel was looking for him and that the Americans had offered a seven-million-dollar bounty on his head. He heads Hezbollah's Unit 910 - also dubbed 'Shadow Unit' or 'Black Unit,' which was established in 2020, after the U.S. assassinated Iran's senior commander of the Revolutionary Guards Quds force in Iraq, to carry out attacks against Israelis and Jews abroad but also against Americans. Hamiyah has close ties to the top brass in the IRGC, which has bases in countries that are part of the Shiite axis (Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen) and certain countries in Africa and maintains close relationships with international criminal organizations around the world. Hamiyah's operatives also recruit, fundraise, and assemble explosives, even in Latin America. Before rising through Hezbollah's ranks, Hamiyah was a clerk at the Beirut airport. Two years later, in the mid-1980s, he joined Hezbollah, reaching high-level positions. To this day, he is wanted in many countries, including the U.S., and hardly ever leaves Lebanon, except to visit Iran, Iraq, or Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjlp3hvcc	2024-09-30T01:05:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/yk14098215/yk14098215_0_86_283_160_0_small.jpg
IDF thwarts possible strike on offshore gas rig	Military releases images of an attack drone intercepted after it enters Israeli economic waters from the north; Houthi rebels also threatened to strike gas drilling and other Israeli energy installations after July Hudeidah port attack The IDF said on Monday that its aerial defenses shot down an attack drone that entered Israel's economic waters from the north, believed to have been targeting and offshore natural gas rig. The suspected attempt to attack Israel's natural gas infrastructure came days after the IDF assassinated Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and many of his senior commanders in a strike on the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut. The terror group on Monday confirmed the death of one more of its senior officials, Ali Karki, who was with Nasrallah in the command bunker that was bombed. Hezbollah had reportedly made numerous attempts to target offshore drilling for natural gas since the war began, most recently last week. In July, a naval vessel, in cooperation with the Air Force, successfully intercepted an unmanned aircraft entering the economic waters from Lebanon. Houthi rebels in Yemen also said they planned to retaliate against Israel for its July attack on the port of Hodeidah, by attacking Israel's natural gas rigs in the Mediterranean and other energy facilities, the Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkaf7rd0a	2024-09-30T00:41:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/BJuKm0wRC/BJuKm0wRC_0_0_462_263_0_small.jpg

Senior Hamas member and UNRWA staffer, killed in Tyre, Hamas says	Fatah Sharif Abu al Amin praised the Hamas massacre on October 7, was temporarily suspended from the UN agency for 'violating regulations' The Hamas terror group said on Monday that its senior member, Fatah Sharif Abu al Amin, was killed in an IDF strike in the area of Tyre, along with his wife, son and daughter. Al Amin who was quick to praise the Hamas massacre on October 7 was described as the terror group's leader in Lebanon and a member of its international leadership. He was also employed by the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees UNRWA and was chairman of its teacher's union. UNRWA said he was suspended from his position as teacher in the UN's school last march for a period of three months over what it described was a violation of regulations. After his suspension, dozens protested outside the UNRWA offices in Beirut. Israel accused the UN agency of employing terrorists in Gaza, some of whom participated in the October 7 atrocities. The UN admitted that at least nine of its employees were probably involved in the massacre. The western areas of South Lebanon are Hamas's main stomping grounds and its operatives there, have been responsible for much of the rocket fire targeting Nahariya and towns north of Haifa.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syc0nadac	2024-09-29T23:39:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/rkGISnD00/rkGISnD00_0_143_628_354_0_small.jpg

Senior PFLP members killed in Beirut strike	The attack on an apartment block in Beirut was the first carried out on a Sunni neighborhood outside the Hezbollah stronghold in the Dahieh A Palestinian terror group said on Monday that three of its leaders were killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut, the first attack within city limits as Israel escalated hostilities against Iran's allies in the region. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three leaders were killed in a strike that targeted Beirut's Kola district. The strike hit the upper floor of an apartment building in the Kola district of Lebanon's capital, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military. The PFLP is another group taking part in the fight against Israel. Israel's increasing frequency of attacks against the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and the Houthi militia in Yemen have prompted fears that Middle East fighting could spin out of control and draw in Iran and the United States, Israel's main ally. Israel on Sunday launched airstrikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen and dozens of Hezbollah targets throughout Lebanon after earlier killing the Hezbollah leader. The Houthi-run health ministry said at least four people were killed and 29 wounded in airstrikes on Yemen's port of Hodeidah, which Israel said were a response to Houthi missile attacks. In Lebanon, authorities said at least 105 people had been killed by Israeli air strikes on Sunday. Lebanon's Health Ministry has said more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes. The intensifying Israeli bombardment over two weeks has killed a string of top Hezbollah officials, including its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Israel has vowed to keep up the assault and says it wants to make its northern areas secure again for residents who have been forced to flee Hezbollah rocket attacks. Monday's attack in the Kola district appeared to be the first strike within Beirut's city limits. Syrians living in southern Lebanon who had fled Israeli bombardment had been sleeping under a bridge in the neighborhood for days, residents of the area said. The United States has urged a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Lebanon but has also authorized its military to reinforce in the region. U.S. President Joe Biden asked if an all-out war in the Middle East could be avoided, replied: 'It has to be.' He said he would be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1h7qiwac	2024-09-29T21:13:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/BkxWXksvR0/BkxWXksvR0_0_60_800_450_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah names new leader after Nasrallah assassination, report ...	Terror group's executive council head Hashem Safieddine reportedly tapped to succeed cousin slain in Israeli airstrike in Beirut; Iranian axis making arrangements for 'historic funeral' Hezbollah's Shura Council has chosen Hashem Safieddine as the organization's new secretary-general, following the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike on Beirut’s Dahieh district on Friday, Saudi television channel Al Hadath reported Sunday. Safieddine is Nasrallah's cousin and the head of Hezbollah's executive council. His appointment has yet to be officially confirmed by either Hezbollah or Lebanese authorities. Reports over the weekend identified Safieddine as a likely successor to Nasrallah, and various outlets noted that he was not present at the senior meeting where Nasrallah was killed. Safieddine, who closely resembles Nasrallah, is also the son-in-law of former Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani. Often referred to as Nasrallah’s 'shadow,' he has served as Hezbollah’s second-in-command, overseeing the group’s daily operations, including its institutions, finances and investments both in Lebanon and abroad. Since 1994, when Nasrallah recalled him from his studies in Qom, Iran, to lead Hezbollah's executive council—essentially the group’s government—Safieddine has managed all sensitive issues while Nasrallah handled strategic matters. His close ties to both Hezbollah's military wing and Iran have been well-documented, and he has been on the U.S. terrorist list since 2017. Meanwhile, it remains unclear when Nasrallah's funeral will take place. According to Reuters, his body was recovered from the site of the attack. A medical and security official in Lebanon told Reuters that the body was intact and Nasrallah did not suffer direct injuries. His death was attributed to the trauma caused by the explosion. Initial reports suggested the funeral would be held on Monday, but there has been no confirmation from Lebanese or Hezbollah officials. Lebanon’s An-Nahar newspaper reported that Hezbollah's leadership has been holding high-level consultations, involving officials from Iraq and Iran, to finalize funeral arrangements. Although no official statement has been made by Hezbollah, sources say a 'historic funeral' is planned in Beirut. There are also reports that prayers will be held in Iran, after which Nasrallah’s body will be flown to Karbala, Iraq, for burial near Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Muhammad and one of the most important figures in Shia Islam. In Iran, a portrait of Nasrallah was displayed alongside President Masoud Pezeshkian during a government meeting on Sunday. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari, in an interview with Sky News Arabia, said Nasrallah 'escalated tensions in Lebanon for Hamas. He paid the price. The world is safer without him; he terrorized many in the region.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1g113nva0	2024-09-29T14:08:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2022/05/20/HyaGDCEv9/HyaGDCEv9_0_0_680_396_0_small.jpg

Strike on Hodeidah port disrupts Houthi fuel supply, military say...	Gallant says cost of attacking Israel 'seen on television screens around the world' in response to repeated missile launches by Houthi rebels The IDF said Sunday that it launched airstrikes on the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah and nearby targets in Yemen after the rebel group repeatedly fired missiles at Israel. Dozens of Israeli fighter jets bombed the city's power station and port, hitting infrastructure used for oil intake as well as an oil depot that had been spared in a previous Israeli strike in July in retaliation for a deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv. The IDF said the attack has halted fuel supplies through the seaport and is expected to severely impact the Houthis' military capabilities. 'This time we targeted the Houthis' bottleneck,' the military said. The IDF confirmed that Air Force jets, which flew 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from Israel, refueled mid-flight during the operation. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was present at the Air Force command center during the strikes. 'The military's ability to strike on seven fronts almost simultaneously speaks volumes about its strength,' Gallant said. 'We are targeting the tentacles of Iran that are spread across the region.' Gallant praised the IDF's long-range capabilities, saying, 'These strikes send a clear message to those who seek to harm us: Israel will exact a heavy price, and we mean it. The cost of attacking Israel is seen on television screens around the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk001bmprr	2024-09-29T13:24:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/BkalHyDA0/BkalHyDA0_1_241_352_198_0_small.jpg
Since October 7, 170 new books on the war published, report revea...	National Library report finds most frequently covered topics in recent publications include hostages, stories of heroism, protests, soldiers' memories and rise of antisemitism in diaspora As the first anniversary of the October 7 terrorist attack approaches, Israel's National Library released a special report on Sunday highlighting books published in the wake of the war. According to the report, 169 books and publications have been released, covering topics such as the hostages, stories of heroism, protests and memories of soldiers, as well as the rise of antisemitism in the Diaspora. Of these, 42 are research papers and reports, 30 are nonfiction and reference books, 29 are personal testimonies and accounts of heroism, 14 are poetry collections, 9 are works of fiction and 3 are children's books. The National Library emphasized that the report is only partial, noting that writing and publishing books is a lengthy and complex process, predicting that hundreds more books will be published in the coming years, including a significant number of memorial and tribute books expected to be released around the anniversary of the war. For comparison, the library examined the number of books published after the Yom Kippur War and found that about 300 were released within the first year (by the end of 1974). Over the following 50 years, thousands more books were published on the topic, both in Hebrew and other languages. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7, the National Library has been tasked with creating an archive that documents all aspects of the digital response. So far, this includes 500 million online items, such as WhatsApp messages, social media posts and videos, as well as two million digital files, more than a thousand printed materials like posters, flyers and booklets, and thousands of filmed testimonies. As part of its commemorative efforts, the library has launched a project titled 'Lives Lost: The Works of the Victims of October 7,' which honors those who wrote, edited and translated books before their lives were tragically cut short. Additionally, on October 6, the library will host a musical performance titled 'At the End of Tishrei: An Evening of Poetry and Remembrance,' featuring journalist Ben Shani as host and performances by Shlomi Saranga, Alma Gov, The Backyard and others. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryzhjyvr0	2024-09-29T13:07:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/10/SJr00F042DC/SJr00F042DC_145_147_1057_595_0_small.jpg
IDF chief’s cryptic photo sparks questions as Sinwar vanishes aft...	Army releases photo showing IDF chief seated in front of screen with picture of Hamas leader and question mark over his face, amid rumors Sinwar may be dead; speculation grew after reports he went incommunicado The IDF released a photo Sunday evening showing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi at his desk, with an infographic in the background featuring a picture of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar with a question mark over his face. Speculation has grown in Israel over the past week regarding Sinwar's status, with rumors circulating about whether he has been killed or injured after reports that he has been out of contact. However, defense officials said there is no concrete information confirming his whereabouts, and no recent targeted strikes have been reported in areas where Sinwar was believed to be. On Saturday, Saudi-based Al Arabiya reported that Sinwar changed his location in Gaza following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. The report also claimed that Hamas has adjusted its security protocols for Sinwar and other leaders in recent days. Sources told Al Arabiya that Hamas leaders are seeking guarantees in any future cease-fire agreement to ensure their safety. Additionally, Hamas has halted organizational meetings in Lebanon and restricted internal communications to written correspondence to avoid potential Israeli interception or tracking of senior officials' locations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdwngdrc	2024-09-29T12:50:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/11/HJa74KHSA/HJa74KHSA_0_0_713_401_0_small.jpg

Mocked Israel, suppressed hijab protests: Iranian general assassi...	Iranian deputy foreign minister vows killing of Abbas Nilforoushan 'will not go unanswered'; sanctioned by US in 2022 for role in suppressing civil rights protests in Iran Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi vowed on Sunday that Iran would avenge the killing of senior Quds Force officer Abbas Nilforoushan, who was killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's Dahieh district. 'This will not go unanswered,' Araghchi said, following confirmation from Iranian officials that Nilforoushan had been present in the underground headquarters at the time of the strike. Araghchi’s remarks come amid reports of an internal debate within the Iranian regime over how to respond to Nasrallah’s far more significant assassination. According to The New York Times, hardliners in Tehran are pushing for swift retaliation, while Iran's more moderate President Massoud Pezhkian is cautioning against a regional war that could severely damage Iran's economy. Regardless, Tehran may feel compelled to retaliate, as it did after the assassination of another top Iranian general in an Israeli strike on Damascus in April. Nilforoushan, 58, was described by Iranian media as the 'deputy commander of operations' for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, where he oversaw ground forces. While it’s unclear what he was doing in Lebanon, AP notes the Quds Force’s crucial role in arming and directing Iran’s proxies throughout the Middle East, most notably Hezbollah. Recent reports suggest that Nilforoushan was effectively the Quds Force commander in Syria and Lebanon. Iran’s deputy judiciary chief Ahmad Reza Kahan declared that Nilforoushan had been 'a guest of the Lebanese people' and that Iran has a right to respond under international law. Nilforoushan had previously mocked Israel, frequently repeating anti-Israel rhetoric similar to that of Nasrallah. In a 2022 interview with Iran’s state news agency IRNA, he said: 'The Zionist regime has many cracks—ethnic, cultural, social and military. The regime is more vulnerable to collapse than ever.' That same year, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Nilforoushan, accusing him of playing a direct role in suppressing civil rights protests in Iran. The sanctions coincided with widespread demonstrations following the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died after being detained by Iran's morality police for not wearing a hijab in accordance with strict Sharia law. Nilforoushan blamed Iran's enemies for stoking the protests. Nilforoushan also fought alongside Syria’s Assad regime in the bloody civil war that saw the Syrian dictator maintain power with the help of Iran, Hezbollah and Russia. He began his military career during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, and Iranian media described him as a close associate of powerful Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2020. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj8wwwp0r	2024-09-29T12:22:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/S1P00iuSCR/S1P00iuSCR_0_10_800_450_0_small.jpg
Israel strikes on four fronts, sending stark warning to Iran	Senior official says fighter jets flew 1,800 kilometers to strike Houthi assets in Yemen, including Hodeidah port and airport, underscoring Air Force capable of reaching targets at similar distance to Iran if required The Israel Defense Forces launched extensive airstrikes Sunday on targets in Yemen, Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, including the Lebanese capital Beirut. The strikes reportedly targeted sites in Homs, western Syria and areas near Damascus. Senior officials told Ynet that the strike on Yemen came in response to Houthi missile fire on Tel Aviv on Saturday. The attack was also aimed at deterring Iran from retaliating for the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli officials said the strikes were intended to send a clear message to Iran, with the IDF showing it can engage on multiple fronts. Air Force jets flew 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) to strike Hodeidah, a distance comparable to that from Israel to Iran. 'The strike on Yemen aims to exact a heavy price for their attacks,' an Israeli official said. 'If the Houthis continue targeting Israel, our strikes will intensify.' Iran has vowed to avenge the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last July in an attack attributed to Israel. The IDF said in a statement that dozens of Israeli Air Force planes, including fighter jets, mid-air refueling aircraft and reconnaissance planes, struck military targets belonging to the Houthi forces in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah areas of Yemen. The targets included power plants and a seaport used to import oil, which the Houthis used to transfer Iranian weapons. The military added that the damage to Houthi infrastructure would take time to repair. 'The IDF is determined to continue operating at any distance—near or far—against all threats to Israeli citizens,' the statement concluded. The military also confirmed targeted strikes on Hezbollah officials in Beirut’s Dahieh neighborhood, including a senior commander from Unit 1600, responsible for producing rocket and missile materials and trafficking the addictive stimulant Captagon. In Gaza, the IDF said it targeted a Hamas command center operating from a school. The military stressed it had taken precautions to avoid civilian casualties. Meanwhile, Syrian state media reported that air defenses were activated in response to Israeli strikes near Damascus, following earlier strikes on Homs. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkuvrevca	2024-09-29T11:59:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/By7x5sJPA0/By7x5sJPA0_0_453_520_293_0_small.jpg

New Hope Party leader Gideon Sa'ar joins government amid war	Veteran lawmaker assigned minister without portfolio, will be included in inner circle of war consultations and serve as member of Security Cabinet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that New Hope Party leader Gideon Sa'ar is set to join the government as a minister without portfolio. He will also be included in the inner circle of war consultations and serve as a member of the Security Cabinet. Sa’ar’s return to government comes after years of tension between him and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Once a close ally and a senior figure in the prime minister's ruling Likud party, Sa’ar broke away from Likud in 2020 to form the New Hope Party, citing deep disagreements with Netanyahu’s leadership and policies. Sa’ar had previously held key roles under Netanyahu’s leadership, including serving as minister of education and the interior. However, his defection was seen as a direct challenge to Netanyahu, as Sa’ar became one of his most vocal critics, positioning himself as an alternative leader on the right. In the early days of the war, Sa'ar joined an emergency unity government with Netanyahu under the National Unity alliance with former IDF chiefs of staff Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, taking part in the War Cabinet. Sa'ar, Gantz and Eisenkot resigned from the Cabinet in June, citing their inability to influence key decision-making processes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryaeq11prr	2024-09-29T09:46:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/SJ5WXZv0C/SJ5WXZv0C_0_0_1280_836_0_small.jpg

Saudi crown prince says doesn't care about 'Palestinian issue'	Mohammed bin Salman reportedly tells Blinken kingdom's young population first learning about Israeli-Palestinian conflict through Gaza war Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in January that, while he does not personally prioritize the Palestinian issue, it holds significant importance for the Saudi people, according to a report by The Atlantic. 'Do I care personally about the Palestinian issue? I don’t, but my people do,' he reportedly said during a meeting in Al-Ula, a remote oasis in Saudi Arabia, as part of American efforts to address the ongoing war in Gaza and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages. The crown prince explained that with 70% of Saudi Arabia’s population being young, the Gaza war marked the first time many of them were exposed to the Palestinian issue. During the meeting, Blinken sought to revive talks on Saudi-Israeli normalization, which had stalled after the October 7 Hamas attacks and the subsequent war. When asked what it would take to resume progress, the crown prince responded, 'calm in Gaza.' According to the report, Blinken also inquired whether Saudi Arabia would tolerate Israeli operations in Gaza to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Bin Salman reportedly replied that such incursions might be acceptable 'in six months or a year,' but stressed they could not be tied to any cease-fire agreement. A Saudi official later suggested that the details of the crown prince's comments in The Atlantic report were inaccurate but did not deny the overall substance of the remarks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1s1111ypra	2024-09-29T09:07:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/03/21/rylmMSKAT/rylmMSKAT_0_156_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF confirms strike on Houthi-controlled targets in Yemen	The IDF said it carried out a large-scale aerial operation on Sunday, striking what it described as 'Houthi-controlled military targets in Yemen,' about 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from Israel's border. 'The airstrikes focused on key military infrastructure in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah regions, including power stations and a port used for importing oil. These facilities were being used by the Iranian-backed Houthi regime to transfer weapons and military supplies, including oil, to their forces,' a statement read. According to the army, dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets, tankers and reconnaissance planes, participated in the operation, which was directed by the Military Intelligence Directorate. The IDF said the operation was in direct retaliation for recent Houthi missile attacks on Israel. Over the past year, the Houthi regime has intensified its activities against Israel, working closely with Iranian militias in Iraq to destabilize the region and disrupt global shipping routes. The IDF affirmed its resolve to strike any threats to Israeli citizens, regardless of the distance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkbotkwrc	2024-09-29T07:58:09-07:00

Houthi-controlled Hodeidah Port hit by explosions, reports say	Blasts comes after several missile launches by Iranian-backed rebels toward Israel over past week; port attacked by Israel in July in response to deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv Initial reports surfaced of explosions at the Hodeidah port in Yemen on Sunday evening. The incident follows a recent spike in missile activity from Yemen, where just Saturday night, a surface-to-surface missile was fired toward Israel, triggering air raid sirens across several regions. The missile was successfully intercepted outside Israeli territory. This latest missile was the second launched by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the past three days, adding to growing tensions. Earlier this month, the Houthis fired a missile at Israel, partially intercepted near Ben Gurion Airport, raising concerns over Israeli deterrence. Israel struck the Hodeidah port in July following a deadly drone strike in Tel Aviv—claimed by the Houthis.

IDF targets senior Hezbollah commander in fresh Dahieh strike	Strike reportedly targets commander of Unit 1600, which oversees production materials for rockets and missiles, as well as drug manufacturing operations organization traffics globally to fund its activities The IDF resumed airstrikes on Sunday, targeting the Dahieh district in Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. The main target of the attack was reportedly the commander of Hezbollah's Unit 1600, a division responsible for developing missile and rocket materials, as well as weapons production. Unit 1600 is also allegedly behind the production and trafficking of the addictive, amphetamine-type stimulant drug Captagon, which funds Hezbollah's global terrorist activities. The unit's highly restricted bases are located within civilian neighborhoods, with access granted only to those with personal authorization from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah or his cousin, Hashem Safieddine. Safieddine, seen as Nasrallah's successor, was also reportedly targeted in a separate Israeli strike on Saturday. In the early hours, another strike was reported in Dahieh, raising tensions as Hezbollah revealed on Sunday the identities of senior commanders who died alongside Nasrallah. Among them was Ali Karaki, third in command and the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, who had previously survived an Israeli assassination attempt, and Nabil Qaouk, a central council member in charge of internal security. Hezbollah confirmed that Nasrallah’s body was recovered from the underground command bunker bombed on Friday. While Hezbollah's initial statement did not detail the exact circumstances of his death, sources indicated that Nasrallah had no visible wounds, and the likely cause of death was blunt trauma from the force of the blast. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk11211cl0a	2024-09-29T07:17:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJctRhIA0/HJctRhIA0_0_251_961_540_0_small.jpg
Pilots reveal: The tactical feints that led to Nasrallah's assass...	After leading successful assassination mission targeting Hezbollah leader in Beirut, 69th Squadron commander calls operation 'historic,' emphasizing precision, team effort and emotional impact; 'We knew exactly who the target was' Following the airstrike that eliminated Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah and key operatives, Hatzerim Air Base commander Brig. Gen. Amichai Levin hailed the operation as a historic military success. In an interview, Levin explained, 'Dozens of bombs hit the target within seconds, and no anti-aircraft missiles were fired.' The precision strike took out Nasrallah's command bunker in Beirut’s Dahieh district, a move Israel hopes will reshape the strategic landscape in the Middle East. Levin, in command for just two weeks before the operation, said the mission was a critical step toward achieving Israel's war objectives. 'Nasrallah was the central figure in the Shiite axis,' he said, adding that his elimination would significantly impact Hezbollah and Iran's regional strategies. The operation, conducted by Israel’s elite 69th Squadron, was executed with high-level coordination between intelligence and military units. 'The intelligence provided was incredibly precise, which allowed for such a successful mission,' Levin said. He emphasized that the mission showcased a level of decisiveness and initiative that had been missing before October 7, when Israel was caught off guard by surprise attacks from Hamas. 'This is my most important lesson from that day because we must act aggressively and proactively against those who seek to harm us and there are more of them. The mission is not over and we will keep striking Hamas at its roots as we deal with the northern threat.' 69th Squadron commander Lt. Col. M. noted that his wife is from a kibbutz near the northern border and her family was evacuated at the beginning of the war. 'This is a significant firepower with many planes. We waited for a few days until an opportunity arose. People realized this was an unusual opportunity, and therefore they had to know how to succeed and be very precise. Young teams that had only completed training a year ago, along with 50-year-olds in the reserves, participated in the mission. 'We knew exactly who was the target' The squadron commander led the formation alongside a reservist pilot. Describing the mission, Lt. Col. M. said, 'The operation went smoothly, exactly as planned. We knew exactly who was the target.' Following the landing, the emotional commander reflected on the significance of the mission. 'I hugged the crew because you probably only do something this big and historic once in a lifetime. The second hug was for my technical officer, who worked tirelessly to arm the planes. His brother was killed on the Lebanese border. The third was to my family, at Friday night dinner. We didn't talk much, waiting for results, but they understood.' Lt. Col. M. revealed that the target's identity was kept secret until just hours before the operation. 'When the pilots learned who the target was, they understood the mission's value and risk.' Brig. Gen. Levin added, 'The key operational challenge was precise intelligence—ensuring the target didn't flee before the strike. We employed creative tactics to ensure success.' He noted that Hezbollah's anti-aircraft defenses were neutralized prior to the operation, and the pilots synchronized a large amount of ordnance, striking within seconds of each other. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1svs2l00	2024-09-29T06:53:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/HkQ1ccWmAA/HkQ1ccWmAA_194_220_890_501_0_small.jpg

Syrian national wearing keffiyeh goes on rampage in Germany, crit...	A Syrian man wearing in the city of Essen set fire to a building, then threatened passers by with a machete while locals scrambled to safety; He was eventually apprehended, and the media is curiously silent about the incident A 41-year-old Syrian man launched an attack in the city of Essen in western Germany on Saturday night, injuring 31 German citizens, including eight children. Two of these children, ages 2 and 4, are in critical condition. Video footage from the scene shows the Syrian man wearing a keffiyeh and armed with a long machete. He set fire to one residential building, got into his gray Opel van, drove a few hundred yards, and set another residential building on fire. In footage captured before the arrival of security and firefighting forces, citizens are seen placing ladders, which were too short, against the building's exterior wall in an effort to get people out of the burning buildings. Parents, screaming hysterically for help, were desperately trying to rescue their children by pulling them out of windows. Ten minutes later, the suspect returned to his van, drove a short distance, and crashed into the windows of two shops. At this point, he exited the vehicle wielding a large machete and attempted to threaten those around him, but bystanders managed to keep their distance by throwing objects at him and using iron rods and wooden sticks. The police captured the suspect, but have not yet disclosed the motive for the attack. One line of investigation suggests that the Syrian was enraged by his wife leaving him, prompting a destructive spree, although this does not explain the attack on the additional building, the shop crashes, and the use of a machete. Some media outlets reported it as a terrorist attack, with journalists noting that he wore a keffiyeh on his head. Two helicopters evacuated the injured from the Essen attack, including five who were seriously wounded, to a nearby hospital. In both cases, the suspect used a gas canister to set the buildings ablaze. He ignited fires in the wooden staircases, trapping the building's residents with no means of escape. Despite the horrific attempt at mass murder and the critical condition of two toddlers (lung damage in children from smoke inhalation is extremely lethal), the German media, preoccupied throughout the weekend with harsh condemnations of Nasrallah's elimination (including from Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock), attempted to downplay the incident, push it to the back of the news, and conceal the fact that the perpetrator was a Syrian national. This attack is part of a wave of terrorist assaults on German citizens by Muslim immigrants, which has resulted in the murder of four citizens, including an on-duty police officer. This surge in terror has prompted authorities to adopt a firmer stance against Islamist elements in the country and a more aggressive policy against immigration, including the redeployment of police forces at the country's borders. The violence by Muslim immigrants in Germany has also strengthened the far-right in the country, as seen in elections held this month in three federal states, and in polls for the federal elections to be held next year. In neighboring Austria, where federal elections are being held today, the right-wing is also expected to win, primarily due to dissatisfaction with immigration policies and citizens' personal security concerns. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b12cchia0	2024-09-29T05:41:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJx11x4o8AA/HJx11x4o8AA_1_501_800_451_0_small.jpg

His body is intact and cause of death appears to be blunt trauma from the force of the blast The body of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been recovered from the site of an Israeli air attack on Beirut's southern suburbs and is intact, a medical source and a security source told Reuters on Sunday. While Hezbollah's statement on Saturday confirming Nasrallah's death did not say how exactly he was killed nor when his funeral would be, the two sources said his body had no direct wounds and that it appeared the cause of death was blunt trauma from the force of the blast. The IDF confirmed Saturday that Nasrallah was killed in the attack on Hezbollah's central headquarters Dahieh district of Beirut, and more than three hours later Hezbollah also confirmed that their leader was killed in the attack, but the Shiite terrorist organization did not specify exactly how and when his funeral would take place. Along with Nasrallah, Ali Karaki, commander of the southern front in Hezbollah, and other commanders in the terrorist organization also were killed in the same attack. More than 80 bombs, with an average weight of one ton of explosive material per bomb, were dropped on the Hezbollah headquarters, which the bunker-busting munitions penetrated, though Israel has not confirmed the use of such bombs. Squadron 69 ('The Hammers') led the attack in Operation New Order with its F-15I ('Thunder') planes, which are considered the leading bombers of the IDF. According to the IDF, the attack was carried out while the top brass of Hezbollah was at its headquarters and engaged in coordinating terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wspnlra	2024-09-29T04:52:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/Sk5APcURC/Sk5APcURC_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
How do Palestinians truly feel about Nasrallah's demise?	Despite criticism and occasional mocking of Palestinian Authority, PA leaders not celebrating Hezbollah chief's assassination by IDF;’ We are confident that Hezbollah will continue his path and uphold the banner of resistance until Jerusalem is liberated’ Nearing the twilight of his tumultuous reign, Hassan Nasrallah fashioned himself as the 'guardian of Palestine,' offering Hezbollah's military might to the cause against Israel. Yet, the relationship between the leader of the Iran-backed Shiite terror group and the Sunni Palestinians was not always harmonious. While Nasrallah engaged in alliances with various terrorist factions, tensions were particularly pronounced with the Palestinian Authority. Animosity between Hezbollah's secretary general and the Palestinian leadership dates back to the era of Yasser Arafat, who died in 2004. In an interview from that period, Nasrallah, when asked about his disagreements with the Palestinian leadership, retorted: 'What Palestinian leadership? Yasser Arafat? We do not recognize this leadership, and it holds no legitimacy among the Palestinians.' In another speech, he provocatively questioned: 'Why isn't there a Palestinian officer or policeman who would assassinate Arafat and proclaim Arafat a disgrace to the Palestinians?' A senior official from the Palestinian Authority, speaking to Ynet following Nasrallah's elimination, stated, 'There were never any ties with Nasrallah or his organization. On the contrary, he preferred to insult us, glorify Hamas, encourage them to defeat Fatah and oust them from power. He sought to incite and deepen the rift between Hamas and Fatah.' Despite this history, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas issued a succinct condolence message to the Lebanese people on the death of Nasrallah and to the citizens of the country. The PLO, an umbrella organization, also released a statement expressing sorrow and calling for an urgent cessation of the conflict 'against Palestinians and Lebanese.' In Ramallah, a protest against Israel took place in the evening, with images of Nasrallah prominently displayed. For Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the relationships were markedly different. Nasrallah viewed them as a critical operational arm within the territories for the 'axis of evil.' Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy leader of Hamas, stated in a recorded message: 'We mourn with the Palestinian people and the entire nation the death of Hassan Nasrallah and his fellow fighters.' He added: 'The occupation bears responsibility and consequences for Nasrallah's elimination and the attack in Beirut. The assassination of Hassan Nasrallah will not break the resistance.' Ziyad al-Nakhalah, secretary-general of Islamic Jihad, was also known to be close to Hezbollah's secretary-general and the Iranian leadership, which provided him significant financial support. 'The Palestinian resistance understands that it has lost great support in its path, and it will remain loyal to his memory and great legacy,' al-Nakhalah stated. 'We are confident Hezbollah will continue his path and uphold the banner of resistance until Jerusalem is liberated.' In Gaza, a year into the war initiated by Hamas and joined by Hezbollah, opinions diverged following Nasrallah's elimination. Anas Sharif, a journalist from Jabaliya who is affiliated with Hamas, tweeted: 'We belong to God, and to Him we shall return. O God, compensate us for our disaster and give us something better.' In contrast, Gazan journalist Ihab Al-Fasfus wrote on Facebook: 'In a moment, he found himself before God, accountable for all his deeds in creation... and there will be no intercession or forgiveness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqgriuaa	2024-09-29T04:36:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/Sk11jaXaBAC/Sk11jaXaBAC_0_227_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Special report by Lebanese journalist: Everyone is asking, 'Who b...	As refugee centers fill up and rent is jacked up following assassination of Hezbollah's Nasrallah, Lebanese public is reacting with either hysteria, repression or suspicion; Despite major blow, fear of Hezbollah still exists on the street 'This man, Hassan Nasrallah, will not die,' claimed Lebanese Hezbollah supporters on Saturday. Many of them are still waiting to see him on television screens, explaining what will happen next. They think that the announcement of his death is a ruse and a tactic designed to confuse the enemy. It's hard to believe. Yesterday I went for a long walk through Beirut's streets. The city, which always was bustling with life, seemed dead. In the few places where young people still gathered, there was complete hysteria: 'This man was killed in his prime, they killed him and humiliated him,' claimed Nasrallah's supporters, who were almost the only ones who went out into the street. A few hours before, Lebanese citizens held a demonstration in Beirut, with dozens of young people standing in the street, holding Lebanese flags and remaining silent. Although they are still afraid of Hezbollah operatives, their goal is to convey a message to the world that 'Lebanon will remain Lebanon,' with or without the terrorist organization and its leaders who have been eliminated. It is interesting to discover that the people pointed fingers at Iran and not at Israel. 'They abandoned him,' they said in Beirut. 'Nasrallah was revered in Tehran, (Supreme leader Ali) Khamenei brought him closer, made him an ally, and abandoned him.' Khamenei, so the supporters claimed, has a habit of abandoning his allies. First, he abandoned Ismail Haniyeh, then all of Gaza, and now Nasrallah. Lebanese Hezbollah supporters consider Nasrallah's death an Iranian betrayal. The Shiites in Lebanon, who are not members of my sect, are calling to boycott the Iranian ruler, whose representative was eliminated in the strike in the Dahieh district. On the night of the attack, people in the streets of Beirut were already telling stories about Iran's distance from Nasrallah, about his scorn in the eyes of leader Khamenei. These are stories that no one can confirm nor deny. Lebanese Hezbollah supporters consider Nasrallah's death an Iranian betrayal We now know that Hezbollah's actions were completely visible to Israeli intelligence. All his steps were monitored for many months. All the phone calls had another ear listening. A question that disturbs the Lebanese public is: 'Who betrayed Hezbollah?' Conspiracy theories are circulating, with one of them claiming that the Iranians betrayed him to reach a new nuclear agreement with the Americans. According to this theory, the Iranians lied to Nasrallah that the fighting against Israel would not last long but gave him up to the Israelis. Some believe it was the Syrian intelligence officers who led Israel to Nasrallah. Either way, someone betrayed Hezbollah, and Israel was able to discover the exact location of the organization's leadership. Somehow, Israel managed to discover the location and the participants of the secret meeting. The echoes of the explosion were felt dozens of kilometers away from the site of the bombing. This explosion reminded me of the mega-explosion in the port of Beirut in 2020 when the whole city shook following the magnitude of the horrific destruction, with hundreds of dead and injured. Citizens of Israel, think of us, of the innocent citizens of Lebanon. We are not a party to the war. We are suffering. The Lebanese waited with bated breath for confirmation of the rumors of Nasrallah's assassination. At first, they were sure that this was Israeli propaganda and Hezbollah waited almost a day to make the announcement. In the meantime, refugees from Dahieh found themselves and their families without a roof over their heads, crying, destitute, lost and refusing to believe that this disaster had befallen them. This situation did not start with Nasrallah's death. On Monday the residents of South Lebanon woke up to the sounds of sirens from the Israeli army bombings, which called them to evacuate their homes immediately. The residents fled, carrying a few belongings, and escaped in cars, creating an endless traffic jam. Their journey from southern Lebanon to Beirut, which usually takes two hours, took 20 long hours. When they finally arrived in Beirut, they found that no reception centers were waiting for them. There was no emergency plan. The Education Ministry opened makeshift schools, and Beirut residents voluntarily took refugees into their homes. The churches also took in refugees, but the Lebanese government was nowhere in sight to help or mobilize. Dahieh refused to take refugees at the beginning of the week. Now, when the residents fled in fear, they discovered that the reception centers were already full. Many had to spend the nights in their cars. Others slept by the side of the road, on blankets that they managed to get out of their homes before fleeing. Other refugees spent their days and nights in the Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, forced to reside near the dead buried there. There are also refugees who chose to flee to areas hostile to Hezbollah, such as the city of Tripoli in northern Lebanon. They discovered signs meant to welcome them. However, the refugees were warned not to hang pictures of the hated Nasrallah and to remove his pictures from their cars. Citizens of Israel, think of us, of the innocent citizens of Lebanon. We are not a party to the war. We are suffering. Even if some of the food stores are open, no one can afford to buy enough food. Meat has not been on our table for many days. Power outages last at least nine hours a day, and rent has tripled. A house that cost $1,000 two weeks ago has now jumped to $3,000. Two families squeeze into a small two-room apartment. We were promised a short war, but for almost a year the citizens of Lebanon have not known their fates. Anyone who can afford it, tries to escape or runs away.

Early on Sunday afternoon, with the direction of IDF intelligence, the Israeli Air Force conducted a precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a Hamas command and control center embedded inside a compound that previously served as the Umm al-Fahm School in the northern Gaza Strip. The command and control center was used by the Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel, according to the IDF. Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence information, the IDF said in a statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1naw3ua0	2024-09-29T03:56:11-07:00	
Activists protest escalating Mideast crisis outside UK base in Cy...	Pro-Palestinian campaigners protested at the gates of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus on Sunday, accusing Britain of offering tacit support to Israel's ongoing operations in Gaza and elsewhere. Chanting 'Out with the bases of death' a couple of hundred people holding Palestinian and Cypriot flags peacefully protested outside the locked gates of the facility, Britain's largest in the Middle East. Britain last week sent additional troops to Cyprus to be in position to assist any potential evacuation of nationals trapped in Lebanon, which is reeling from a barrage of Israeli air strikes which culminated in the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday evening. The UK has two military bases on Cyprus, a former British colony. RAF Akrotiri has been used in the past as a staging point for airstrikes against Houthi forces in Yemen in retaliation for attacks on Red Sea shipping that the Iran-backed group says is a response to the war in Gaza .A British bases spokesperson said: 'No RAF flights have transported lethal cargo to the Israeli Defense Forces.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkjzynicr	2024-09-29T03:43:46-07:00

The Kremlin said on Sunday that amendments to Russia's nuclear doctrine had been prepared and were about to be formalized, meaning the relevant documents setting out the circumstances in which nuclear arms can be used by Moscow will be updated. President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday that under proposed changes to the doctrine Russia could use nuclear arms if it was struck with conventional missiles and would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. The changes were widely seen as an attempt by Putin to draw a 'red line' for the United States and its allies by signaling that Moscow will consider responding with nuclear weapons if they allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjzjdjicr	2024-09-29T03:12:37-07:00

Mixed emotions for families who lost loved ones at hand of Nasral...	Some 18 years have passed since the Second Lebanon War, and families whose loved ones were killed during that time are experiencing mixed emotions; Some are happy he's gone, but for many it just triggers a flood of painful memories The assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, one of Israel's premier enemies in recent decades, has elicited mixed reactions among bereaved families whose loved ones were killed during his tenure. For some, it represents personal and historical closure. Yet, emotions are far more complex: while it is indeed a significant achievement for Israel's security forces, it does not heal the deep wounds left by war on the souls of grieving parents, siblings and children. Liora Hasson, whose son, Staff Sergeant Guy Hasson, fell on August 13, 2006, during the final day of the Second Lebanon War, said she is 'not getting carried away' with celebrating until the entire so-called axis of evil is destroyed. 'If we put everything in perspective, I'm not celebrating or handing out sweets. I've already taken my hit. I am glad that the head of the 'axis of evil' has been eliminated, but I will only truly rejoice when the entire axis is destroyed. Until then, this is just a small point in my heart, warming another corner, but I'm not getting carried away. Revenge won't lead to anything. After today, we should remember what all the fallen in this current war have said and what our sons hoped for – that when this nation unites and works together, we will prevail eightfold. The only comfort would be if Guy returned; nothing else will help. As a Jewish Israeli, I am proud that we have wonderful sons in the sea, air and land forces who know how to do the job,.' she said. 'In a sense, quite the opposite – today I am sadder, and the pain is sharper. This entire period is déjà vu of what happened 18 years ago. If we were united and did not have this hatred among the people, we could have reached this operation much sooner. We have the capabilities and everything, but everything is overshadowed when there is hatred,' she added. 'There's a song written by Moshe Klughaft called 'We Deserve More.' I think what summarizes the IDF's tremendous success today in eliminating Nasrallah is seeing that we deserve more. We have an excellent army, a wonderful nation, and if we know how to direct it, unite it and not incite, then we will reach perfection, and as a people we deserve more. Today, there's nothing more fitting than this song to tell our leaders: we deserve more, more than what you are. We deserve leadership that understands and knows how to unite this nation. We deserve people who know how to take responsibility.' 'For many years I waited for Nasrallah to be held accountable' Tal Sheinbrum, whose brother Yaniv Sheinbrum fell in the Second Lebanon War alongside Guy Hasson, reflected on the sense of closure. 'This is something that has accompanied me personally and my family for 18 years since the Second Lebanon War, where I fought alongside Yaniv. We were both in Lebanon. On the last day, when the cease-fire terms had been agreed but had not yet taken effect, Yaniv was hit by an anti-tank missile. While they were treating him, another missile hit, and he died. I was deep in Lebanon at the time and was informed in the evening hours, and from that moment our lives changed. I won't say that I was preoccupied daily with Nasrallah's future, but for many years I waited for him to be held accountable for what happened to my brother and others during the 30 years he has led this organization. Hearing that it happened gave me a significant sense of closure and revenge for all the evil he brought to this world,' he said. Is there a message you’d like to convey to our leaders? 'The policy of containment has not proven itself. This attempt not to heat up the area and not to disturb the calm in the north and south has led us to a harsher reality than before. We need to respond wherever and whenever they try to harm us. Beyond that, I think the policy that relies solely on military action and strikes will not change the future for my children in the Middle East and in our country. We need to leverage military successes for a more strategic solution to change the reality so our children have a future here. As a citizen of the state, a father, and a bereaved brother – with all due respect to Nasrallah, Hezbollah and Hamas, in the end, the only thing that will determine the fate of the state and the chance for our children to live here is the internal relations among us within Israel. We need to stop the division, look at each other, and see our brothers.' Lt. German Rozhkov fell in battle near Hanita in the Western Galilee in March 2002, at the age of 22. That day, two terrorists infiltrated from Lebanon, positioned themselves on two hills near Kibbutz Hanita, and opened fire on cars passing by on a road near Kibbutz Matzuva. About 20 poeple were wounded and five were killed. Rozhkov, who happened to be in the area, bravely charged at the terrorists but did not survive the encounter. His mother, Ludmila, who lives in Kiryat Shmona and was evacuated to a hotel in Tiberias at the start of the war, called the assassination of Nasrallah an 'amazing event.' 'You have no idea how much I waited for this moment, as a bereaved mother. A single bullet from Hezbollah terrorists who infiltrated Israel caused me to lose my only son, German. He was a young officer who loved Kiryat Shmona so much and charged the terrorists courageously. Since I lost him, I haven't really had a life,' she told Ynet. She describes her feelings upon hearing about the assassination: 'I'm already waiting to visit German's grave in the military section of the cemetery in Kiryat Shmona. I will tell him that our army is strong and mighty, and there's nothing like our air force. The assassination of Nasrallah is an amazing event, something we should have seen long ago.' However, Ludmila emphasizes that the assassination does not end the struggle. 'Sure, they eliminated Nasrallah, the man who frightened us for many years, but this is not the time to be dazzled or relax. We must continue to act and deliver more blows. Who knows who will step into the shoes of this wicked man. It might be someone even more violent and determined in their ideology to destroy Israel.' During the Second Lebanon War, a great tragedy occurred in early August. Near the entrance to Kibbutz Kfar Giladi, soldiers from the Hiram battalion were preparing to enter Lebanon. As they were organizing at the entrance to the kibbutz cemetery, a rocket fired from Lebanon hit them directly. The blast killed Major Eli Alkarif and 11 other reserve soldiers. Alkarif's widow, Libi, talks abut the aftermath of the incident with pain. 'We have a group of widows who lost what was most precious to them. The husband who was killed left behind a wife and small children in the great tragedy of Kfar Giladi. Yesterday, there were rumors that perhaps Nasrallah had been killed, and today it became certain by morning. To tell the truth, there's no sense of relief; this is something that should have been done long ago, despite the complexity involved in such an assassination. Personally, I feel that justice has been done. I thought I would feel relief, but it didn't really happen. We went through a prolonged nightmare of threats and intimidation with Nasrallah, and it's good that he was eliminated. We must see who will come in his place and ensure that the residents of the north can safely return to their homes.' Tzion Saadia, whose son Liran was killed in the Second Lebanon War in 2006, responded to Nasrallah's assassination with a Biblical verse: ''I will pursue my enemies and overtake them; I will not turn back until they are destroyed.' The soil of Lebanon has claimed over a thousand soldiers' lives and wounded thousands, including our son Liran who fell in the Second Lebanon War, along with many fighters. The Israel Defense Forces is a strong army that we trust. For us, today feels like closure as the air force killed the arch-terrorist.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rj50zyic0	2024-09-29T02:45:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkShoYrRC/SkShoYrRC_0_166_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Son-in-law and adviser of former US President Donald Trump, praised assassination of Hassan Nasrallah as 'the most important day in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords breakthrough' which he brokered, and called on Israel to finish the job: 'It has no option to back down' Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who alsothe most important day in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords breakthrough.' 'I have spent countless hours studying Hezbollah and there is not an expert on earth who thought that what Israel has done to decapitate and degrade them was possible. This is significant because Iran is now fully exposed. The reason why their nuclear facilities have not been destroyed, despite weak air defense systems, is because Hezbollah has been a loaded gun pointed at Israel. Iran spent the last forty years building this capability as its deterrent,' Kushner posted on the X platform. 'President Trump would often say, 'Iran has never won a war but never lost a negotiation.' The Islamic Republic’s regime is much tougher when risking Hamas, Hezbollah, Syrian and Houthi lives than when risking their own. Their foolish efforts to assassinate President Trump and hack his campaign reek of desperation and are hardening a large coalition against them,' he also wrote in a long post. Kushner also said that 'Iranian leadership is stuck in the old Middle East, while their neighbors in the GCC are sprinting toward the future by investing in their populations and infrastructure. They are becoming dynamic magnets for talent and investment while Iran falls further behind. As the Iranian proxies and threats dissipate, regional security and prosperity will rise for Christians, Muslims and Jews alike.' Trump's advisor, who is Jewish, emphasized that Israel now finds itself with threat from Hamas in Gaza 'mostly neutralized' and with the 'opportunity to neutralize Hezbollah in the north', saying that 'It’s unfortunate how we got here but maybe there can be a silver lining in the end.' He emphasized that 'Anyone who has been calling for a ceasefire in the North is wrong. There is no going back for Israel. They cannot afford now to not finish the job and completely dismantle the arsenal that has been aimed at them. They will never get another chance.' Kushner described Iran as 'reeling' and said that Hezbollah's weapons cache is 'unguarded and unmanned.' 'Failing to take full advantage of this opportunity to neutralize the threat is irresponsible,' he wrote. 'This is a moment to stand behind the peace-seeking nation of Israel and the large portion of the Lebanese who have been plagued by Hezbollah and who want to return to the times when their country was thriving, and Beirut a cosmopolitan city. The main issue between Lebanon and Israel is Iran; otherwise there is a lot of benefit for the people of both countries from working together.' 'The right move now for America would be to tell Israel to finish the job. It’s long overdue,' he wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1poqflcc	2024-09-29T01:26:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/12/21/rygNGu6ZPp/rygNGu6ZPp_1717_459_1284_723_0_small.jpg

Iranian president at odds with hardliners on how to respond to Na...	Regime in Tehran was dumbfounded by Nasrallah's death and immediate steps were taken to secure Ayatollah Khamenei, fearing he might be next, NYT reports; President Pezeshkian thinks an attack on Israel might prove detrimental to Iran's security, while hardliners in Tehran advocate for a powerful response The assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah represents a significant strategic blow not only to the Lebanese terrorist group but also to the broader Iranian axis. This development raises pressing questions about how Iran will navigate its next steps. As detailed in the New York Times, which cites insights from four Iranian informants, the assassination of Nasrallah –a long-standing ally of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei – sent shockwaves of anxiety through Tehran's corridors of power. Iranian officials are reportedly pondering whether Iran itself might be Israel's subsequent target, with Khamenei – who, according to a recent Reuters report, has been relocated to a secure location – possibly in the crosshairs. 'This loss is devastating and, frankly, we have no means to recover from it,' Mohammed Ali Atbani, a former vice president of Iran, told the New York Times. 'We will not engage in war; that's not an option. Yet, Iran will steadfastly support armed groups in the region and continue efforts to ease tensions with the West. These objectives can be pursued concurrently,' he asserted. In the wake of Friday's attack on Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut, Khamenei convened an emergency session of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. Iranian sources briefing the Times reported that during this meeting, held at Khamenei's residence, there was significant discord over the nature of Iran's response. Conservative council members, including Saeed Jalili, who lost the recent presidential election to Pezeshkian, argued for a rapid move to 'restore deterrence' against Israel, fearing Netanyahu might otherwise push the conflict to Tehran’s doorstep, according to a source familiar with the meeting's details. In contrast, Pezeshkian, representing Iran's reformist camp that seeks to de-escalate tensions with the U.S. and lift sanctions, warned against a harsh and quick response, urging caution to avoid falling into what he claims is Netanyahu's trap –a bid to provoke a regional war. Additional moderate council members expressed during the meeting that Israel has 'crossed all red lines,' while voicing concerns that an Iranian attack on Israel might invite a direct counterstrike against critical infrastructure within the Islamic Republic. Given its current economic fragility, they argued, Iran cannot afford such a confrontation. In his first public statement following Nasrallah's assassination, Khamenei exercised caution, implying that he anticipates Hezbollah will spearhead the retaliation, with Iran playing a supportive role. 'All resistance forces in Iran stand alongside Hezbollah,' Khamenei declared. 'It will be Hezbollah, leading the resistance forces, that will shape the region's future.' Analysts consulting with the New York Times suggested that Khamenei's remarks indicate that Iran currently lacks an effective strategy to counter Israel's assaults on its proxies. 'Faced with the choice between full-scale war with Israel and 'lowering its profile' for self-preservation, it seems to opt for the latter,' they wrote. Despite Khamenei's cautious approach, the Times notes that Iranian state television—controlled by Jalili's hardline allies – called for the Ayatollah regime to launch a direct attack on Israel. 'There is no distinction between Tehran, Baghdad and Beirut,' an Iranian TV host claimed, arguing that Israel aims to harm them all. 'Netanyahu understands only one language: that of ballistic missiles and drones.' The report emphasizes that, before deciding on retribution against Israel, Iran's primary focus is to rehabilitate Hezbollah after the severe setbacks it has encountered in recent weeks. Two sources from the Revolutionary Guards, including one involved in recent regime discussions on Iran's response, stated that Iran's immediate priority is to enable Hezbollah to 'regain its footing,' appoint a successor to Nasrallah, establish a renewed command structure, and rebuild a secure communication network (following the beeper and walkie-talkie bombings attributed to Mossad). Subsequently, they indicated, Hezbollah could plan its response to Israel. Revolutionary Guards sources added that Iran plans to dispatch a senior Quds Force officer to Beirut, via Syria, to aid in Hezbollah's recovery efforts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjvubdlcc	2024-09-29T00:48:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/09/By6dSUhn0/By6dSUhn0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Austrian voters appear ready to elect far-right 'Freedom Party'	Should the latest polls prove accurate, it's likely that Herbert Kickl, chairman of the 'Freedom Party of Austria' will become the nation's newest chancellor after Sunday's elections; The party is highly resistant to immigration from the Middle East, and also has adopted some antisemitic views As Austria edges toward its general elections on Sunday, the political landscape is poised for a seismic shift. Polls forecast a significant triumph for the far-right Freiheitliche Partei Österreich, or 'Freedom Party of Austria,' an entity with historical ties to the Nazi movement. This could herald the ascent of its leader, Herbert Kickl, to the chancellorship, marking the first time since World War II that such a position is held by a member from this faction. The election outcomes are anticipated to mirror the prevailing European trend toward policies that resist immigration, oppose the European Union, and waver in their support for Ukraine, while adopting a conciliatory stance toward the Kremlin. The Freedom Party's manifesto is rooted in a stringent anti-immigration stance. It seeks to emulate Austria's neighbor, Hungary, which has successfully curtailed the influx of Muslim immigrants, fortified its defenses against radical Islam, and drawn inspiration from Austrian cities where party representatives have prioritized security. These cities have bolstered police forces, installed street surveillance and linked immigrant integration with access to municipal social benefits. In contrast to its neighbor Germany, Austria's far-right party has historically participated in coalition governments, notably under Jörg Haider in 2000. It was also part of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's coalition and remains a coalition partner in three major Austrian states. However, this election might witness an unprecedented milestone with a party member vying for the chancellery and the formation of a government. Currently, the Freedom Party leads the polls with 27%, holding a two-point lead over the People's Party. Despite its modest population of nine million, Austria holds significant clout within the European Union, primarily due to its strategic geographic positioning for trade: the Tyrol region serves as the north-south conduit, while the country's eastern frontier is the nexus between Western Europe and the Balkan states. Should the party ascend to power and pursue initiatives akin to Brexit, distancing or even severing Austria from the EU, it could deal a severe blow to trade relations. However, Austria's geographical importance transcends commerce, extending into security dynamics. The Freedom Party’s rise, perceived as staunchly pro-Russian, could forge a coalition of EU nations sympathetic to Moscow – Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia – thus facilitating the Kremlin's efforts to undermine Western European morale. Geography also plays a pivotal role in immigration and asylum policies: Austria has absorbed more immigrants relative to its population than any other EU country. This is a significant factor behind the Freedom Party's impressive polling performance. These dynamics have led Austrians, who for decades saw themselves as the Nazis' first victims, to rally behind a party founded in the 1950s by former Nazis. Twenty years ago, Jörg Haider elevated the party from obscurity to prominence, and now Kickl, his protégé, is steering the party toward national leadership post its 2019 expulsion due to major scandals. Kickl has advanced a platform that can be viewed as 'Haider-plus': under his leadership, the party openly advocates for a policy of re-migration for those deemed foreigners by authorities. Those anticipating that Kickl might temper his extreme views in a pragmatic turn, reminiscent of Giorgia Meloni in Italy, should recall his tenure as Interior Minister. He orchestrated raids on state security services over suspicions of infiltration by informants and rebranded reception centers as 'departure centers.' The sole hope for Kickl’s opponents lies in the People's Party, the conservative Christian-Democratic faction, opting to isolate the Freedom Party. However, given their historical alliances – having twice entered coalitions – and policy alignments that are closer to the Freedom Party than the current Green Party partners, the likelihood is favorable that Herbert Kickl will emerge as a leading candidate for Austria's chancellorship following Sunday's elections. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk7eldirc	2024-09-28T23:39:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/By0IXmX0C/By0IXmX0C_0_207_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

A news anchor on the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen network, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported Saturday afternoon in a voice choked with tears that the leader of the terrorist organization had been assassinated in Beirut. According to a report on the Qatari Al-Araby TV channel, Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon felt deep sadness and shock when they learned of Nasrallah's assassination. Mohammed Shabaro, an Al-Araby network journalist, reported that hundreds of Lebanese citizens spontaneously went out Saturday day for protest marches in the streets of Beirut after hearing the news. He reported that he also witnessed several of those in the street crying and suffering emotional breakdowns and claimed that these reactions were not limited to Hezbollah supporters, but also included other sectors of the Lebanese public. 'We are talking about a large-scale security and political event that will change many things in Lebanon,' the reporter said. The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat also described the feeling of confusion on the Lebanese street after the assassination of Nasrallah. According to the report, people who left their homes were waiting for an explanation about what was going to happen next. One of the residents was quoted as saying: 'A big loss... we will wait for a response.' A young man in his 20s asked: 'Who will lead the battle now? How will we face our fate without him?' While the supporters of the terrorist organization were still in shock, in the city of Tripoli in Lebanon they actually celebrated the death of Nasrallah. Videos of Lebanese and Syrians sharing sweets and shooting in the air as a sign of joy were circulated on the networks. Also from Idlib in Syria, which is under the control of the Syrian opposition, similar scenes of celebrations spread since Nasrallah has many enemies in Syria. Many Syrians remember the atrocities committed by his men when they were sent to assist Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. In recent weeks, many Syrians, mainly Sunnis, celebrated the vulnerability of Hezbollah, from the attacks of explosive pagers and walkie-talkies to the assassination of the organization's leader. They handed out sweets in the streets and posted videos explaining why they hate the terrorist organization so much. The Syrian regime, however, holds a different position. The Syrian Foreign Ministry issued an official condemnation of the assassination on Saturday. 'Lebanon today lost the Secretary General of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, in a cruel and cowardly Israeli attack, which targeted a residential area in the Dahieh area of ​​Beirut, with devastating bombs that caused his death along with a large number of innocent civilians,' it said in a statement. The statement added that Syria 'lays the full responsibility on Israel of the serious consequences of the criminal act.' In the hours after the assassination was officially confirmed, first by the IDF spokesman and later by the terrorist organization Hezbollah, condemnations began to appear from the countries of the Shiite axis. Iraq was among the first countries to announce three official days of mourning. Iraq's Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani said in a statement that the assassination of Nasrallah is 'a crime that confirms that Israel has crossed all the red lines.' In Iran, after the official authorities in the country categorically denied that Nasrallah was killed, with the the official confirmations the condemnations and chants against Israel began to emerge. The spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Nasser Kanaani, said that 'Nasrallah's path will continue and achieve the goal - the liberation of Jerusalem.' Iran's official Tasnim agency posted videos of demonstrations by Iranians against the assassination of Nasrallah. The agency added next to one of the videos that the protesters expressed their willingness to support and help Hezbollah and the residents of the Gaza Strip. The videos also show signs promising violence against Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced Saturday night that Iran is determined to protect its security and confront Israel over its actions. The Houthis in Yemen also announced three days of mourning on Saturday. Pictures of Nasrallah and memorial videos were distributed on the group's social media channels. Abd al-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis in Yemen, spoke Saturday night, and condemned the attack saying: 'No matter how great the casualties, it increases our motivation toward escalation. His (Nasrallah's) martyrdom is a loss for the entire Islamic nation. We confirm that the fronts of support, the axis of jihad and the flag of Islam will remain and rise higher.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdlpd8rc	2024-09-28T23:26:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/H1yo6y800/H1yo6y800_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Small scale' movements into Lebanon may have started, US officia...	Netanyahu promised to continue attacking into Lebanon and Gallant met with IDF chief of staff to discuss 'expansion of military action' in north; ABC News reports Sunday morning that small-scale cross-border operations may have begun, or will soon begin, in order to destroy Hezbollah positions; 'Not enough to behead organization to return residents of north to their homes Small-scale operations or cross-border movements have begun, or will soon begin, into Lebanon in order to disable Hezbollah positions located right on the border with Israel, ABC News reported on Sunday morning, citing two American sources. The report comes hours after other reports in U.S. media, including by CNN, which reported that Israel is preparing for a ground maneuver in Lebanon. The sources who spoke with ABC emphasized that Israel does not appear to have finally decided whether to launch a ground operation against Hezbollah, but, according to them, it is ready for it. The officials also emphasized, as recently clarified by IDF officials, that if a ground operation happens its scope will be limited. The key is fulfilling the promise to Israelis that the tens of thousands displaced from northern Israel will be able to go home. To do that, decapitating Hezbollah is not enough, the officials said, referring to the assassination of the leader of the Shiite terrorist organization Hassan Nasrallah on Friday night. The reports come as Israeli officials signal that the elimination of Hezbollah will indeed not be enough to complete the goal of returning the residents of the north to their homes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarified in a televised statement on Saturday night that Israel will 'continue to strike at its enemies,' and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced that he was holding an operational situation assessment, 'with an emphasis on the readiness of the IDF forces to expand offensive activity in the northern sector,' with IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, who himself said after the elimination of Nasrallah that the IDF had not completed using its 'toolbox.' The US officials who spoke with ABC also referred to reports of tensions between Israel and the Biden administration following the assassination of Nasrallah, which Washington publicly insists it was not informed about in advance, although according to officials it did receive an advance update of 'few minutes notice at best.' In response to reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin 'blew up' when Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed him about Nasrallah, the officials said, 'We do bear a lot of risks' in the region, and their people were not given a lot of notice to prepare for possible hostile responses to the assassination, which did not please U.S. officials. In addition, according to one source, U.S. 'interests in the region could be badly harmed' if U.S. officials lose their contacts with the Israelis. According to the sources, the U.S. approach has not changed; it believes that only a diplomatic settlement is a long-term solution to the crisis. They also noted that a military campaign might lay the groundwork for such a solution. President Joe Biden himself was asked Saturday night by reporters whether Israel's ground entry into Lebanon is inevitable, and he answered evasively: ''It's time for a cease-fire.' When asked whether Washington would respond to missile attacks on American warships in the Red Sea, he said: 'We are responding.' Meanwhile, the extensive bombings against Hezbollah targets continue, as part of the Northern Arrows operation. Israeli Air Force fighter jets, under the direction of the Northern Command, attacked terrorist targets in the territory of Lebanon overnight, the IDF spokesman announced on Sunday morning. The targets attacked included rocket launchers aimed at Israel, buildings where weapons were stored and military structures belonging to the terrorist organization. The IDF spokesman also noted that over the past day, the army attacked hundreds of Hezbollah terrorist targets throughout Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h100lru8a0	2024-09-28T21:56:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJd11iZ40R/SJd11iZ40R_11_0_1270_715_0_small.jpg

Rocket from Lebanon explodes on outskirts of Jerusalem	The rocket knocked out power to the area and sparked several fires; Meanwhile, in the western Galilee there were explosions in Nahariya as two armed drones were intercepted: Watch the footage A rocket launched from Lebanon into the Binyamin area east of Jerusalem exploded Saturday night in an open area near the settlement of Mitzpe Hagit sparking fires in the area. In footage of the impact, the rocket knocks out electricity in the settlements. Watch the video: At 10:05 p.m., alarms were activated in a series of settlements in Binyamin, including: Nofei Prat, Mishor Adumim industrial area, Kfar Adumim, Almon, Alon, Geva Binyamin, Ma'ale Michmash, Shaar Binyamin industrial area, Mitzpe Yericho and Ma'ale Adumim. The IDF spokesman reported that the rocket alert sirens were activated following a single launch from Lebanon. Following the impact, fires broke out in the Michmash area of ​​Binyamin, and firefighting teams from the Binyamin regional station were dispatched to the area. Fire and rescue spokespersons reported that the fire threatens the settlement, and that after scanning the area it is clear that the rocket did not land on a building, contrary to reports circulating through various channels. Teams from Magen David Adom arrived at the scene after receiving several calls for help. In addition, the Binyamin Regional Council reported that due to the fire there are power outages in several localities. A short time later, the electric company updated that it had restored the electricity supply to the localities of Ma'aleh Michmash and Mitzpe Hagit. About an hour later, alarms were set off warning of the intrusion of hostile aircraft in several communities in the Western Galilee, including Nahariya, Gesher HaZiv, Betzet, Rosh Hanikara, Liman, Matzuva, Hof Betzet, North Military Industrial Zone, Ben Ami, Shlomi, Sa'ar, Evron and Shavei Zion. Several explosions were heard in the area after two drones were intercepted, according to the IDF spokesman. The Home Front Command later declared the incident to be over. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjzgeeura	2024-09-28T14:44:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/ByTxukLAR/ByTxukLAR_115_65_647_365_0_small.jpg
Israel preparing limited ground incursion into Lebanon, senior US...	Israel has rejected a cease-fire proposal - even a limited one - in Lebanon, even though it has already eliminated many of Hezbollah's top officials, official tells ABC News Israel is preparing for a limited ground incursion in Lebanon, a senior US official claimed in a report published on ABC News. The source claimed that Israel is preparing for the ground operation even though it has already killed more than 30 senior Hezbollah officials, most significantly the organization's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. According to the unnamed source, Israel has rejected a proposal for a cease-fire, even a limited one, and is continuing its attacks against targets which are believed to contain long-range missiles and weapons. At the same time Israel is not listening to the Biden administration despite its repeated calls for a diplomatic solution, according to the report. The U.S. and Western countries still hope, despite the assassination of Nasrallah, to find a way toward a cease-fire in the north. At this stage it is not clear what will happen to the U.S. initiative and whether it even still exists. The chances of a cease-fire at this stage are not high, but if there is someone able to make decisions in Lebanon who will agree to the terms of withdrawal to the north of the Litani River and a disengagement from Gaza then it is possible. As for who this responsible party is, the answer is not clear. The preferred option from Israel's point of view is for the Lebanese government to fill the vacuum, but the problem is that within the government there are quite a few ministers who are under Hezbollah's authority. It must be assumed that whoever succeeds Nasrallah will not make such a move without the blessing of the patrons from Tehran, so everything ultimately goes back to Iran. Regarding the joint cease-fire initiative of the U.S. and France, sources in Israel familiar with the matter say that from the beginning of the discussions the contacts were with the Lebanese government and not with Hezbollah and the initiative did not have much chance of materializing even before the elimination of Nasrallah. It is difficult to know what the chances of such a cease-fire initiative are now. It is unclear who the Lebanese government can talk to on the ground itself. It may take some time before Hezbollah appoints a successor to Nasrallah, so it is not clear how feasible this move is. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wzokicc	2024-09-28T14:06:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/BkzTBir00/BkzTBir00_0_83_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Nasrallah elimination will return residents to north and bring ho...	Settled accounts with those responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans,' Netanyahu says in address to the nation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday night that the elimination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was necessary to achieve Israel's war goals. In a statement from the Kirya defense headquarters in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, a few hours after returning from the United States and a little more than a day after the assassination of Nasrallah, Netanyahu said that: 'We settled accounts with those responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans and dozens of Frenchmen. 'Nasrallah was not a terrorist. He was the terrorist. He was the axis of the axis, the central engine of Iran's axis of evil. He and his men were the architects of the plan to destroy Israel. He was not only activated by Iran, many times he also activated the Iran.' Netanyahu said that 'at the beginning of the week I came to the conclusion that the powerful blows that the IDF landed on Hezbollah in the last few days would not be enough. Nasrallah's killing was a necessary step toward achieving the goals we have set, returning residents of the north safely to their homes and changing the balance of power in the region for years to come. Because as long as Nasrallah was alive, he would quickly restore the capabilities we took away from Hezbollah.' Netanyahu said that Nasrallah's elimination both promotes the return of the residents of northern Israel to their homes, 'but also advance the return of our hostages in the south.' 'The more (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar sees that Hezbollah is no longer coming to save him, the greater the chances for the return of our hostages,' he said. There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach Netanyahu thanked the IDF, the Israeli Air Force, Military Intelligence, the Mossad and the Shin Bet for their 'great achievements, and not only yesterday.' 'We have great achievements, but the work is not yet complete. In the coming days we will face significant challenges, and we will face them together. Nasrallah spoke of us as 'spider webs'. But instead of 'spider webs,' he discovered steel tendons of a united people And we are determined to ensure its existence and its future, and not only Hezbollah has discovered this,' Netanyahu continued. 'All those who oppose the axis of evil, all those who groan under the violent tyranny of Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, in Syria, in Iran itself and in other places, all of them were filled with hope today,' Netanyahu stressed. 'I say to the citizens of those countries: Israel stands with you.' He addressed the leaders of Iran: 'I say to the Ayatollah regime - whoever strikes us, we will strike. There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach, and today you already know how true this is. These are great days. We are at what appears to be a turning point in history. A year ago, on October 7, our enemies attacked us and thought that Israel was on the way to extinction. One year later, blow after blow, they realize how much their hopes have faded. We are determined to continue to strike our enemies, to return our residents to their homes and all our hostages. We don't forget them for a moment.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rksuz0bra	2024-09-28T12:39:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/02/B1e9ybs72A/B1e9ybs72A_145_98_1058_596_0_small.jpg

Sinwar runs scared after Nasrallah assassination, changes locatio...	Hamas has also changed leader Yahya Sinwar's security protocols in recent days, and has decided not to meet in Lebanon in the near future Yahya Sinwar and senior Hamas officials are running scared after the wave of assassinations in Lebanon. Al Arabiya reports Saturday that, after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Sinwar changed his location in Gaza. It was also reported that in recent days Hamas has changed security protocols for the organization's leader in the Gaza Strip. Sources told the channel, which is owned by Saudi Arabia and broadcasts from Dubai, that Hamas leaders want any future cease-fire to ensure that they will not be harmed. As an additional precaution, Hamas decided to stop the organization's meetings in Lebanon in the near future. In addition, Hamas is limiting communication within the organization to correspondence only to prevent the possibility of intercepting conversations or locating locations. Senior Islamic Jihad officials also decided to suspend meetings in Lebanon in the wake of the strike on Nasrallah and other Hezbollah leaders, according to the report. Earlier on Saturday, Hamas issued a statement following the assassination of Nasrallah. 'We mourn for His Honor Hassan Nasrallah and remember his life and the journey full of sacrifices for the liberation of Jerusalem and the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, and his honorable roles in supporting the Palestinian people, our brave resistance and our legitimate rights , and his insistence on continuing on the heroic front of supporting our people and our resistance in the Al-Aqsa flood. 'We are sure that this crime and all the crimes and assassinations of the occupation will not affect the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine except with determination, and continue with all the strength, courage and pride, in the way of martyrs, follow their path and in their footsteps, and continue the path of resistance and steadfastness until victory and defeating the occupation.' Nasrallah's maternal cousin, Hashem Safi al-Din, is believed to have survived the attack or was not in the bunker with Nasrallah when it happened. He was designated as Nasrallah's successor and reportedly has taken over, although perhaps secretly for the time being, until the official meetings of the Shura Council are held to appoint a successor. The appointment of Safi al-Din is a step with a double declarative meaning – both to show continuity and continuity in command and leadership, and also to entrust it to someone who is known for his extreme positions toward Israel and the struggle against it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by4fo6bcr	2024-09-28T11:42:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/BJDQD1qp0/BJDQD1qp0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Lebanon locked down to prevent Hezbollah , IDF says	Military says it aims to prevent arms being brought in to replenish Hezbollah's depleted arsenal after Israel attacked missile storage facilities The IDF has placed Lebanon under lockdown to prevent Hezbollah from rearming itself with Iranian weapons after its arsenal was depleted in Israeli strikes. Since the targeted killing of Hassan Nasrallah in the terror group's underground command bunker in the Dahieh quarter of Beirut on Friday, the Air Force has repeatedly attacked Lebanese heavy machinery sent to rebuild six military border crossings to Syria, damaged in previous strikes. The military also informed Lebanon officially, that it would not allow cargo planes arriving from Syria and Iran, to land at Beirut's international airport. Earlier on Saturday, an Iranian cargo plane was refused landing permission and had to return to Iran. The IDF breached communications at the control tower and warned against allowing the plane to land under threat of attack. According to reports, Israeli jets attacked an industrial area 500 meters from the airport. Reuters quoted a security source who said it was the closest strike yet to the airport. Middle East Airlines CEO Mohammad al-Hout said the airport was operating normally. 'The Beirut airport is not being targeted, there are no weapons there,' al-Hout told Reuters. Civilian travel and border crossings would not be impacted, the IDF said. Thousands of Lebanese civilians crossed into Syria in recent days, many of them hoping to escape the Israeli attacks. But if an Iranian ship attempts to doc in a Lebanese port, it may encounter Israeli action off the Lebanon coast. Some 600,000 Lebanese residents of the South have left their homes heading north and 400,000 residents of the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the southern sector of Beirut have also escaped the bombings. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bke0011tbca	2024-09-28T11:19:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/HyA7uhBAR/HyA7uhBAR_1_0_1094_615_0_small.jpg

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris commented on the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, and delivered a message similar to that of President Joe Biden. ''Hassan Nasrallah was a terrorist with American blood on his hands. Across decades, his leadership of Hezbollah destabilized the Middle East and led to the killing of countless innocent people in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and around the world. Today, Hezbollah’s victims have a measure of justice,' said the Democratic presidential candidate. 'I have an unwavering commitment to the security of Israel. I will always support Israel’s right to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis,' Harris said. She emphasized that 'President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war. We have been working on a diplomatic solution along the Israel-Lebanon border so that people can safely return home on both sides of that border. Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk5mets00	2024-09-28T11:06:25-07:00

'Yassin stood at the head of a department responsible for the identification of civilian and military targets, on the northern border and deep within Israeli territory,' the military said in a statement. 'As part of his role, Yassin collaborated with all of Hezbollah's offensive units, was personally involved in the planning of terror attacks that were executed during the war against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and planned additional attacks to be carried out in the coming days.' The Air Force also carried out strikes in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley after targeting Hezbollah assets in South Lebanon, Beirut and the Lebanon Mountains to the north. In total, some 3,500 bombs were dropped on Lebanon in the past week. The IDF said it had more surprises for Hezbollah in store and aims to diminish the terror group's military capabilities. 'We are now focused on strangling Hezbollah and are fully prepared to face Iran and its proxies including in Syria,' the IDF said. Earlier, the Homefront Command announced restrictions on crowd sizes in central Israel, limiting them to no more than 1,000 people in any given location.

Biden: Killing of Nasrallah 'a measure of justice' for his many v...	The United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against Iran-supported groups, president says, but aims to deescalate conflicts in Lebanon, Gaza through diplomatic means US President Joe Biden on Saturday referred for the first time to the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, since it was confirmed earlier in the day by the IDF and by the terrorist organization itself. In a statement, Biden said that the killing of Nasrallah 'and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese civilians.' Biden noted that 'the strike that killed Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre on October 7, 2023. Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel.' The U.S. president emphasized that 'The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups. Just yesterday, I directed my Secretary of Defense to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war.' He called for a diplomatic solution to Israel's conflicts on both the northern and southern borders. 'Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. In Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the UN Security Council for a cease-fire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' he concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkdobnbar	2024-09-28T10:21:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/06/B1gwA7LyHC/B1gwA7LyHC_0_148_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF shoots down Yemen missile after sirens sound across central I...	Army confirms 'sirens activated due to surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen, which was intercepted outside country’s borders' The IDF reported that a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the Arrow defense system outside Israeli territory on Saturday, triggering air raid sirens across central Israel. The army confirmed that 'the sirens were activated due to a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen, which was intercepted outside the country’s borders.' The Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance services said there were no immediate reports of casualties, aside from individuals who suffered shock or were injured while rushing to shelters. Hazem Al-Asad, a member of the Supreme Political Council of Yemen's Ansar Allah (the Houthis), posted a photo of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah on X shortly after the missile launch with a Hebrew caption, reading 'They will not pass, and revenge will come.' Nasrallah was assassinated by Israel in a targeted attack on Hezbollah's central command bunker in Beirut's Daheih district. This incident follows another missile launch from Yemen on Thursday night, which also set off sirens in central Israel. Earlier this month, a Houthi missile targeting central Israel was 'partially intercepted,' with fragments of its warhead exploding near Ben Gurion Airport. Israel did not respond to that attack, leading to concerns about eroding deterrence. This contrasted with Israel’s previous response when the Air Force struck the port of Hodeidah in Yemen after a deadly drone attack on Tel Aviv in July that killed one person and injured ten others. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who returned from the UN General Assembly in New York, is expected to hold security consultations and assessments later Saturday, his office announced. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy36p9rrr	2024-09-28T08:40:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkiJh9r0R/SkiJh9r0R_33_601_532_300_0_small.jpg

The IDF is continuing to operate to degrade and dismantle Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure and capabilities. According to reports, the Air Force conducted an airstrike against Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah and additional senior operatives in the Dahieh district in Beirut on Friday. Nasrallah served as the terror organization's leader for the past 32 years. 'He was responsible for directing and executing terrorist attacks around the world in which civilians of various nationalities were murdered. Nasrallah was the central decision-maker and the strategic leader of the organization,' the military said.

IDF strikes Hezbollah missiles threatening navy, Haifa port	Overnight attacks on the Dahieh quarter of Beirut target underground facilities housing Iran-made missiles belonging to covert unit and able to disrupt maritime traffic along Israel's coast The IDF on Saturday struck targets in Beirut's Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold, targeting a missile storage facility, housing guided missiles belonging to the terror group's covert shore-to-sea unit, a specialized, highly trained force made up of dozens of operatives involved in smuggling and operating the missile array. The missiles that were destroyed in the strike were meant to endanger Israel's military and civilian maritime routs and was responsible for attacking an Israeli naval vessel during the Second Lebanon War in 2006. The unit had at its disposal Iranian-made C-704 and C-82 missiles with a range of 120 and 180 kilometers. (74.5 and 112 miles) e Khadr missiles with a range of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles.) The missiles were stored in a densely populated area near schools and mosques making an attack on them difficult. The Hezbollah unit worked in collaboration with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) but its members mostly operated independently. In the strikes overnight, the IDF targeted six Hezbollah missile assets where production and storage of the missiles were built in underground facilities below high-rise apartment blocks. Images released by the IDF showed mass explosions caused by the munitions in the location. the IDF said the operation was carried out to ensure the safety of vessels along Israel's coastline and to protect the Haifa Port from attack.

Nasrallah's likely successor has close ties to Iran	Hashim Safi Al Din is slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's cousin who oversees the group's education system and finances including its investment arm financing terrorism; He is on U.S. terror list since 2017 Hashim Safi Al Din, head of Hezbollah's Executive Council could replace the group's slain long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. He was reported to have survived the Israeli attack on the terror group's underground bunker on Friday. Al Din is Nasrallah's cousin and has been designated, next in line since the 1990s when he was called back to Beirut from his studies in Iran, to head Hezbollah's Executive Council just two years after Nasrallah took over leadership of the Group. According to a report in the Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper he is also related by marriage to Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds force, killed by the U.S. in 2020. Over the past three decades, he oversaw all daily and sensitive aspects of Hezbollah's civilian operations including its education system and finances including foreign investments, leaving strategic matters to Nasrallah. He heads an investment group operating in Lebanon, across the Arab world, in Africa, Europe and North and Latin America. Al Din has close ties to the military wing of Hezbollah as well and has been on the U.S. terror list since 2017. He maintains good relations with Tehran and supports its regime after his religious studies there. His brother Abdullah is Hezbollah's envoy to Tehran, which the Saudi newspaper says could increase his chances of being named the next leader of the group. He was born in 1964 in a village near the coastal city of Tyre in South Lebanon, to a well-established family of clerics. Since the outbreak of the war, Al Din represented Nasrallah in public events including at the funeral of high-ranking members of terror-group, who were killed in the coordinated detonation of communication devices, attributed to Israel. 'The wounded will return to their Jihad,' he said. 'We tell the enemy that if its aim is to stop support of Gaza, it must know that that will only grow.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1y0kirrr	2024-09-28T02:56:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2017/05/20/7792688/7792688_0_1_750_422_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah fires at West Bank, rockets hitting Palestinian village...	Rocket sirens sound in northern West Bank for second time since war, just five days after previous attack; large interception fragments cause damage in Palestinian town of Huwara, south of Nablus Rocket sirens blared across several settlements in the northern West Bank on Saturday, including Ofra, Kokhav Ya'akov, Tel Tzion, Ma'ale Mikhmas, Talmon, Psagot and Beit El, following the official announcement of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's assassination by the IDF. This marks the second time since October 7 that Hezbollah has targeted the northern West Bank, with rocket fire causing damage in Palestinian villages as well. In the village of Huwara, south of Nablus, large fragments from an interception landed on a house, though no injuries were reported. 'We are at risk every moment,' said local residents. 'Hezbollah is firing indiscriminately. We are already facing economic and social distress, and now we have an aerial threat as well.' A Huwara resident added, 'There are no sirens or shelters here. The piece that fell today could have killed someone.' Sirens first sounded at 7:35 a.m. in Ofarim, Halamish, Beit Aryeh, Beit El, Peduel, Neria, Nachliel, Atarot, Kerem Re'im, Harsha, Ofra, Talmon and Ali Zahav. Thirty minutes later, additional sirens were activated in Hinanit, Shaqed, Tal Menashe and Reihan. On Monday, 10 rockets were fired at the northern West Bank from Lebanon. While some were intercepted, others caused fires. The distance from Lebanon is roughly 60 miles, similar to the distance from Lebanon to the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, which was targeted earlier in the day with a surface-to-surface missile that reportedly fell into the sea. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1zgeshaa	2024-09-28T01:44:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/Sy11s2jMHRR/Sy11s2jMHRR_46_446_627_353_0_small.jpg

Nasrallah dead, IDF says	Military says it can confirm that the Hezbollah leader was eliminated in the attack on the terror group's central command bunker in Beirut The IDF said on Saturday that it can confirm the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in the strike on Beirut on Friday. 'Following precise intelligence from the IDF and Israeli security establishment, IAF fighter jets conducted a targeted strike on the Central Headquarters of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, which was located underground embedded under a residential building in the area of Dahieh in Beirut,' the military said in a statement. 'The strike was conducted while Hezbollah’s senior chain of command was operating from the headquarters and advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel.' The announcement went on to say Nasrallah was responsible for the murder of many Israeli civilians and soldiers, and the planning and execution of thousands of terrorist activities. 'He was responsible for directing and executing terrorist attacks around the world in which civilians of various nationalities were murdered. Nasrallah was the central decision-maker and the strategic leader of the organization,' the military said. 'The IDF will continue operating against anyone who promotes and engages in terrorism against the State of Israel and its people.' Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said more options remained in Israel's toolbox in the fight against Hezbollah. The message is clear, whoever threatens Israeli citizens, we will reach, in the north, south and and beyond,' he said in a statement soon after the military confirmed Nasrallah's death. 'This strike was prepared overtime and executed well and in a timely fashion. We are now moving on to the next stage. We are in peak readiness on all fronts,' he said. The Air Force had prepared synchronized operations, working around the clock to eliminate senior members of Hezbollah, whenever the opportunity presented itself. Bunker-busting bombs were selected to target Nasrallah's bunker. The images from the scene showed pillars of fire as the result of the attack while surrounding buildings were mostly unharmed, to minimize collateral damage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxkfesar	2024-09-28T01:12:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/13/ByS5D6O9A/ByS5D6O9A_0_133_2762_1554_0_small.jpg

PM leaves NY early to return home; IDF continues strikes on Hezbollah's stronghold in Lebanon's capital while rescue efforts continue in terror group's command center The IDF continued its strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon including in the capital Beirut, from the air and sea, after targeting the terror group's leader Hassan Nasrallah in a massive strike on the group's underground headquarters on Friday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut his U.S. visit short and departed for Israel a day early in the wake of the attack. Nasrallah's fate remains unknown as rescue efforts continued to reach those trapped under the rubble after some six apartment blocks above the bunker were leveled in the attack. Rocket fire targeted the West Bank early on Saturday after strikes on the Galilee region overnight. Pro-Iranian Iraqi militias claimed responsibility for four attacks on Israel, claiming to target strategic sites in the north including the Golan Heights and the south using attack drones. Israel said it did not know about such attacks. A senior Israeli official told the New York Times that the strike on the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the southern sector of Beirut, was to eliminate the group's senior leaders and commanders, to avoid a ground incursion into Lebanon. The officials also said it may take weeks before the results of the strike are known including the fate of Hassan Nasrallah who was thought to have been in the bunker when the IDF attacked. A U.S. official said on Friday that if he was there, he could not have survived. The military said Hezbollah's missile unit commander in South Lebanon, Muhammad Ali Ismail and his deputy terrorist Hussein Ahmad Ismail were killed in a targeted strike. on Friday that it was attacking Hezbollah's strategic assets including their weapons storage facilities. IDF spokesperson in Arabic, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee urged civilians to immediately leave areas where Hezbollah command centers and weapons were located including the Munir Shadid building and adjacent structures in the Laylaki neighborhood, the Shiyit building and nearby structures in the Al Hadath neighborhood and the Al Salam complex in the area. In a televised statement, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that the IDF exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapons cashes in South Lebanon in recent days and their strikes aim to reveal how Hezbollah stores strategic weapons and arms in Beirut’s Dahieh, using buildings as shields. 'We will not allow any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in any way,' Hagari said. 'We know about these transfers and are thwarting them. IAF aircraft are patrolling the Beirut area, and we are making it clear that hostile flights with weapons will not be allowed to land at Beirut airport.

IDF strikes Hezbollah strategic assets in Beirut, issues evacuati...	Army plans to escalate strikes as large secondary explosions reported in Lebanese capital; Israel warns Iran it will block any weapon transfers, including hostile flights to Beirut The IDF struck Hezbollah weapon depots stored beneath civilian buildings in Beirut’s Laylaki neighborhood, the IDF said in a statement early Saturday. The attack followed a televised announcement by IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, who said that Israel would soon target strategic capabilities, including an Iran-funded anti-ship missile array hidden in the heart of Beirut’s Dahieh district. Hagari noted that during the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired such missiles, one of which hit the Israeli naval vessel INS Hanit, killing four sailors. 'Nasrallah himself has threatened strategic and critical facilities in Israel at sea and near the shore,' Hagari said, adding that these missiles pose a serious threat to global shipping routes and Israel’s strategic infrastructure. He warned that the explosion from the strikes could cause the targeted buildings to collapse. After the IDF struck the suspected sites, large secondary explosions were reported across Beirut, indicating the destruction of weaponry. Earlier, a source close to Hezbollah told Reuters that contact with the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, had been lost. The IDF believes Nasrallah was at least injured and likely killed in the strike on Hezbollah’s central command in Dahieh. The operation, launched at 6:20 p.m., was described by the IDF as 'highly significant, with potential implications for the Middle East.' However, the military is still assessing the results and has not confirmed if other senior Hezbollah commanders were present. The IDF plans to continue targeting Hezbollah’s capabilities following the strike in Laylaki neighborhood, aimed at crippling the group's resources. 'Challenging days lie ahead,' Hagari said, adding that the military will intensify its attacks in a coordinated effort. In addition to Iranian-supplied coastal defense missiles, the IDF plans to strike other strategic assets in Beirut that Hezbollah could use for retaliation. In recent days, the IDF has exposed Hezbollah’s hidden weapon caches in southern Lebanon, and the current strikes aim to reveal how Hezbollah stores strategic weapons and arms in Beirut’s Dahieh, using buildings as shields. 'We will not allow any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in any way,' Hagari emphasized. 'We know about these transfers and are thwarting them. IAF aircraft are patrolling the Beirut area, and we are making it clear that hostile flights with weapons will not be allowed to land at Beirut airport. It is a civilian airport and must remain as such.' Hagari also said that the IDF has conducted a readiness assessment under the chief of staff's direction, saying, 'The IDF is prepared on all fronts, and we are still evaluating the results of the attack on the command center located in the heart of the Dahieh district. The strike was very precise. We are conducting a situation assessment, and there are no changes in [Home Font Command] guidelines. We will update immediately if anything changes.' Earlier, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee urged the immediate evacuation of three buildings in central Dahieh: the Munir Shadid building and adjacent structures in the Laylaki neighborhood, the Shiyit building and nearby structures in the Al Hadath neighborhood and the Al Salam complex in the area. 'If you are near Hezbollah properties, for your safety, you must evacuate the buildings immediately and move 500 meters away,' Adraee said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1uxsovaa	2024-09-27T15:11:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkeAtwjVCC/SkeAtwjVCC_0_352_961_541_0_small.jpg

Looking east: The importance of Jordan to Israel’s security	Across Israel’s longest border, danger is mounting constantly; while King Abdullah’s reign is stable and a quiet border is in both sides’ interest — can the Hashemite regime deliver the goods? Jordan is a ticking bomb. Israelis love quiet, and we all find it comfortable not to probe too deeply into what’s happening in the kingdom that safeguards our eastern border — Israel’s longest border with any next-door neighbor. Beyond that kingdom, an ocean of threats, hostility and chaos extends. We find it comfortable to believe that the king, despite occasional unfriendly statements, will be sure to do whatever needs doing in order to maintain quiet. But the king’s throne, which in any case hasn’t always excelled in stability, is wobbling. And that wobble is growing stronger by the day. The instability threatens to undermine security not only in Jordan but throughout the Middle East. The troubles of the Hashemite kingdom are also the troubles of Israel, and the Israeli public only partly realizes what’s eating away at the foundations of the monarchy. The first reason for the Hashemite regime’s fragility derives from the kingdom’s large refugee population. In 1948, there were 400,000 people in Jordan and today there are 11.5 million, including many refugees. That growth has come mainly from enormous waves of immigration. Immigration from where? After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, many refugees arrived in Jordan from the east. Tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees are estimated to still reside in Jordan, but today their numbers are small in comparison with the Syrian and Palestinian refugees. A huge number of refugees fled into Jordan from the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. According to figures from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, some 670,000 Syrian refugees are registered in Jordan; but according to unofficial estimates, those refugees could even number a million or so. Besides accommodating 'new' refugees, Jordan has housed Palestinian refugees since 1948. How many? The Hashemite regime has an interest in concealing the actual number, so it isn’t clear. But out of 11.5 million Jordanian citizens in all, the Palestinian population is estimated to total at least 3.5 million. And along with all those refugees, Jordan also hosts refugees and immigrant workers from countries such as Yemen, Sudan and Egypt. Given shelter in times of trouble, asylum seekers might be expected to show gratitude. But not necessarily. The flood of foreigners in Jordan is under incitement from various ideological and political sources aiming to topple the Hashemite dynasty and take over the kingdom. Given shelter in times of trouble, asylum seekers might be expected to show gratitude. But not necessarily. The flood of foreigners in Jordan is under incitement from various ideological and political sources, each with its own motivation to topple the Hashemite dynasty and take over the kingdom. The Muslim Brotherhood’s ideology, for example, has won great sympathy among Jordan’s large Palestinian sector. It’s the same ideology that’s shared by Hamas and that inspired the assassination of President Sadat in Egypt. Moreover, Iran is of course also troubling the waters and creating great pressure by way of Iraq and Syria at the borders of the kingdom. So Jordan has changed from a country adjoining territories such as an American-dominated Iraq to a country adjoining Iranian proxy organizations — all this at a time when the King’s loyal Bedouin minority is waging tough domestic battles that ruinously weaken it. The volume of weapons smuggled from Iran into the West Bank area, and even into Israel proper, results directly from the Jordanian army’s inaction. Israel can already distinctly feel the effects of the Jordanian government’s weakness. The volume of weapons smuggled from Iran into the West Bank area, and even into Israel proper, is a direct consequence of the Jordanian army’s weakness. And the Iranian–Palestinian effort to mount terror attacks against Israel, such as the one at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, is no less a consequence. Sensing weakness, the Iranian octopus is focusing considerable effort on turning Jordan into one more proxy of the Ayatollahs, like Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. If Iran succeeds in its plan for Jordan, there’s no need to explain what a serious challenge Israel will face. The question now is how to confront that security challenge in its present form, because it threatens to turn into a serious headache before long. The first thing to do is to beef up the relatively scanty Israeli forces in the Jordan Valley and the Arava. In addition, a network of meaningful obstacles should be set up, centered around a barrier like the one at the Egyptian border. The sphere of economics is also critical to our eastern neighbor’s stability. So Israel should continue following through on programs that are now partially in effect, such as the economic corridor that crosses Jordan eastward to India, the Sea-to-Sea Project and increased industrial and agricultural cooperation. Remember that Jordan relies heavily on Israel for energy. And the supply of water to the East Bank rests on agreements between Amman and Jerusalem. Granted, anti-Israeli statements are heard more than rarely from east of the river. The relationship has known ups and downs and it isn’t all rosy today. But diplomatic and geopolitical strategy requires cool consideration in view of the alternatives, rather than emotionally colored thinking. It’s important to bear in mind that not everything depends only on us. Jordan is an independent country, with complicated internal dynamics that Israel can influence only so far. But Israel has helped the Hashemites more than once to stay on the throne. The best-remembered example was during Black September, when King Hussein was facing substantial danger and Israel threatened to step in against any Syrian invasion of Jordan. Granted, anti-Israeli statements are heard more than rarely from east of the river. The relationship has known ups and downs and it isn’t all rosy today. But diplomatic and geopolitical strategy requires cool consideration in view of the alternatives, rather than emotionally colored thinking. Brig. Gen. (Res.)

Nasrallah was present at command center,' Israeli officials say	Israel and the world await updates on Hezbollah leader's fate following Beirut strike; 'No one there could have survived,' Israeli official says; Nasrallah was reportedly on brief visit to Beirut 'Enough is enough,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, without hinting at the imminent military action. Behind the scenes, however, plans for the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Dahieh district had been approved before the Israeli leader departed for the UN. An operational window presented itself, and the final green light was given. According to a U.S. official who spoke with ABC, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and some of his associates were in Beirut for a brief visit when the strike occurred. The official did not confirm whether Nasrallah was at the targeted site, but this may have been the operational opportunity identified by Israeli intelligence. Israeli officials believe Nasrallah was present at the command center, with one saying, 'Anyone there could not have survived.' Netanyahu, who authorized the strike while in the U.S., abruptly left a press briefing following his speech at the UN General Assembly after being approached by his military secretary. The Prime Minister’s Office later announced that Netanyahu would cut his trip short and return to Israel, departing the U.S. at 3 a.m. Israel time. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement that Hezbollah’s central command was located beneath residential buildings in Dahieh. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that at least six buildings were destroyed in the attack. Local reports indicated that around 10 explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital. Footage from the scene showed extensive damage, with the Lebanese news agency reporting that the attacks created a 'belt of fire' from Burj Barajneh to Haret Hreik. Security sources in Lebanon told Reuters the attack, the most extensive Israeli assault on the southern Beirut Hezbollah stronghold since the war began, targeted an area where top Hezbollah officials are usually based. Iran's embassy in Lebanon said on X that the strike represents a dangerous game-changing escalation that will 'bring its perpetrator an appropriate punishment.' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar were in the Air Force command center in Tel Aviv during the attack. Israel updated the United States about its upcoming operation, but a Pentagon spokesperson denied Washington knew of the strike in Beirut in advance. The spokesperson also said that U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart as the operation was ongoing. Netanyahu, addressing the United Nations earlier Friday, said Israel must defeat Hezbollah and prevent the group from posing a threat along its northern border. 'Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that has murdered American, French and other civilians. We will not allow them to sit on our border and plan another October 7,' Netanyahu said. 'Israel has no choice—and every right—to eliminate this threat, and that is exactly what we are doing.' 'We have eliminated commanders responsible for the murders of Israelis, Americans, and French citizens, and then we took out their replacements, and their replacements’ replacements,' Netanyahu added. 'We will continue our strikes until we achieve all our objectives.' Friday's attack came on the heels of a spree of assassinations of high-profile Hezbollah commanders and figures. On Thursday, the IDF killed Hezbollah’s air unit commander Mohammed Srur in Beirut, using three missiles near the site where Ibrahim Aqil, Hezbollah’s head of operations, and other senior Radwan Force commanders were killed last weekend. On Tuesday, the IDF targeted Ibrahim Qubaisi, Hezbollah’s head of missile operations, in a strike on Dahieh. According to the army, several key commanders in Hezbollah’s missile and rocket divisions were with Qubaisi at the time of the strike. Earlier this week, the IDF attempted to eliminate Ali Karaki, Hezbollah’s southern front commander and the organization’s third-highest-ranking official. However, Hezbollah announced that Karaki survived and had been moved to a secure location. In July, Fuad Shukr, described as Hezbollah’s 'most senior military commander and head of the group’s strategic operations,' was killed in Dahieh. According to the IDF, Shukr was a close aide and strategic adviser to Nasrallah. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkeh1ynra	2024-09-27T12:39:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJmyNdVAC/SJmyNdVAC_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

Israel 'crossed all lines' with Dahieh attack, Hezbollah parliame...	Lebanon’s health minister says buildings hit in Israeli airstrike on Beirut housed civilians and condemned IDF flights near airport, calling them 'serious threat'; at least 2 killed and 76 injured Israel has 'crossed all lines' with its attack on Hezbollah's command center in Beirut’s Dahieh district Friday, a Hezbollah parliamentary source told Qatari newspaper The New Arab but vowed it would not destabilize the organization. The powerful strike, which reportedly targeted Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, killed at least two people and injured 76 others, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Search efforts for survivors continued in the area amid widespread anger in Lebanon. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Al-Abyad said that some of the targeted buildings were occupied by residents, and Lebanese media reported that the strike was carried out by F-35 fighter jets while civilian aircraft were landing and taking off at the nearby Rafic Hariri International Airport, posing a serious risk to passengers. Khalil Nasrallah, a commentator close to Hezbollah, suggested on social media that the 'rules of the game have changed.' The airstrike, aimed at Hezbollah’s central command, has raised questions in Israel about whether Nasrallah was present at the time and his fate. Iran’s Tasnim News Agency and Sky News Arabia reported that Hezbollah sources claim Nasrallah is alive and in a secure location. However, an Iranian official told Reuters that 'Tehran is assessing his condition.' A U.S. official told ABC News that Nasrallah and his deputies were in Beirut for a 'brief visit' during the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who authorized the strike while in the U.S., abruptly left a press briefing following his speech at the UN General Assembly after being approached by his military secretary. The Prime Minister’s Office later announced that Netanyahu would cut his trip short and return to Israel, departing the U.S. at 3 a.m. Israel time.

Reports from Lebanon indicated around 10 explosions were heard, and at least six buildings were destroyed in the strike. Footage from the scene showed extensive damage, with the Lebanese news agency reporting that the attacks created a 'belt of fire' from Burj Barajneh to Haret Hreik. A Lebanese security source confirmed to Al Arabiya that this was the most significant Israeli assault on southern Beirut since the beginning of hostilities, targeting an area frequently used by senior Hezbollah officials. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hybmtun0a	2024-09-27T11:41:49-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/ByMDhMP40R/ByMDhMP40R_0_105_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

32 years at the helm: Who is Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah?	Nasrallah, 64, has led Hezbollah since the assassination of his predecessor in 1992; after Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon, he was perceived as a Arab hero; the arch-terrorist targeted by Israel in Beirut Israel attempted to assassinate Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on the Dahieh district of Beirut on Friday, but his fate remains unknown. Nasrallah, 64, has served as Hezbollah's secretary-general since 1992, following the assassination of his predecessor, Abbas Musawi. Known for his fiery rhetoric, charismatic presence and eloquent speeches, Nasrallah has become one of Lebanon’s most prominent figures and a significant leader within the broader radical Islamist movement. Born in a refugee camp in eastern Beirut, Nasrallah was the eldest of nine children in a poor Shiite family originally from a village in southern Lebanon. From a young age, he was deeply interested in Islam and dedicated much of his time to religious studies. During the Lebanese Civil War, he and his family returned to their village, where he joined the Shiite Amal movement. Nasrallah’s talents and dedication were soon noticed, and he was taken under the wing of a prominent local cleric. At 16, he was sent to study at a prestigious seminary in Najaf, Iraq, under the guidance of Abbas Musawi, a fellow Lebanese who would later become Hezbollah’s leader. The two developed a close friendship. In 1978, as the Iraqi regime began cracking down on Shiite clerics, Nasrallah and Musawi fled Iraq along with hundreds of other Lebanese seminarians. Upon returning to Lebanon, Nasrallah continued his studies and taught at a religious seminary established by Musawi in Baalbek. His charisma and militant messages quickly elevated his status as a religious leader, attracting a devoted following. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Nasrallah, following Musawi’s lead, left the Amal movement and joined forces with the newly formed Hezbollah, which was supported by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Nasrallah's leadership abilities quickly became evident, and he was appointed commander of Hezbollah’s forces in the Bekaa Valley. Under the guidance of the Revolutionary Guards, the Lebanese Shiites worked to develop a new framework known as Hezbollah. Nasrallah was a founding member and part of the organization's leadership from its inception. Over the years, Nasrallah consolidated his position as both a military and religious leader within Hezbollah, leading several successful operations against Amal fighters in the late 1980s. He later traveled to Iran to continue his studies in the holy city of Qom. When the conflict between Hezbollah and Amal resumed in 1989, Nasrallah returned to Lebanon, where he participated in the fighting and sustained minor injuries. By the following year, he had become one of Hezbollah’s top military commanders and a member of the group's highest decision-making body, the Shura Council. During that time, the organization’s leadership was divided between different factions loyal to Syria and Iran. In 1991, amid negotiations between the two countries, Musawi, who was seen as an ally of Damascus, was appointed secretary-general of Hezbollah, with Iran-backed Nasrallah’s influence within the organization further solidified. The campaign to eject Israel from Lebanon In 1992, Musawi was assassinated by Israel and Nasrallah took over the helm. Under his leadership, Hezbollah launched a wave of retaliatory attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets worldwide, including bombings at the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which left dozens dead. Nasrallah’s leadership faced a significant challenge in 1997 when former Hezbollah leader Sheikh Subhi Tufayli led a 'revolution of the hungry' in protest of what he saw as the group’s abandonment of its social commitments to Lebanon’s Shiite community in favor of becoming a mainstream political organization. However, with support from Iran and Syria, Nasrallah successfully quashed the uprising, disarming Tufayli’s supporters in the Baalbek region. From 1985, following Israel’s withdrawal from most of Lebanon, Hezbollah waged a persistent guerrilla war against Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the security zone. Under Nasrallah’s guidance and with backing from Iran, Hezbollah’s military capabilities grew significantly. However, the IDF's superior firepower resulted in high casualties for Hezbollah fighters, and many of their operations ended in failure. Israeli attempts to end the prolonged conflict, such as Operations Grapes of Wrath and Accountability, were met with Hezbollah rocket and mortar fire on northern Israel, international condemnation and the group’s entrenchment within the civilian population. Under Nasrallah’s leadership, Hezbollah shifted its strategy to include targeting Israeli public opinion, recognizing that the Israeli public’s sensitivity to casualties was a potential vulnerability. This approach turned the media into a key battleground for Hezbollah, contributing to a protracted conflict that inflicted ongoing casualties on both sides, including Hezbollah fighters, IDF soldiers and SLA forces. By the late 1990s, the continuous casualties and lack of a decisive outcome led to growing public opposition in Israel to the military presence in Lebanon. This pressure culminated in the Israeli government’s decision to withdraw from the security zone. In May 2000, the IDF executed a unilateral withdrawal to the international border, ending its 18-year presence in southern Lebanon. An Arab hero post-Israeli withdrawal The Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon elevated Nasrallah to a hero’s status across the Arab world. Shortly after, he was promoted to the religious rank of Hojjat al-Islam. During celebrations marking the withdrawal, Nasrallah delivered a speech declaring, 'Israel has nuclear weapons and the strongest air force in the region, but in reality, it is weaker than a spider’s web.' His so-called 'Spider Web' theory suggested that Israeli society’s sensitivity to casualties and perceived decadence made it vulnerable to a prolonged struggle and heavy losses. Domestically, Nasrallah focused on solidifying Hezbollah’s influence within the Shiite community, particularly against its main rival, the Amal movement. A significant portion of the group’s budget was allocated to establishing welfare, education, charity and healthcare institutions, providing free services to the community. Despite Israel’s withdrawal, Nasrallah refrained from ending hostilities, frequently attacking and mocking Israel and its leaders in his speeches. While the intensity of the conflict decreased, it was marked by sporadic skirmishes and preparations for future confrontation. In early July 2006, a Hezbollah squad attacked an Israeli military patrol along the Israel-Lebanon border, capturing two Israeli soldiers and killing three others. In response, the Israeli government launched a large-scale military operation against Hezbollah, later known as the Second Lebanon War. During the war, Nasrallah went into hiding, fearing an Israeli assassination attempt. However, he continued to deliver messages to the Lebanese public and engage in psychological warfare with Israel through speeches broadcast on Hezbollah’s television station. The last speech Since then and until October 2023, Hezbollah, with significant Iranian support, has armed itself extensively but largely avoided direct clashes with Israel. Over the past month, Israel has killed several senior Hezbollah commanders close to Nasrallah. Foreign reports have also attributed to Israel a large-scale sabotage operation of communication devices used by the group’s operatives, resulting in dozens of deaths and thousands of injuries. Last week, in a televised speech, Nasrallah vowed that Israel would face a 'harsh and just punishment' for its recent actions, warning, 'We are currently in the most sensitive phase of the campaign.' However, he did not specify what Hezbollah’s retaliation would look like, saying that the details are kept within a 'small circle' of the group’s leadership. 'I won’t speak of the time, form or place. The response will come,' Nasrallah declared, adding, 'The aggression is unprecedented and will face a harsh reckoning and just retribution—whether from an expected or unexpected place.' He accused Israel of intending to kill 5,000 people—presumably referring to Hezbollah members—in the communication device blasts, claiming, 'The enemy has crossed all red lines with this action.' Nasrallah also hinted that Israel’s actions could be considered a declaration of war, though he stopped short of making such a declaration himself. Nasrallah is married to Fatima Yassin. His eldest son, Hadi Nasrallah, was killed by Israeli forces in September 1997. His body was transferred to Israel and later returned to Lebanon as part of a prisoner exchange deal for the remains of an Israeli Navy commando killed in a separate incident the same year. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj5rfdva0	2024-09-27T10:55:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/HklEg112KaA/HklEg112KaA_0_0_3000_1672_0_small.jpg

Army says terror group's HQ located beneath residential buildings in Lebanese capital's Dahieh district; no changes to Home Front Command safety guidelines The IDF said it carried out an airstrike on Friday evening targeting Hezbollah’s central command, located beneath residential buildings in the Dahieh district in southern Beirut. Some media reports suggested that the Lebanese terrorist group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was the intended target. 'On October 8, Hezbollah, led by Nasrallah, initiated a war and has since escalated the situation,' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement. 'Israel warned them, but they continued their aggression against our citizens and sovereignty. The Air Force continues to strike terror targets to diminish their capabilities.' Hagari added there are no changes to the Home Front Command’s safety guidelines and any updates will be provided immediately through official channels. Security sources in Lebanon told Reuters the attack, the most extensive Israeli assault on the southern Beirut Hezbollah stronghold since the war began, targeted an area where top Hezbollah officials are usually based. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that six buildings were destroyed in the attack. Local reports indicated that around 10 explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital. The strikes hit Beirut shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue Israel's attacks on the Iranian-backed terrorist group in Lebanon in a closely watched United Nations speech, as hopes faded for a cease-fire that could head off an all-out regional war. He abruptly left a press briefing he was holding following his speech after learning about the strike. *This is a breaking news story* >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycgxi4ca	2024-09-27T08:50:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/S1VOf8N0A/S1VOf8N0A_0_139_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu addresses UN General Assembly amid war | watch live	PM defends Israel’s right to security and its fight against terrorism amid growing criticism over his handling of Gaza war and tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Friday to defend Israel’s right to security and its fight against terrorism amid growing criticism over his handling of an almost year-long war against Hamas in Gaza and escalating tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon. The speech comes as Netanyahu faces mounting pressure at home and abroad to navigate Israel through one of the most volatile periods in its history. Netanyahu defended his government's military operations in Gaza, which have drawn international scrutiny over civilian casualties and the ongoing blockade. Meanwhile, tensions with Hezbollah have spiked along Israel's northern border, raising fears of a broader regional conflict. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hymalq4ca	2024-09-27T06:40:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/HyO7aQVR0/HyO7aQVR0_109_67_630_355_0_small.jpg
Israel aims to keep Lebanon ground operation as brief as possible...	Army completes call-up of 2 reserve brigades in preparation for a potential expansion of the conflict in Lebanon and a possible ground incursion The IDF announced on Friday that it has completed the mobilization of the 6th and 228th reserve brigades in preparation for a potential expansion of the conflict in Lebanon and a possible ground incursion. An Israeli official told AFP that the aim would be to keep any ground operation in Lebanon as brief as possible. 'We will try to make it as short as we can. We are preparing for this every day, and we definitely have the means,' the official said. The official also dismissed claims that Israeli airstrikes have resulted in high civilian casualties in Lebanon, asserting that many of those killed were Hezbollah members. 'They are not publishing the names of the dead. Many were from Hezbollah,' he said, accusing the militant group of using civilians as human shields. In addition to the two brigades, the IDF has also mobilized several additional reserve battalions to support efforts to secure the northern region and enable residents to return to their homes safely. Emergency depots have been opened, and logistical and combat equipment has been distributed to reservists. Photos from the north show dozens of tanks poised for possible deployment. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, visiting the northern border, said, 'The enemy wanted attrition, and they are getting crushed instead. There have been blow after blow to key operatives and the command chain, dramatic moves to eliminate their missile and rocket capabilities, and many more operations from air and sea.' During a briefing with 91st Division commander Brig. Gen. Shai Klapper and other senior officers, Gallant emphasized the need for readiness in the region. 'What you’ve seen in the past two weeks has changed Hezbollah significantly, and we need to capitalize on that. Continuity in battle and exploiting success are key. We are looking at how Hezbollah is behaving—it’s a problem of capability, fear, and control. The lack of commanders in their chain of command is significant, especially with the Radwan Force. The dramatic operation last Friday changed a lot.' Gallant added, 'We have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, not just in the past year, but for many years. We have unfinished business with many elements here, and in the end, we want to live here properly, both in this region and in the more western fronts. So keep going, use the time, and surprises will come—both for the enemy and for our forces. We will give you as much warning as possible, but the dynamics are known.' Meanwhile, airstrikes in Lebanon continued. The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that 14 villages across the country were hit afternoon within two hours. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjp11znncr	2024-09-27T06:33:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJeuboZ400/SJeuboZ400_0_0_1280_773_0_small.jpg

We have to make a deal with Iran,' Trump says	Republican presidential candidate says would attempt and negotiate a new deal with Tehran should he be elected without providing details U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday he was willing to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran if elected. 'I would do that,' Trump said without elaborating on the potential deal’s details. 'We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.' Trump's statements, made in the context of his tight race against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, are notable given the hostility he previously demonstrated toward Tehran — both as president and during his campaign. Trump's campaign claimed this week that U.S. intelligence informed him that Iran was planning an assassination attempt on his life. According to Politico, Trump's comments were aimed at easing tensions with the Iranian regime. Trump said that he would have been ready to reach an agreement with Iran within a week after the elections were he reelected in 2020. ' I would’ve made a fair deal with Iran. I was gonna get along with Iran. The deal was simple: Iran can’t have a nuclear missile. It cannot have that nuclear capability,' he said. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who arrived for the annual UN General Assembly in New York alongside Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, said that Tehran was ready to resume nuclear talks. He noted that Iran is prepared to restart negotiations 'if the other parties are also ready,' to do so. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers collapsed after Trump decided to withdraw from the agreement and reinstate sanctions on Iran. Iran has since violated many of the agreement’s clauses. In his speech at the UN this week, Iran's president stressed that Tehran was willing to cooperate with major powers to save the agreement. Pezeshkian said in his address that the sanctions against the Islamic Republic are 'inhumane' and harm Iranian residents. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byixjmnac	2024-09-27T05:23:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/SyFswO9TA/SyFswO9TA_1_25_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Once buildings in Beirut start collapsing, it'll be clear we're ...	As IDF operation against Hezbollah continues military is adamant to cut off Lebanon from smuggling routes used to deliver weapons to terror group from across the Middle East Amid Operation Northern Arrows against Hezbollah announced by IDF Chief of Staff LTG Herzi Halevi last week, military indications point out the Iran-back terror group is maximizing its efforts in receiving new munitions and military equipment from Tehran via smuggling routes in Syria, Iraq and Iran — which the IDF is now adamant in disrupting. More than 200 Hezbollah targets were attacked on Thursday out of approximately 3,000 since Israel’s large-scale operation began. Four border crossings in Lebanon were attacked by Israeli Air Force fighter jets as well, with plans to escalate strikes in the coming days to disrupt Hezbollah's smuggling routes. A mid-operation assessment by the IDF indicated that the operation’s initial strikes, which severely impacted dozens of Hezbollah commanders — including top officials who were eliminated — are the primary reason the Shiite terror army has struggled to implement its contingency plans. These included the daily firing of thousands of rockets, precision missiles and drones against Israel in general and Tel Aviv in particular in large-scale barrages. Hezbollah’s initial shock over the elimination of its key leaders, including its air unit commander, has hindered its ability to reassess and formulate additional actions. The IDF, however, said it has yet to fully unleash its force. 'It will be clear that we are applying our full strength once buildings in Beirut start collapsing or the IDF Northern Command forces initiate a ground operation. We're not there yet.' The IDF believes that the past week demonstrates Hezbollah has lost its operational balance, though it still retains significant capabilities for major attacks deep within Israel. As a result, prolonged strikes are necessary which will possibly last several more weeks. At this stage, the IDF isn’t attacking dual-use infrastructure in Lebanon, such as bridges that Hezbollah could also use, reserving these elements for an all-out war. One of Israel's primary objectives in this operation is to sever the connection between Lebanon and Gaza. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah committed — and followed through on his promise — to fire at Israel as long as fighting continues in the Gaza Strip. The Ground operation in Gaza has been dramatically reduced to a minimal force maintaining the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors in the past month, with only a few hundred soldiers involved and without the widespread ground raids that were initially planned for the war’s 'Phase C'. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force sees both fronts as joined. The pilots who attacked hundreds of additional targets in Lebanon on Thursday also participated in airstrikes against Hamas's recovering positions in Gaza, as part of support for divisions defending the Gaza border. According to IDF estimates, Hezbollah is still equipped with thousands of short-range rockets as well as thousands of drones and precision missiles. However, the elimination of senior figures in recent days has disrupted its ability to use them. The IDF is aware Hezbollah hasn’t yet deployed its heavy arsenal, much of which has been targeted: precision missiles, and not only surface-to-surface missiles but also advanced Russian-made Yakhont cruise missiles which the IDF believes the terror group still holds from its part in suppressing the Syrian civil war. The Yakhont missile can hit any target along Israel's coast within a range of about 300 km (186 miles), potentially crippling the Haifa and Ashdod ports and endangering Israel's gas rigs. However, the IDF believes Hezbollah would need to assemble the missile’s components from various hideouts In order to deploy it, a process the IDF has detected and disrupted. Another key target being gradually worn down is Hezbollah's Radwan Force, the terror group’s elite unit comprising thousands of highly trained soldiers organized into battalions. Israel has made significant efforts to distance the unit's operatives from southern Lebanon. The Radwan Force’s command chain has been hit or eliminated by the Israeli Air Force in recent days, which the IDF believes has disrupted Hezbollah's plans to invade the Galilee which took over two decades to develop and designed to mirror Hamas’s invasion on October 7. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tla114rr	2024-09-27T04:37:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/SJXUZJm00/SJXUZJm00_0_159_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Local reports say terror group operatives stopped Islam Hijazi's car and fired over 90 bullets at her after she refused to provide them with money donated to her organization Hamas terrorists on Thursday killed Islam Hijazi — program director of the Heal Palestine organization working to medically support the Strip — near a hospital in Khan Younis after she refused to hand charity funds she collected over to the terror group. According to eyewitnesses, three masked Hamas terrorists stopped Hijazi’s Thursday overnight and fired around 90 bullets at her while she was on her way to visit patients. Gazan reports noted that the motive for the murder was Hamas operatives' takeover of large portions of the aid and funds entering the Strip via donations. 'Islam was a mother of two young children, a humane woman with the highest level of ethics and professionalism. She stayed in Gaza intentionally to help others. She always said, 'I'm staying here to help our people,'' The NGO said in a statement following the murder. Iyad Khader, a Gaza resident, posted on social media following the murder, writing, 'A mafia has recently been established in the southern part of the Strip to loot, kill, steal and terrorize the residents. War must declare war on them immediately.' 'This isn’t the first of such a case,' said Hussein Jamal, a political researcher from Gaza. 'The truth is that civilians are murdered daily and no one talks about it. Hijazi was unfortunately well-known; otherwise, no one would have known the circumstances or details of her death.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry00kqzera	2024-09-27T03:24:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/H1RV067AA/H1RV067AA_0_94_680_383_0_small.jpg

Lebanese terror group resumed heavy fire on north amid American efforts to avoid conflict spiraling into regional war; reports say six rockets fell inside Sea of Galilee Sirens blared incessantly in northern Israel’s Tiberias and Haifa throughout Friday morning as Hezbollah renewed its fire against the country amid ongoing efforts by the U.S. and France to secure a three-week cease-fire. According to the Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service, a 25-year-old man received moderate injuries after being hit by ricochets in the southern Golan Heights following Hezbollah’s fire. Launches toward the area began around 8 a.m. with the Tiberias municipality reporting a hit was seen inside the Sea of Galilee after several interceptions took place above the city. 'The rocket fell 20 meters away from the shore, it’s a Rosh Hashanah miracle that no one was hurt. It fell right at the point where boats are lowered toward the Sea of Galilee,' Tiberias Mayor Yossi Nava said following the attack. Shortly afterward another rocket salvo was launched toward the city, with the municipality reporting at least five rockets were seen landing inside of the Israeli lake. The MDA said no injuries were reported in either incident. Hezbollah also resumed launches toward the Haifa Bay area on Friday, with the IDF reporting that 10 rockets were fired toward the city and were intercepted. 'Approximately 10 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and others were identified as having fallen in open areas,' the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said in a statement. Two individuals received minor injuries running for safety during the barrage, and a car was damaged from ricochets hitting Kiryat Haim. The rising conflict on the northern border comes amid efforts to calm the situation and attempts to avoid an all-out war with Hezbollah amid fears such a war could span the entire Middle East. Sources close to the talks to end the fighting in the north voiced their disappointment late on Thursday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the fight against Hezbollah in Lebanon would continue until the objective of returning Israelis to their homes in the north safely, is met. The prime minister spoke to reporters upon landing in New York before his address to the UN General Assembly on Friday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk7waa7ar	2024-09-27T00:45:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/Byme9TXRC/Byme9TXRC_0_73_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Nasrallah, hit Tel Aviv': Belgium protest calls on Hezbollah to ...	Israel's ambassador to Belgium posts clip on social media in which extreme pro-Palestinian group calls for attacks on country and say they support Hamas Israel's ambassador to Belgium Idit Rosenzweig-Abu, posted a video on her X account on Thursday showing a pro-Palestinian demonstration in central Brussels in which hundreds of protesters participated, chanting in Arabic for Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah to launch rockets at Tel Aviv. 'Hassan (Nasrallah), hit, hit Tel Aviv, please sir, in the name of Allah,' they chanted. 'Hamas, we are here for you.' The demonstration was organized by a group called 'Samidoun,' a Palestinian organization advocating for Palestinian 'prisoners.' The extremist group even opposes the Palestinian Authority, believing that anyone negotiating with Israel is a traitor. They support the establishment of a Palestinian state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean and accuse the United Arab Emirates of betrayal for making peace with Israel. The group's leader was deported from Germany and now lives in Canada, while the head of its European center, Mohammad Khatib, resides in Brussels. A few months ago, Belgium's interior ministry announced plans to deport Khatib, but the issue is still under legal proceedings following a public uproar and he still resides in the country. During the war in Gaza, the organization's activists held a webinar with a Hamas spokesperson. They regularly organize demonstrations on university campuses in the country, often marked by violence. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Belgium have a structured plan to turn campus demonstrations violent, both in Europe and beyond. Belgian authorities appear powerless in dealing with the group. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skoaqpmrc	2024-09-26T23:25:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SyFxI5XR0/SyFxI5XR0_288_247_746_420_0_small.jpg

IDF thwarts Houthi missile strike on Tel Aviv, central Israel	The IDF intercepted a missile fired by the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the military said late on Thursday after sirens were heard in many communities surrounding the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, the central plains and the city of Modi'in.

Major hurricane Helene menaces Florida with 'unsurvivable' storm ...	The storm became a major Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds near 120 mph, worrying weather officials of potential destructive outcomes Driving rain flooded roadways and closed down airports in Florida as an intensifying Hurricane Helene marched toward the state's panhandle region, bringing the threat of a potentially deadly storm surge to much of the coastline. The storm became a major Category 3 hurricane on Thursday afternoon with sustained winds near 120 mph (193 kph), the National Hurricane Center said, and was expected to continue gaining power. Helene was forecast to make landfall in the evening in Florida's Big Bend region, possibly as a Category 4 storm with sustained winds in excess of 130 mph (209 kph). Officials pleaded with residents in the path of the storm to heed mandatory evacuation orders or face life-threatening conditions. Helene's surge - the wall of seawater pushed on land by hurricane-force winds - could rise to as much as 20 feet (6.1 meters) in some spots, as tall as a two-story house, the center's director, Michael Brennan, said in a video briefing. 'A really unsurvivable scenario is going to play out' in the coastal area, Brennan said, with water capable of destroying buildings and carrying cars pushing inland. The hurricane was about 160 miles (274 km) west-southwest of Tampa, Florida, as of 3 p.m. EDT, the center said. Strong rain bands were whipping parts of coastal Florida, and rainfall had already lashed Georgia, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina and portions of Tennessee. Atlanta, hundreds of miles north of Florida's Big Bend, was under a tropical storm warning. In Pinellas County, which sits on a peninsula surrounded by Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, roads were already filling with water before noon. Officials warned the storm's impact could be as severe as last year's Hurricane Idalia, which flooded 1,500 homes in the low-lying coastal county. Videos posted on the county's social media site showed some swamped beachside roads and water rising over boat docks. Airports in Tampa, Tallahassee and St. Petersburg all suspended operations on Thursday. Governor Ron DeSantis warned North Florida residents to flee before time ran out. 'You have time to get to a shelter, but you've got to do it now,' he said at a morning news briefing. 'Every minute that goes by brings us closer to having conditions that are going to be simply too dangerous to navigate.' Helene is expected to remain a full-fledged hurricane as it rolls through the Macon, Georgia, area on Friday, forecasters said. It could bring 12 inches (30.5 cm) of rain or more, potentially devastating the state's cotton and pecan crops, which are in the middle of harvesting season. 'The current forecast for Hurricane Helene suggests this storm will impact every part of our state,' Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said. After making landfall across the Florida coast, Helene is expected move more slowly over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday, the NHC said. Wall of water Storm surge was forecast to reach 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 meters) in the Big Bend area of Florida's Panhandle region where the storm is expected to come ashore. Numerous evacuations were ordered along Florida's Gulf Coast, including Sarasota and Charlotte counties. Pinellas County officials ordered evacuations of long-term healthcare facilities near the coast, including nursing homes, assisted living centers and hospitals. Not everyone heeded the evacuation orders. In coastal Dunedin, Florida, about 25 miles west of Tampa, state ferry boat operator Ken Wood, 58, planned to ride out the storm with his 16-year-old cat, Andy. 'We're under orders, but I'm going to stay right here at the house,' Wood told Reuters by telephone. 'The storm looks like it'll be a bit west of us, but who knows? I'm sure it'll be interesting, to say the least.' Tallahassee officials expressed concern that the storm could cause unprecedented damage. Reinsurance broker Gallagher Re said preliminary private insurance losses could reach $3 billion to $6 billion, with additional losses to federal insurance programs approaching a potential $1 billion. Energy facilities along the U.S. Gulf Coast scaled back operations and evacuated some production sites. The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, said at a White House briefing that she would travel to Florida on Friday to assess the damage. Helene was expected to dump up to 15 inches (38.1 cm) of rain in some isolated spots after making landfall in Florida, causing considerable flash and urban flooding, the hurricane center said. National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said about half of lives lost in hurricanes typically came from flash flooding caused by torrential rain, often among people who drive into flooded roads and are swept away.

Algeria says Morocco using 'Zionist intelligence agents'	Ministry of Foreign Affairs accuses Morocco of taking advantage of the visa exemption regime to carry out 'actions detrimental to the stability of Algeria' Algeria announced Thursday the 'immediate reestablishment' of a visa regime for 'all foreigners holding a Moroccan passport', accusing its neighbor of deploying 'Zionist intelligence agents ' against a backdrop of growing tensions between these rival Maghreb countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs accuses Morocco of taking advantage of the visa exemption regime to deploy 'Zionist intelligence agents (....) and freely access the national territory' to carry out 'various actions detrimental to the stability of Algeria'. Algiers specifies that 'these acts constitute a direct threat to national security' and affirms that 'the Kingdom of Morocco is held solely responsible for the current process of deterioration of bilateral relations through its hostile actions against Algeria.' Algiers broke off diplomatic relations with Rabat in August 2021, denouncing a series of 'hostile acts' by its neighbor, particularly concerning the disputed territory of Western Sahara, normalization with Israel as well as support for the independence movement. of Kabylia (MAK) which Algiers has classified as a terrorist organization. Morocco deemed this decision 'completely unjustified', rejecting the neighboring country's accusations. Emboldened by the recognition by the American administration of its sovereignty over Western Sahara, in return for a rapprochement with Israel, Morocco has since deployed offensive diplomacy to rally other countries to its positions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkbehrqaa	2024-09-26T14:16:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/S1ecgAHQ0A/S1ecgAHQ0A_0_0_275_183_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu backed from 'quiet understandings' with U.S., sources s...	Israeli officials and military leadership including IDF chief continue to press for northern front campaign amid efforts by U.S. and France to foster cease-fire with Hezbollah Sources close to the talks to end the fighting in the north voiced their disappointment late on Thursday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the fight against the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon would continue until the objective of returning Israelis to their homes in the north safely, is met. The prime minister spoke to reporters upon landing in New York before his address to the UN General Assembly on Friday. The sources said that the prime minister backed away from 'quiet understandings' reached earlier that he would accept the international efforts to stop the fighting. The White House said the 21-day cease-fire proposal between Israel and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, unveiled Wednesday night, was coordinated with the Israeli government, which later rejected it. 'I’m just laying out the facts and what we know, and what we want to avoid,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a briefing. 'We do not believe an all-out war is the answer.' Jean-Pierre said she could not speak for the Israel side. 'Israel was aware of this statement and now, what I can tell you right now, we are having continued discussions that is happening with our teams in New York. … I can assure you these conversations are continuing,' she said. Another source said that there were no clear commitments that Israel would agree to a proposed lull in the fighting but there were sufficient indications that allowed for a public statement about a pending agreement to be made. 'But then Israeli politicians came out with their public reactions and the same occurred on the Lebanese side,' he said. 'We did not expect these reactions from Netanyahu and the Israelis. Our understanding was that the prime minister would at least welcome the initiative. We believe diplomacy is the best way to return residents to the north compared to a dangerous war that would have a devastating effect on both peoples and on the entire region.' 'It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety,' U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a joint statement. 'The exchange of fire since October 7, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians. We are grateful for all of those who are making a sincere effort with diplomacy to avoid escalation, to avoid a full war,' the leaders added. The proposal was also supported by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. This was the first time that the Americans have referred to the northern front separately from the war in Gaza, which is advantageous to the Israeli position although it is devastating to the families of the hostages still held by Hamas who fear their loved ones would be overlooked in any deal. Netanyahu gave the green light to proceed with attempts to reach a temporary cease-fire before he departed for the United States and after a dramatic meeting of the security cabinet. He dispatched Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in New York. Officials close to the prime minister briefed reporters that Netanyahu's red lines are that Hezbollah be pushed back north of the Litani River but at the same time, he was involved in the wording of the American-French proposal, but wanted to maintain plausible deniability so as not to endanger his coalition. Both far-right ministers Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said they opposed a cease-fire and Ben-Gvir even threatened Netanyahu that he would remove his party from the coalition if one was imposed. Netanyahu may have intended to agree to the proposal under the assumption that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah would reject it, thus providing Israel with the international legitimacy to continue the war without the risk of a U.S. arms embargo. The announcement of the cease-fire was made while Netanyahu was airborne. This may have been intentional. But soon after it was made, the prime minister's coalition partners and members of his own party, came out with their statements opposing it. According to the source, the situation is at a critical junction. 'This does not mean we are on the cusp of an all-out war but the risk is high. A war would not yield better conditions than an agreement. Now, after the statements that were made, the path is even more narrow and it is more difficult for us but we have not lost hope.' U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew said the unacceptable risk of broader regional escalation demands immediate action. ' A cease-fire is the best way for diplomacy to restore safety for citizens to return to their homes,' he said. 'Conditions in the north of Israel and the south of Lebanon must change to permit their safe return. At the same time, we press forward every day for an agreement to release the hostages and achieve a cease-fire in Gaza.' The Prime Minister's Office released a statement earlier on Thursday, denying reports of an imminent cease-fire. 'It is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to,' the statement which was released while Netanyahu was on his way to the U.S. read. 'The report about an alleged directive to scale back fighting in the north is also incorrect. The prime minister instructed the IDF to continue fighting with full force, according to the plans presented to him. Likewise, the fighting in Gaza will continue until all the war's goals are achieved,' the statement added. IDF Chief of Staff LTG Herzi Halevi said earlier that the military had waited a long time for this opportunity to hit Hezbollah. He said strikes should continue and that the forces have succeeded thus far in eliminating the terror group's leadership, disrupting its arms supplies and diminishing its military capabilities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r159afmra	2024-09-26T12:24:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/20/BkTYLwK00R/BkTYLwK00R_0_15_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Children were shot and burned alive on October 7, police report s...	Police cyber and forensics teams work tirelessly across communities near the Gaza border to uncover facts about Hamas' brutal killing of children; warning: viewer discretion is advised Warning: The article contains graphic descriptions. Viewer discretion is advised. Israel Police data released on Thursday revealed 27 children between the ages of 0-17 were shot and burned alive on October 7. Commander Dudi Katz, the Israel Police special investigations unit’s Lahav 433’s cyber unit chief, was tasked with analyzing digital forensic evidence. One of the recordings received by the cyber team investigating one of the kibbutzim near the Gaza border featured a child's voice. The girl was on a call with the police emergency center while being held by a terrorist. She begged the terrorist to let her go, saying she was just a child and had school the next day. Despite the police dispatcher's pleas, the terrorist shot her to death. Her burnt remains were later located. This is just one of the many heartbreaking stories that police investigators have uncovered. The data, testimonies and hundreds of thousands of videos have been analyzed by Lahav 433, the national unit investigating the events of October 7. 'We collected 11,666 videos that provide a comprehensive evidentiary basis gathered from various sources from just one kibbutz, which will enable us to file some of the most severe indictments against the perpetrators of these brutal terror acts,' said Superintendent Reut Anoim, head of Lahav 433’ cyber investigation division. The data and testimonies were also collected from ZAKA Search and Rescue volunteers who operated in the kibbutz. Six days after the deadly assault began, ZAKA personnel returned to ensure no evidence was overlooked, guided by the smell of decay, flies and other signs. In one room, they found the small body of a child and the body of a woman in the stairwell. Both bodies were so badly burned they were nearly unrecognizable. The only thing left of the mother was her bra, and of the child, only ashes remained. 'Each cyber unit and the International Crime Investigations Unit was assigned to gather and analyze evidence based on specific areas. We relied on a web of testimonies collected from CCTV cameras in the affected towns, private homes near the Gaza border, testimonies from hostages, ZAKA volunteers, Hamas terrorists' body cameras and social media posts,' Anoim said. Any evidence that could not be verified was dismissed. 'All the materials we used helped complete an evidentiary framework as we worked hard to maintain the highest standards of verification and cross-referencing, compared to the fake materials circulating on social media,' she added, Katz explained the challenge was interpreting the significance of the evidence they located. 'As a law enforcement officer, I only work with definitive evidence. When I see a child shot with a severed finger, I can describe and document the scene but cannot definitively state the cause, as the finger may not have been intentionally severed but instead was injured by a fragment from the explosion in the safe room.' However, Katz was unequivocal about one fact: the torture of children by Hamas' Nukhba terrorists. 'That children were burned, shot and murdered alongside their parents is a proven fact. Children witnessed their parents being murdered and we found a scene with a pile of bodies from the same family more than once.' Among the other harrowing scenes was a photograph of a baby who was murdered alongside her father who tried to protect his family. She was the youngest victim of October 7. Another case that Katz said he would never forget was the tragic story of the Taasa family from Netiv HaAsara. The father, Gil, threw himself on a grenade that terrorists had tossed into their home to save his children from witnessing the horror. In another video, 'We identified a child around six or seven years old whose body was burnt, but his face remained intact. His glazed expression indicated that he had been burned alive,' Katz recounted. Over 90 members of Kibbutz Be'eri were murdered on October 7. The kibbutz secretary, Gal Cohen, said that the highest number of children murdered was in his community. 'What the children here went through is incomprehensible and we’re still burying our dead. This is an open wound, and we haven't digested it yet.' 'We’re scarred, but we’re rebuilding and trying to recover. Parents and grandparents who lost their children and grandchildren have said they will never set foot in the kibbutz again because they see the victims everywhere they look,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqyi11q0r	2024-09-26T11:38:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/11/03/S1g26PMm6/S1g26PMm6_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

80% of homes aren't protected': Safed worries after rocket makes...	Northern city residents and mayor say city doesn't have enough safe room in homes, putting them at risk after Hezbollah focuses its fire on the area Israel’s northern city of Safed felt Hezbollah’s most severe rocket salvos on Wednesday since the war began on October 7 and amid increased fighting across the northern border against the terror group. One home suffered a direct hit while its owners were abroad and avoided severe injury. Most homes in the city lack safe rooms or shelters because they were built before regulations demanded them, and many were also built using lightweight construction materials such as drywall. Many of these homes were part of assisted living housing complexes, where elderly people and new immigrants reside. The distance to public shelters, combined with advanced age, makes it impossible for many of the residents to reach a safe place in the 30 seconds between when sirens warn of fire and rockets arrive. The city was now examining the possibility of evacuating residents to a safer location. Unfortunately, we're being deserted,' Yitav Haddad, who lives near the home that took a direct hit said. 'We heard a huge explosion and quickly realized it hit the neighborhood, very close to us. The government and the municipality must wake up fast because tragedies will happen. We're talking about people's lives.' 'It was insane, the hardest volley we've experienced, Roman, another Safed resident, said. 'Some 80% of homes in the neighborhood aren't protected and that's a big fear here. It's a miracle no one was injured.' According to Safed Mayor Yossi Kakon, over 200 rockets targeted his city. 'Unfortunately, Safed also has a significant lack of shelters.' 'Generally, no evacuations are taking place in the city, but there are isolated cases where we may examine complex situations involving patients, the elderly and specific individuals. The decision to evacuate residents, are made by the Home Front Command in coordination with the municipality,' he said. Entire neighborhoods in the Druze cities of Daliyat al-Karmel and Isfiya, which have recently come within range of rockets from Lebanon, lack safe rooms or public shelters, leaving their residents feeling helpless in the face of this new threat. Parts of an intercepted rocket fell near the home of Suad Abu Rokhen living in Isfiya. Having recently undergone surgery, she can’t leave her unprotected home. 'When I hear the siren, I do nothing. I just wait for it to pass and pray that we don't get hit,' she said. 'According to the Civil Protection Law, the responsibility for building private safe rooms falls on the property owner, while the responsibility for public protection falls on municipalities. The Home Front Command is working in collaboration with various government ministries and local authorities to advance the permitting process for building various protection solutions,' The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk0zkx70r	2024-09-26T11:34:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/HyD800dhZA0/HyD800dhZA0_0_56_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Iran, Hezbollah enabled Houthis' rise, says UN report	The rebel group is transformed into an army with weapons training and assistance provided by other members of Iran's axis despite a de facto UN embargo on arms since 2015 Yemen's Houthi rebels have grown 'from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization' with the help of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists, according to a confidential report by U.N. sanctions monitors. The independent panel of experts, who report annually to the U.N. Security Council, said Houthi fighters had been receiving tactical and technical training outside Yemen, traveling on fake passports to Iran, Lebanon and Iraq. Over the past year the Houthis have launched repeated drone and missile strikes on ships in the crucial Red Sea shipping channels to show support for Palestinians in the Gaza war with Israel, disrupting global maritime trade by forcing shipping firms to divert cargo. 'The multiple testimonies gathered by the panel from military experts, Yemeni officials and even individuals close to the Houthis, indicate that they do not have the capacity to develop and produce, without foreign support, complex weapon systems,' the U.N. experts wrote in their latest report, seen by Reuters. 'The scale, nature and the extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,' they said. The Houthis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. The sanctions monitors said weapons systems operated by the Houthis were similar to those produced and operated by Iran or armed groups of the Tehran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' opposed to Israel and U.S. influence in the Middle East. 'This transformation has been possible due to the transfer of materiel and the assistance and training provided by IRGC-QF, Hezbollah, and Iraqi specialists and technicians to the Houthis,' the U.N. experts reported to the 15-member Security Council Yemen sanctions committee. 'IRGC-QF' refers to the Quds Force, the overseas branch of the Revolutionary Guards. Built up over years or decades of Iranian support, the 'Axis of Resistance' includes the Houthis, Palestinian militants Hamas, Hezbollah and various armed groups in Iraq and Syria. The Houthis have effectively been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2015. Iran has repeatedly denied supplying weapons to the group. Iran's mission to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. sanctions monitors report. At the United Nations on Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters before a Security Council meeting that his country supported Hezbollah and would not remain indifferent if the Lebanon conflict with Israel spiraled. The U.N. sanctions monitors also expressed concern about an increasing collaboration between the Houthis and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. 'Both have agreed to cease internal conflict, transfer weapons, and coordinate on attacks against the forces of the Government of Yemen,' they said. 'Additionally, increased smuggling activities, involving small and light weapons (SALWs) are observed between the Houthis and Al-Shabaab, with indications of shared military supplies or a common supplier.' On the issue of fake passports, the U.N. sanctions monitors said that the Houthis issue the counterfeit documents to people who 'act on their behalf, for their support or under their control.' 'These people are tasked with the procurement and/or transfer of illicit goods or weapons or they travel abroad to participate in military training,' they wrote in the 38-page report that includes hundreds of pages of annexes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skp8qmq0c	2024-09-26T10:46:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/01/13/H1eEFeElKa/H1eEFeElKa_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Hamas massacre to be celebrated in Spain as Israel unable to sway...	Several pro-Palestinian organizations announce plans to celebrate atrocities committed on Israelis; Israel's position at a disadvantage with no Ambassador named to head mission harming efforts to counter Palestinian narrative Several Spanish organizations, some funded by Iran, are set to hold events across the country on October 6 and 7 to celebrate Hamas’ attack on Israel. Spain’s postal workers union decided to go on Strike on October 9 to protest 'Israeli aggression,' while failing to mention the massacre that took place across southern Israel before the war began. Israel's embassy in Madrid has appealed to the relevant Spanish authorities to cancel a planned parade by the Masar Badil organization, affiliated with Hamas, celebrating Hamas’ atrocities in the city. Despite the embassy's efforts, the parade is still set to take place. Senior officials noted that the embassy is tirelessly working to counter the Palestinian narrative and ensure Israel’s voice is heard — both among official figures in the government and opposition and with the Spanish public. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas was received with full honors in Spain this week, including in a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Sanchez promised that a bilateral meeting between Spain and the PA would take place soon following a major international conference held nearly two weeks ago with foreign ministers from Arab and European countries participating aimed at promoting the two-state solution. The only country not invited to the event was Israel, which is perceived as irrelevant to the process by the current Spanish government. The Foreign Ministry chose to avoid a direct attack on Spain and instead focused criticism on the European Union's Foreign Affairs Chief Josep Borrell, who’s due to end his term in late October. Israel itself seems largely absent from the Spanish arena amid the anti-Israel sentiment present there and its voice is barely heard. It's not that Israel lacks friends in Spain or people willing to help, but with the embassy operating without an ambassador since May, following Spain’s recognition of a Palestinian state, bringing Israel’s perspective to the media or initiating meetings with senior Spanish officials has hit snags. Sources familiar with Israel-Spain relations say that inaction only strengthens the anti-Israel stance and creates the impression that Israel has given up on Spain. Israel’s ambassador to Spain Rodica Radian, who was recalled in May, has since retired. Her replacement, Zvi Vapni, is waiting for the government to decide if and when he should leave to take up his post. Spain isn’t only a popular tourist destination for Israelis, but also the fourth-largest economy in the European Union. Its economy is thriving, and it has maintained significant business and economic ties with Israel which have been mutually beneficial but are now at risk due to the increasingly hostile stance in the country. 'Israel's frustration with Spain's recent conduct is understandable and justified, but now is the time to resume action, send an ambassador back to Madrid and take a firm and aggressive stance to counter the ongoing deterioration in relations. We must not lose Spain, and to prevent that, we need to operate at full capacity in the country,' sources said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by9mwjmar	2024-09-26T09:28:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/25/SkacwD1NC/SkacwD1NC_86_160_403_227_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu: war on Hezbollah to continue until objectives met	Prime minister speaks to reporters upon landing in New York ahead of his address to the UN General Assembly; Chief of staff says military waited years to deal blows to Hezbollah and succeeded in eliminating leaders, disrupting arms supplies and diminishing its capabilities Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that the fight against the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon would continue until the objective of returning Israelis to their homes in the north safely, is met. The prime minister spoke to reporters upon landing in New York before his address to the UN General Assembly on Friday. He said he approved the targeted strike on Beirut's Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, that killed the terror group's head of aerial forces, Mohammed Srror, responsible for its drones, cruise missiles and gliders. According to Lebanese media, three missiles attacked a 10-story building located near the site of a previous strike that killed Hezbollah's senior military commander Ibrahim Aqil last week. Sources close to the negotiations said the prime minister backed away from 'quiet understandings' reached earlier that he would accept the international efforts to stop the fighting. The United States and France along with other European nations, were pressing for a cease-fire in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. A 21-day truce was said to be imminent earlier on Thursday, but Netanyahu's office said in a statement while the prime minister was still en route to New York, claiming he had not agreed to any lull in the fighting. Lebanon's LBCI Network said Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer informed U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein that Israel would continue the war on Hezbollah and would reject the proposed cease-fire. According to the report, the U.S. and France would continue discussions with Israel while Qatar and Turkey were speaking with senior Iranian officials to reach some agreement. IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said earlier that the military had waited a long time for this opportunity to hit Hezbollah.

UK police investigating Islamophobic hack of Wi-Fi at train stati...	Wi-Fi remained offline on Thursday following the incident at 19 stations including London Bridge and London Euston as well as Manchester Piccadilly and Edinburgh Waverley British police said on Thursday they had launched an investigation into a cyberattack after passengers at the country's major railway stations saw an Islamophobic message when they tried to use Wi-Fi services. The Wi-Fi system, which is managed by communications group Telent, was quickly taken offline after passengers said a message was displayed, that referred to terror attacks. 'We received reports at around 5:03 p.m. (1603 GMT) yesterday (Sept. 25) of a cyberattack displaying Islamophobic messaging on some Network Rail Wi-Fi services,' British Transport Police said. Tensions in Britain flared over the summer with a wave of anti-Muslim riots across the country after the killing of three young girls, an attack which was initially falsely blamed on an Islamist migrant following online misinformation. The police said they were working with Network Rail to investigate the Islamophobic cyber security incident 'at pace'. Network Rail, the group that manages tracks and train hubs, said the Wi-Fi remained offline on Thursday following the incident at 19 stations including London Bridge and London Euston as well as Manchester Piccadilly and Edinburgh Waverley. Telent said in a statement that no personal data had been affected by the hack, adding the matter was now in the hands of the police. It said an unauthorized change had been made to the Network Rail landing page, provided by Global Reach, from a legitimate administrator account. 'As a precaution, Telent temporarily suspended all use of Global Reach services while verifying that no other Telent customers were impacted,' it added. Network Rail said it expected the Wifi service to be restored over the weekend once final security checks were completed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1vclyxrr	2024-09-26T07:10:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/BJvvPCf0C/BJvvPCf0C_0_103_1000_563_0_small.jpg
IDF uncovers terror tunnel in Jenin	Troops find unusual tunnel shaft in a residential home in the area lacking an exit point; military says its troops find no weapons or people inside but some suspects were being questioned The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Thursday reported forces operating in the West Bank city of Jenin located an unusual tunnel shaft located at inside a residential apartment. According to the military, troops will use 'various operational means,' to dismantle the tunnel. The IDF said that the shaft was discovered deep within a civilian area, some six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the West Bank barrier wall during an operation overnight Wednesday. 'The tunnel is dug two meters deep without an exit point and no weapons or suspects were found within,' the military said, noting the site is being monitored. Several suspects were arrested and being questioned. Ynet also learned that the military established a dedicated unit to investigate suspected shafts and tunnels found in the Wes Bank, especially near the border wall, but thus far no tunnels reaching Israeli settlements were found. During IDF raids on the Jenin refugee camps, however, several underground passageways were discovered. One tunnel was found earlier this year, leading from a mosque where armed terrorists were hiding to an apartment filled with explosives. The IDF Central Command said it was aware of terrorist organizations' attempts to build underground tunnels across the West Bank and is acting accordingly amid growing concerns from residents of Israeli communities located close by. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwktrzcc	2024-09-26T06:43:12-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/22/rJtaLkzzp/rJtaLkzzp_1_96_720_406_0_small.jpg

Rev. Franklin Graham delivers aid to Israel, all 'in Jesus’ name'	While in Israel to dedicate new ambulances to Magen David Adom, Graham - the son of the late Billy Graham - praised Trump's policies, calling them ‘good for America, good for the world, and also good for Israel’ Former U.S. President Donald Trump 'is a controversial person who has alienated many people,' Rev. Franklin Graham admitted last week during his visit to Israel. 'But I support him,' he added. At 72, Graham, president of Samaritan’s Purse, was in Israel to dedicate new life-saving ambulances to Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s national emergency medical service. Yet, with the U.S. election looming in less than two months, many wonder whether Trump will outpace Vice President Kamala Harris and reclaim the White House. Arguably America’s most prominent evangelist, Graham is the son of the late Billy Graham, famously known as 'America’s pastor' until he died in 2018. The elder Graham traveled the globe, spreading God’s word and earning the trust of presidents in various countries. The younger Graham has followed in his father’s footsteps and leads a Christian charity, delivering aid to war-torn areas from Ukraine to Israel, all 'in Jesus’ name.' During his visit to Israel Graham praised Trump’s policies, calling them 'good for America, good for the world, and also good for Israel.' According to Graham, Trump 'wants to fight terrorism and secure our borders – these are important for everyone.' Graham represents the evangelical base that helped elect Trump in 2016 and remains loyal to him. According to a Pew Research Center survey published earlier this month, most Christians across denominations continue to support Trump. This includes 82% of white evangelical Protestants, 61% of white Catholics, and 58% of white non-evangelical Protestants. 'Born Again' Christians like Graham comprise most U.S. Protestants. In appreciation for their support, Trump when president enacted policies aligning with his evangelical base’s beliefs and values. Notably, he appointed conservative Supreme Court justices who, in 2022, played a pivotal role in overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. Additionally, he signed an executive order on free speech and religious liberty. He introduced two federal rules allowing nonprofits and for-profit businesses to file religious or moral objections to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate under Obamacare, which requires coverage of contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs. Trump was the first president to speak at the March for Life and continues to open his rallies with prayers led by local church leaders. Despite rumored tensions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump’s strong pro-Israel stance is well-known. His administration is especially remembered in Israel for moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. When asked about whether Trump would support Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, Graham said it is 'hard to say' which policies will be prioritized if Trump is reelected. However, he noted that after surviving two assassination attempts, Trump might be weighing decisions differently, adding, 'I hope for the best.' Graham said that Trump would maintain 'a good relationship with whoever runs Israel because he loves Israel.' Love for Israel is also a fundamental part of Graham’s belief system. 'I believe Israel the nation and Israel the Jewish people are God’s chosen people. As Christians, we stand with Israel, we want to support Israel, and we do all that we can, especially in these times of great trouble,' he said. He added that 'the war is not over. It will take more time, and there will be even more need. As Christians, we believe the Bible and God’s word and want to stand with God’s people.' On Thursday, Graham visited the Gaza border community of Avshalom, where his organization dedicated two armored ambulances to MDA in memory of three American-Israelis murdered by Hamas: Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Roee and Smadar Idan. Goldberg-Polin was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival and survived 11 months in captivity. Earlier this month, he was executed by Hamas terrorists along with five other hostages. The Idans were murdered in their Kfar Aza home in front of their children on October 7. Their four-year-old daughter, Avigail, was kidnapped, while her older siblings survived by hiding in a closet for 12 hours. 'We are privileged to be in a position to help Magen David Adom with these ambulances,' Graham said. 'But it is also very sad, in the sense that these ambulances are dedicated to people who are no longer with us.' In addition to the ambulances, Graham laid the cornerstone for a new MDA dispatch station in Avshalom, which will significantly improve response times by Israeli paramedics and EMTs in future emergencies. 'The need is so great,' Graham said at the ceremony while pledging to provide 20 more armored vehicles to the organization. 'The MDA team are heroes, saving lives every day, and it is an honor to stand with them.' Samaritan’s Purse also supports Israel’s northern region by helping to establish a second dispatch center in Shlomi. So far, the organization has provided or committed to 42 rescue vehicles, including 28 armored ambulances and two dispatch stations. Fourteen of these ambulances are already in service, donated by the organization in January to replenish the fleet after Hamas targeted and destroyed rescue vehicles during the October attack. Additionally, Samaritan’s Purse has sent 1,000 trauma supply kits to Israel, packed with essential medical equipment such as chest tubes, sutures, intubation kits, and combat tourniquets. These supplies have been strategically placed with MDA first responders. 'The generosity of Reverend Franklin Graham and Samaritan’s Purse knows no bounds,' said MDA Director-General Eli Bin. 'The entire people of Israel are indebted to this great man and his organization.'

Terrorists who took part in the October 7 massacre eliminated	The IDF and the Shin Bet announced that warplanes, under the direction of the Shin Bet and the 215th Fire Brigade, killed in targeted strikes the commander of the Nukhba Force in Hamas, as well as a terrorist who took part in the October 7 attack. They were operating inside a command and control center embedded inside a compound that previously served as the 'al-Faluja' School in the northern Gaza Strip. The command and control center was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel. In addition, in the last day the forces of Division 162 killed about 15 terrorists in the Rafah area. It was also reported that the Air Force attacked in Rafah the terrorist Suleiman Jawad Suleiman Abu Lafi, who according to the IDF promoted transfers of IDF to the Gaza Strip and directed forces from Gaza to carry out attacks in the Gaza Strip. In the same attack, his brother Abdullah Abu Lafi, the islamic Jihadist terrorist, was also killed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjbet6gac	2024-09-26T05:04:37-07:00	
Shin Bet thwarts attack on Israelis visiting tombs of sages in no...	Basel Abahra, 23, from the Galilee village of Arraba, planned a coordinated shooting and explosives assault against Israeli pilgrims visiting the graves of revered figures; 'Particularly serious as they were to be carried out by Israeli citizens during wartime,' says Shin Bet official The Shin Bet and Israel Police announced Thursday they had thwarted a planned bombing and shooting attack orchestrated by a young man from the Galilee, with assistance from illegal Palestinian residents. In addition to this young man, two minors were also arrested, and indictments have been filed against all three. In a coordinated operation by the Shin Bet and the Northern District Police's Central Unit, 23-year-old Basel Abahra from Arraba in the Galilee was taken into custody on August 12. His interrogation revealed a plan for a combined attack involving explosives, followed by a shooting targeting Jews visiting the graves of Jewish sages in the Galilee region. In the months leading up to his arrest, Abahra sought help from Palestinians with expertise in explosives, who were staying in Israel without permits, to prepare the explosive devices while he conducted reconnaissance on potential targets. He also recruited two teenagers into the military cell he established; they were subsequently arrested and interrogated by the Shin Bet and the Northern District Police's Central Unit. The investigation led to the seizure of communication devices, a military vest and dual-use materials intended for making explosives. The cell's activities were disrupted in the early stages before they were ready to execute the attack. Additionally, Abahra's interrogation revealed that, at the start of the Gaza war, he had thrown Molotov cocktails at an access road near the community of Avtalyon, close to his home. On Sunday, the Haifa District Attorney's Office, represented by attorney Shikma Nachmias, filed an indictment against Abahra and the two involved minors, charging them with preparing an act of terror and manufacturing weapons. 'The aforementioned acts of terrorism are particularly serious as they were carried out by Israeli citizens during wartime,' the Shin Bet and the police said in a statement. 'We view any involvement of Israeli citizens in activities that endanger the security of the state and its citizens with great severity. We will continue to act within the authority granted to us by law and employ the measures available to us to thwart threats in a focused manner.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1en46ga0	2024-09-26T04:54:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/rJFmGnMRA/rJFmGnMRA_0_111_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu clarifies: 'Report of cease-fire incorrect; directed ID...	The IDF is attacking deep deep in Lebanon after massive rocket barrage to Acre; Prime Minister's Office responds to report that cease-fire in north expected 'in coming hours': 'We haven't reponded' After hours of silence, the Prime Minister's Office reacted to the proposal made by the United States and France for a 21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, and says that the Prime Minister 'as not even responded' to it. This announcement came after government ministers and residents and council heads in the north lashed out following news of an apparent imminent cease-fire. Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who is filling in for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he travels to the United States to address the UN General Assembly, wrote: 'There will be no cease-fire in the north. We will continue to fight against the terrorist organization Hezbollah with all our might until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' More than three hours after the report, and while Netanyahu was on the 'Wing of Zion' plane, a message was delivered from his office stating that 'The report about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the Prime Minister has not even responded to.' 'The report about the purported directive to ease up on the fighting in the north is the opposite of the truth,' the PMO also said in a message that was also posted on the prime minister's social media accounts. 'The Prime Minister has directed the IDF to continue fighting with full force, according to the plan that was presented to him. The fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the objectives of the war have been achieved.' The IDF, meanwhile, continued its attacks. An official announcement on Thursday morning from the IDF spokesman said that overnight the Israeli Air Force, directed by IDF intelligence, struck approximately 75 terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Bekaa and in southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities, ready-to-fire launchers, terrorists and terrorist infrastructure. At noon there were reports of attacks in Tzur, an attack on a vehicle in the village of Shoba, and fighter jets breaking the sound barrier over various areas in Lebanon, including over Beirut. At noon, there were also reports of an attack deep in the country, in Ba-Lava, north of Baalbek. Rocket alert sirens were heard in the Acre area at about 10:45 a.m., the first rockets to be fired in more than 12 hours. Some 45 rockets were launched in the heavy barrage, and dramatic footage shows a sequence of falls in the sea off the coast of Acre. Following the attack residents of the northern Golan, Upper Galilee and Krayot-Haifa Bay were ordered by the IDF Homefront Command to stay near protected areas. On Thursday morning an Israeli source told CNN that the talks regarding a potential temporary cease-fire with Hezbollah were the main reason for Netanyahu's flight to New York. He noted that the message in the briefings from Israel the previous day were that 'Israel prefers a diplomatic solution.' The spokesman for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, Majed Al-Ansari, said at the same time that 'there is still no official mediation path that works for a cease-fire in Lebanon. We are not aware of a direct connection between the proposal for a 21-day cease-fire in Lebanon and the proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1qw52ma0	2024-09-26T04:07:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/S1Rp1hzRC/S1Rp1hzRC_0_278_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
New York City mayor indicted in foreign bribery scandal, refuses ...	Eric Adams faces historic indictment for alleged ties to foreign entities from Turkey, China, Qatar and possible illegal donations from Israel; Adams denies accusations and refuses to step down; progressive Netanyahu critic could replace him New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on corruption charges by a federal grand jury, U.S. media reported late Wednesday. The specific details of the indictment have not yet been disclosed and may be revealed during a court hearing on Thursday. The charges come after a year-long investigation into allegations of corruption and ties to foreign entities, including Israel. The indictment has sent shockwaves through the city’s political landscape, as Adams becomes the first sitting mayor in New York’s history to face criminal charges while in office. Despite mounting calls for his resignation, including from within his own Democratic Party, Adams has refused to step down, asserting his innocence. In a video statement following news of the indictment, Adams described the accusations as 'entirely false, based on lies.' He added, 'I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit.' Adams also accused investigators of leaking details about the probe in an attempt to damage his credibility. The federal investigation that led to the indictment has focused on serious allegations of corruption and bribery involving foreign actors. Suspicions about Adams and his top aides first emerged last November, days after federal agents raided the home of his chief fundraiser, Brianna Suggs, seizing electronic devices. Shortly afterward, Adams’ own phone and iPad were confiscated as he left an event in Manhattan. In recent months, four parallel investigations have been conducted, with some focusing on Adams’ ties to foreign donors, particularly from Turkey. Allegations include campaign finance violations, bribery and potential undue influence in securing expedited approvals for the construction of a new Turkish consulate building in exchange for perks like first-class Turkish Airlines flights. Meanwhile, the FBI is also examining the possibility of illegal campaign contributions from Israel during Adams' 2021 mayoral run, as well as prohibited connections with other foreign governments, including China, Qatar, South Korea and Uzbekistan. AOC joins the resignation choir Federal investigations into New York City’s government reached a climax earlier this month when the FBI seized mobile phones belonging to top city officials, including Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright and Schools Chancellor David Banks, who resigned Wednesday. Banks’ resignation follows a series of high-profile departures linked to the ongoing investigations, further intensifying pressure on Mayor Adams to step down. Lisa Zornberg, the city’s chief legal counsel and a key member of Adams’ inner circle, also resigned. Another dramatic departure was that of NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, who stepped down after being questioned by the FBI over his twin brother’s involvement in nightclub businesses. Under state law, Adams is not required to resign even while facing serious criminal charges. The only official who could potentially remove him from office is New York Governor Kathy Hochul. However, sources in her office suggest that she is unlikely to turn against Adams, a close ally. A source close to Hochul’s office told Ynet that the situation is 'not like the Biden-Pelosi' dynamic, referencing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s pressure on President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race. They indicated that similar pressure is not expected from Hochul on Adams. However, Hochul’s office described the reports of Adams’ indictment as 'concerning' and said that the governor is monitoring the situation closely while holding off further comment until the matter is confirmed by law enforcement. Adams, 64, was elected mayor of New York City in 2021 and took office in January 2022, becoming the city’s second Black mayor. He entered politics after serving 22 years as an officer in the NYPD. Over the past year, his popularity has declined, despite improvements in certain crime statistics and a drop in unemployment. The city has struggled to manage a massive influx of tens of thousands of migrants overwhelming homeless shelters, and the corruption scandals have fueled calls for his resignation. Shortly before news of the indictment broke, progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined those calling for Adams to step down. She argued that the 'flood' of resignations in the city administration threatens its ability to function effectively and that the investigations would make it difficult for Adams to attract qualified individuals for key positions. 'For the good of the city, he should resign,' she said. Accused Netanyahu of 'war crimes': Adam's apparent successor Adams has been a vocal supporter of Israel, especially after the October 7 terror attacks. If he is forced to step down, the city's public advocate, Jumaane Williams, would assume the role temporarily. Williams, a progressive Democrat from Brooklyn, has been far more critical of Israel. Williams has frequently criticized Adams, accusing him of being overly supportive of Israel and condemning his refusal to call for a cease-fire in Gaza. He has also been outspoken against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, questioning why Netanyahu was given a platform to speak before Congress in July, despite what Williams described as 'international war crimes and human rights violations.' A shift in the city's leadership could directly impact Israeli interests in New York, raising concerns among the city’s large Jewish community as well as diplomatic and advocacy groups. Adams was scheduled to host world leaders, including Netanyahu, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Thursday evening during the United Nations General Assembly. However, following the news of the indictment, his participation in the event has been canceled. Despite refusing to resign, Adams is likely to face increasing public pressure in the coming days. While Governor Hochul is unlikely to remove her long-time ally from office, many speculate that Adams may eventually opt to leave Gracie Mansion on his own terms. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ly7hgr0	2024-09-26T03:58:45-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/06/22/BJZCc11SJ3O/BJZCc11SJ3O_0_80_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Residents of north say cease-fire is gift to Hezbollah	Local leaders up north say they won't accept insufficient agreements with Hezbollah before returning home, demanding decisive action from Netanyahu's government and commending the IDF for recent successes; This comes amid rumors that a cease-fire agreement could materialize by the end of the day Amid Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approval to hold talks with the U.S. about a temporary halt to strikes in Lebanon for cease-fire negotiations, northern border community leaders are expressing concern. They refuse to accept any 'exit points' for Hezbollah that might allow the terror organization to regroup. Instead, they have put their hopes on IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, who has stated that the IDF is ready to enter Lebanon to dismantle terrorist infrastructure, a fundamental condition for ensuring the safe return of northern residents. Hezbollah rockets strikes have damaged over half of the homes in Metula. Despite military assurances, Metula Mayor David Azoulay remains troubled by statements from 'political sources' in Netanyahu's office. 'I sincerely hope the Israeli government isn't stepping back again but continues to move forward,' he said. 'We've experienced this after the Majdal Shams event, the preemptive attack on Tel Aviv, and other instances where the military launched a strong operation only to return to a containment policy. We're tired of this policy and the expectation of retaliation every time we strike.' Azoulay emphasized that, post-October 7, Israel's deterrence has been significantly eroded, and now is the time to restore it. 'Deterrence isn't regained through a single operation but through sustained efforts to sever Iran's proxy arm in Lebanon completely. We won't tolerate a cycle of forward and backward steps anymore; we demand consistent progress,' he said. In both the security and political arenas, it's understood that the northern conflict will eventually conclude with a settlement with Hezbollah. The key question is what position of strength Israel will bring to these discussions and how proactive it will be in achieving an agreement before international demands to halt the conflict arise. 'We must persist without pause, advancing daily until Hezbollah says 'enough.' I believe international pressure from Americans, French, and Europeans will lead to an agreement, but it must be robust. It shouldn't rely on (UN Resolution) 1701 and must be enforced by the IDF, with every violation addressed. I doubt we've already hit 50% of Hezbollah's capabilities; maybe only 30%,' Azoulay added. On Tuesday, the IDF Chief of Staff announced that the offensive in Lebanon would be named Northern Arrows. The announcement of this as 'another operation' worried many, including local leaders, fearing the military isn't aiming for a comprehensive campaign. IDF sources clarified that the operation is part of the broader campaign to restore security to the north, but noted that all aspects depend on political decisions and guidance. Avichai Stern, mayor of Kiryat Shmona, noted that after a year of attrition and displacement residents demand a war to bring them home. 'In 2006, it was a war, and they didn't finish the job. Certainly, an 'operation' with some made-up name won't do the job. We pay the price, and from the IDF, we expect just one operation for the holidays – Operation 'One Plus One' – Gaza plus Lebanon or Nasrallah plus Sinwar.' On Tuesday, in a rocket barrage on Kiryat Shmona, Hezbollah launched about 50 missiles, causing direct hits and significant damage to residential homes and municipal emergency facilities. Stern said that, in the past two weeks, 'the IDF has operated brilliantly, and we express gratitude and appreciation. The army has demonstrated its capability to surprise, initiate, destroy, and strike – these capabilities must continue in the war.' With the mobilization of two reserve combat brigades in anticipation of expanding the conflict and the recent deployment of numerous artillery units, the possibility of a ground invasion seems real. However, northern leaders aren't rushing to demand it just yet. Azoulay noted that he doesn't believe it's time for a ground operation in southern Lebanon. 'Once the Dahiyeh district falls, Nasrallah will capitulate. We should also target their airport in Beirut and power station; the Lebanese government should pay for this. Why aren't we destroying their drug fields? Brute force is the only language they understand.' 'If Hezbollah agrees to cease-fire now, it will undoubtedly end in certain massacre' Meanwhile, the Fighting for the North organization headquarters contacted Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, warning that residents won't settle for mere declarations of 'restoring security' or 'a sense of security.' The headquarters, which includes hundreds of evacuated families from the north, expressed appreciation for the IDF's actions against Hezbollah, alongside the decision to include the northern campaign in the military's war objectives, but stated that isolated operational moves are insufficient. 'We are more apprehensive than ever that soon we'll be told to return home after Israel reaches international understandings regarding the northern front,' they wrote. 'We declare that if the war is stopped prematurely, without a ground incursion and clearing the area, restoring security to the north, we will not return.' Rafael Slav, a leader of the headquarters, told Ynet: 'I see various former generals discussing the possibility of giving Hezbollah an 'exit point,' as if our lives are their investment portfolios. If Hezbollah agrees to a cease-fire now, before all its capabilities are destroyed, it will certainly end in a massacre as soon as they are able to execute it.' He added: 'We must not seek escalation to reach an agreement. We cannot return to our homes without an absolute buffer zone devoid of residents, certainly without Hezbollah.' Lobby 1701 stated: 'In the past week, the IDF has been attacking Lebanon with strength and sophistication. The government has finally made the return of residents home a part of the war objectives. But, as usual, when the enemy suffers, they run to plead with the French and Americans, who in turn pressure for a resolution. We've seen this scenario before. It won't happen again. We hear voices in television news studios starting to calculate whether the war is economically worthwhile, instead of asking how to repopulate the Galilee. This opportunity to continue striking the enemy must not be missed. There are no more pagers. Tens of thousands of northern residents have been evacuated from their homes for a year, and tens of thousands more live in a war zone, with hundreds of thousands joining this week. This must not be in vain. We must not return to October 6. We must not stop.' Meanwhile, Minister for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev and the Galilee Yitzhak Wasserlauf, of the Otzma Yehudit party, posted on his X account: 'Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister, I am now in the north. Another long day with the incredible and dedicated local leaders here. Just today I sat with sixteen of them. and I am informing you about their consensus: without a significant military decision against Hezbollah there is no point in discussing the return of northern residents to their homes. No one believes in agreements with terror. The State of Israel has learned this the hard way. Northern residents will no longer live under Hezbollah's sights. Now is the opportunity to vanquish Hezbollah.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjvhyfzrr	2024-09-26T01:28:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/rklzz4FbCC/rklzz4FbCC_0_214_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Moroccan immigrant, previously slated for deportation, murders 19...	The body of a 19-year-old student was located in the woods near her dorm and, following a manhunt, the suspect was apprehended in Switzerland, a Moroccan immigrant with a previous rape charge on his record, Incident has sparked debate in France about immigration and enforcement policy In response to the murder of a 19-year-old student, allegedly by a Moroccan immigrant slated for deportation, France's new right-wing Interior Minister has vowed decisive state action. The suspect, who reportedly abandoned the victim's body in a forest before fleeing to Switzerland, has been apprehended. Previously convicted of rape, the immigrant recently faced a deportation order from French authorities. The French media has identified the student only by her first name, Philippine. Her murder has ignited public outrage, intensifying pressure on the newly formed government and fueling demands for stricter immigration controls. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau described the crime as 'heinous' and committed to strengthening legislation to expedite the deportation of foreigners convicted of crimes. EU data shows France leads in expelling non-European nationals among member states, yet the sheer volume of deportation orders challenges enforcement. Addressing political leaders, Retailleau emphasized the need to enhance legal measures to safeguard France, advocating for legislative changes if necessary. Philippine was last seen on Friday at Paris-Dauphine University in the capital's western region. Her body was discovered on Saturday in a nearby forest. Witnesses reported seeing a man with a shovel. The 22-year-old Moroccan suspect was captured in Geneva and extradited to France. French prosecutors revealed the suspect was convicted in 2021 for a rape committed as a minor two years earlier. After serving his sentence, he was placed in administrative detention. A judge ordered his release in early September, conditional on regular contact with authorities and residency at a designated hostel. Days before the murder, he violated these conditions and went missing, prompting the state to issue a deportation order. The student's murder has sparked widespread debate in France, with politicians from both the far-right and the left urging a review of immigration policies. Former President François Hollande, representing the left, called for swift enforcement of deportation orders. Jordan Bardella, leader of the far-right National Rally party, said that 'Philippine's life was taken by a Moroccan immigrant under a deportation order.' Bardella's party, alongside Marine Le Pen's, holds the largest parliamentary presence but has yet to form a government. Bardella criticized the judicial system as weak and the state as dysfunctional, accusing leaders of placing French citizens in peril. He urged the government to take action, warning of the growing anger among perceived enemies. To facilitate the establishment of a right-wing government while maintaining political influence, Le Pen's National Rally party has opted to 'tactically support' Michel Barnier's new administration. They cautioned that the government's fate hinges on their support, reserving the right to withdraw if immigration and other critical issues are not adequately addressed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvl7ofr0	2024-09-25T23:58:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/r1p7ScbC0/r1p7ScbC0_0_129_981_553_0_small.jpg

Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire expected 'in coming hours'	Despite Israeli insistence that strikes on Lebanon will continue, report in Sky News says 21-day cease-fire set to take effect soon; Prime minister's office has not responded to report Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during security consultation that preceded the cabinet meeting late Wednesday night that 'negotiations will only be under fire,' but Thursday morning Sky News reported citing senior officials in the Biden administration that the cease-fire with Hezbollah is expected to come into effect in the coming hours. The Prime Minister is currently flying to New York, where he will speak at the United Nations on Friday, and his office has yet to respond to the report. The U.S. officials indicated that the ceasefire will last 21 days, as called for overnight in a statement by U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, which was also joined by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. As of 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, no rocket alert sirens were heard in the north. The IDF, meanwhile, continued its attacks in Lebanon. 'During these 21 days, the parties will hold negotiations. We hope for a solution that will return the citizens of both countries to their homes,' a U.S. official said. He added that 'the agreement will only be valid in Lebanon, but it will also buy time for negotiations with Hamas in Gaza. A diplomatic solution can be achieved.' The report led to stormy reactions in the political system. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that 'the campaign in the north should end in one scenario - crushing Hezbollah and denying its ability to harm the residents of the north. We must not give time to the enemy to recover from the severe blows it has received and to reorganize for the continuation of the war after 21 days. Surrender of Hezbollah or war, this is the only way we will restore the residents and security to the north and the country.' Minister Orit Struck also attacked: 'There is no moral mandate for a cease-fire. Neither for 21 days nor for 21 hours. Hezbollah turned Lebanon into a barrel of explosives. UN Resolution 1701 turned the residents of the north into hostages, and exiles in their own country. We do not repeat past mistakes. We won't stop until it is fixed.' Minister of Culture and Sports Miki Zohar added that 'the cease-fire without any significant return on the part of Hezbollah is a serious error that endangers Israel's major security achievements in recent days. I really hope that the reports are not true, we must continue with all our might until a clear decision is made in the north.' Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said: 'So now suddenly the world is pushing for a cease-fire with Hezbollah. It just doesn't work that way. Israel reacted very late and began to gradually destroy Hezbollah. So suddenly, the world decides that now is the time for a cease-fire? Israel must remove Hezbollah as a threat to our families. If Hezbollah wants the fire to stop, let it disarm and move 15 km away from the Israeli border.' In contrast to these words, opposition leader Yair Lapid said that Israel 'should announce this morning that it accepts the Biden-Macron cease-fire proposal, but only for seven days, in order not to allow Hezbollah to restore its command and control systems. We will not accept any proposal that does not include removing Hezbollah from our northern border.' U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement overnight between Wednesday and Thursday calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah. ''It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes,' the statement reads. 'We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.' Senior White House officials hinted that Israel and Lebanon were familiar with the agreement, and even endorse it. A senior White House official said that the statement was coordinated with the Israeli and Lebanese governments and that they could endorse it in the coming hours. 'This is a breakthrough, we will try to use the time to make achievements on all fronts, including Gaza.,' he said. The official added that 21 days is a long enough period to allow practical contacts to reach a 'very complex agreement. It's not some magic formula, but we thought it fit. We have held talks in recent months and we hope to use these 21 days to reach a permanent agreement that will allow citizens to return to their homes, that is the goal.' The cease-fire will be along the blue line dividing Lebanon from Israel approved by the UN in 2000 for the purpose of determining whether Israel had fully withdrawn from Lebanon; During the cease-fire the parties would discuss a comprehensive agreement that will allow civilians to return to their homes in both Israel and Lebanon, according to the official. 'This is a great effort that has been made during the last 48 hours. The president and his advisers have dealt with this with countries around the world. Lebanon and Israel have worked tirelessly to reach this moment and we value their cooperation,' according to the official. U.S. officials said Hezbollah would not be a signatory to the cease-fire but believed the Lebanese government would coordinate its acceptance with the group, and that once it is approved by LEbanon it would be understood that Hezbollah is involved. They said they expected Israel to 'welcome' the proposal and perhaps formally accept it when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the General Assembly on Friday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk88cum00	2024-09-25T23:42:55-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/SyvoiuRT0/SyvoiuRT0_242_386_2753_1549_0_small.jpg

Hamas to cede civilian control of Gaza to Palestinian Authority, ...	A day after PA prime minister said that the PA would manage Gaza after the war with the participation of 'everyone,' a Hamas official said that the terrorist organization had reached an agreement with Fatah; They are expected to meet next week, in Cairo Hamas may have just given up civilian control in the Gaza Strip. Almost a year after the October 7 massacre and the outbreak of war, a Hamas official told the Saudi network Al-Hadath on Thursday that the terrorist organization that controls Gaza has reached an agreement that would make the Fatah party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas responsible for the civil management of the Strip, and the crossings. According to the same source, these will not be under the supervision of Hamas. The meeting between Fatah and Hamas leaders where this agreement is supposed to be signed is expected to take place next week. On Wednesday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said that this meeting is expected to take place in Cairo, noting that the PA will manage the Gaza Strip after the war with the participation of 'everyone.' The previous meetings between the Palestinian factions were held in China, and ended with the Beijing Declaration on July 23, in which it was agreed to reach 'total national unity,' including all the forces within the PLO, and to form a temporary national consensus. A senior official in the Palestinian Authority responded to the report and downplayed the possibility of an agreement. He told Ynet that 'the PA manages civil affairs in the Gaza Strip anyway - education, health, the water and energy authority. For Hamas, this is a headache, so it will hand it over to the PA in order to continue to control security and military. Hamas understands that Israel will not give up control of the crossings from a security point of view, so it will let the PA face Israel. We will wait and see what happens at the meeting in Cairo, but there are not too many expectations for an agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byb3fofra	2024-09-25T23:17:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/27/ryrSJfEiUA/ryrSJfEiUA_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

U.S. and France issue a statement, joined by several other countries, calling for stop to hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah ' to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement'; Calls on parties to 'endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately' U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement overnight between Wednesday and Thursday calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah. ''It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes,' the statement reads. 'We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.' Senior White House officials hinted that Israel and Lebanon were familiar with the agreement, and even endorse it. As of 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, no rocket alert sirens were heard in the north. The IDF, meanwhile, continued its attacks in Lebanon. 'The exchange of fire since October 7th, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians,' the statement continues. 'We therefore have worked together in recent days on a joint call for a temporary ceasefire to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid further escalations across the border.' The statement is endorsed by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. 'The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation. This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon,' according to a statement signed by all of the countries. 'It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety. Diplomacy however cannot succeed amid an escalation of this conflict. 'Thus we call for an immediate 21 day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement consistent with UNSCR 1701, and the implementation of UNSCR 2735 regarding a cease-fire in Gaza,' according to the statement. It concludes: 'We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately consistent with UNSCR 1701 during this period, and to give a real chance to a diplomatic settlement. We are then prepared to fully support all diplomatic efforts to conclude an agreement between Lebanon and Israel within this period, building on efforts over the last months, that ends this crisis altogether.' A senior White House official said that the statement was coordinated with the Israeli and Lebanese governments and that they could endorse it in the coming hours. 'This is a breakthrough, we will try to use the time to make achievements on all fronts, including Gaza.,' he said.

They said they expected Israel to 'welcome' the proposal and perhaps formally accept it when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the General Assembly on Friday. The White House said Wednesday night even before the joint statement, that Biden and Macron talked on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York about efforts to reach a cease-fire in Lebanon to avoid a wider regional war. The joint statement comes after Israel's political-security cabinet convened Wednesday night for about four hours at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv, against the backdrop of the possibility that the IDF will soon enter into a ground war in Lebanon as part of the Northern Arrows operation . After the discussion ended, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to the United States where he will speak At the UN General Assembly in New York without providing a statement before take off. The Pentagon said that it does not appear that the entry of IDF forces into Lebanon is likely to happen immediately despite the messages coming out of the IDF, and the Wall Street Journal cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that the IDF is not yet in a position to carry out a ground operation until it moves more soldiers to the north, but that the Pentagon believes that an Israeli ground operation could happen in the coming days. The IDF announced Wednesday afternoon that it will mobilize two reserve brigades of combined infantry and tanks for operational missions in the north. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1spjvgcc	2024-09-25T22:00:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/08/BJeiD7ezrA/BJeiD7ezrA_1_80_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Haredi draft dodgers on collision course with IDF, face possible ...	In a first, Haredi youth who refuse to report for IDF enlistment after receiving a personalized draft order will face sanctions, which could result in jail time; IDF spokesperson: 'Those who do not report are committing an offense of absence without leave' Young ultra-Orthodox men in Israel who failed to respond to military draft orders were issued warning calls on Wednesday. These calls informed them that they must report to recruitment offices within 48 hours or face potential arrest warrants. This marks a shift as the military now considers employing sanctions and legal measures against those who do not comply. An ultra-Orthodox worker who received an exemption due to his limited weekly yeshiva study hours, shared his experience with Ynet. 'I was contacted by the Haredi administration, and they informed me of two orders I had missed. I told them that, just as they have a commander who instructs them, my commander is the rabbi, and he advised me not to enlist. They insisted I report within 48 hours or face an arrest warrant,' he said. Another young man, Yair, explained: 'I received a call from the army's Haredi administration, telling me I have 48 hours to report, or legal proceedings will be initiated against me.' He expressed his frustration, over the incident. 'The ultra-Orthodox members of the Knesset are not assisting us, nor is the Yeshiva Committee providing any answers,' he said. In an attempt to broaden recruitment, the IDF has issued over 1,000 initial draft orders to young ultra-Orthodox men in recent months, yet only about 70 have reported to recruitment offices. Brigadier General Shay Tayeb, head of the IDF's Planning and Manpower Directorate, addressed the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee recently, acknowledging the low turnout following the initial orders. 'Those who did not respond to the first order have received a second. We also make phone calls to clarify that they can report at a more convenient date without demonstrations. If any do not report, the process will continue, and we expect the numbers to rise.' According to the law, failing to respond to a second order results in a third warning, followed by potential economic sanctions, arrests, and travel restrictions. Rabbi Moshe Hillel Hirsch, a prominent figure in the Degel HaTorah party, met with heads of ultra-Orthodox high schools this week. 'If yeshiva students who received orders are arrested, I will come to support them in prison.' Rabbi Dov Landau, leader of the Lithuanian stream, also announced his support for those who do not enlist, even if they face arrest. 'Judicial authorities have declared war against the Torah world and are forcing the army to issue draft orders to yeshiva students. We publicly declare that under no circumstances should anyone report to the recruitment offices, and we stand with these yeshiva students and their families during this trial. We are with you, heroes of valor,' he said. The IDF spokesperson's unit responded. 'Those designated for security service who were summoned for recruitment and did not report are committing an offense of absence without leave, will be declared draft dodgers, and are subject to enforcement proceedings according to the law.' It is important to note that as part of the enforcement process, a draftee may be arrested, and their departure from the country could be delayed,' the unit said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skvl02wrc	2024-09-25T15:39:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/04/17/Bkw3g005Gh/Bkw3g005Gh_0_182_1024_577_0_small.jpg

New US forces for Middle East may aid evacuation, if needed	The new U.S. deployment of a small number of troops to the Middle East announced earlier this week could help the U.S. military prepare for scenarios including an evacuation of Americans from Lebanon, two U.S. officials told Reuters. Officials say the move is precautionary and comes as President Joe Biden warns of the risk of all-out war and as Israel openly talks about a possible ground incursion into southern Lebanon. While Washington has urged U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon, the U.S. State Department has not ordered an evacuation of U.S. personnel from Lebanon nor requested any assistance so far from the U.S. military to evacuate Americans from the country, U.S. officials say. But close U.S. ally Britain announced on Wednesday it was moving troops to Cyprus in position to help evacuate nationals trapped in Lebanon. The additional U.S. forces deploying to the Middle East are also headed to Cyprus, the officials say, and number in the dozens.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00przmc0	2024-09-25T15:28:38-07:00

This is the missile Hezbollah used to target Tel Aviv area	Hezbollah's Qader 1 missile, with a 118-mile range and 1,100-lbs. warhead, was intercepted by Israel's David's Sling system; The launch triggered sirens across central Israeli cities; 'Hezbollah attempted to send a message' Hezbollah has unveiled a video showcasing the features of the Qader 1 surface -to-surface ballistic missile – the first of its kind to be launched from Lebanese soil toward central Israeli cities. The David's Sling aerial defense system intercepted the missile, resulting in no casualties or damage. According to the Shiite terrorist organization in its video released on Wednesday evening, this surface-to-surface missile boasts a range of 118 miles. The missile's total weight is 2.87 tons, with a warhead weighing 1,100 lbs. Hezbollah claims that it is a tactical ballistic missile with high destructive capability, capable of maneuvering mid-flight and striking targets with precision. At 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, sirens echoed through Tel Aviv, Glilot, Ramat Gan, Netanya and other central Israeli cities. Shortly after, the missile launched from Lebanon was intercepted. About half an hour following the launch, the Home Front Command confirmed there were no changes in directives for the center o9f the country, and schools in areas where sirens sounded would operate as usual. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the launch, stating in their announcement that a Qader 1 ballistic missile was fired at the Mossad headquarters – the site allegedly responsible for the explosion of Hezbollah beepers and communication devices, as well as the elimination of senior terror organization members. The Saudi television channel Al-Hadath reported, based on its sources, that 'Hezbollah attempted to send a message by launching a single ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. The launch occurred simultaneously with an attack on October 7,' meaning at 6:29 a.m. Residents of Netanya have grown accustomed to a life without sirens. The last time an alert was activated in the city was during Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. However, on Wednesday morning, residents were startled by sirens echoing through the city, waking many at an early hour. 'I woke up in a panic and ran with the kids to the shelter,' shared Michal Nechmani, a resident of the city's southern neighborhoods. 'Since the war started, we haven’t had a siren, so we were calm, thinking it wouldn’t reach us. People always joked that Hamas and Hezbollah are afraid of people in Netanya. This morning we realized that’s not the case. There were moments of fear, but we quickly understood there were no casualties, and they were holding school – so we returned to our routine.' Meanwhile, social media platforms were flooded with posts and humorous remarks. 'The Netanya municipality has asked residents not to get involved. This is between the IDF and Hezbollah,' read one post. 'I don't understand where Nasrallah got the nerve to shoot at Netanya,' another post quipped, along with a sarcastic message to criminal elements: 'So, what are we paying you such high protection fees for?' Also on Wednesday, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, operating under the moniker Islamic Resistance in Iraq, published footage of the launch of the two UAVs aimed at Eilat. One of them exploded in the city's port, causing minor injuries to two residents, and the other was intercepted by the Israeli Navy in the skies over the Red Sea. According to sources identified with the militias, the UAVs that were launched are of the Iranian model Shahed 131, a model that is also used by Russia in its attacks on Ukraine. According to reports, this is an attack UAV manufactured by Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Its weight reaches 135 kg, its length is 2.6 meters and its wingspan is 2.2 meters. The warhead of the UAV weighs 15 kg, and it is claimed that it can reach ranges of 900 to 1,000 km. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry3cgzgra	2024-09-25T15:17:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/Bk1LN1zRC/Bk1LN1zRC_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

They added: 'Delays in equipment that Israel requires to win its multi-front war against Iran's terrorist proxies, plus statements by senior administration officials accusing Israel of escalation, undermine Israel's efforts to restore deterrence by encouraging Iranian-backed terrorists.'

Terror groups intensify efforts to target Israelis, Jews travelin...	National Security Council warns that elevated motivation and 'atmosphere of hatred' across the globe significantly increases the risk of attacks by lone-wolf assailants or organized terror cells targeting Israelis or Jews around the world The National Security Council (NSC) issued on Wednesday a public update on terror threats targeting Israelis and Jews traveling abroad ahead of upcoming High Holiday season, warning of heightened efforts to harm Israelis or Jews on October 7, marking the anniversary of Hamas’ deadly terror attack. 'We expect October 7, 2024, (the one-year anniversary of the Swords of Iron War) to be a significant date for terrorist organizations (and in particular Hamas and Global Jihad factions). Around that time, efforts to carry out attacks against Israeli/Jewish targets abroad are expected to intensify, both in planned attacks and in local initiatives or lone-wolf attacks.,' the NCS said in a statement. The NSC noted a sharp rise in motivation and attempts by terror groups to target Israeli or Jewish sites worldwide since October 7, 2023, citing a series of recent attacks and attempted attacks over the past year, as well as numerous threats of revenge from Iran. The statement also emphasized that the Sinai Peninsula remains a high-risk area due to its popularity among Israeli tourists, despite the significant terror threat there. The NSC reiterated that a Level 4 travel advisory remains in effect for Sinai, warning against any travel to the region. The NSC highlighted the elevated motivation of various terror groups (including Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and global jihadist factions) alongside the growing 'atmosphere of hatred' against Israelis and Jews due to the ongoing war. This, they noted, significantly increases the risk of attacks by lone-wolf assailants or organized terror cells targeting Israelis or Jews abroad. The NSC issued the following recommendations: 'We wish to emphasize the dangers of sharing or posting on social media (Facebook, Telegram, WhatsApp, TikTok, etc.) anything that could identify you as being a member of or active in Israel's security forces (be it regular service, standing army or as a reservist). Sharing any such information increases the risk that the person who shared it or is depicted in it will be marked as a target for attack.' 'We also wish to underscore the possible danger of being lured and kidnapped. We ask that you be wary of anyone unfamiliar who tries to make any type of contact with you, especially online and for those who do most of their business abroad. We stress the importance of refraining from travel to the following countries, in light of the real life-threatening danger facing Israelis in these places: Iraq (including the Kurdish region), Yemen, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia (restricted by law), Bangladesh, Somalia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya, Algeria, Jordan, Egypt (including the Sinai Peninsula) and Turkey. 'To clarify, if you are concerned that you have been exposed to a terrorist threat while abroad, you must first inform the local security forces in the country where you are staying and then contact the NSC's Travel Warning 24/7 hotline, at +972-2-6667444.' 'For updates or if you have questions relating to terrorist threats against Israelis, please contact the NSC's Travel Warning 24/7 hotline, at +972-2-6667444. For other matters, such as health services, consular issues, crimes related to personal security, or antisemitism, please contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 24/7 hotline, at +972-2-5303155.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ggq6bar	2024-09-25T11:47:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/01/16/rJVYvcXYa/rJVYvcXYa_1_174_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Brandeis University president, who banned campus Palestinian grou...	Ronald Liebowitz resigned after a narrow no confidence vote from the university's faculty; He was criticized for 'a consistent pattern of damaging errors of judgment and poor leadership' Brandeis University President Ronald Liebowitz resigned on Wednesday following a narrow no confidence vote from the university's faculty. In a letter addressed to the Brandeis community, Liebowitz confirmed his decision to step down, effective November 1. The faculty vote, passing by a margin of just 10 votes – 159 in favor to 149 against, with 26 abstentions – criticized Liebowitz for 'a consistent pattern of damaging errors of judgment and poor leadership.' Liebowitz, who had earned widespread attention for his staunch opposition to antisemitism following the Hamas attacks of October 7, found himself at the center of growing tensions on campus. His decision to ban the group Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) after the attack drew sharp reactions, with some praising his firm stance, while others accused him of overreach. This controversy, along with ongoing budget shortfalls, layoffs and fundraising struggles, ultimately led to frustration within the university’s faculty and administration. The faculty's resolution cited multiple grievances, including what they described as excessive responses to student protests, mismanagement of the university's financial challenges and indifference toward faculty concerns. A draft of the resolution, published by the Brandeis student newspaper earlier this month, summarized a litany of issues, ranging from budgetary missteps to staff layoffs that had shaken the university community. Liebowitz, in his role as president, had made Brandeis the first private university to ban SJP in the wake of the Hamas attacks. He stood by this decision despite criticism from certain quarters, arguing that free speech should not be a cover for hate speech or extremism. 'SJP was acting as a mouthpiece for Hamas, which has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S.', he explained in February. While Liebowitz’s strong position on antisemitism resonated with many, it unfolded against a backdrop of deeper issues at Brandeis. The university has faced significant financial challenges, including a $2 million budget deficit for the upcoming academic year. Graduate student enrollment has dropped by nearly 25% over the last five years, contributing to a need for budget cuts, including the elimination of 60 staff positions earlier this year. In his resignation email, he expressed 'mixed emotions,' praising Brandeis as 'an exceptional institution' and highlighting the significance of its founding principles, particularly in light of the university’s historical connection to Jewish values and identity. He will assume the role of president emeritus. Board Chair Lisa Kranc, in her message to the Brandeis community, thanked Liebowitz for his leadership and dedication to the university’s Jewish roots. She acknowledged his efforts to elevate these values, writing, 'He has continually reminded us that we are animated by Jewish values and identity, including a reverence for knowledge, a commitment to repairing the world, and openness to all.' While Liebowitz’s departure marks the end of a tumultuous period for Brandeis, Arthur Levine, a former president of Teachers College at Columbia University, will step in as interim president. Whether the new leadership can stabilize the university’s administration and restore harmony remains to be seen. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skuc00t110r	2024-09-25T11:33:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/S1yRBCZC0/S1yRBCZC0_0_0_960_640_0_small.jpg
Drone slams into Eilat port, injuring 2	A second UAV was intercepted by the Israeli Navy; News network with ties to Hezbollah claims militias in Iraq responsible A drone that approached the southern Israeli city of Eilat from the east on Wednesday night slammed into the Eilat port, injuring two people. Police officers and police sappers were working to isolate the scene of the crash. A second drone was intercepted by an Israeli Navy Sa’ar 5 class corvette missile ship, according to the IDF spokesman. Magen David Adom reported that two people sustained minor injuries at the scene, a 68-year-old who was hit by shards of glass, and another young man who was wounded and lightly injured. The Home Front Command confired that 'the incident is over.' The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an association of pro-Iranian militias, claimed responsibility for launching the drone attack against what it called a 'vital target' in Eilat. In addition, the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen news network, that has ties to Hezbollah, cited Iraqi sources as saying that the attack on Eilat was launched by militias in Iraq. In footage from the scene of the UAV impact in the port of Eilat, paniced voices are heard, and the man who took the video shows damage to the windshield of a truck, which was parked next to a building in the port that was also destroyed.

Families of 6 killed hostages send message to the people in power	Relatives of the 6 hostages murdered in a tunnel in Rafah publish an open letter in Time magazine accusing leaders and celebrities around the world of meeting with them, promising to take action – yet ultimately doing nothing The families of the six hostages who Hamas terrorists murdered in a tunnel in Rafah published an open letter in Time magazine on Wednesday, pointing the finger not only at Hamas, who kidnapped their loved ones, but also at others who failed to rescue them. 'On the clear, blue-skied Saturday morning of Oct. 7, 2023, our loved ones and 245 others were brutally stolen from us by Hamas terrorists. Carmel was visiting her parents at Kibbutz Be'eri. Almog, Alexander, Eden, Hersh and Ori had been celebrating peace and freedom at the Nova Music Festival. These six beautiful people were abducted into Gaza, several of them with critical injuries. They languished in miserable conditions for 328 days, then, on Aug. 29, were shot in the head, hands, shoulders and elsewhere in their battered and starving bodies,' it reads. 'Israeli forces found their emaciated corpses two days later in a tunnel 65 feet under a Gazan child's bedroom. The tunnel was just over two feet wide and 5 ft. 6 in. high. It had minimal oxygen, no light and no plumbing. Their Hamas captors executed our loved ones at point blank range, exited the tunnel, and shut a bolted door.' 'In captivity, Alexander, nearly six feet tall, dropped from 190 pounds to 132 pounds. Hersh, a couple inches taller, weighed just 116 pounds. Eden, 5-ft.-5, was found at 79 pounds,' the families wrote in their letter. The parents of the hostasges acknowledged that 'it was Hamas that took our loved ones, tortured them, and pulled the triggers that murdered them. But many others failed to save them. Israeli governmental decision-makers had opportunities to reach negotiated settlements to release our loved ones and, for calculations they deemed strategic, they chose not to. These choices will be the eternal legacy of these men. But there are so many other people who could have done so much more to save them-and still others who will join them as accomplices in avoidable deaths if they stand by and allow malevolent entities to triumph over the passive words of people with power.' They noted that for nearly over 10 months'many of us traveled the world and met politicians, diplomats, business titans, celebrities-people with power. They made promises, nodded, held our hands, cried with us, hugged us tightly...and then failed to deliver results.' They added that: 'Celebrities met us in secluded rooms but asked that we never acknowledge publicly that they did so; they feared losing followers. Leaders of humanitarian aid organizations, including the International Red Cross and the World Health Organization, claimed they would like to intervene but could not figure out how. Two Muslim clerics confidentially assured us, wrongly, that our loved ones would be okay because harming hostages violated Islam; but they and too many other religious leaders were publicly silent. More than one of these many people with power assured us that the hostages would survive, that their return was only a matter of time. Some said our loved ones were suffering but surely not dying.' The families questioned why the world's movers ad shakers have not pressed the cause of the hostages. 'Two hundred fifty-one hostages from 39 nationalities were stolen from their lives and from the world on Oct. 7. Why did the Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Foreign Ministers of those nations never stand, arm in arm, on a global stage and demand their release? Why are the names of the 101 hostages who remain in captivity not on the nightly news in countries around the world? Where is the global outcry calling for their release?' 'This is our clarion call now: There are still 101 hostages in horrific conditions in Gaza, and the time to save them is running out. Sympathetic words alone will not spare them the same fate as Almog, Alexander, Carmel, Eden, Hersh, and Ori. Now is the time for decisive, deliberate, meaningful action,' they wrote. The bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Uri Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov were found in a tunnel in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah. The hostages were murdered by their Hamas captors , after apparently fearing a possible rescue operation by the IDF that was operating in the area. The bodies of the six hostages were found on August 31. An IDF investigation revealed that a day before, Hamas observers had seen soldiers approaching the tunnel, and ordered the terrorists to murder the six hostages. The terrorists shot the six hostages execution-style at close range. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hygtxnwaa	2024-09-25T10:24:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/10/BkK8PApnA/BkK8PApnA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu signals willingness to discuss cease-fire deal with Hez...	Several sources have confirmed that behind-the-scenes negotiations are taking place to achieve a cease-fire deal with the Iranian proxy, which the Biden administration is pushing for in time for the November elections; Blinken: 'Israel will have some tough decisions to make' Amid ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, coupled with Northern Command Chief Major General Ori Gordin's threats to launch a ground offensive into Lebanon, international diplomatic efforts are intensifying to de-escalate tensions. The United States is spearheading efforts to lower the flames, although Washington acknowledges the limited influence of the Beirut government over Hezbollah. Concurrently, consultations are underway in Jerusalem to soon decide Israel's next steps in the conflict. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized negotiations, led by himself and Minister Ron Dermer, with the U.S. to consider a temporary cessation of attacks in Lebanon to facilitate cease-fire talks. Since the U.S. does not have direct communication with Hezbollah, negotiations on the opposite side are conducted indirectly through the Lebanese government and European entities, including the French. Simultaneously, Iran is also engaged in attempts to prevent a full-scale war. As an Israeli source noted, 'We are approaching a crossroads of decisions on the war's trajectory.' U.S. initiative links Gaza, Hezbollah conflicts The United States is spearheading a new diplomatic effort to end hostilities in both Gaza and Lebanon, linking the two conflicts as part of a single initiative, six sources familiar with the initiative told Reuters. Details are being hammered out at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, according to two Lebanese officials, two Western diplomats, a source familiar with Hezbollah's thinking and a source briefed on the talks. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during an NBC interview on Wednesday regarding the northern escalation: 'Israel has a real and legitimate problem. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, and what everyone wants is a safe environment where people can simply go home, and children can return to school. That’s what Israel is looking for. The best way to achieve that is not through war, not through escalation.' 'A diplomatic agreement, whereby forces withdraw from the border, creating a safe environment for people to return home, is what we are aiming for. While there is a legitimate issue here, we don’t believe war is the solution. That’s our focus now, including working with many partners here in New York at the UN General Assembly, the Arab world, Europeans, and others. It’s unlikely people will be able to return home if there’s a full-scale war,' Blinken said. When asked whether Israel should have provided the U.S. with advance notice about attempts to assassinate senior figures in Iran or about last week's operations, Blinken responded, 'It's always nice not to be surprised by someone’s actions; it’s certainly preferable.' 'Beyond our efforts to ensure that October 7 never repeats itself, and the attempt to ensure that civilians in Gaza – men, women, and children caught in Hamas’ terrible crossfire – are better protected and receive the help they need, we have also acted to prevent this war from spreading, escalating, and reaching other places. Ensuring that the situation in northern Israel and southern Lebanon does not escalate into a full-scale war is our current focus, and conversely, addressing the issue Israel faces,' he said. Regarding the potential for a cease-fire agreement with Hamas, Blinken remarked: 'We have a draft agreement with 18 paragraphs. Fifteen of those have been agreed upon between Hamas and Israel. However, in recent weeks, Hamas simply has not been at the table, unwilling to engage with the remaining issues, which, if resolved, would finalize the deal. Israel will also have some tough decisions to make in the end, so we need to consider that.' He said that President Joe Biden is determined to finalize the deal before his term ends. 'He knows what he wants to achieve. He is determined to utilize the remaining months as president to reach the finish line. Our message, my message to anyone who perceives the U.S. as weak or indecisive – President Biden is here until January 20. He will use every day to advance the national interest.' Meanwhile, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated the U.S. is 'very concerned' about reports of Hezbollah launching a missile at the Mossad headquarters this morning. However, Kirby noted Washington's belief that a diplomatic solution could reduce tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border. In a CNN interview, Kirby also highlighted: 'This again proves that Israel faces a legitimate threat from an Iran-backed terrorist organization. The U.S. continues to support Israel's right to defend itself. No nation should have to live with such threats just beyond its border, right next door.' Response in Lebanon In Lebanon, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri noted today that serious efforts are underway with international parties, including Americans, to halt what he terms 'the recent Israeli escalation against Lebanon.' In an interview with the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat published in London, Berri stated that the next 24 hours would determine whether diplomatic efforts have led to a political solution or failed. Berri was asked whether Hezbollah would be willing to separate the Gaza and Lebanon fronts, to which he replied that diplomatic efforts account for the inseparability of these arenas. The Lebanese official explained that those involved in de-escalation attempts are working on a solution based on proposals put forward by American envoy to the region, Amos Hochstein, even before the war in Gaza. Berri did not disclose the details of the solution but said it is the only feasible one. A senior Lebanese official and the source familiar with Hezbollah's thinking told Reuters that Hezbollah was 'open to any settlement that would include both Gaza and Lebanon.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s10rdsb0a	2024-09-25T09:46:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/S11100ACaa0/S11100ACaa0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF chief of staff views brigade exercise in north: 'We are not s...	Herzi Halevi rallies the troops on the border with Lebanon: 'You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah' IDF Chief of the General Staff, Liet. Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited the brigade exercise of the 7th Brigade at the northern border, and said that the IDF is preparing for a ground operation in Lebanon. 'You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah. Today, Hezbollah expanded its range of fire, and later today, they will receive a very strong response. Prepare yourselves,' Halevi said. Halevi made the visit along with the Commanding Officer of the Northern Command, the Commanding Officer of the 98th Division, the Commanding Officer of the Ground Forces Training Center, the Commanding Officer of the 7th Brigade and additional commanders. 'Today, we will continue, we are not stopping; we keep striking and hitting them everywhere. The goal is very clear—to safely return the residents of the north. To achieve that, we are preparing the process of a maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory, enter villages that Hezbollah has prepared as large military outposts, with underground infrastructure, staging points, and launchpads into our territory and carry out attacks on Israeli civilians,' Halevi said. 'Your entry into those areas with force, your encounter with Hezbollah operatives, will show them what it means to face a professional, highly skilled, and battle-experienced force. You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are. You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure. These are the things that will allow us to safely return the residents of the north afterward.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rker3ibaa	2024-09-25T09:18:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/r1boUAq11RA/r1boUAq11RA_21_0_1580_1057_0_small.jpg

Brandeis University President Ronald Liebowitz resigned following a vote of no confidence by the institution's academic staff, he announced in a letter sent to the university community Wednesday. The vote, which passed by a majority of 159-149, with 26 abstaining, included criticism of 'a consistent pattern of damaging errors of judgment and poor leadership.' The no-confidence measure was taken mainly due to his 'excessive' reaction against the pro-Palestinian student demonstrations on campus, along with other administrative failures such as problematic handling of the budget and firing of employees.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryh4zhwcr	2024-09-25T08:54:51-07:00	
National Security Council warns of terror attacks on Israelis abr...	The National Security Council on Wednesday published an update to the public on the terrorist threats against Israelis abroad ahead of the upcoming Jewish holidays. The announcement stated that, since the beginning of the war, and against the backdrop of threats by Iran and Hezbollah to harm Israelis, a sharp increase in the motivation to carry out terrorist attacks against Israelis and Jews around the world has been detected. The National Security Council said that October 7 is a 'significant landmark' for the terrorist organizations, when efforts to carry out attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets are expected to increase. In addition, the public is asked to be vigilant, and recommended not to post content on social media indicating service in the security forces or operational activity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b15hrjb00	2024-09-25T08:42:04-07:00	
Flooding in Thai hotel sends Israeli travelers scrambling for cov...	Hotel manager in the town of Pai wakes Israeli tourists in the middle of the night due to incoming floods; Israeli couple caught in hostilities in Ethiopia rescued by extraction team In the picturesque town of Pai in northern Thailand, what began as a peaceful evening quickly turned into a night of turmoil for dozens of Israeli tourists. Heavy rains had transformed the area into a flood zone, submerging hotels and bungalows under relentless waters. Among those affected was Yotam, who shared his experience with Ynet. 'It all started in the middle of the night,' he recounted. 'The manager woke us with urgent shouts as the porch was already overwhelmed by water. We immediately contacted Clal Insurance's emergency center, and they promptly dispatched a rescue team. Now we're in a safe hostel still within the Pai district, recovering from the ordeal but feeling relieved.' Floodwaters from the overflowing river forced the Israeli tourists to seek refuge on rooftops, where they were eventually rescued using ladders, ropes, boats and off-road vehicles. Dror Zesler, deputy CEO and head of Claims Division at Clal Insurance and Finance, explained. 'Upon learning of the situation, we immediately activated our rescue team to ensure the swift and safe evacuation of our insured clients.' Meanwhile, in the Horn of Africa Meanwhile, in a separate incident in Ethiopia, an Israeli couple's vacation took an unexpected turn when they found themselves embroiled in renewed hostilities in the town of Debark. Previously a site of conflict between the government and rebels, the area had enjoyed a period of calm until clashes resumed without warning. The couple, the only Israelis in the vicinity, became trapped in their inn as roads were blocked and fears grew about potential power and communication failures. Using satellite and cellular communication, they reached out to their families and the Magnus rescue team. An extraction team swiftly assessed the situation and plotted the safest evacuation route, relying on local contacts. On Saturday, two rescue teams navigated the precarious path to reach the couple, ensuring their safe transfer to a local airport, where they boarded a flight to safety, allowing them to continue their African adventure. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syon5qwcc	2024-09-25T08:35:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/H1WG11IYbA0/H1WG11IYbA0_1_705_720_406_0_small.jpg

Elon Musk said on Wednesday that he was not having an affair with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, replying to a joke after their mutual praise at a black-tie event in New York this week drew headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. Photographs of the two lit up social media after Musk presented Meloni with the Global Citizen Award from the Atlantic Council think tank on Monday. The New York Post called it a 'public love-in' between the world's richest man and the first female Italian prime minister. 'I was there with my Mom. There is no romantic relationship whatsoever with PM Meloni,' Musk wrote on X in response to a post of a photo of the two of them gazing fondly into each other's eyes at a banquet table, which had the jokey caption 'we all know what happened next.' In a speech before handing over the award, Musk said Meloni was 'someone who is even more beautiful inside than outside'. The Italian right-wing leader replied that the U.S. entrepreneur was a 'precious genius'. Meloni, who split from her long-time partner in 2023, requested that Musk be the person to hand her the award, while the tech businessman flew to Italy twice last year to meet the Italian leader -- in June and December.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryz11jjbr0	2024-09-25T08:24:36-07:00

The United States is deeply concerned by a report that Russia has a secret war drones project in China that appears to be an instance of a Chinese company providing lethal assistance to a U.S.-sanctioned Russian firm, a White House spokesperson said on Wednesday. The United States has not seen anything to suggest that the People's Republic of China (PRC) was aware of these transactions or that there has been any government involvement in providing lethal aid to Russia, said a spokesperson for the National Security Council (NSC). 'However, the PRC government also has a responsibility to ensure its companies are not providing lethal assistance,' the spokesperson said. Russia has established a weapons program in China to develop and produce long-range attack drones for use in the war against Ukraine, according to two sources from a European intelligence agency and documents reviewed by Reuters. The United States is prepared to take immediate action against the Chinese companies identified in the Reuters report as well as look into which banks facilitated the transactions with a sanctioned Russian entity, the spokesperson said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjilfj110c	2024-09-25T08:15:53-07:00

Return of barred nuclear inspectors to Iran unlikely	The U.N. nuclear watchdog has been pushing Iran to lift its ban of several uranium-enrichment inspectors from Iranian nuclear sites, but the IAEA chief told Reuters that success seems unlikely. n'Unfortunately this ship has sailed,' Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. The IAEA has strongly condemned the step taken by Iran a year ago as 'unprecedented' and called it a 'very serious blow' to its ability to carry out meaningful inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. Grossi is seeking a meeting in Iran next month with new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that he hopes will bring some movement to long-running standoffs between the IAEA and Iran on issues that include unexplained uranium traces found at undeclared sites and expanding monitoring of some activities. While a country is allowed to veto inspectors assigned to visit its nuclear facilities, the IAEA has said Iran went beyond normal practice.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkwmuib0r	2024-09-25T08:12:47-07:00

IDF mobilizing 2 reserve brigades to north signaling possible gro...	IDF announced mobilization of two reserve brigades of infantry and tanks, which could participate in a ground invasion in Lebanon; Political-security cabinet set to meet Wednesday night in the underground bunker of defense headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv The IDF announced Wednesday afternoon that it will mobilize two reserve brigades of combined infantry and tanks for operational missions in the north. The call-up comes as fighting in the Northern Arrows operation against Hezbollah on the northern border continues. The mobilization 'will enable the continuation of combat against the Hezbollah terrorist organization, the defense of the State of Israel, and create the conditions to enable the residents of northern Israel to return to their homes,' the IDF spokesperson's office said in a statement. Meanwhile, the political-security cabinet is set to meet Wednesday evening in the underground bunker of defense headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv. The mobilized reserve brigades are integrated armored-infantry brigades that have previously been mobilized in this war, and will return to increase the defensive operations in the Galilee Division, as well as participating in a ground invasion of Lebanon if one begins. Earlier on Wednesday Northern Command head Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin said Israel has 'entered a different stage of the campaign' and threatened a ground entry into Lebanon, after another morning with dozens of rockets launched in attacks on areas of northern Israel, and waves of Israel Air Force attacks from the air throughout Lebanon, including north and south of Beirut. 'We have entered another phase of the campaign. We must be fully prepared for a ground incursion and action,' Gordin said during a visit to the 7th Brigade's divisional exercise on the northern border, to assess the readiness of the commanders and soldiers. Gordin said that the Northern Arrows operation 'began with significant strikes on Hezbollah’s capabilities, focusing on their firepower and a severe blow to their commanders and personnel. In light of this, we need to change the security situation.' The political-security cabinet will meet Wednesday night, hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes off to the United States to give a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York . Netanyahu has postponed his trip again, and will only fly to the United States Thursday morning, instead of Wednesday evening. Before the cabinet meeting, he will hold limited consultations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will leave for his UN speech tomorrow (Thursday) instead of tonight, and will return on Saturday evening,' his office said in a statement. 'Throughout today, the Prime Minister will hold consultations with security officials in order to discuss the continuation of the attacks in Lebanon,' the statement also said. The announcement from Netanyahu's office came about an hour after Hezbollah expanded the circle of fire - and for the first time ever fired a missile from Lebanon into the center of the country . The IDF reported that one surface-to-surface missile was launched from Lebanon and, according to reports, it was aimed at the Camp Glilot intelligence military base, near Herzliya. Meanwhile, the IDF spokesman announced that Israeli Air Force fighter jets had completed attacks on 60 Hezbollah intelligence targets. The strikes destroyed surveillance equipment, command centers and other infrastructure used by the group for intelligence gathering, according to the military. The IDF spokesman also announced that, as part of the Northern Arrows operation against Hezbollah, about 280 targets in Lebanon were attacked during the day, including the launchers from which the rocket launches were carried out Wednesday morning toward Safed, Nahariya and the Jezreel Valley area. In addition, terrorists, ammunition depots and launchers ready for launch were also attacked, as well as military infrastructure of the terror organization. In addition, the IDF attacked ammunition depots and military infrastructure in the Nabatia region and other areas in the south of the country. The army is concentrating its efforts on attacks against the terrorist organization's intelligence infrastructure, as well as against long-range missiles. 'They have a lot to lose if Hezbollah increases the range of fire,' said a senior member of the General Staff yesterday. He added that 'the assassinations have an effect on Hezbollah's ability to command, which has been severely damaged.' The Lebanese Ministry of Health announced 23 dead and 95 wounded in Wednesday's attacks in Lebanon. The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that more than 95,000 displaced people have left southern Lebanon so far, after the expansion of Israeli attacks there. According to the report, the displaced are staying n schools that have been turned into shelters in Beirut, Mount Lebanon, the Sidon area, al-Baqaa, Baalbek, al-Harmel, Bekhar and in the north of the country. It was also reported that the internal security personnel who were supposed to operate according to the government's emergency plan did not show up, and that the displaced were left to their fate. Only 'social solidarity and civil initiatives' managed to alleviate the situation, the report said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h18riqb0r	2024-09-25T07:35:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/21/HJLpH9rZf6/HJLpH9rZf6_0_21_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Despite missile attack, Tel Aviv parents decide to send their children to schools despite many facilities not having designated safe zone Despite air raid sirens triggered by a Hezbollah missile from Lebanon on Wednesday morning, many Tel Aviv residents chose to continue their daily routines. Hadar, a local, told Ynet she did not hesitate to send her daughter to kindergarten, even though the facility lacks a designated safe zone. 'If there is a siren, I will come immediately to take her home,' she said. 'Routine is the best approach, in my opinion.' Hadar, who works as an assistant in municipal kindergartens, noted that there had been discussions among parents about whether educational institutions should remain open. She emphasized that the municipality is well-prepared, with educational centers distributed throughout the city. 'There was no hesitation or alternative guidance,' she added. Or, another Tel Aviv resident, admitted he woke up with 'difficult feelings' but also decided to take his children to kindergarten. 'It’s scary, but we trust the IDF,' he said. 'I considered whether to send the children, but in the end, I don’t know any parents who didn’t. Everyone sent their children and felt safe.' How do you mediate the sirens for children at such a young age? 'We tell them what’s appropriate. I tell them a nice story. I told the children that the siren is like a song for a two-year-old; when you hear it, you go downstairs. There’s not much else to say.' 'Israel is strong, even Tel Aviv can endure it' Doron Shnaper, Kiryat Shmona's spokesperson, commented on the unusual fire against the Tel Aviv metropolitan and said, 'Our reality in Kiryat Shmona is bleak, with rocket fire, sirens, and drones. Tuesday broke the record with 50 launches.' Doron Shnaper, a municipal spokesperson for the northern city of Kiryat Shmona, commented on the unprecedented attack on the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. 'Our reality in Kiryat Shmona is grim, with constant rocket fire, sirens and drones. Tuesday set a record with 50 launches,' he said. 'We have 24,000 affected residents. Israel is strong, and we need to resolve this with force. It’s time to crush Hezbollah. The residents of Kiryat Shmona will endure, and so can Tel Aviv. We love our country. We want the IDF to win and for us to return home.' In Netanya, a city north of Tel Aviv, city council member Avi Salama acknowledged that the recent sirens marked the first time since 2021 that the city had been targeted. 'There is no doubt it is unsettling. We lack sufficient safe zones in the city and schools, and these are fundamental issues that need addressing,' Salama said. 'Many residents are reaching out, and the municipality is seeking solutions, but we stand united behind the IDF.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj4sqv11ac	2024-09-25T05:25:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/S1oR4cxA0/S1oR4cxA0_0_147_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Senior Hezbollah official says many terrorists rendered unfit for combat due to explosions; new US report estimates Hezbollah’s strength at 40,000 to 50,000 members—around half of number previously claimed by Nasrallah Some 1,500 Hezbollah fighters have been disabled after their communication devices exploded en masse last week, with many losing their sight or suffering hand amputations from the blasts, a senior member of the Lebanese terrorist group told Reuters on Wednesday on condition of anonymity. Hezbollah published a list of casualties over the past week, following the explosions, reporting 37 deaths from various regions across Lebanon. These include the Bekaa Valley, the Dahieh district in Beirut, multiple locations in southern Lebanon and the Akkar region in the north. According to various Lebanese reports, around 3,000 people have been injured by the explosions. While Reuters noted that the incident represents a 'major blow' to Hezbollah, the disabled fighters represent only a small fraction of the group's total force, which, according to a recent report submitted to the U.S. Congress, numbers between 40,000 and 50,000 members. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had previously claimed the organization had 100,000 fighters. Three Hezbollah sources told Reuters that since October 7, the group has redeployed its fighters to 'frontline areas in the south,' including some who have returned to Lebanon from Syria. Additionally, Hezbollah has been rapidly moving more rockets into Lebanon in preparation for prolonged fighting. However, the sources emphasized that Hezbollah is seeking to avoid an all-out war. Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King's College London, said that while Hezbollah operations had been disrupted by the past week's attacks, the group's networked organizational structure helped make it an extremely resilient force. 'This is the most formidable enemy Israel has ever faced on the battlefield, not because of numbers and tech but in terms of resilience.' IDF strikes 100 Hezbollah targets and counting Amid reports of heavy losses for Hezbollah, Israel continued its extensive wave of airstrikes across southern and central Lebanon on Wednesday, with at least 10 people reported killed in the morning hours. By midday, the Israeli military said that its fighter jets had struck more than 100 targets in Lebanon, and the attacks were ongoing. In response, Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets and drones at northern Israeli communities, with one residential unit suffering a direct hit. Earlier in the day, Hezbollah fired a ballistic missile toward central Israel, triggering sirens in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area and the Sharon region. The missile was intercepted by the David’s Sling missile defense system. Saudi network Al Hadath reported that the target was the Glilot military base. Meanwhile, the pro-Hezbollah Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar reported that over 95,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon as a result of the intensified Israeli strikes. The displaced are reportedly sheltering in schools turned into temporary shelters across Beirut, Mount Lebanon, Sidon, the Bekaa Valley, Baalbek, Hermel, Akkar and northern Lebanon. The report added that internal security personnel, who were supposed to manage the situation according to the government's emergency plan, were absent, leaving the displaced to fend for themselves. Only 'social solidarity and civic initiatives' have managed to alleviate the situation, the report said. The newspaper also highlighted the economic impact of the displacement, noting that the influx of people into Beirut and its eastern suburbs has led to skyrocketing prices. The cost of bread has reportedly increased sixfold. In a separate article, Al Akhbar described severe congestion at border crossings into Syria from the Bekaa Valley and northern Lebanon, with thousands of people crossing daily. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkpyid11cr	2024-09-25T04:35:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/Bk9x11GDTR/Bk9x11GDTR_0_95_2500_1408_0_small.jpg

New faces in Tehran': Israeli academic meets Iran president at U...	Prof. Lior Sternfeld attends meeting in New York at invitation of Masoud Pezeshkian, touts ‘opportunity that shouldn’t be missed’ to ‘engage step by step’ with Tehran Israeli professor Lior Sternfeld, an expert on Iranian Jewry, met with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Despite laws prohibiting contact with officials from enemy states, Sternfeld informed Israeli authorities, who did not prevent the meeting. 'The president knew I was Israeli,' Sternfeld said, adding that he notified the UN delegation of his citizenship in advance, and his invitation was not rescinded. The meeting, conducted in Persian, was part of an 'Interfaith Dialogue' event, which also included American Jewish rabbis invited by the Iranian president. 'Are there new faces in Iran? The answer is yes,' Sternfeld said. Sternfeld, a historian teaching in the United States, noted that he was the only Israeli present. 'Nearly everyone had a chance to speak,' he said. 'President Pezeshkian responded to all at once. This is not a continuation of [former President Ibrahim] Raisi’s foreign policy; Pezeshkian spoke about renewing dialogue with the West. If Israel had leadership open to building a better future for the region, I believe there is a partner to work with. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.' The event focused on interfaith dialogue as a means of peacebuilding in the Middle East. Sternfeld emphasized the need for more than just dialogue, advocating for concrete steps to build working coalitions. He relayed Pezeshkian’s statement that if Israel and the Palestinians reached an agreement acceptable to most Palestinians, Iran would no longer carry the banner of resistance. Sternfeld urged Pezeshkian to reiterate this stance to a Western audience, suggesting it could positively impact perceptions of Iran. Sternfeld also referenced a past offer by Iran’s former foreign minister to help resolve the issue of hostages as a humanitarian gesture. When he asked Pezeshkian if Iran could assist with the current hostage situation, the president did not respond directly, instead saying it was now up to the West to take the next step in dialogue with Iran. 'He is a moderate and seeks dialogue,' Sternfeld said, describing the meeting as a significant opportunity for the West to engage with Iran. Although initially hesitant to accept the invitation, he ultimately decided that the chance to speak directly with Iran’s president was too important to pass up. Reflecting on the conversation, Sternfeld acknowledged that the war was a central theme, but Pezeshkian did not present a clear plan for ending the conflict. The professor highlighted the interconnectedness of the regional conflicts and emphasized the importance of initiating steps toward building trust. 'This is an opportunity that shouldn’t be missed,' Sternfeld said. 'We can’t wait for Iran to meet a list of demands before starting talks. We must seize this moment to engage step by step.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry8v25erc	2024-09-25T03:13:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/HknWLFxAA/HknWLFxAA_0_136_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Argentina’s Milei slams UN bias against Israel at General Assembl...	Pro-Israel leader criticizes organization for 'failure to defend democratic values,' while allowing 'bloody dictatorships' seats on Human Rights Council Argentine President Javier Milei delivered a sharp rebuke of the United Nations' policies toward Israel during his address to the General Assembly on Tuesday, condemning the organization for what he described as a double standard and failure to defend democratic values. Milei accused the UN of undermining Israel, calling it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, and criticized the body for not allowing Israel to protect itself against terrorism. He argued that the UN’s approach contradicts its founding principles of promoting peace and human rights. 'Israel is unjustly targeted while regimes that oppress their people are given a platform,' Milei said, highlighting what he sees as the UN’s selective criticism. During the assembly, Milei spoke with Israeli UN Ambassador Danny Danon. He also lambasted the organization for including 'bloody dictatorships' like Cuba and Venezuela on the Human Rights Council without holding them accountable, and allowing countries 'that punish their women just for showing their skin' to sit on committees dedicated to women's rights. Milei’s remarks come amid growing criticism of the UN's treatment of Israel and reflect his administration's pro-Israel stance. Since taking office in December, he has strengthened ties with Israel, and in July, Argentina designated Hamas as a terrorist organization, ordering the freezing of its financial assets following the group's attack on October 7. 'If the United Nations wants to return to the principles that led to its creation, it can count on Argentina’s full support,' Milei said. He concluded his speech with his signature catchphrase, 'Long live freedom, God damn it.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkkvtnzra	2024-09-25T02:52:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/21/Hk0K62tmR/Hk0K62tmR_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Dozens of rocket fired into northern Israel; Safed home takes dir...	IDF says some 40 rocketts fired in latest barrage, some intercepted by air defenses and one landing in Safed home; no casualties reported; Hezbollah says targeted IDF Northern Command headquarters The IDF reported that approximately 40 rockets were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel Wednesday morning, with some intercepted and one landing in a home in Safed. No casualties were reported. The army said that Hezbollah continues to target civilian areas and institutions in Israel’s rear, while the Israeli military is responding with strikes on Hezbollah’s terror sites and weapons depots. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it targeted the IDF Northern Command headquarters in Safed. Meanwhile, Saudi network Al Hadath reported on Wednesday that Israel scattered leaflets in the area of the village of Kahale in the Mount Lebanon region, near the Beirut-Damascus highway. According to the report, the leaflets called on residents of the village to evacuate within two hours. Earlier on Wednesday, air raid sirens blared in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area and the Sharon Planes early Wednesday following rocket fire from Lebanon, marking the first time that central Israel has come under attack from Israel's northern neighbor. The alarms sounded at 6:30 a.m. in cities including Tel Aviv, Glilot, Ramat Gan and Netanya, which experienced its first siren of the war. The attack came hours after the IDF struck a Hezbollah arms depot south of Beirut. The IDF confirmed a single surface-to-surface missile was launched from Lebanon and intercepted by the David’s Sling air defense system, with no reported casualties or damage. The army later said that it struck the launcher from which the missile was fired toward central Israel. Shortly after, the IDF resumed its strikes on southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah weapons depots and other military sites. Sirens also sounded in Zichron Yaakov, Yokneam Illit and several coastal towns south of Haifa. The IDF reported that five rockets were launched from Lebanon at the Carmel and Wadi Ara area in northern Israel. According to the army, some of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses, and at least one impact was reported. A hostile aircraft infiltration alert was also issued for the northern city of Tiberias. Saudi network Al Hadath reported that Hezbollah launched at least one missile toward the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. The report also claimed the missile was aimed at the Glilot military base. 'Hezbollah attempted to send a message by launching a single ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. The launch was timed to coincide with the start of the attack on October 7, at 6:29 a.m,' the report said. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it fired an Iranian-made Ghadr 1 medium-range ballistic missile at the Mossad headquarters, which it accused of coordinating recent assassinations of senior Hezbollah leaders and the detonation of thousands of communication devices belonging to the terrorist group's operatives. IDF Arabic spokesperson, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, urged residents in southern Lebanon to avoid returning to their homes for their safety. Overnight, the IDF continued airstrikes across southern Lebanon and deeper into the country. According to Al Hadath, Israeli forces targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot in the town of Jiyeh, about 12 miles south of Beirut. Later, rocket sirens were heard in several towns in the Upper Galilee and the Arava region. The army reported that a drone had crossed into Israel from the east, with an impact identified in the area, but no injuries were reported. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a group of pro-Iranian militias operating in Syria, claimed responsibility for the drone strike, saying it targeted 'a site near the Jordan Valley.' Wednesday's attack on central Israel follows days of intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, with multiple rocket barrages targeting northern Israel. The escalation has prompted the United Nations Security Council to hold an emergency meeting on Lebanon, called by France, with UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon participating. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad reported Tuesday night that at least 569 people have been killed and 5,000 injured since Monday morning in Israeli airstrikes. Meanwhile, Hezbollah confirmed that its head of missile operations Ibrahim Qubaisi was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s Dahieh district. In response to the escalating violence, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed his planned departure for the United Nations General Assembly, now set for Thursday. The Prime Minister's Office said that Netanyahu will hold consultations with security officials to discuss ongoing operations in Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/tygahaa70	2024-09-25T02:24:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/Sy8qdBZAC/Sy8qdBZAC_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Israel urges US to warn Iran against intervening in Lebanon	Israeli intelligence indicates Nasrallah trying to drag Tehran into war; US officials believe intervention would drag the region into a full-scale war As Israel targets Hezbollah's military capabilities while bracing for retaliation, it is working through the U.S. to prevent a broader war by urging Washington to pressure Iran not to intervene. The move comes after Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday suggested that Iran might support the terrorist organization. The U.S. is concerned about further escalation in the region and believes there may be several more days of conflict ahead. American officials have urged Israel to refrain from significant strikes that could provoke Iran to enter the fray. In response to IDF strikes on weapons caches in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has expanded its operations, launching a surface-to-surface missile barrage toward central Israel. Air raid sirens sounded across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area Wednesday morning as one of the missiles, which Hezbollah claimed it aimed at the Mossad headquarters, was intercepted. A Saudi report suggested that the target may have been the Glilot base. While the U.S. is engaged in diplomatic efforts to 'pacify' Hezbollah, it appears that the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is demanding a cease-fire in Gaza as a condition for halting hostilities. U.S. officials acknowledge that without a resolution in Gaza, it will be challenging to stabilize the situation in Lebanon. Most of their diplomatic efforts are therefore focused on Gaza, but progress has been slow, reportedly due to a lack of response from Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt. IDF takes the fight to Lebanon Even before the missile attack on central Israel early Wednesday, Tuesday marked another day of intense clashes between Israel and Hezbollah. The terrorist group continued to fire barrages at northern Israeli towns, prompting widespread precision strikes by the IDF against Hezbollah's infrastructure, operatives and weapons stockpiles. Throughout the day, hundreds of rockets were launched from Lebanon, with a particularly heavy barrage at noon when 105 rockets crossed the border in less than an hour. In the evening, Hezbollah launched a drone toward the coastal town of Atlit, claiming it was targeting an elite Israeli commando unit. Earlier on Tuesday, a house in Rosh Pina was directly hit by a rocket. The family inside was unharmed after taking shelter in a safe room. A 25-year-old reservist was moderately injured by shrapnel from an intercepted rocket near Yokne'am and was taken to Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa for treatment. 'He defended himself well, lying on the ground, but was still hit by shrapnel,' said a Magen David Adom spokesperson. Meanwhile, the IDF conducted multiple rounds of strikes throughout Lebanon, including deep within Lebanese territory. The Lebanese Health Minister reported that the death toll from Israeli attacks over the past two days had risen to at least 569, including 50 children and 94 women, with around 5,000 people injured. Lebanese media reported that the IDF targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot near Jiyeh, about 12 miles south of Beirut. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited a training exercise by the IDF’s 7th Armored Division and the 202nd Paratrooper Battalion, simulating ground combat in Lebanese territory. 'Hezbollah today is not the same as last week’s Hezbollah,' Gallant said. 'The sequence of blows to its command and control capabilities, operatives, and combat resources are severe.' IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, emphasized the need to maintain pressure on Hezbollah. 'We must not give Hezbollah a break,' he stated. 'We need to continue working with all our strength, accelerating offensive operations and reinforcing all our efforts. The situation demands continued vigorous action on all fronts.' Another high-profile assassination in Dahieh In a significant achievement during the second day of Operation Northern Arrows, Israel successfully targeted and killed senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Qubaisi, known as 'Abu Musa,' in an airstrike on Tuesday in the Dahieh district of Beirut. Israeli sources identified Qubaisi as the head of Hezbollah's rocket and missile division and a direct subordinate to the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, making him the most senior military figure after recent high-profile assassinations. Qubaisi had recently been brought into Nasrallah’s inner circle, participating in closed meetings with the Hezbollah leader. According to the IDF, Qubaisi was responsible for several attacks against Israel, including the 2000 raid on Mount Dov, which resulted in the abduction and killing of Staff Sgt. Benjamin Avraham, 21, Staff Sgt. Adi Avitan, 22, and Staff Sgt. Omar Sawaid, 27. Their remains were returned to Israel for burial in 2004. Alongside Qubaisi, six other Hezbollah operatives were killed, and 15 civilians were injured in the attack. This marks the latest in a series of targeted strikes by Israel against senior Hezbollah figures. On July 31, Nasrallah’s military chief Fuad Shukr was killed, followed last week by the elimination of Ibrahim Aqil, the head of Hezbollah’s operations, along with senior commanders from the Radwan Force. Tuesday's strike in Dahieh is the fifth Israeli attack on Hezbollah’s stronghold since October 8, when the terrorist group began firing at Israel unprovoked. The first attack targeted senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri, who was killed in January. Residents of Dahieh are increasingly feeling the impact of these escalations. A Lebanese resident living near the building where Qubaisi was killed described the incident: 'We heard a deafening explosion, and three floors of the building collapsed at once. In the past few days, there have been several assassinations in Dahieh, and only after the attack did we learn from the Israeli media who was targeted. We, the ordinary residents of the district, had no idea.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s100wsqbr0	2024-09-25T01:54:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/rJgXzVEeR0/rJgXzVEeR0_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Suspected Trump gunman charged with attempted assassination	AG Merrick Garland says Justice Department will 'spare no resource,' on the case; Trump campaign says security officials briefed candidate of threats from Iran to assassinate him Ryan Routh, accused of staking out Donald Trump at his Florida golf course was indicted on Tuesday on a charge of attempted assassination of a political candidate as prosecutors alleged he intended to kill the former U.S. president, federal prosecutors said. Routh has not yet entered a plea. His lawyers unsuccessfully sought to have him released on bond. A Secret Service agent identified the barrel of an AK-47 in the bushes and fired at least four shots at Roth who escaped leaving his backpack behind which contained a GoPro camera and other items. He was later arrested after an eyewitness provided his license plate number to authorities. Routh, 58, was already facing two gun-related charges after authorities said he pointed a rifle through a fence at Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida on Sept. 15 while the Republican presidential candidate was golfing there. He has been ordered to remain in jail to await trial. A federal prosecutor said on Monday that the U.S. Justice Department would ask a grand jury to approve the more serious attempted assassination charge, which carries a maximum of life in prison. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday called the attempted assassination a 'heinous act' and said the Justice Department will 'spare no resource,' on the case. Prosecutors have in recent days revealed evidence they said pointed toward a plan to kill Trump. They alleged that months before the incident, Routh dropped off a letter to an unidentified person alluding to 'an assassination attempt on Donald Trump.' They said Routh spent a month in South Florida and cell phone data showed him near the golf course and Trump's Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago. He was found with a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump spoke or was expected to appear, according to the court filings. A U.S. Secret Service agent searching the golf course ahead of Trump opened fire after discovering the gun poking through the fence, causing Routh to flee, prosecutors said. He was arrested within an hour along a Florida highway. Routh was initially charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Trump's presidential campaign said on Tuesday that they were briefed by U.S. intelligence officials on alleged threats from Iran to assassinate the candidate. Iran has previously denied U.S. claims of interfering in American affairs. Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York and the ODNI did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Tuesday. Earlier this month, a Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the 2020 killing by the U.S. of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. The defendant named Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhlsezac	2024-09-25T01:37:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/16/rkwbNlSpA/rkwbNlSpA_0_41_639_360_0_small.jpg
Donating to remember the fallen	Since October 7, Smile shifted from turning personal gifts into community support to helping bereaved families commemorate loved ones; ‘It’s natural that the urge to commemorate is arising only now,’ founders say Since October 7, hundreds of families have lost their loved ones to war and terror, leaving them grappling with immense grief and loss. Beyond the emotional and psychological support they need during this devastating time, these families are also seeking ways to honor and commemorate those they have lost. Yael Hollander, Daphne Seroussi and Yael Ouanounou, founders of the Smile Foundation—a platform established to turn private gifts into opportunities for donations and community aid—have stepped up to help the bereaved families. 'It’s natural that the urge to commemorate is arising only now,' they said. The platform has been used to promote the music of spouses who were murdered in Kibbutz Holit on October 7 and to fund a rehabilitative trip in memory of a fallen soldier. The Smile Foundation was founded in 2019 by Hollander under joyful circumstances: she was celebrating her 40th birthday, her husband’s 50th, her eldest son’s bar mitzvah and her father’s 80th birthday. 'It was a year filled with celebrations, but the subject of gifts irked me,' she recalls. 'Another massage gift card? More scented candles? Giving is important to me. I’m a physical therapist at Beit Izzy Shapiro, and I was looking for a way to combine private celebrations with giving back to the community.' After asking her friends to replace her birthday gifts with donations, Hollander recognized the need for an organized platform to connect private donors with the 40,000 non-profit organizations operating in Israel. 'Yes, I was also shocked by the number,' admits Yael. 'We all know the top 10 big organizations, which already receive large budgets, but there are thousands of smaller organizations doing amazing community work that remain in their shadow and don’t even have proper websites.' With the help of her two friends, Daphne and Yael, she founded the Smile Foundation, which they describe as a 'social BUYME' platform. To establish the foundation, each of the three friends contributed funds from their private savings ('a loan,' clarifies Yael, 'with the hope that at some point in the future, we’ll be able to repay it') to build the colorful app. 'I scoured the country and hand-picked 30 non-profit organizations working in various fields, from supporting abused women to assisting those leaving the ultra-Orthodox community. For each organization, I customized what a private donation could buy,' explains Yael. 'If you donate 10 shekels, that buys three sandwiches for a child. At the Starting Over Farm, you can choose between rescuing a sheep or adopting a donkey. That way, everyone knows exactly where their money is going.' However, the COVID-19 pandemic ground the foundation's operations to a halt. Despite the setback, Hollander used the forced lull to add crucial information about each organization featured on the Smile website, including Yad and Lev, which supports Holocaust survivors, and The Center for Training Service Dogs, which provides assistance to patients with PTSD. She also put together care packages at fixed prices, such as those including a cake, a flower pot and challah for Shabbat for 50 NIS. Even the smallest donations have an impact. 'A donation doesn’t have to replace a wedding gift; it can be a complementary gift for a new mother, or a way to thank the doctor who treated you. For that purpose, we’ve added a range of different notes to accompany each donation, because in my eyes, the note can often be more important than the gift itself. I’ve called this gifting option ‘a triple gift’ because there are three beneficiaries: the one who donates, the one on whose behalf the gift is given and the recipient.' Rachel Shapira was moved On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the trio was working tirelessly, 'but then October 7 happened, and everything collapsed. Who was in the headspace for gifts then? And who did you feel more obliged to help—the evacuees who had suddenly lost their homes or the already homeless people who had come to rely on your support?' Hollander recalls. 'I felt uncomfortable with the thought of evacuees from the north and south receiving second- or even third-hand clothing donations. With all due respect to those who opened their closets to donate, it still left a bitter taste in my mouth. I wanted to provide them with true independence. So we raised money to give evacuees vouchers. Each family received a BUYME gift voucher, which they could use in stores like Fox or at a baby clothing shop. 'I joined forces with Jewish communities abroad. A Jewish community in Cambridge adopted Kibbutz Nir Oz and financed the vouchers we provided for them. A community from Vancouver adopted Holit. Some organizations offered gifts to children, like Hanukkah presents, but I objected to that approach. We distributed vouchers so the children could choose their own pajamas or games. Receiving eight gifts in a row brings joy. It's a small smile.' The prolonged war forced Hollander to come up with creative ideas. 'At one of the rehabilitation centers, I selected five wounded soldiers and found a company that donates a voucher of one thousand shekels to each of them monthly, as well as to the families of reservists,' she explains. 'Tonight, one of our wounded soldiers is getting married, and I found someone who financed the wedding dress, a makeup artist and other goodies.' Now, almost a year since that fateful Sabbath, reality demands a new course of action. Bereaved families from the Nova festival massacre and the military are interested in establishing memorial exhibits in honor of their loved ones, and Hollander is determined to help. 'In my view, it's natural that the urge to memorialize is only now emerging,' she says. 'It took these families time to process, to build a new kind of routine for themselves, and to recover all their deceased loved ones. When families tell me they want to establish a memorial foundation, I explain that it is a process requiring financial resources, an accountant, a lawyer, and endless bureaucracy. It is not suitable for everyone.' As a result, the Smile app has opened a new page dedicated to memorializing. 'I don't interfere with the content; I only manage negotiations with the various suppliers to optimize fundraising and reduce costs,' Hollander explains. Among the projects that have come to fruition is an album dedicated to the late Shahar and Shlomi Mathias, who were murdered on October 7 in the shelter of their home in Holit. 'Shahar, my only sister, was a singer, and Shlomi, my brother-in-law, was the music teacher for all the children in the settlements around Gaza,' says Bar Yuval-Shani, a psychotherapist and marriage therapist from Lahavim. 'Nathan Salor, who studied with them in Ramon, played Rachel Shapira their rendition of her song, 'Consolation,' and she said it was the most moving version she had ever heard. So I went to see her in Shefayim to introduce her to my sister and play some original material from the album we produced.' Shapira was the one who approached Hollander and took it upon herself to raise 90,000 shekels for the project. Salor selected the pieces, and the musicians who gathered in the studio in Be'er Sheva were assisted by artificial intelligence to fill in the gaps. 'It's slow work, but I hope the album will be ready within the next year,' says Yuval-Shani, adding, 'If we hadn’t partnered with Smile, my sister's voice would not be heard.' The late Major Sivan Weil, a commando in the Egoz unit, died of his wounds on March 29 after being injured in a battle in the southern Gaza Strip. 'He was the second of our four children,' says his father Julian, who made aliyah from France 26 years ago. He owns a marketing firm, and his wife Helen is an occupational psychologist. 'What do I know about memorializing?' he asked, already during the week of his son’s shiva. Daphne Seroussi, one of the founders of the Smile initiative, knew the family from Ra’anana and offered her help. In the first phase, thousands of bottles of wine from the Bin Nun and Titora wineries were prepared with Sivan's picture and were also distributed abroad. 'Each bottle is accompanied by a leaflet that tells the story of Sivan’s short and beautiful life,' explains his father. 'Our Sivan loved skiing; he learned at the young age of four, and when he was asked what he wanted to do after his military service, he answered: 'go on a ski trip.' From the money we raised from the wine sales, we are flying 15 members of Sivan’s unit, who were injured in the same incident, for a week of rehabilitative skiing in Bulgaria. The Erez Foundation, which specializes in extreme sports and rehabilitative work with IDF veterans, will adapt the skiing to their needs.' And that's not all. 'On October 31, the date when Sivan was meant to celebrate his 21st birthday, we will launch a major campaign to establish a fund that will finance rehabilitative sports activities for disabled IDF veterans and provide scholarships. As part of the 'Israeli Journey,' two scholarships for math tutoring will be awarded to high school students. Sivan's organs were donated and transplanted into Druze and Bedouin recipients.' 'There are other platforms that conduct crowdfunding campaigns,' notes Hollander, 'but we, for a nominal fee of 500 shekels per month, accompany the creation of the commemoration project through to its completion.' 'Not trying to profit' Do Israelis like to donate? Hollander: 'Wealthy Israeli donors give millions to hospitals and research. But the average donor, the one who doesn’t donate large amounts, may be overlooked because they aren’t given the option to choose where their money goes. In the U.S., they recognized the need for a defined donation goal, and everywhere you look you’ll see ads like, ‘Adopt an orphan in Africa for $50 a month.’ I believe in the importance of such public education.' This is also her response to the question of how Smile generates revenue. 'Since we want 100% of the donation to reach its intended recipient, we have added an option to leave a tip for us. In the U.S., 3-5% of donations come with a tip for the facilitating app. At Smile, the tips add up to about 1%, which is fine. It’s a slow process.' These are the words of someone who is taking a big risk. 'No,' she laughs, 'but we’re really not trying to make a profit. The tips finance the website server. We don’t earn a salary, we don’t have an office, and we only pay for essential services, like a programmer, accountant and lawyer. To survive financially, we started another initiative that is doing well in the U.S.—donations by businesses. 'In Israel, most businesses donate generously but do not involve their employees in the process. We divide the donation amount into vouchers, which are distributed to employees via email, and each employee chooses from the platform who they’d like to donate to. It’s not a personal connection, but it does have a positive impact on the heart.' 'It’s incredibly fulfilling,' she concludes. 'On a personal and even egotistical level, this is what has kept me going for the past year. I get to meet the good people of Israel. And there are many.'

The journey of escape from death': Lebanese fleeing combat zones...	Thousands flee southern Lebanon amid heavy fighting, creating massive traffic jams and panic; ‘We left for Beirut not knowing where we were going’ Thousands of Lebanese civilians are fleeing combat zones in southern Lebanon as the IDF continues extensive airstrikes on the second day of Operation Northern Arrows. The evacuations follow Israeli warnings for civilians to leave areas where weapons were allegedly being stored by Hezbollah. Arab media outlets reported scenes of residents escaping under fire, enduring difficult road conditions and seeking refuge in schools converted into shelters. On Monday, the first day of the IDF’s precision strikes, 558 people were reportedly killed, the highest single-day toll in Lebanon since the civil war over 30 years ago. The Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar published an extensive report on the displaced, titled 'The Journey of Escape from Death.' One woman displaced from her home in southern Lebanon described her journey to Beirut, saying, 'Missiles were falling in front of us, behind us and on both sides. For four hours, we could not leave the house. We saw houses collapse on their occupants. We left for Beirut at 10 a.m. and arrived the next day at 7 a.m. due to heavy traffic. There was no food or drink on the way, everyone was in the same difficult situation.' She said that the Israeli attacks 'forced me, and thousands of families, to leave their homes instead of staying in place and dying.' Another displaced woman said: 'We were at home when we heard the attacks around us. We woke up in the morning and discovered that the house was shaking from the force of the rockets and attacks in the area. We left the house and hid under the trees. Then we packed our suitcases and left for Beirut without knowing where we're going. We arrived at a school in Beirut until we know what fate has for us.' A displaced person who fled from Nabatieh in southern Lebanon said, 'The attacks came closer to our house so we had to leave because there are children at home. If there were no children we would not have left. We do not have the financial ability to rent an apartment, so we came to a school to take shelter.' Another displaced person from the village of Ain Qana said, 'A missile exploded a few meters from me. We took the children and drove to Beirut. There was heavy traffic for eight hours on the road.' Saudi daily Asharq Al-Awsat shared similar stories of families making treacherous journeys lasting up to 16 hours. Many used any available transportation, including tractors and trucks, as they fled northward. A displaced person from the town of Shaitieh recounted his car breaking down, forcing him to spend the night in Zahrani before continuing his journey. 'It’s better to die on the road than in a place subject to dozens of attacks every day,' he said. Schools in Beirut and other cities have been turned into makeshift shelters as tens of thousands seek refuge. According to UN reports, about 6,000 people have crossed into Syria, and thousands more remain on the move within Lebanon. Volunteers at Bir Hassan Technical College in southern Beirut have been working tirelessly to provide food, water and medicine to those in need. Rami Najam, a representative of the Shiite Amal movement, which is taking an active part in fighting against Israel, said, 'In the beginning there were only a few families, by 5 p.m. we had 30 families.' Lebanon’s Health Minister reported at least 569 fatalities and over 5,000 injuries since the escalation began on Monday. Hezbollah confirmed the death of its missile commander, Ibrahim Qubaisi, in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s Dahieh district. Israeli officials said that Qubaisi, who oversaw missile units targeting Israel, became the group’s top military leader after recent high-profile assassinations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wrdfbra	2024-09-25T00:20:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/rkvNoRk00/rkvNoRk00_0_234_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IAEA chief sees willingness from Iran to re-engage on nuclear fil...	Iranian president tells UN General Assembly Tehran willing to cooperate with West revive 2015 nuclear deal UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he had sensed a greater willingness by Iranian officials to engage with the agency in a more meaningful way after talks in New York, and that he hoped to travel to Tehran in October. Several long-standing issues have dogged relations between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, including Tehran's barring of uranium enrichment experts on the inspection team and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. Grossi held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, one of the key architects of the 2015 accord that limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium in return for a lifting of Western sanctions, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. 'What I see is an expressed willingness to re-engage with us in a more meaningful fashion,' Grossi told Reuters in an interview. On Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in his speech to the UN General Assembly that Iran was ready to end its nuclear standoff with the West. 'We are ready to engage with participants of the 2015 nuclear deal. If the deal's commitments are implemented fully and in good faith, dialogue on other issues can follow,' Pezeshkian said. With nuclear diplomacy largely stalled between the Iranian presidential election and the U.S. one on Nov. 5, Iranian and European officials have met in New York to test their mutual willingness to reduce tensions amid Tehran's disputed nuclear program, its role in Ukraine and mounting regional tensions. Grossi said he wanted to make real progress in restoring proper technical discussions with Iran quickly and was aiming to travel to Tehran in October to meet with Pezeshkian. 'Of course now we have to give content and substance to this because we are not starting from zero. We have had a relatively protracted process without replies to some of the questions we have,' he said. 'We also need to calibrate together with them how we go through this period where they are waiting to see what is going to happen with their other partners, starting with the United States.' IAEA board resolutions ordering Iran to cooperate urgently with the investigation into the uranium traces and calling on it to reverse its barring of inspectors have brought little change, and quarterly IAEA reports seen by Reuters on Aug. 29 showed no progress. The development of Iran's nuclear program has also advanced. By the end of the quarter, the latest IAEA reports showed Iran had completed the installation of eight new cascades at Fordow but still not brought them online. At its larger underground site at Natanz, which is enriching to up to 5% purity, it had brought 15 new cascades of other advanced models online. 'Iran has kept a regular pace without accelerating too much, but it continues,' Grossi said, adding that the Fordow cascades remained offline. Iran has stepped up nuclear work since 2019, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned an agreement reached under his predecessor Barack Obama. When asked about the prospects of a revival of nuclear talks, Grossi said the preparatory work needed to start now, notably for the IAEA to get the necessary clarity on Iran's activities since it reduced cooperation with the agency. 'I think we need to, or the ambition should be to get results in a different way, because the old way is simply not going to be possible anymore,' he said, adding that he foresaw a more active role for the agency. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkiwrzbcc	2024-09-24T23:36:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/05/H1K7G4C4C/H1K7G4C4C_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Venue cancels, Israelis mobilize to find the couple a wedding alt...	A post on social media prompts many to offer a plethora of worthy options to ensure the IDF commando wounded on October 7 weds his bride They had been anticipating this moment for nine months, and on Monday it finally happened: Ofri Azulai, 23, from the religious community of Sde Ya'akov, and her partner A., also 23, a naval commando from the Jerusalem area, were married. A. was moderately injured during the battle of Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7 and is still undergoing rehabilitation before he can fully return to his role as a career soldier. A. proposed to Ofri, his partner of two and a half years, three months after his injury. Since then, they had been planning their wedding, which was scheduled for Sunday in the Jezreel Valley. However, on Saturday night, the venue owners informed them they had to cancel due to new Home Front Command instructions. In response to the cancellation, Ofri's mother posted on Hanoch Daum's Facebook page, seeking an alternative venue for the wedding. Just a few hours later, thanks to an overwhelming response on social media, the couple was able to get married at the 'Ein Hemed' hall in Jerusalem. 'We received hundreds of calls from businesses, hotels, event venues, and private individuals offering their gardens, even from people abroad connected to local businesses. It was overwhelming,' said Efrat, the bride's mother, about the outpouring of support. On Monday morning, she added, 'Thanks to the tremendous kindness extended to us at the last moment, the wedding will go ahead today.' During the final preparations before the emotional reunion with her fiancé, Ofri shared: 'He is still undergoing rehabilitation, and his condition is gradually improving. For now, he uses a sleeve on his injured arm. He has a journey ahead, but he will overcome it and return to combat. He has a long military career ahead as he continues his permanent service.' Reflecting on the opportunity to get married despite the challenges they faced, she added: 'We didn't expect such an amazing response; it made us feel like we weren't alone. There's nothing like the solidarity of the people of Israel. Thank you to everyone; you made our evening. Thanks to you, we had the chance to pause and celebrate our love.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1pmv11lcc	2024-09-24T21:38:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/HygEcy10T0/HygEcy10T0_0_105_1280_721_0_small.jpg

UK’s Starmer blunders with call for return of ‘sausages’ from Gaz...	In call for Gaza cease-fire during his first speech at Labour Party conference, British PM mixes up ‘sausages’ instead of ‘hostages’ British Prime Minister Keir Starmer made headlines Tuesday with an unexpected slip of the tongue during his first speech at the Labour Party's annual conference since taking office. Addressing the audience in Liverpool, Starmer mistakenly called for the return of 'sausages' from Gaza instead of 'hostages.' 'I am once again calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, for the return of the... sausages... the hostages...' he said, and although he quickly corrected himself, the gaffe spread rapidly online, with British media outlets humorously highlighting the blunder. In his speech, Starmer also called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and a return to a two-state solution framework and urged for restraint along the Israel-Lebanon border amid rising tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. During the address, Starmer also had to deal with a protester who interrupted his remarks to ask what he was doing to help children in Gaza. Starmer, who succeeded pro-Palestinian advocate Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, responded: 'We changed this party, and that’s why we have a Labour government now.' The crowd responded with applause as security escorted the protester out. Corbyn had previously accused Israel of genocide in Gaza and repeatedly refused to label Hamas as a terrorist organization. He led Labour into the 2019 election, where the party suffered a crushing defeat to the Conservatives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by87tdlcc	2024-09-24T14:14:44-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/r1v4bPxCR/r1v4bPxCR_0_95_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Armed to the teeth by Iran, Hezbollah gears up for ground war in ...	As Israeli airstrikes intensify, Wall Street Journal reports Hezbollah preparing for possible ground offensive in southern Lebanon, armed with Iranian weapons, including advanced anti-tank missiles reverse-engineered from Israel’s Spike; analysts fear such operation could become quagmire for Israel The IDF continued its extensive airstrikes in Lebanon for the second day of Operation Northern Arrows, aimed at degrading Hezbollah’s capabilities as much as possible. While the operation is focused on aerial attacks, the army has not ruled out the possibility of a ground incursion, according to IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. He emphasized that Israel will do whatever is necessary to ensure the safe return of northern residents to their homes after nearly a year of escalating conflict. The heavy strikes and Hezbollah’s intense rocket barrages on northern Israel have raised international concerns about a potential escalation into full-scale war, which could include a ground offensive in southern Lebanon to push Hezbollah terrorists away from the border. Several international news outlets have compared the military capabilities of the IDF and Hezbollah amid these fears. An article published Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal highlighted one of Hezbollah’s 'most lethal' weapons— the Iranian-made Almas anti-tank missile, based on the Israeli Spike missile, which was reportedly captured by Hezbollah during the 2006 Lebanon War and transferred to Iran. The Almas (Farsi for 'diamond') missile is reportedly comparable to advanced anti-tank systems like the American Javelin, which has been used extensively by the Ukrainian armed forces against Russian armored vehicles. It has been used by Hezbollah in recent years for precision attacks. Its first documented use was in January, when Hezbollah released footage of a missile strike on an Israeli radar and other reconnaissance equipment near the border. According to the report, Hezbollah has been bolstering its preparations for a potential large-scale war in recent months, expanding its tunnel network in southern Lebanon, relocating fighters, and increasing arms smuggling. U.S. and regional sources reported that Iran has increased its supply of light weapons, anti-tank missiles and long-range unguided missiles to Hezbollah. A former Hezbollah officer described the south as 'boiling,' claiming, 'We have everything the Iranians have.' During the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah used anti-tank missiles to inflict significant damage on Israeli forces. Last week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted at preparations for a ground invasion, calling it a 'historic opportunity' and expressing eagerness for such a scenario. 'We’re waiting for their tanks. When they come, they’re welcome,' he boasted. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that Nasrallah’s emphasis on the possibility of a ground invasion indicates his apprehension about such a development. Syrian experience, Ukrainian methods The Wall Street Journal highlighted Hezbollah’s military buildup since the 2006 war nearly two decades ago, noting that the group has amassed tens of thousands of rockets, although thousands were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes in recent days. Hezbollah fighters have gained valuable experience in Syria’s civil war, fighting alongside Russian and Iranian forces and learning conventional military tactics. The report warns that a potential ground offensive in southern Lebanon would play to Hezbollah’s strengths. Military analysts fear such an operation could become a quagmire for Israel, akin to its entanglements in Gaza. 'It’s a little like saying to the United States in 1980, ‘Let’s go back into Vietnam,’' said Daniel Byman, a former U.S. government official and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Analysts cited in the report also suggest that Hezbollah could adopt tactics used by Russia in Ukraine, launching barrages of rockets and drones to overwhelm Israel’s air defenses. Israeli officials reportedly estimate that such a scenario could result in hundreds of casualties. 'It’s not going be a walk in the park,' Assaf Orion, a retired IDF brigadier general, told the Wall Street Journal, adding that preventing all damage in such a war would be impossible. While Hezbollah is unlikely to seek a conventional military victory against Israel, which holds a clear advantage in air power and intelligence capabilities, the terrorist group may try to draw Israel into a prolonged war of attrition. 'Israel can cause destruction in Lebanon, it’s not up for discussion. There is a gap in the military balance,' said Elias Farhat, a retired Lebanese army general. 'But Hezbollah has asymmetric weapons. They proved their skill in using anti-tank missiles in 2006. They are well-trained.' Israeli officials acknowledge the threat. 'Hezbollah is not Hamas—there are similarities, but there are also differences. The terrain is different, the enemy is different, the threats are different and the challenges are different,' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said during a visit with IDF soldiers from the 7th Armored Brigade and the 202nd Paratroopers Battalion, who were training for ground combat in Lebanon. Iran continues to threaten Israel 'One thing I know: every Hezbollah fighter you encounter, you will know how to eliminate. I am 100% sure of that, and they understand it,' Gallant added. 'Hezbollah is aware of what I’m saying and is concerned. You understand very well that the moment may come when we give the order, and this system will move forward. Therefore, we need to make the best preparations.' Gallant noted that Hezbollah has suffered 'severe blows' and that its morale is low. However, he cautioned troops to take Hezbollah’s threats seriously, saying, 'When they say they want to strike us, destroy us, harm us — take it seriously. That is their goal, and they mean it.' Amid fears of a broader conflict, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian did not rule out Tehran’s potential support for Hezbollah in the event of a full-scale war. 'We must not allow for Lebanon to become another Gaza at the hands of Israel,' he told CNN. 'Hezbollah cannot do that alone. Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western countries, European countries and the United States of America.' However, he stressed that Iran does not seek regional war and accused Israel of pushing for it. Pezhkian’s statements came as Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority, continued to threaten Israel. In Tehran, missile displays were set up alongside signs with messages of vengeance, including one in Hebrew that read: 'You started it, but we’ll finish it.' Pezeshkianemphasized that Iran’s response to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh would come 'in due course.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byumt5gac	2024-09-24T13:38:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/Bkmv8uxRR/Bkmv8uxRR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

We have more strikes ready,' Gallant says as IDF drills ground c...	I’m confident you will know how to eliminate any Hezbollah fighter you encounter,' defense minister tells troops; Netanyahu to Lebanese: 'Anyone with a missile in their living room won’t have a home' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday expressed confidence in the IDF’s preparations for fighting against Hezbollah after the Israeli military landed a series of unprecedented blows on the Iranian-backed terrorist group in recent days. 'Hezbollah today is not what it was a week ago. It has suffered severe blows to its command, personnel and weaponry,' he told troops during a visit to a military exercise simulating ground combat in Lebanon, involving the IDF’s 7th Armored Brigade and the 202nd Paratroopers Battalion. 'We have more strikes ready. We know what to do and how to execute it. Remember, Hezbollah is not Hamas. The terrain, the enemy and the threats are different. I’m confident that any Hezbollah fighter you encounter, you will know how to eliminate.' He emphasized that Hezbollah understands the IDF’s capabilities and is concerned. 'We must be fully prepared to give the order to move forward when necessary. I see what you’re doing, and it’s extremely important.' He added, 'You are the most trained forces the IDF has ever had. No one has faced a year of fighting like you have. But remember, you’re up against an organization that looks different — its morale is low, but its intentions to harm us are serious.' Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited an intelligence base, where he received a briefing from the head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder and the commander of Unit 8200, Lt. Col. Yossi Sariel. 'I am deeply impressed by the work that has been done and the work that will be done. We will continue to strike Hezbollah,' Netanyahu said. Addressing the people of Lebanon, Netanyahu said, 'Our fight is not with you; it is with Hezbollah. Nasrallah is leading you to the brink of disaster. I told you yesterday to leave homes where he has placed missiles in your living rooms and rockets in your garages. Anyone with a missile in their living room won’t have a home. He is putting your country at risk. Free yourselves from Hezbollah’s grip — for your own sake.' The IDF released data on its operations in Lebanon over the past two days. 'In recent days, the IDF has launched a widespread campaign in Lebanon aimed at degrading Hezbollah’s military capabilities and altering the security reality in the north. Fighter squadrons and drones have conducted nearly 3,000 flight hours over Lebanon. More than 1,500 Hezbollah targets, including over 1,000 types of weaponry, have been struck in 200 different areas,' the military said. The IDF added that the strikes involved over 250 aircraft dropping around 2,000 munitions and targeted roughly 400 medium-range rocket launchers, 70 weapons depots and 80 drones and UAVs. 'The IDF continues its strikes in the area,' the statement said. A senior air force official told Ynet that the scale of targets struck in such a short time is unprecedented. 'This is a broad and synchronized air operation, with intelligence and Northern Command coordination like never before in terms of target quantity and timeframe,' he said, but cautioned that this is not yet a full-scale war with all of the IDF’s capabilities. 'Hezbollah still has rocket-launching capabilities,' he noted. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that NASA satellite data, used to monitor global fires, shows that IDF airstrikes in southern Lebanon have covered an area of 650 square miles. The Fire Information for Resource Management System, based on satellite data, tracks flashpoints and fires caused by the strikes targeting Hezbollah’s weapon and missile stockpiles. According to AP, the satellite data also indicates secondary explosions resulting from the destruction of these weapons. As of Tuesday, numerous fires have been reported across southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1me9ugrc	2024-09-24T10:49:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/SJzdziwgAC/SJzdziwgAC_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

Coastal communities south of Haifa jolted by first rocket alarms ...	Over 170 rockets fired toward northern Israel in three hours; Hezbollah drones target Atlit; Israeli Air Force launches fourth wave of attacks on terror targets; several fatalities reported in Lebanon's Bekaa The Israeli Air Force continued its extensive air campaign against Hezbollah targets across Lebanon Tuesday evening as the Shiite terrorist group launched barrages of rockets at civilian areas in northern Israel. Hostile aircraft infiltration warnings were issued for the towns of Neve Yam, Atlit and Megadim south of Haifa. This marks the first air raid warning siren sounding in Atlit since July 2019. Another siren sounded in Beit Jan in the Upper Galilee and several communities in the Lower Galilee, including Sde Ilan and Givat Avni, shortly after. Shortly earlier, rocket alert sirens were activated in the cities of Safed, Hatzor HaGlilit, Rosh Pina, Nof Kinneret and Elifelet in the Upper Galilee. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force launched another wave of airstrikes Tuesday evening, its fourth for the day. Five buildings were reportedly struck in the southern village of Maliki, resulting in casualties, according to Lebanon’s state news agency. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported widespread strikes in nine locations across southern Lebanon shortly before the Maliki attack. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen network reported one fatality in an Israeli drone strike on the Litani Bridge near Baalbek. Additional reports from the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar and the state news agency said five people were killed and six others injured in an airstrike on a house in Nabi Ila, in the Bekaa Valley. Earlier, sirens also sounded in Katzrin and the surrounding areas in the Golan Heights, where five rockets were fired, some of which were intercepted. No injuries were reported. Meanwhile, sirens warning of drone incursions were activated in Shlomi, Rosh HaNikra and nearby communities in the Western Galilee. Earlier, around 30 rockets were launched toward Safed and Merom HaGalil, with some intercepted. No injuries or damage were reported. Another barrage of 30 rockets was fired at Shlomi and the western Galilee at 5:27 a.m., with no reported casualties or damage. In total, about 170 rockets were launched within three hours. In Rosh Pina, four rockets landed, one of them striking a house. The four residents, who were in a reinforced shelter at the time, were unharmed but suffered from shock. Other rockets caused damage to infrastructure and open areas. Extensive damage was reported to the house that was directly hit in Rosh Pina. Images showed a large hole above the bathroom, adjacent to the shelter where the family had taken refuge. 'Mom, what happened to my room?!' a child was heard asking in footage from the destroyed home. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1nhswlca	2024-09-24T10:06:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/HkzHsve0R/HkzHsve0R_1_35_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

The protests will kill the hostages': Hostage families divided o...	Brother of hostage Omri Miran claims protests undermining efforts to secure hostages’ release and only ‘driving up the cost’; another family member criticizes ‘politicized’ demonstrations As thousands take to the streets every week demanding the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, some families whose loved ones have been held captive for almost a year fear these protests may be doing more harm than good. The debate over whether to push for a deal or apply military pressure has deeply divided the family of Omri Miran, who was abducted from Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7. Omri’s father, Dani, is part of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, advocating for negotiations, while his brother, Nadav, belongs to the Hope Forum, which calls for increased military pressure on Hamas and opposes any deal that doesn’t secure the release of all captives. 'In recent months, I’ve opposed the direction of the protests,' Nadav said, criticizing what he sees as a shift toward political aims, namely toppling the government. 'We hear [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar instructing the hostages in Gaza to tell their families to protest and bring down the government. And what do Israelis do? They follow Sinwar's orders.' Nadav believes the initial protests, born out of pain, have now been politicized, with calls for nationwide strikes and connections to last year's judicial reform demonstrations driving up the cost of a deal. 'The protests will kill the hostages. They’re essentially blocking a deal and driving up the hostages’ price,' he said, adding that using Omri’s photo to push political agendas 'misses the point.' 'The only one blocking a deal is Hamas— even the Americans say that,' he added. Shimon Or, whose nephew Avinatan Or was kidnapped from the Nova music festival along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who has since been freed, shares Nadav’s concerns. As a member of the Hope Forum, Or supports the protesting families but believes the movement has taken on a more political tone, undermining its mission. 'I’m frustrated that the protests are now being politicized. It doesn’t help bring back the hostages,' he said. Or is skeptical of Hamas’s intentions, suggesting the group has no real desire to return the hostages. 'Even if we offered everything— all for all, cease-fire and a return to power— they wouldn’t agree. Their strategy is to drag negotiations out for years,' he said. 'I’m frustrated that we keep sending negotiation teams without considering alternatives or making real progress. I’m also frustrated with the government and the prime minister, who says the goal is to destroy Hamas. The envoys he sends to negotiate only strengthen Hamas’ grip, ultimately endangering the hostages.' He believes military pressure has its limits and advocates for taking control of Gaza as the only way to secure the hostages’ release. 'The military objectives are just tactics. The strategy must be to take control of Gaza. Without controlling Gaza, we won’t get the hostages back,' he said. Regarding Avinatan’s photo being used in the protests, Or says, 'I’m less concerned with who’s holding his picture, even if it's Kaplan-linked groups. They don’t care about Avinatan or the hostages— they have their own agenda, like toppling the prime minister.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwhnvxar	2024-09-24T09:22:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/27/SJLWU9h5WA/SJLWU9h5WA_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Following a series of recent assassinations, Qubaisi became one of the group's top military figures, responsible for Hezbollah's strategic capabilities and allegedly involved in recent rocket attacks on Tel Aviv. Officials noted that, at this stage, there is no confirmed verification of his death.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by11w9recr	2024-09-24T07:18:44-07:00
