Los Angeles wildfires spread to Hollywood as 100,000 ordered to e...	Raging wildfires surrounding Los Angeles spread to the Hollywood Hills on Wednesday, after other fires in the area killed at least five people, destroyed hundreds of homes and stretched firefighting resources and water supplies to the limit. More than 100,000 people were ordered to evacuate as dry, hurricane-force winds hindered firefighting operations and spread the fires, which have burned parched terrain almost unimpeded since they began on Tuesday. 'This firestorm is the big one,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told a press conference after rushing back to Los Angeles upon cutting short an official trip to Ghana. A new fire broke out in the Hollywood Hills on Wednesday evening, Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told a press conference, forcing more evacuations and raising to six the number of wildfires burning in Los Angeles County. Four of them were 0% contained according to state officials, including a pair of major conflagrations on the eastern and western flanks of the city that continued to grow as night fell on Wednesday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj02wjpljl	2025-01-08T21:09:06-08:00

Iran 'defeated very badly' in Syria, general admits and blames Ru...	Brig. Gen. Behrouz Esbati blasts Assad for rejecting Iranian proposals to use Syrian territory as staging ground for attacks on Israel, claims Russian forces misled Tehran by bombing open fields instead of rebel strongholds A senior Iranian military official overseeing operations in Syria has publicly acknowledged Iran was 'defeated very badly' in the war-torn country, marking a stark departure from Tehran's previous narrative of strategic resilience. 'I don’t consider losing Syria something to be proud of,' said Brig. Gen. Behrouz Esbati according to an audio recording of remarks delivered the remarks during a speech at a Tehran mosque, which was later disseminated through Iranian media. 'We were defeated, and defeated very badly, we took a very big blow and it’s been very difficult.' Esbati, who coordinated Iranian military operations in Syria and liaised with both Syrian and Russian officials, described the fall of Damascus as a strategic blow. He further criticized Iran's relationship with ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad, citing strained ties due to Assad's rejection of Tehran’s proposals to allow Iranian-backed militias to open a front against Israel from Syrian territory. Esbati accused Russia, a key ally of both Iran and Assad, of undermining Iranian efforts. He claimed Russian forces misled Tehran by bombing open fields instead of rebel strongholds and deactivating radar systems when Israeli forces targeted Iranian assets in Syria. The general also revealed that Iran had presented Assad with 'comprehensive military plans' to utilize its forces in Syria for attacks on Israel. However, he noted that Assad's refusal to cooperate contributed to the collapse of his regime. Esbati said that he was on the last Iranian flight out of Damascus the night before the capital fell to rebel forces. During his speech, Esbati addressed audience questions, including whether Iran plans further retaliation for the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. He confirmed that April and October missile attacks on Israel were part of Iran's response but added that a third strike was unrealistic given current circumstances. Esbati vowed to mobilize resistance against the new Syrian leadership under Ahmad al-Sharaa, leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. 'We can activate all the networks we have worked with over the years,' he said. 'We can activate the social layers that our guys lived among for years; we can be active in social media and we can form resistance cells.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He added, 'Now we can operate there as we do in other international arenas, and we have already started.' However, a senior IRGC official told The Times that these ambitions appear more aspirational than practical. Esbati attributed the collapse of Assad's regime to corruption, political repression, economic hardship and inadequate public services, including electricity and fuel shortages. He claimed Iran had repeatedly warned Assad to implement reforms, which were ignored. When questioned about Iran's reluctance to strike U.S. military bases in the Middle East, Esbati cited the risk of significant retaliation from the United States and its allies. He admitted that Iran's simpler missiles are incapable of penetrating advanced U.S. defense systems, limiting Tehran’s ability to escalate. Despite admitting to severe setbacks, Esbati maintained that Iran and its allies still hold significant influence in the region. He suggested that chaos in Syria could ultimately benefit Iran by creating opportunities for greater leverage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skwge1puyl	2025-01-08T20:53:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/BJeoRTo94Jx/BJeoRTo94Jx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Is Hamas playing Israel in hostage negotiations?	Middle East analysts say Hamas is using hostage negotiations to pressure Israel while the Biden administration’s policies have worsened the situation Hamas is not genuinely interested in a hostage-for-ceasefire deal, according to two leading Middle East experts. Speaking on ILTV’s Insider this week, Israeli analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem argued that even President-elect Donald Trump’s threats against Hamas are unlikely to be taken seriously. 'I think that the more he talks about this hostage deal and then threatens Hamas, he is losing his credibility because Hamas doesn't take him seriously,' Ben-Menachem said. He explained that Trump lacks direct influence over the terror organization or mediators like Egypt and Qatar. 'Egypt is very unstable internally, and the relationship between Trump and Qatar’s ruler, Sheikh Tamim ibn Hamad Al Thani, is such that Trump will not want to threaten him,' he added. 'I think the situation is very gloomy,' Ben-Menachem concluded. 'A Series of Missteps' How did things reach this point? Lt. Col. (Res.) Maurice Hirsch, who also appeared on Insider, blamed the Biden administration for what he described as a series of critical errors. 'The Biden administration managed to step on every landmine on the way to destroying Israel's capability to really get rid of Hamas, to annihilate Hamas, and to rescue the hostages,' Hirsch said. He pointed to specific decisions, including the aid allowed into Gaza. 'I think that forcing Israel to pour millions of tons of aid into the Gaza Strip through the hands of Hamas was a terrible mistake, which we are paying for to this day,' Hirsch said. He also criticized delays in Israel’s military actions. 'The idea of holding the IDF up from attacking in Rafah, which we saw the U.S. administration do for quite a long time, really proved to be disastrous. And so I don't think that anything the Biden administration really suggested was operable,' he said. Hirsch dismissed the possibility of a sustainable ceasefire, suggesting that Hamas was using the idea of a deal as a tactic. 'They’re all just tricks to play with Israel's heartstrings and drag the situation out even more, putting more pressure on Israel instead of on the terrorists themselves,' Hirsch explained. 'Israel’s Mistakes in Gaza' While critical of international actors, Ben-Menachem acknowledged that Israel has made its own mistakes. He contrasted Israel’s performance in Gaza with its operations in the north against Hezbollah. 'We see a lot of good results on the Northern Front, but on the Southern Front, the army made a lot of mistakes in Gaza and is still making mistakes,' Ben-Menachem said. He called for a major overhaul of Israel’s strategy. 'I think that the whole strategy should be completely changed,' he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj0tfkaike	2025-01-08T20:52:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/rylYa2cj81x/rylYa2cj81x_0_222_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

However, Truzman cautioned about the hurdles ahead. 'There is going to be a significant security challenge for whatever post-war government takes over or for Israel, since there are Hamas elements and allies of Hamas that will survive,' he explained. Truzman underscored the need for a long-term solution in Gaza. 'I don't think Gaza can have stability with Hamas remaining in power,' he said.

IDF to recognize and support lone reservists with expanded benefi...	Military to recognize approximately 8,000 lone reservists, granting them expanded benefits such as increased financial assistance and mental health support; 'The timing of mental health treatment is critical,' says MK Oded Forer The Knesset Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs Committee announced Wednesday that the IDF will formally recognize reservists who were formerly lone soldiers as 'lone reservists,' granting them additional benefits and mental health support. The decision follows public outcry over the challenges faced by reservists without family support, sparked by the testimony of Lt. Col. (res.) Aryeh Dergel, who shared his struggles with financial and mental health crises in November. The issue gained further attention after additional cases of hardship were reported. The new designation will apply to about 8,000 reserve soldiers lacking family support. Benefits include increased financial reimbursements, subsidized flights, gift vouchers and mental health services. The IDF revealed that since the war began, 13,000 lone reserve soldiers have served, including 8,300 singles, 2,401 married and 157 divorced soldiers. Of these, 7,963 will now be recognized as 'lone reservists,' with 5,359 serving in frontline units and 2,604 in rear units. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Committee Chairman MK Oded Forer announced that he would immediately appeal to the defense minister to allocate NIS 5 million ($1.35 million) to organizations assisting lone soldiers. 'The timing of mental health treatment is critical. The quicker, more accessible and effective the treatment, the better we can prevent crises and help soldiers return to their daily lives,' Forer emphasized. Daniel Aharon, CEO of Ach Gadol for Lone Soldiers, welcomed the decision: 'Today, we took another step toward recognizing and honoring the lone reserve soldiers who once again dropped everything to defend the State of Israel. Thanks to Committee Chair MK Oded Forer, who brought together the IDF and relevant parties to ensure these soldiers are not alone, even in reserve duty.' Expanded benefits package and mental health support Expanded benefits, expected to take effect in January 2025 pending approval of final criteria, include: Doubling reimbursements for personal and home maintenance expenses. Gift vouchers and flight subsidies of up to 5,000 shekels ($1,364). Two personal errand days during reserve duty. Hotel accommodations for Rosh Hashanah and Passover events. Workshops easing the transition out of reserve duty. Mental health support is a central component of the initiative. Col. Avishag Sabag Reuven, head of the reserves branch in the IDF, said updated 'Resilience' and 'Standing at the Gate' workshops will specifically address the needs of lone reservists. Col. Si Pivko, head of the IDF’s welfare and social services division, emphasized the military's commitment: 'Since the war began, we have distributed gift vouchers worth NIS 5 million to lone reservists, and we will continue to do so.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkgrgn2l1e	2025-01-08T20:25:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/BklqT11jdMyx/BklqT11jdMyx_0_0_1600_901_0_small.jpg

This country is the world's least antisemitic – can you guess whe...	Interview with Taiwanese Ambassador to Israel Ya-Ping (Abby) Lee: ‘A lot of Taiwanese see a reflection in Israel’ There are only 700 Jews living among Taiwan’s population of 23.5 million people, yet the country is considered one of the least, if not the least, antisemitic nations in the world. 'We are very honored to say that Taiwan is the least antisemitic country in the world,' said Taiwanese Ambassador to Israel Ya-Ping (Abby) Lee. Speaking on the most recent episode of the ILTV News Podcast, Lee noted that while there is no official ranking of least and most antisemitic countries, the travel risk map published by Israel’s National Security Council consistently shows Taiwan in green. This indicates zero risk for Jews or Israelis traveling to the country. Additionally, Taiwan received a badge of honor from a former Israeli ambassador for its efforts to incorporate Holocaust education into its curriculum and broader community. While Jews have likely lived in Taiwan sporadically over the years, it wasn’t until 2021 that the country’s first synagogue opened. Taiwan’s predominant religions are Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianity. The synagogue and cultural center in Taipei serves as a second home for Jewish residents and visitors, as well as a hub for locals to learn more about Jewish traditions. It includes a museum showcasing beautiful ancient Jewish artifacts discovered in the region and a kosher restaurant that offers a unique fusion of traditional Jewish and Taiwanese cuisine. 'The voice of the Jewish diaspora in Taiwan is getting stronger and stronger,' Lee emphasized. Although Israel is not among the dozen countries that have officially recognized Taiwan’s independence from China, the two nations share a close bond, Lee explained. This connection is rooted in their mutual struggles and opportunities to work together in complementary ways. 'A lot of Taiwanese see a reflection in Israel,' she told ILTV. 'While you are facing a lot of challenges externally, you are so united together in fighting for the survival of the country. This is the inspiration for Taiwanese society.' Though the countries are more than 8,000 kilometers apart, Lee described them as 'neighbors in values.' 'We share the same democratic values. We safeguard freedom and human rights, and of course, we are modern states. We face many challenges to our survival, but while dealing with those challenges, we never give up hope or our belief in humanity and resilience,' she said. Both nations also share a reliance on human capital due to a lack of natural resources. 'So both countries pay a lot of attention to education, and we know that we need to keep innovating in order to thrive under threat,' Lee explained.

The Secret Weapon for Israel's Future: Faith-Based Diplomacy Tucker Carlson, Anti-Zionism, and the Rise of the Woke Right: What’s Happening? Taiwan has demonstrated its support for Israel since October 7, providing financial and emotional assistance to convey that Israel is not alone. Just as Taiwanese sovereignty is not determined by the number of countries that recognize it, neither is Israel’s right to exist. 'It is not easy for small countries to deal with pressure from bullies, especially when these bullies have hybrid toolkits to coerce you, including military intimidation and economic coercion,' Lee said. 'But we know that democracy should speak with one voice. When the axis of upheavals works together, democracies should coordinate their actions, stand in solidarity, and reinforce one another.' Today, Taiwan is Israel’s fourth-largest market in Asia. Their tech ecosystems complement each other, with Taiwan excelling in hardware and Israel in software. Over the past three decades, the two nations have signed 34 government-to-government cooperation agreements across fields such as medicine, agriculture, and technology. 'We always believe that the cooperation between two countries can generate synergies beyond imagination,' Lee said. Israel also has much to learn from Taiwan. While Lee is the only female ambassador representing Taiwan in the Middle East, women make up 42% of Taiwan’s parliamentary members, compared to only 25% in Israel. 'We pay a lot of attention to women’s empowerment and strive to reinforce gender equality in Taiwan through government policies and social movements,' Lee said. Lee sees Israel as her 'home away from home.' She is impressed by the freshness and diversity of Israeli food and has developed a fondness for hummus and schnitzel, calling Israeli cuisine 'amazing.' 'Taiwan has always been called a paradise for foodies,' Lee quipped in conclusion, 'so my comment has some level of credibility.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1lwla28kl	2025-01-08T18:53:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/10/21/r1Po9pjJNj/r1Po9pjJNj_0_103_1000_563_0_small.jpg

The policy, effective immediately, applies to all personnel from the rank of brigadier general and below. It affects thousands of active-duty and reserve soldiers, including battalion, company and brigade commanders from standard units—not just elite forces—who frequently gave public interviews in the aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attack.

Inside Israel’s secret underground prison: How Israel detains Ham...	Smart cameras monitoring vital signs and 'minimal conditions under international law': Israel unveils Rakefet, its underground prison housing Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists, including October 7 massacre perpetrators The Israel Prison Service (IPS) provided a rare sneak peek at its 'Rakefet' wing on Wednesday, a highly classified underground complex at Nafha Prison, where dozens of Hamas Nukhba terrorists and Hezbollah’s Radwan unit members are held. The wing is one of the most advanced and secure in the IPS, equipped with cutting-edge technology. Smart cameras are installed in every cell, capable of monitoring and tracking every movement of the prisoners. The underground facility was reopened after it was shut down in the 1970s when it housed some of Israel’s most dangerous criminals, but its operations were halted following two major incidents: one, the murder of a criminal caught on the facility’s cameras, and the other, the smuggling of a gun to an inmate. After those events, the IPS decided to close the complex. However, due to the war and the detention of numerous terrorists, the wing has now been reopened for the incarceration of security prisoners. According to IPS, the conditions under which the terrorists are held are 'minimal' and comply with international law, with each prisoner receiving one hour of daily exercise. A prison official added that the conditions in the underground complex are basic, which allows for maximum control over the detainees, all while adhering to legal requirements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The conditions in the Rakefet wing are among the harshest in the IPS,' said the facility’s commander. 'The prisoners held here participated in the October 7 massacre, and they are extremely dangerous, highly trained operatives. The IPS must remain vigilant at all times, as extraordinary events can happen at any moment.' The wing is equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance systems, including biometric cameras installed in every cell to continuously monitor the prisoners’ presence and vital signs. These cameras allow the IPS to know exactly who is in each cell at any given time. 'The Rakefet wing is a perfect example of the IPS’s approach, using advanced technology to minimize the variety of security threats posed by its detainees,' said IPS Chief Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also commented on the facility, stating, 'This is the natural place for terrorists—underground.' He went on to express his hope that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would support the advancement of the death penalty for terrorists. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryetbshl1l	2025-01-08T12:16:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/r195Bm281g/r195Bm281g_0_217_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

To counter rising efforts targeting IDF troops abroad, military orders all combat personnel, from brigadier general and below, to remain anonymous; photos from combat zones require special approval, and legal briefings will precede any interviews In a significant directive issued Wednesday by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military will now conceal the identities of all soldiers and officers involved in operational combat activities. The move comes in response to increased efforts by anti-Israel activists to target IDF personnel abroad. The policy, effective immediately, applies to all personnel from the rank of brigadier general and below. It affects thousands of active-duty and reserve soldiers, including battalion, company and brigade commanders from standard units—not just elite forces—who frequently gave public interviews in the aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attack. While existing images and footage of these individuals will not be retroactively altered, all future appearances will adhere to the new guidelines. The IDF’s International Law Division will personally brief soldiers and officers before any interviews, and combat zone images featuring personnel will require special authorization before publication. The measure ensures that the identity of infantry soldiers will be protected as an Air Force pilot or a commander in the naval or commando units. Increased risks abroad The decision follows rising threats against IDF personnel traveling abroad, including from organizations like the Hind Rajab Foundation, reportedly operated by Lebanon-based pro-terror activists in Belgium. Recent complaints filed by the foundation led to a Brazilian judge ordering an investigation into an IDF soldier vacationing in the country, prompting the soldier to flee. Concerns over such incidents have grown since reports surfaced last month of soldiers being warned against travel due to the risk of arrest or interrogation. Some IDF personnel had to leave foreign countries abruptly, while others were advised against traveling altogether. The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, has intensified fears of international legal actions against IDF officers and soldiers. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF has long urged personnel who served in Gaza to avoid posting images or videos from the war, which could be used as evidence in war crimes investigations. Despite these warnings, many soldiers violated military orders, leading to the creation of 'blacklists' by pro-Palestinian organizations in Europe and elsewhere. These lists are compiled using social media content and other publicly available materials. To mitigate these risks, the IDF now evaluates travel requests on a case-by-case basis, particularly for those who served in Gaza. While soldiers are not explicitly banned from traveling abroad, the military assesses the risks for each applicant, focusing on commanders and combatants involved in Gaza operations. The new policy reflects the IDF’s growing concern over the potential misuse of images and information against its personnel in international legal proceedings. With pro-Palestinian groups operating a vast network across Europe and other regions, the military aims to shield its soldiers from legal and personal risks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkb5xv2uyl	2025-01-08T11:42:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/B1ADawTX1e/B1ADawTX1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Judge calls out unequal police treatment of anti-government and H...	Ultra-Orthodox boy, 14, arrested in Jerusalem light rail protest released under lenient conditions; judge accuses police of unequal enforcement, contrasting harsh treatment of ultra-Orthodox with leniency toward anti-government protesters A Jerusalem youth court judge sharply criticized police on Wednesday for their handling of a 14-year-old boy’s arrest during a protest against light rail construction in the city. Police alleged the teen assaulted a female officer during Monday’s demonstration, but the boy denied the claim, with his lawyer asserting he merely bumped into her while walking on the sidewalk. Judge Gad Arenberg released the teen under significantly lighter conditions than those sought by police and accused law enforcement of selective enforcement. 'The police’s approach to protesters is not uniform,' the judge said, referencing differences between protests involving ultra-Orthodox demonstrators and those in other areas, such as anti-government protests in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. At the hearing, police requested stringent release conditions, including full house arrest outside Jerusalem, a ban on participating in protests for 180 days, a third-party guarantee of 20,000 shekels ($5,200), and a cash deposit of 8,000 shekels ($2,100). Police argued the protests disrupted construction and traffic and had been declared illegal. However, they noted the boy said he had not participated in the protest. The teen’s lawyer, Shlomo Haddad, described him as an orphan who denied the allegations. Judge Arenberg reviewed the case and deemed the police’s demands excessive. 'The requested conditions exceed those typically imposed for other protests in places like Kaplan or Gaza Street. Release terms should not vary based on protesters’ religious affiliation or other characteristics,' he wrote in his decision. The judge ultimately imposed far lighter conditions, including a 60-day ban from the light rail construction site, a third-party guarantee of 5,000 shekels ($1,300), and a cash deposit of 1,000 shekels ($260). Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Four adults were also arrested during the protest. Police sought similar stringent release conditions for them, but Judge Arenberg reduced most of these demands, except for one detainee accused of assaulting an officer. The judge reiterated that conditions should be applied fairly across all protests, emphasizing, 'Every protester believes they are demonstrating for an issue important to them.' Attorney Haddad said: 'The court's release decision speaks for itself. The court criticized the police for acting inequitably, leaving no doubt that this is a case of selective enforcement against the ultra-Orthodox community concerning protests. The police treat Kaplan protesters and those advocating for the release of hostages with kid gloves while taking a far harsher approach toward the ultra-Orthodox community, including the use of unreasonable force.' He further claimed that indictments for similar charges have been filed only against ultra-Orthodox protesters. The Israel Police responded: 'First, we emphasize that any attempt to attribute selective enforcement to the police is unfounded and undermines the hard work of officers who operate day and night to ensure the safety of all citizens of Israel. The suspect was arrested during a violent disturbance involving physical confrontations with police, including attacks on officers using pepper spray, stone-throwing, and damage to light rail infrastructure. Two officers were injured during the incident, including a policewoman allegedly attacked by the suspect, who was arrested and brought before the court for release under conditions in consultation with the prosecution.' The police added: 'On December 24, the District Court ruled in an appeal concerning the release conditions set by the Magistrate’s Court (Judge Chavi Toker) on December 23 for individuals arrested during an unauthorized gathering. The court stated: 'The need for a suspect's arrest, as well as the conditions of their release, should not be determined based on sectoral affiliation. A detailed examination is required for each case and each respondent regarding the nature and strength of the detention grounds and the measures necessary to address them while avoiding undue harm to the suspect’s rights.'' The court’s decision regarding one of the respondents said: 'The respondent was found at an unauthorized gathering protesting light rail construction in Jerusalem. According to investigative materials, during the gathering—marked by derogatory chants toward police—he and others entered a pit at the site, resisted removal by interlocking arms with others, and was eventually removed by officers.' The police further noted: 'Operational reports show that the gathering disrupted work at the site, involved additional participants, and caused a road blockage. Such incidents frequently occur at light rail construction sites, posing a public interest in preventing their recurrence. This is necessary to avoid repeated disruptions to construction intended for the public’s benefit, road closures on major routes, and to free Jerusalem police—already stretched thin due to the ongoing war and security situation—for essential tasks.

IDF confirms 3 soldiers killed in Gaza tank blast	Staff Sgt. Matityahu Ya’akov Perel, 22, from Beit El, and Staff Sgt. Kenew Kasa, 22, from Beit Shemesh, both tank crew members in the 46th Battalion killed in Beit Hanoun; third soldier’s name unreleased Three Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday when a tank from the 46th Battalion of the IDF’s 401st Brigade hit a booby-trapped pit in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza, causing a large explosion, the military said. The names of two of the fallen soldiers have been released: Staff Sgt. Matityahu Ya’akov Perel, 22, from Beit El, and Staff Sgt. Kenew Kasa, 22, from Beit Shemesh, both tank crew members in the 46th Battalion. A third soldier’s name remains under a publication ban. Another soldier sustained serious injuries in the incident and was evacuated to a hospital, where his family was notified. Since the war began, 830 Israeli soldiers have been killed. The ground maneuver in Gaza, which started on October 27, 2023, has accounted for 395 of these fatalities. To date, 5,589 soldiers have been injured, including 822 seriously. Seventeen soldiers in serious condition remain hospitalized. The unit struck on Wednesday was operating under the Nahal Brigade’s reconnaissance forces as part of an ongoing operation targeting Hamas’ local battalion in Beit Hanoun. Explosives have emerged as a major threat in the area, the IDF said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Initial investigations revealed that two officers from the Nahal Brigade—Maj. Dvir Zion Revah and Capt. Eitan Israel Shiknazi—killed in combat on Monday, were also victims of explosive devices rather than anti-tank missiles as initially believed. The operation in Beit Hanoun, which began in late December, is one of the final key stages of the IDF’s campaign in northern Gaza, now in its third month. Soldiers have uncovered weapons stockpiles and operational tunnels still used by Hamas fighters. Last weekend, Kfir Brigade forces destroyed the 'Officers’ Neighborhood' in Beit Hanoun, a strategic area that overlooked the Israeli city of Sderot. Southern Command estimates that civilians will not be permitted to return to Beit Hanoun after the fighting concludes. Staff Sgt. Kenew Kasa leaves behind his parents, Sisay and Worknesh, and five siblings. Kasa is the 18th fallen soldier from Beit Shemesh since the start of the war. Mayor Shmuel Greenberg visited the family to offer condolences, saying, 'The war is not over, and each loss tears our hearts anew. This is a painful and profound loss for the family and the entire city. We embrace the family and stand by them during this difficult time.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ptdi28jg	2025-01-08T11:00:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/SkZSZI3Uyl/SkZSZI3Uyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israeli woman missing in Turkey after traveling with family accus...	Aliaa Sarsour, 20, from Kfar Qasim, last seen in Turkey in July 2024; father and brother charged with assaulting her months earlier—allegedly throwing a table, punching her and attempting to stab her—over suspicions of her speaking to a man Israeli authorities on Wednesday issued an appeal for public assistance in locating Aliaa Sarsour, a 20-year-old woman from Kafr Qasim, who has been missing since July 2024. She was last seen in Istanbul, Turkey, where she had traveled with her father and brother—both of whom are facing charges of assaulting her earlier this year. According to an indictment filed in March 2024, Sarsour’s father, Shahin Sarsour, and her brother, Ashraf Sarsour, allegedly assaulted and threatened her on multiple occasions, accusing her of communicating with men. In one incident, her brother reportedly locked her in a room after taking her phone and threatened her, saying, 'Wait until Father gets back—I’ll show you what I’ll do to you.' When her mother intervened, her brother refused to unlock the door. Upon the father’s return, he allegedly threw a table at Aliaa’s head, while her brother punched her.

The time to act is now': Israeli-American family fights for retu...	After having spoken on every possible platform, met with international leaders, and 30 days after receiving the news of their son's death on Oct. 7, they continue the fight for his return More than 30 days have passed since the Neutra family was informed of the devastating loss of their son, Captain Omer Neutra, 22, an IDF officer who was killed in action on October 7. Despite the news, Omer remains among the 100 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Omer’s parents, Orna and Ronen, launched a global campaign for his release, meeting with leaders in Israel, the U.S. and beyond, while sharing messages of hope for their son. The chief military rabbi confirmed Omer’s death after reviewing evidence from the attack. Born and raised in Long Island, NY, Omer moved to Israel as a lone soldier to enlist in the IDF, where he served as a tank commander. On October 7, he and his tank crew—Nimrod Cohen, Shaked Dahan and Oz Daniel—were abducted during the massacre. A haunting image of their burning tank, surrounded by cheering terrorists, became a grim symbol of that day. Nimrod Cohen is also believed to be in Gaza. 'For 422 days, we were fighting for Omer's life. We did not have a day or a night, sleepless nights, and our days were filled with meetings, travel, rallies and doing everything that we could that we felt was in our power to bring Omer back,' said Omer's father Ronen. 'When they notified us that he was killed on October 7, that was devastating. And he's not back yet. We still have to fight to bring him back and the State of Israel owes it to him to bring him back for proper burial with the respect that he deserves. He didn't have to do what he chose to do. He volunteered to be a protector because those were his values. And the fact that he's not back means that we still need to fight. We don't have the hope anymore to see him alive, but we owe it to him to bring him back.' How do you hold a shiva without a body? 'We were in shock. You want to run away from this news, you really don't want to deal with it, and you have to,' said Orna. 'In this crazy reality, outwardly, nothing has changed. They haven't brought Omer back. Omer is still in an unknown place in Gaza. we don't have him. There's no grave, no funeral, what do you do?' 'We made a decision that we would hold a shiva but we will continue to fight. We decided to split the shiva and do it in both New York and Israel. In the past year, since we received the news that Omer had been kidnapped, we have waged a very intense struggle, and in our path in this struggle, the entire Jewish American community and other communities have rallied around us, and they have basically asked us to hold a shiva in New York as well, because so many people want to come and comfort you,' she added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Thousands of people turned out to console the grieving parents. 'We decided to sit in a synagogue, in the community center,' says Ronen. 'We arrived on the first day and were in shock. At the entrance, hundreds of police officers and cavalry were waiting, similar to a procession of a fallen U.S. service member or police officer. The flag was lowered to half-mast, the governor came and sat with us. There was a minute of silence in Congress, and hundreds of people every day stood in long lines just waiting to come and shake our hands, to offer us 30 seconds of comfort. 'We realized that Omer is no longer just our child, he is a kind of symbol of the sacrifice and support of the Jewish community in Israel, the love for Israel, the sacrifice and heroism that Omer showed, and the symbolism that he transformed over these months into our struggle. We felt that we gave the community a place to show the pain and grief, the open wound that the hostages represent for the entire Jewish people, both in Israel and abroad.' Neutra, raised in New York and steeped in the values of the Conservative Jewish movement, was driven by deep Zionist convictions to make Israel his home. After completing a preparatory program, he remained in Israel, joining the IDF and serving as a soldier and commander in the Armored Corps. 'Omer is a very sociable person,' according to Orna. 'During the shiva and throughout this period, people told us how he influenced them, and their lives, how he changed them. He also did for Israel. He would speak about the country with true, deep love. He would say, 'Let me talk about my friend, Israel.'' 'Our son did not have to enlist,' Ronen continued. 'He did it out of pure Zionism, out of love for Israel and out of adherence to the values of mutual responsibility. The entire Jewish community in the United States is crying over Omer and everything that is happening in the country, all in solidarity. This wound of the hostages must be healed. And the way to heal it is for everyone to return, in the announcement that we have reached the end of the war, to move on. To rehabilitate society, to form a real commission of inquiry, to draw conclusions and make corrections. 'We still haven't received a serious investigation into what happened in our son's tank. It was only a few weeks ago that we heard the communication tape. We heard our son calling for help, asking them to come and rescue his soldier, who was killed there, and help didn't come. The crew was suffocating, Omer asked them to breathe through the air vents, while he continued to beg for help. And 15 months later, we are still fighting to bring him home.' The Israeli American Neutra family is waging their battle on two fronts, appealing to leadership in both Israel and the United States. 'We've actually been seeing this all year, at various points while we've met with ministers or the prime minister himself,' Orna says. 'The messages we're getting are that the conditions are not ripe for a deal, that there's more work to be done, that the IDF needs more achievements, and I think we've been through a lot in these 15 months, and the IDF has achieved a lot. And the reality has changed, and they're still not here. When Trump was elected, we thought there was momentum, and time was passing, and it's not happening. It's worrying, it's frustrating. The sense of urgency is that everything should have happened a long time ago, but nothing has happened yet. 'We are part of a struggle and part of a story. And it is completely clear to us that we have a role, we understood this from day one, that keeping the issue of the hostages in the United States in the apolitical discourse is perhaps one of the only issues that unites Democrats and Republicans. When President Trump was elected, we realized that we needed to push for the issue of the hostages not to wait until he took office, but for the teams to work on it together in advance. 'There was actually a meeting with Trump and President Biden, we met a few hours later with President Biden at the White House and he updated us on things. At the first candle of Hanukkah, we met with Netanyahu, and we decided to support him. To bring the public's pain that we felt in the shiva, and to tell him that it is time. They say that the conditions have ripened, will ripen, are ripening. Do you know what happens to fruit that ripens too much? He is falling.' 'It is worrying, because it could very well be that some of the living abductees will not return alive, and some of the dead will not return to their families and will not have a burial in the Land of Israel, and that scares us,' Omer's father concluded. 'Very much. So if the conditions are ripe - the time to act is now. It is not entirely clear how this will affect society going forward. I think the community we come from understands this well, I think most Israelis understand this, and still the Israeli government is taking its time.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj05111381e	2025-01-08T09:32:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/rJffWSV00Iyl/rJffWSV00Iyl_0_262_961_541_0_small.jpg
No IDF withdrawal without Lebanese Army action against Hezbollah,...	Officials stress IDF operations in Lebanon hinge on adherence to cease-fire, warning of escalation if framework collapses; concerns raised over Lebanese Army’s ability to counter Hezbollah, which seeks to return to southern Lebanon unarmed Israeli officials affirmed Wednesday that the military would not withdraw from its positions in southern Lebanon unless the Lebanese Army fulfills its obligations under a cease-fire agreement. A key provision of the accord requires Hezbollah’s removal from south of the Litani River, a condition that remains unmet. Hezbollah has reportedly expressed willingness to return to southern Lebanon unarmed, but Israel has rejected this, insisting on full compliance with the agreement. The deal also prohibits the rebuilding of buildings previously used for terrorist activities. Israeli officials have clarified that such sites, deemed 'terrorist infrastructure,' will not be restored. Concerns over the Lebanese Army’s effectiveness were raised during a Security Cabinet meeting. 'They are weak,' an Israeli official said, adding that Christian-led units take action, whereas those led by Shia commanders often cooperate with Hezbollah. While the U.S.-led enforcement mechanism is seen as sound, its reliance on the Lebanese Army has proven less effective than anticipated. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite these challenges, senior officials stressed that breaking the cease-fire agreement is not Israel’s objective. 'We don’t want this scenario but must be ready,' said an Israeli official, noting the IDF’s operational plans to expand maneuvers if the agreement collapses. Ensuring the safety of returning residents, they said, remains a top priority. Border disputes and strategic positions Negotiations over contested border points continue to create tension. Lebanon has raised claims to 13 specific locations, while Israel has sought adjustments of its own. According to Lebanon’s pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar newspaper, the cease-fire oversight committee approved the IDF’s continued presence at three strategic positions in southern Lebanon beyond the agreement’s 60-day framework. The report identified the sites as Labbouneh Forest near Israel’s western Galilee, Jabal Balat opposite the Israeli border towns of Shtula and Zar'it, and Tallat al-Hamams overlooking Metula. Meanwhile, the IDF remains active in southern Lebanon. Over the past 24 hours, Israeli forces destroyed five weapons storage facilities, according to a military spokesperson. Troops from the 300th Brigade's Combat Team under the 146th Division continue operations aimed at dismantling terror infrastructure while adhering to the cease-fire terms. Israel’s approach reflects a balance between upholding the agreement and safeguarding its security. Officials emphasized that any withdrawal is contingent on strict adherence to the cease-fire provisions by all parties involved. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj1sgw2iyg	2025-01-08T09:08:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/SynNRBPb8ke/SynNRBPb8ke_0_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Amnesty International suspends Israel chapter over 'racism' alleg...	Human rights NGO claims Israeli branch discriminated against Palestinian workers and failed to follow organizational messaging in reports; Amnesty Israel denies allegations Amnesty International has suspended its Israeli chapter for two years, citing allegations of discrimination against Palestinians and discrepancies between its internal reports and the organization's global line, which accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Amnesty Israel rejected claims of discrimination against Palestinian employees. While agreeing with the global organization's conclusions on violations of international law, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing by Israel, Amnesty Israel contested the genocide allegation, arguing that there’s insufficient evidence to support the claim. The Israeli chapter also expressed dissatisfaction with the global organization’s disregard for Israeli victims of the October 7 massacre, further straining relations. The New York Post addressed the controversy in an editorial published Tuesday, quoting opinion columnist Seth Mandel, who said the 'supposed ‘human rights’ organization' now operates on authoritarian principles.' The suspension marks a new low in the already strained relationship between Amnesty International's global leadership and its Israel branch, which has operated since 1964 and is one of the movement's oldest. The decision followed accusations from the global leadership that Amnesty Israel acted in a racist manner toward Palestinians and failed to align its reports with the organization’s official stance. Amnesty Israel denied these accusations, asserting that it has internal mechanisms for consulting both Palestinian and Jewish employees. One major point of contention was Amnesty’s 2022 apartheid report, which the Israeli branch criticized for presenting a biased and one-sided perspective. Another flashpoint was a 2023 report accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, which Amnesty Israel dismissed as inadequately substantiated. In addition to ideological differences, the Israeli chapter voiced frustration over the global organization's neglect of Israeli victims in Hamas' October 7 attack. While Amnesty International focused on the Palestinian angle, the local branch felt Israeli victims were almost entirely ignored. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The suspension has sparked internal discord within the NGO itself. Some international organization insiders alleged that the racism accusations against the Israeli branch were premeditated, part of a broader pattern by the leadership to disproportionately focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the expense of other issues. Amnesty Israel officials have even threatened to cease operations entirely unless there’s a significant shift in its relationship with the international leadership. At the same time, internal critics argued that the local chapter failed to integrate sufficient Palestinian representation in senior roles, contributing to internal tensions. According to Amnesty International Board Interim Chair Tiumalu Lauvale Peter Fa'afiu, the suspension of the Israeli branch aims to preserve the organization’s moral and structural integrity. Operating with significant autonomy, the Israeli branch is expected to continue its activities but faces considerable uncertainty regarding its future within the global organization and its financial sustainability. Amnesty International plans to discuss the suspension in a special meeting on January 21, during which it will determine if and how the Israeli branch may resume full participation under the organizational umbrella in the future. The current crisis between Amnesty International and its Israeli chapter stems from deep disagreements over the situation in Gaza. In early December, the global organization released a scathing report titled 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman,' accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Based on interviews with hundreds of witnesses and victims' families, the report asserted that Israel is acting in violation of the Genocide Convention and treating Palestinians as 'subhumans.' Amnesty Israel rejected the allegations, criticizing the global body for ignoring the victims of the October 7 massacre. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byw32rii1g	2025-01-08T05:12:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/SkEwFMd8Jx/SkEwFMd8Jx_0_285_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Deep, dark son of a b***h': Trump shares anti-Netanyahu video on...	Days before White House return, Donald Trump shares video of Jewish professor accusing Netanyahu of expansionist aims, undue US influence and 'genocide' in Gaza, sparking renewed debate on Trump's stance on Israel U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump may be reigniting tensions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after sharing a video on his social media featuring a scathing critique of the Israeli leader by Columbia University Professor Jeffrey Sachs, who is Jewish. In the video, Sachs refers to Netanyahu as a 'deep, dark son of a b***h' and accuses him of being responsible for the wars in Syria and Iraq, as well as for pushing the U.S. into a potential conflict with Iran. The video, recorded on October 22, features Sachs claiming that Netanyahu has pursued a policy since the 1990s aimed at dismantling regimes that support Hamas and Hezbollah—Iran, Iraq and Syria. According to Sachs, Netanyahu was instrumental in driving U.S. involvement in wars in those countries. 'The guy is nothing if not obsessive,' Sachs says in the video. 'He’s still trying to get us to fight Iran this day, this week. He’s a deep, dark son of a b***h, I’m sorry to tell you, because he’s gotten us into endless wars. And because of the power of all of this in U.S. politics, he's gotten his way.' The video sparked immediate backlash on social media, with many questioning why Trump’s campaign chose to share such a harsh critique from one of Israel’s most vocal detractors, especially in the wake of the October 7 attacks. Some interpreted the move as a clear signal that Trump intends to distance himself from Netanyahu, while others saw it as a calculated step in the complex relationship between the two leaders. Trump has consistently advocated for ending wars in the Middle East and stated during his campaign that he has no intention of starting new wars—only ending them. However, he has refrained from committing to withholding U.S. support for an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has been strained in recent years, particularly after Trump accused Netanyahu of 'disloyalty' for congratulating Joe Biden on his 2020 presidential, which the Republican leader continues to contest. Interestingly, Trump’s post, which accompanied Sachs’s video, did not directly reference Netanyahu. Instead, it targeted former U.S. President Barack Obama and the American media. The post, originally shared by the 'Wall Street Apes' page, read: 'Jeffrey Sachs details how Barack Obama ordered the CIA to overthrow the Syrian government, and the American media covered it up. He says journalists either lie when blaming Russia or are unimaginably ignorant, claiming Russia intervened in Syria.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Prof. Sachs continued: 'Obama tasked the CIA to overthrow the Syrian government, starting four years before Russia intervened. What kind of nonsense is that? How many times did The New York Times report on operation Timber-Sycamore, which was the Presidential order to the CIA to overthrow Bashar al-Assad?' Sachs, known for his frequent criticism of Israel in interviews and public forums, opposes Israel’s actions in Gaza and efforts to eliminate Hamas. He has accused Israel of committing genocide and pursuing ethnic cleansing in Gaza, alleging tacit support from Washington. Sachs further claims Syria’s collapse is part of a strategic plan by Netanyahu to expand Israel’s borders. According to him, Israel rejects a two-state solution because Netanyahu seeks perpetual control over all territory between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjbipri8kg	2025-01-08T04:26:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/HyuVqARN1x/HyuVqARN1x_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
OpenAI boss denies sexually assaulting his sister after she files...	OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman has denied sexually abusing his sister when she was a child, after she filed a lawsuit in the United States accusing him of regularly sexually abusing her between 1997 and 2006. The lawsuit, filed by Ann Altman's lawyers in a U.S. District Court in Missouri, alleges counts of sexual assault and sexual battery which began when she was three and her brother was 12. It alleges the abuse continued once he became an adult and while she was still a minor. 'All of these claims are utterly untrue,' Sam Altman said in a joint statement with his mother and two brothers published on X on Jan. 7. Sam Altman, one of the co-founders of OpenAI alongside Elon Musk and others, has become one of the world's biggest tech names since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT tool in 2022. He is estimated to be worth over $1 billion, according to Forbes. His sister's lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $75,000, punitive damages, and for the costs of the lawsuit. It also requests a jury trial. The lawsuit stated that as a result of the abuse she alleges, Ann Altman had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, severe emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression, which was expected to continue into the future.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjxdylnuyx	2025-01-08T04:12:50-08:00

An IDF spokesman said that Earlier on Wednesday, under intelligence guidance from the Military Intelligence Service, the Shin Bet and the Homefront Command, a fighter jet attacked Hamas terrorists operating in a command and control complex at a location that previously served as the Halawa school in the Jabaliya area. 'The terrorists used the school complex to plan and execute terrorist acts against IDF forces and the State of Israel. Prior to the attack, many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians, including aerial observation and additional intelligence information,' according to the IDF spolesman.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sktm713lkg	2025-01-08T02:39:19-08:00

Winter surge in respiratory illness in China and elsewhere not un...	Rising cases of common respiratory illnesses in China and elsewhere around the Northern Hemisphere are within the range expected for winter, with no unusual outbreaks reported, the World Health Organization said. Reports of a surge of cases in China of human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a common respiratory infection, have drawn headlines worldwide, with reports of overwhelmed hospitals recalling the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic just over five years ago. However, the WHO said in a statement on Tuesday evening that it was in contact with Chinese health officials and had not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns there. The Chinese authorities have also informed the U.N. health agency that the health system is not overwhelmed and no emergency responses have been triggered. HMPV typically causes cold-like symptoms for a few days but can in rare cases lead to hospitalization among the very young, old or medically vulnerable. Unlike the virus that caused COVID-19, which was new, hMPV was first identified in 2001 and has likely been circulating for much longer, scientists said. A number of other countries, including India and the United Kingdom, have also reported rising cases of hMPV this winter, as well as other respiratory infections, in line with seasonal trends that can sometimes stretch hospitals.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjm7zy381g	2025-01-08T02:33:04-08:00	
Hostage Sagi never met his daughter: Lives of hostages on hold as...	Shahar never met her father, Sagi, and is already a year old; Ofer was not released from captivity with his son, Erez, and missed his bar mitzvah; Agam's twin sister completed the officers course they both dreamed of For 460 days, the families of the hostages have been waiting for their relatives to return home. In the meantime, while their lives have been stopped, the lives of their families continue without them, and they celebrate important events with endless longing and great hope of hugging them again soon. A birthday for a daughter that Sagi doesn't know Avital Dekel Chen hoped for a Hanukkah miracle that would bring her husband, Sagi, back to her, so that he would be by her side at the birth of their third daughter. But he didn't return, and Shahar was born without a father. More than a year has passed since then, and Sagi was not there on her first birthday either. 'It's a sad moment,' says Avital, 'The most important person to Shahar is an hour's drive away and can't come.' The Dekel Chen family has a tradition of making an album on birthdays with photos from the past year, but Shahar's album doesn't have a single photo with her father. 'I included Sagi's presence in the greeting I wrote for her, and I signed it off by saying that Dad and Mom love her very much. And it's so true. If there's anything that motivates Sagi to survive, it's the fact that a wife and three children are waiting for him here,' she said. Alma still calls for her father Alma Miran began to speak when she was a year old. Her first word was Or, then Mama. Her father, Omri Miran, was kidnapped when she was six months old. He doesn't know what her voice sounds like. 'When she said 'Mama', it made me happy, but it also hurt. What kind of child says 'Mama' before 'Daddy'? It's much harder,' says Lishay, Omri's wife. 'I realized I needed to use the word Daddy more often around her. The first time she said Daddy, when she looked at a picture of Omri, it moved me more than any word she said before or after. More than half his life in captivity Kfir Bibas was kidnapped when he was nine months old. 'Kfir marked his first birthday last year while he was in captivity,' says his aunt Ofri. 'He marked it separately from his father, his family and his home. He didn't receive gifts or a cake, and he didn't blow out a candle.' Crowds celebrated his birthday all over the world. Orange balloons, like his red hair, were released into the air. Child stars dedicated songs to him. 'A year ago, our wish for him was that he would come back to us,' his aunt said. A year has passed and he's still hostage there. 'Even his second birthday was taken away from him,' says Ofri. Kfir and his brother, Ariel, are the last children left in Gaza. In 10 days, Kfir will be two years old, spending more than half of his life in captivity. Bar mitzvah with a father in Gaza At a bar mitzvah, an event that symbolizes entrance into the adult world, it is customary for a father to accompany his son. But when Erez Calderon went to the synagogue about two months ago, his uncle Nissan Calderon stood by his side. Erez was forced to grow up even earlier, when he was kidnapped with his father, Ofer, and his sister, Sahar, from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Sahar and Erez were released in the hostage deal more than a year ago, Ofer was left behind in the Hamas tunnels. 'We hoped so much that after a whole year in the Hamas tunnels his father would return for a big hug with his family,' said Hadas, Erez's mother, at the time. 'It didn't happen. Enough! Bring back our Ofer.' Completing officers' course alone Agam Berger had been planning her military service since she started the pre-military preparatory school. In the past 15 months, Agam has missed the opportunity for command. She was kidnapped from the base she arrived at just two days earlier. Her twin sister, Li-Yam, enlisted before her.

Iran ponders relocating capital from Tehran to southern region	Amid population density and environmental challenges, Iran is considering moving its capital to the Makran region near the Gulf of Oman; Supporters cite strategic and economic benefits, while critics warn of high costs and logistical issues Iran is planning to relocate its capital, moving it from Tehran to the southern region of the country, according to the Islamic Republic's government spokesperson. 'The new capital will definitely be in the south, in the Makran region, and we are currently working on this matter,' government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Tuesday. According to Mohajerani, two committees have been established to assess the feasibility of the move. She emphasized that while changing the capital is not an urgent issue, it is important for experts to thoroughly examine the matter, given Tehran’s high population density and the environmental challenges the city is facing. Residents of Tehran are currently dealing with power outages and a water crisis. The government spokesperson noted that, while the government aims to address Tehran's problems, it is also exploring ways to utilize resources in other parts of the country. Iranian media reported that discussions about changing the capital have been ongoing periodically since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 but were abandoned due to economic constraints and logistical challenges. The issue resurfaced during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, driven by concerns over earthquakes in Tehran. Former president Hassan Rouhani also raised the topic, and now it is being addressed by the current administration under President Masoud Pezeshkian.

Italian journalist released from Iranian prison	Italian journalist Cecilia Sala has been freed from detention in Iran and is flying home, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said in a statement on Wednesday. Sala, 29, who had been working under a regular journalistic visa, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19 and held in solitary confinement in the Iranian capital's notorious Evin prison. Sala was detained three days after an Iranian businessman, Mohammad Abedini, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa Airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2024 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. The Italian statement said Sala had been freed 'thanks to intense work on diplomatic and intelligence channels'.

UNRWA scandal grows as ties to Hamas, other terror groups exposed	UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, faces allegations of ties with Hamas and other terrorist groups; A new report accuses the agency of enabling terrorist influence on its policies and decisions, sparking global criticism and calls for accountability The nongovernmental organization UN Watch, which monitors UN activities, has published a report exposing the alleged collaboration between UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) and Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terror groups. The agency, which employs 30,000 staff and oversees an annual budget of $1.5 billion funded by Western countries, reportedly allowed terrorist organizations to influence its policies and operations. The report released on Tuesday reveals that UNRWA employees, including senior local managers, regularly met with representatives of terrorist organizations in Lebanon and Gaza. During these meetings, they praised each other for their cooperation and referred to one another as 'partners.' The report claims that terrorist organizations often made demands of UNRWA and influenced its decisions. Furthermore, when UNRWA proposed actions such as suspending employees who promoted terrorism or publishing a code of ethics that included LGBTQ rights, these decisions frequently were blocked through threats. UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer commented on the findings. 'This report reveals how UNRWA's senior management knowingly employs those connected to Hamas' terror activities and allows terrorist organizations to influence the agency's policies and critical decisions.' Last month, Neuer harshly criticized the UN, saying: 'It is absurd that in 2024, out of 23 UN General Assembly resolutions criticizing countries, 17 of them – almost three-quarters – focused on one country, Israel.' According to the report, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini reached an agreement with terrorist organizations during a meeting in Beirut in May 2024. As part of this agreement, UNRWA allowed senior Hamas official Fathi Al-Sharif, identified by Hamas as the movement's leader in Lebanon, to remain a school principal and head of UNRWA's teachers' union, a role influencing thousands of teachers and students. Only after the Israeli government filed an official complaint against him did the agency impose a mild punishment, suspending Al-Sharif. Hamas and other organizations responded to the suspension by shutting down UNRWA operations in Lebanon and organizing widespread demonstrations involving teachers and students. Lazzarini flew to Beirut and met with the coalition of terrorist organizations behind the strike. Local media reported that 'understandings' were reached, leading to a 'positive outcome' for Al-Sharif and the strike's termination. On September 30, 2024, Al-Sharif was killed by an Israeli missile strike. Hamas eulogized him, describing him as someone who provided his students with 'Jihadi education.' The report also highlighted how UNRWA regional managers routinely held meetings with local terrorist leaders for 'cooperation and coordination.' In a November 2017 meeting, local terrorist leaders told the UNRWA manager in Sidon, Fawzi Kassab, that UNRWA must continue to operate until Palestinian refugees 'return to their homes.' They warned that if donors ceased funding, Palestinians would launch a 'popular revolution.' Former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl met with Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders in February 2017, emphasizing the 'spirit of partnership' between them and the agency. He encouraged the terrorist leaders to secretly appeal any agency decisions they opposed and assured them that he could reverse such decisions following their appeals. Krähenbühl also requested that the groups ensure their discussions remain confidential to protect UNRWA's credibility. Krähenbühl, who was forced to resign in 2019 due to corruption and sexual harassment scandals, was controversially appointed this year as the Director-General of the International Committee of the Red Cross, a move that sparked strong protests from 17 U.S. senators. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In June 2022, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini emphasized the importance of 'partnership' and regularly met with terrorist organizations under the framework of the 'Joint Refugee Committee,' headed by Mahmoud Khalaf, a member of the central committee of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which the U.S. and EU classify as a terrorist organization. UNRWA managers participated in Hamas' annual conference, where internal agency matters, such as job vacancies and teachers' union elections, were discussed. At the 2021 conference, senior Hamas official Ahmad Abd Al-Hadi announced the establishment of a joint committee tasked with 'overseeing relations with UNRWA and ensuring it fulfills its commitments.' UNRWA's director in Lebanon, Claudio Cordone, visited the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp in February 2022 to meet with a coalition of terrorist organizations, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Houthis. During the meeting, he was reportedly told that 'the Palestinian issue in Lebanon is political and cannot be reduced to a humanitarian or security matter.' Similarly, in January 2018, Cordone met with Al-Hadi, who stated that they support UNRWA because it 'serves as a living testimony to the 1948 Nakba.' Contrary to the narrative presented to the world, the report suggests that UNRWA's main purpose is not humanitarian aid but rather advancing the narrative that the establishment of Israel was an 'injustice' and that Palestinians will one day dismantle Israel. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, responded to the report. 'If the world needed more evidence proving UNRWA is Hamas, here it is, laid out before you. It can no longer be denied that all that remains of UNRWA is its name. The State of Israel will not cooperate with humanitarian organizations managed by terrorist groups.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s16kt9suyg	2025-01-08T01:40:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/SJTvagjLJl/SJTvagjLJl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

An Australian student missing for two weeks near the country's tallest mountain was found on Wednesday, after surviving by foraging for berries, drinking water from a creek and finding two muesli bars left behind by other hikers, police said. Hadi Nazari, a 23-year-old university student from Melbourne, went missing from his group of friends on December 26 in the Kosciuszko National Park. Nazari was found on Wednesday afternoon by a group of hikers who alerted the authorities, police in the state of New South Wales said. 'This is the fourteenth day we've been looking for him and for him to come out and be in such good spirits and in such great condition, it's incredible,' NSW Police Inspector Josh Broadfoot said. The student was in 'really good spirits' with no significant injuries, he added. More than 300 people had searched for Nazari across rugged bushland, police said. The national park is home to the 2,228 metre (7,310 foot) Mount Kosciuszko.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj4s7as8jx	2025-01-08T01:31:30-08:00	
Trump will not rule out force to take Panama Canal, Greenland	Incoming U.S. president hints at possibility of turning Canada into an American state and changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America', part of a broader expansionist agenda he has promoted since winning re-election U.S. President-elect Donald Trump refused on Tuesday to rule out using military or economic action to pursue the acquisition of the Panama Canal and Greenland, part of a broader expansionist agenda he has promoted since winning the November 5 election. Trump, who takes office on January 20, also floated the idea of turning Canada into a U.S. state, said he would demand far higher defense spending from NATO allies and promised to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Still two weeks away from taking office, Trump has begun outlining an aggressive foreign policy with little regard to diplomatic considerations or the concerns of U.S. allies. Asked at a press conference at his Florida resort whether he could assure the world he would not use military or economic coercion as he tries to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, Trump said, 'No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security.' Trump criticized American spending on Canadian goods and military support for Canada, saying the U.S. derives no benefits from doing so, and called the border between the two countries an 'artificially drawn line.' He suggested he would impose tariffs on Denmark if it resists his offer to purchase Greenland, which he said is vital to U.S. national security. Shortly before Trump's comments, his son Don Jr. arrived in Greenland for a private visit. Denmark has said Greenland, a self-governing part of its kingdom, is not for sale. 'I don't think it's a good way forward to fight each other with financial means when we are close allies and partners,' Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said late on Tuesday in response to Trump's comments.

IDF scrambles to combat flood of weapons into the West Bank	Troops stationed there face difficulties in capturing armed terrorists and stopping their suppliers, who smuggle weapons from Iran via Jordan; Regular infantry battalions will return from Gaza to the West Bank for the first time since October 7 As the IDF continues its operations in the West Bank trying to prevent murderous attacks such as the one that resulted in the murder of three Israelis on Monday, it still faces difficulties stopping the flood of illegal weapons making their way to the West Bank from Iran via the Jordanian border. The IDF Central Command refers to these efforts as the 'weapons campaign,' citing the over 1,100 rifles seized by troops in the past year through round-the-clock operations across the West Bank. However, a critical unknown factor remains: the IDF can't estimate the total number of weapons held by Palestinians in the West Bank, beyond the thousands of licensed firearms in the possession of Palestinian Authority security forces. According to an intelligence assessment by Central Command from two years ago, one in six Palestinian households in the West Bank contains an illegal weapon, ranging from handguns and makeshift rifles to standard AK47s or M-16s. 'We know we're on the right track based on weapon prices, which have surged this past year — from 30,000 shekels ($8,200) per long-barreled rifle to 60,000–70,000 shekels ($19,200),' a senior military official said this week. 'But when we get intel on a weapons dealer or a handgun hidden in the garden of an unregistered Palestinian, likely intended for self-defense, we'll prioritize catching the dealer.' The IDF's goal is to maintain the West Bank as a secondary front. Despite this, offensive actions within Palestinian areas remain constant, including eliminations taking place almost weekly. Presently, the IDF deploys around 20 battalions for security duties in the West Bank. While this figure is lower than during peak terrorism levels two years before the Gaza war, it remains 7–8 battalions higher than the low point in the late 2010s. However, constraints are evident. Most of these battalions are composed of reservists or units outside the compulsory infantry or armored corps, and reinforcements from Gaza are only expected next month. The Nahal Brigade's battalions will deploy to areas like Hebron and Nablus. Artillery forces are gradually returning to West Bank security tasks as they wind down operations in other arenas. 'We're acutely aware of the implications of a West Bank escalation requiring large-scale reinforcements and diverting resources and attention from Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, which remain the General Staff's primary fronts,' the military clarified. The IDF's main challenge involves handling armed processions in Palestinian cities in broad daylight. Recent efforts in the military push for units to act harshly against such displays, even if they take place during funerals. However, such attempts have so far failed: Troops dispatched to ambush armed individuals were detected, causing the armed groups to disperse quickly. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'They're careful to march near children, ensuring they're photographed. It's unclear if we'd gain anything by eliminating two armed individuals at the cost of harming three nearby children,' the military explained. They clarified that many previously avoided measures are now being implemented. Despite the increasing threat posed by high-grade explosive devices, APC deployments remain absent. Tanks also aren't expected to return to the West Bank anytime soon — last seen there during the Second Intifada in 2000 — even after an anti-tank missile was discovered in the Jenin refugee camp. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hydvocji1e	2025-01-07T23:28:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/BkMjw4YWLkx/BkMjw4YWLkx_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

This is why some of the Israeli hostages may never come home	Experts explain why the odds of rescuing all 100 hostages still held in Gaza are slim A hostage deal is looming, expected to coincide with President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. But hopes for the release of all 100 Israeli hostages are fading fast. Despite any concessions Israel may offer, experts warn the chances of bringing everyone home are slim — a sobering reality in the aftermath of the devastating October 7 attacks. 'I always talk about the release of hostages rather than the release of the hostages,' cautioned professional negotiator Moty Cristal, a seasoned expert who served on Israeli negotiation teams with Jordan and the Palestinians from 1994 to 2001. For the past 16 months, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been working tirelessly to broker a hostage-for-cease-fire deal aimed at ending the war and securing the return of Israeli captives. Their efforts have so far yielded only one breakthrough: a week-long pause in November 2023, during which 80 Israeli hostages and about two dozen others were freed in exchange for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed cautious optimism, stating that a deal was within reach. However, he acknowledged that it might only materialize after President Joe Biden leaves office under Donald Trump's administration. Speaking in Seoul, Blinken emphasized: 'We very much want to bring this over the finish line in the next two weeks,' adding that any agreement would align with Biden’s plan, which has garnered broad international support. Biden’s proposal calls for an end to the fighting in Gaza, where Israel has spent 16 months dismantling Hamas’ military infrastructure. The campaign followed the brutal October 7 massacre, during which over 6,000 Gazans – half of them armed terrorists – stormed into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people. Another 251 Israelis and foreign nationals were abducted and taken into Gaza. Today, 96 hostages remain, in addition to four Israelis captured and killed in earlier conflicts, including Lt. Hadar Goldin and 1st Sgt. Oren Shaul. The IDF estimates that at least a third of the remaining captives are dead. On Monday, a Saudi news agency leaked a list of hostages reportedly slated for release in the first phase of any agreement. The list included women, children, elderly individuals, and those in poor health. However, it was unclear which of the people on the list were alive or dead. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) quickly clarified that the list, widely circulated in the media, had not been provided by Hamas. Instead, Israel originally shared it with mediators back in July 2024. 'As yet, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment from Hamas regarding the status of the hostages on the list,' the PMO stated. However, an Israeli source later told a local outlet that Hamas had indeed passed on a list of hostages. In addition, on Sunday, a Hamas official, speaking to Reuters, insisted that any agreement would still have to hinge on Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and the establishment of a permanent cease-fire. The challenge, experts say, is that even if Hamas wanted to return all the hostages, it might not be able to. Gershon Baskin, director of the International Communities Organization Middle East and a negotiator involved in the 2011 release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from Hamas captivity, is certain of this. 'I 500% believe Hamas doesn’t know where all the hostages are,' he said. 'There’s no reason to doubt that,' Baskin explained. 'Hamas controls very little of the Gaza Strip. Most of it – 80% of the buildings – has been bombed or destroyed. Thousands of Gazans are missing, buried under rubble, with their families having no idea where they are. The hostages are likely buried under the rubble as well.' Complicating matters, not all the hostages were taken by Hamas. Other terrorist organizations abducted some, while others were seized by civilians unaffiliated with any group. Since the IDF began operations in Gaza, Hamas’s central command has been dismantled. According to Baskin, the group now lacks any functional communication system – digital or analog – to coordinate with its members. Hamas itself admitted in September that it needed a week of cease-fire just to locate the hostages. Baskin believes this was no exaggeration. Tragically, he added, it’s highly probable that some hostages’ bodies will never be recovered, leaving their fates forever unknown. However, even if the hostages could be located, it is unlikely that Israel can or will agree to the terms Hamas would demand to release everyone: a total cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. Cristal explained that throughout the history of hostage negotiations, one golden rule was consistently followed: The release of Israeli hostages was always exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. 'It was always kept on the humanitarian level – purely people for people,' Cristal said. 'Any attempt to provide additional considerations – political considerations, like territory or any other consideration – was rejected by Israel.' This approach changed in February 2024 when the Biden administration linked the release of hostages to a cease-fire agreement, pressuring Israel to accept the plan. 'By linking the release of prisoners to the end of the war, you actually gave a structure of veto power to both [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and Hamas,' Cristal said. Ending the war completely is not in Israel’s national interest because Hamas remains a significant threat in both Gaza and the West Bank, despite Israel’s efforts to weaken it. Israel will, for a long time if not forever, need to maintain military pressure to deter the organization and protect its citizens. Cristal explained that tying hostage releases to a full cessation of hostilities ensures either that no deal will ever be reached or that Hamas will perpetually hold bodies or live hostages as bargaining chips to halt Israeli military action. 'That is the root of a bad deal – a really bad deal,' Cristal said. 'We will need to live with many, many Ron Arads, Goldins, and Shauls.' Ron Arad was an Israeli Air Force officer who disappeared during a mission over Lebanon in 1986 and is believed to have been captured by terrorists before being handed over to Hezbollah. Cristal argued that Israel could have secured the hostages' release through smaller, incremental deals. Critics of partial agreements say they are immoral because they leave some hostages behind. However, Cristal countered, 'I say, take out whoever you can, whenever you can. But that was not the paradigm' proposed by Biden and Blinken, he said. Instead, their approach has prolonged both the negotiations and the war. Now, with Donald Trump preparing to take office, the paradigm is shifting once again. On Monday night, Trump warned again that Hamas will 'have hell to pay' if it fails to release the hostages. In the Middle East, Trump is perceived as a strong leader, even in parts of the Arab world. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gershon Baskin noted that the Biden administration never had significant leverage over Hamas and has not fully utilized the leverage it has over Israel. Trump, while also having minimal influence over Hamas, is expected to exert greater albeit covert pressure on Israel. Both Baskin and Cristal predict that Trump will push Israel to declare an end to the war in exchange for the release of most living hostages and some bodies. This outcome could be temporary and will likely leave some hostages behind. Cristal suggested that the intensification of negotiations is less about Hamas’ weakness or desire to end the war and more about the mounting pressure on Netanyahu. He may now feel compelled to finalize a deal that could be credited to Trump by or shortly after January 20. 'Netanyahu might be willing to make compromises that he wasn’t willing to make until now [for Trump],' Baskin explained. 'What’s different now from everything in the past few months is January 20.' 'The entrance of Trump might be what clinches a deal,' he concluded.

EU won't tolerate attacks on its borders, French foreign minister...	The European Union will not let other nations attack its sovereign borders, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said in response to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's comments on Greenland regarding the 'ownership and control' of the vast Arctic island that has been part of Denmark for over 600 years. 'There is obviously no question that the European Union would let other nations of the world attack its sovereign borders, whoever they are...

Wanted IDF soldier who escaped Brazil lands in Israel	Yuval Vagdani, a Nova massacre survivor, was wanted in Brazil after a complaint was filed against him for videos he posted from Gaza; He fled to Argentina, the U.S., and has now landed back in Israel Yuval Vagdani is an IDF soldier who was wanted in Brazil, from where he fled with the help of the Foreign Ministry after a complaint was filed against him for videos from the Gaza Strip that he posted online. On Wednesday, the family agreed to publish his name after he landed in Israel. After leaving Brazil he reached Argentina and continued to the U.S. before returning to Israel. 'We are all excited that he returned home safely,' said Itzik, Yuval's father, and thanked those involved who helped him reach Israel. Yuval is a survivor of the Nova massacre, and now that he has returned home, he has told his family that he will no longer upload videos from Gaza. 'He will never return to Brazil again,' said his father. 'He will learn from the mistakes he made. The main thing is that he has now returned to Israel and we are all happy that everything is behind us. The people of Israel live and are strong and we will prevail.' Brazil's federal court has ordered the local police to open an investigation against Vagdani, who arrived in the country with his friends on vacation after completing his military service about a week ago. Luckily, the he managed to leave Brazil with his friends before they were arrested. The judge's decision followed a complaint filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), which focuses on legal proceedings against IDF soldiers who, according to the foundation, 'committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Palestine.' According to the foundation, named after a 6-year-old Palestinian girl who was allegedly killed by IDF fire during the war in the Gaza Strip, the Brazilian government decided to take action following a complaint it filed against Vagdani, who arrived in the country as a tourist. The foundation's complaint claimed his actions were part of a broader effort and constituted 'genocide and crimes against humanity' under international law. Among the evidence provided by the foundation were videos and photographs that allegedly show Vagdani planting explosives in November 2024 and taking part in the destruction of 'entire neighborhoods' in Gaza, which were reportedly used as shelters for Palestinians displaced from their homes. On Tuesday, local media in Brazil reported that the federal police had asked the court to reconsider its order to open a criminal investigation against Vagdani, claiming that the case required a more in-depth investigation before it could proceed to a real investigation. The background to this, as reported by the local news website Metrópoles, is a dispute among police officers over the legitimacy of such an investigation, and the request submitted for reconsideration of the decision stated that 'technical and legal issues' surrounding such a move needed to be resolved. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the report, some investigators in the Brazilian police believe that an investigation into suspected war crimes against the soldier is legitimate due to the fact that Brazil is a signatory to the Rome Statute under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, while others there believe this is insufficient grounds and that it is necessary to rely on a local law that would define such an offense. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyarr9iuyl	2025-01-07T22:05:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/rk5SgcsL1l/rk5SgcsL1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Huge wild fires burn in Los Angeles, flames reach Hollywood actor...	Strong winds fan the flames in California, which also spread to an upscale neighborhood in Los Angeles; Residents spoke of 'crying and screaming' during the evacuation; The fire caused cancelation of premiere of Jennifer Lopez's new film, while James Woods filmed the flames shooting from his home: 'I don't know if the house is still standing' A wildfire whipped up by extreme winds swept through a Los Angeles hillside dotted with celebrity residences Tuesday, burning homes in Pacific Palisades and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands. In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways were clogged and scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot, some toting suitcases. Los Angeles Fire Chief Christine Crowley said about 30,000 residents have been told to evacuate their homes, while more than 13,000 structures are under threat from the fire. The traffic jam on Palisades Drive prevented emergency vehicles from getting through and a bulldozer was brought in to push the abandoned cars to the side and create a path, according to the LA Fire Department. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was in Southern California to attend the naming of a national monument by President Joe Biden, made a detour to the canyon to see 'firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the embers,' and he said he found 'not a few of the many structures already destroyed.' Officials did not give an exact number of structures damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire, but they said about 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures were under threat. And the worst could be yet to come. The blaze began around 10:30 a.m., shortly after the start of a Santa Ana windstorm that the National Weather service warned could be 'life threatening' and the strongest to hit Southern California in more than a decade. The exact cause of the fire was unknown and no injuries had been reported, officials said. Only about 25 miles (about 40 kilometers) northeast in Altadena, another fire spread to about 400 acres (about 162 hectares) by Tuesday evening, prompting evacuation orders, the Angeles National Forest posted on the social platform X. The winds were expected to increase overnight and continue for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 100 mph (160 kph) in mountains and foothills - including in areas that haven't seen substantial rain in months. 'By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,' Newsom warned residents, saying the worst of the winds are expected between 10 p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. He declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. As of Tuesday evening, 28,300 households were without power due to the strong winds, according to the mayor's office. About 15,000 utility customers in Southern California had their power shut off to reduce the risk of equipment sparking a blaze. A half a million customers total were at risk of losing power preemptively. The Pacific Palisades fire quickly consumed about 4.6 square miles (11.6 square kilometers) of land in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, some 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. The LA Fire Department requested all off-duty members call with their availability for recall Tuesday evening. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. 'We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,'Trainor said. 'People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour.' An Associated Press video journalist saw a roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which borders Malibu about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of downtown LA, includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. An AP photographer saw multi-million dollar mansions on fire as helicopters overhead dropped water loads. Roads were clogged in both directions as evacuees fled down toward the Pacific Coast Highway while others begged for rides back up to their homes to rescue pets. Two of the homes on fire were inside exclusive gated communities. Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he immediately went to pick his two kids up from St. Matthews Parish School when he heard the fire was nearby. Meanwhile, he said embers flew into his wife's car as she tried to evacuate. 'She vacated her car and left it running,' Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean until it was safe. Adams said he had never witnessed anything like this in the 56 years he's lived there. He watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs 'like small explosions,' which he said he believes were the transformers exploding. 'It is crazy, it's everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home's safe, the other one's up in flames' Adams said. Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 'Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,' Woods said in the short video on X. Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in the Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. 'This is not a parking lot,' Guttenberg told KTLA. 'I have friends up there and they can't evacuate. I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars.' The erratic weather caused Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. He remained in Los Angeles, where smoke was visible from his hotel, and was briefed on the wildfires. The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant to help reimburse California for the firefighting cost. Biden said in a statement that he and his team are communicating with state and local officials and he has offered 'any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire.'

The museum located on the eastern end of the Pacific Palisades is a separate campus of the world-famous Getty Museum that focuses on the art and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. The fire also burned Palisades Charter High School classrooms. Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, including Jennifer Lopez's new film, and the Los Angeles Unified School District said it temporarily relocated students from three campuses in the Pacific Palisades area. Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there's been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn't seen more than 0.1 inches (0.25 centimeters) of rain since early May. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmt5tjikl	2025-01-07T20:48:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/HJkE00LjLkl/HJkE00LjLkl_0_48_800_451_0_small.jpg

The suspected driver of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day used popular chatbot ChatGPT to plan the blast, officials told reporters on Tuesday. The suspect used ChatGPT to try and work out how much explosive was needed to trigger the blast, officials said. Authorities last week identified the person found dead inside the Cybertruck as Matthew Livelsberger, 37, an active-duty Army soldier from Colorado Springs, and said he acted alone. The FBI says the incident appeared to be a case of suicide. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said on Tuesday the Cybertruck blast was the first incident on U.S. soil where ChatGPT had been used to build an explosive device.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1oj00tj8kl	2025-01-07T20:11:03-08:00	
Iran tells France to review 'unconstructive' approach ahead of me...	Iran's foreign ministry called upon Paris to review its 'unconstructive' approach, a few days before Tehran is set to hold a new round of talks about its nuclear program with major European countries. On Monday, Emmanuel Macron said Tehran's uranium enrichment drive is nearing a point of no return and warned that European partners in a moribund 2015 nuclear deal with Iran should consider reimposing sanctions if no progress is reached. 'Untrue claims by a government that has itself refused to fulfil its obligations under the nuclear deal and has played a major role in (Israel's) acquisition of nuclear weapons is deceitful and projective,' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei wrote on X on Wednesday. French, German and British diplomats are set to hold a follow-up meeting with Iranian counterparts on Jan. 13 after one in November held to discuss the possibility of serious negotiations in coming months to defuse tensions with Tehran, as Trump is due to return to the White House on Jan. 20.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry6jukslkl	2025-01-07T20:08:38-08:00	
IDF will stay in Lebanon until Hezbollah is dismantled'	Anywhere Hezbollah rebuilds, they will meet the Israeli army,' warns Brig.-Gen. Amir Avivi Israel is not relying on anyone but itself to ensure Hezbollah does not rebuild in Lebanon, according to Brig.-Gen. Amir Avivi, founder and chairman of HaBithonistim. 'Israel is not counting on anybody; Israel is counting on Israel,' he told ILTV on Tuesday when asked whether Israel would withdraw from Lebanon as the end of the 60-day ceasefire approaches. 'Anything that is not Israel will be a bonus. So, if we manage to deploy the Lebanese army, that's a bonus. If they manage to dismantle the positions of Hezbollah, that's a bonus. But more than 40 Hezbollah terrorists have been killed by Israel since the beginning of the ceasefire because they were trying to rebuild themselves. And this is not going to change—not only in south Lebanon, but all over Lebanon.' Avivi emphasized that Hezbollah will face consequences wherever it attempts to rebuild. 'Anywhere Hezbollah will try to rebuild itself, they will meet the Israeli army, and there will be retaliation,' he said. While the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah appears to be extending, Israel has not committed to removing its troops from Lebanon until Lebanon fulfills its obligations under the deal. Avivi clarified that the timeline is less important than the agreement's implementation. 'If the Lebanese army doesn't deploy fully, if they don't dismantle Hezbollah in south Lebanon, if they don't push Hezbollah out of south Lebanon, the IDF is going to stay in its positions and secure the citizens of Israel,' Avivi stressed. 'I think we learned that lesson from the seventh of October. We're not going to agree to timetables. We want to see results on the ground. And this is the responsibility of the state of Lebanon. This is the responsibility of the Lebanese army to do what was agreed upon—to dismantle Hezbollah, to push it out of south Lebanon, and to fully deploy the Lebanese army in a way that will create stability and security in Lebanon.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjxitdjl1l	2025-01-07T18:18:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/rJtNCrvbIJg/rJtNCrvbIJg_0_151_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Ancient Byzantine monastery unveiled	A 600-year-old monastery was discovered near Kiryat Gat with a remarkable mosaic floor A stunning monastery with a colorful mosaic floor, a Greek inscription, and a sophisticated winepress has been uncovered during an Israel Antiquities Authority excavation. The dig was conducted as part of the Israel Land Authority's development of the Karmey Gat North neighborhood near Kiryat Gat. 'This is the largest and most significant site discovered in the region from the Roman and Byzantine periods,' researchers noted. The monastery, dated to the Byzantine period (5th–6th centuries CE), is part of a site that originated during the Roman era and remained active for around 600 years. Its mosaic floor features intricate designs, including crosses, lions, doves, flowers, geometric patterns, and a quote from Deuteronomy: 'Blessed are you when you come in, and blessed are you when you go out.' The excavation also revealed a highly sophisticated winepress, used and repaired over centuries. Its fermentation rooms and collecting vat are decorated with mosaics made from blue and white stones. To preserve this extraordinary find, the mosaic floor will be relocated to a public area in the city, where it will be accessible to visitors.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqctdslyl	2025-01-07T18:02:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/rkPw5wjI1e/rkPw5wjI1e_0_166_1440_811_0_small.jpg
Israel prepares for Trump's return and for a joint attack on Iran...	IDF and US military generals meet in Israeli ahead of Trump's inauguration to discuss frozen US weapons shipment and potentially plan an attack on Iran, which is dramatically close to nuclear capability The deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, landed in Israel last week for a visit and met with the deputy chief of staff, Major General Amir Baram. The parties discussed shipments of critical weapons that the outgoing Biden administration has delayed and improving readiness for a possible joint attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The IDF Spokesperson reported that Baram and Cooper visited a number of Israeli Air Force bases, where a review of joint operational operations took place. 'In addition, a joint discussion was held regarding the threats from Yemen and cooperation with the U.S. military,' the IDF spokesman reported. Trump did not rule out the possibility that he would order an attack against Iran's nuclear facilities or support such an attack by Israel. At a press conference about three weeks ago, the president-elect was asked about a possible preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, amid reports that his team was considering such a step, and replied that he does not rule out any action. Tehran is preparing for Trump's return to the White House, and amid Israeli threats, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared about two weeks ago that '2025 will be an important year in terms of the Iranian nuclear issue.' Araghchi made the remarks after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing. He did not mention Donald Trump or elaborate on the significance of 2025. It is possible that his remarks were related to Trump's return, and Iranian fears that his entry into the White House would strengthen Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to the latest quarterly report published by the IAEA in November, Iran has already accumulated a fairly significant amount of 60% enriched uranium, an amount that is enough for four nuclear bombs. According to the report, as of October 26, the amount of uranium enriched to this level stands at 182.3 kg – an increase of 17.6 kg since August. In order for uranium to be used to produce nuclear weapons, it must be enriched to a level of 90%, but nuclear scientists explain that the path from 60% to 90% is quite short and is considered a 'technical' step which can be done in a few days or weeks. Israel and the U.S. are discussing the Biden Administration's delayed weapons shipment, which includes 1,700 heavy bombs, 134 D9 Caterpillar bulldozers, and additional weapons. The IDF is already preparing to target Iran's nuclear facilities by improving readiness for a possible joint attack with the U.S. The use of these bulldozers by the IDF led to major internal criticism in the U.S., protests and tremendous pressure on the Biden administration which gave in and froze the shipment. An examination conducted by Ynet in November revealed that dozens of IDF D9 bulldozers require maintenance. These bulldozers were also needed in southern Lebanon. 'At the height of the fighting in Gaza, about a year ago, battalion commanders 'fought' over D9 bulldozers, making it necessary to carry out maintenance on them,' said an IDF commander in November. It is difficult to officially and directly link the deadly results of the raid in Jabaliya in October and November, and the 21 fighters killed in about a month, many from IEDs, to the dire need for D9 bulldozers. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In these operations, the bulldozers are usually the first to lead the combat teams, safely clearing 'dirty' areas from explosives that are set to explode and harm infantry and armored soldiers. At the same time, it is clear this tool is not only operationally effective against tunnels and in built-up areas, but also protects soldiers' lives. The US is still freezing a shipment of about 1,300 bombs for the Israeli Air Force, which the defense establishment has already purchased from Boeing - in shekels and not in aid dollars - weighing close to a ton per bomb, on the similar claim that the IDF could harm the civilian Gazan population with them. Half of this shipment, which was frozen about six months ago by the administration and caused a stir, has reached the IDF, but about half is still stuck in warehouses in the U.S. In addition, the defense establishment currently rents engineering tools for forces in the field from private contractors. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1d00f7o8jx	2025-01-07T14:02:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

Probe of New York Mayor Eric Adams uncovers more criminal conduct...	Federal prosecutors said on Tuesday they have uncovered additional criminal conduct by Eric Adams as they prepare for the New York City mayor's April corruption trial. Adams, 64, was charged in September with accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey. He pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery, fraud and solicitation of a campaign contribution from a foreign national. In a court filing, the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan cited new information in urging U.S. District Judge Dale Ho to deny Adams' request that they identify his alleged co-conspirators or provide early access to evidence for his April 21 trial. The prosecutors warned doing so could lead to attempts to tamper with witnesses.

Hamas exploits chaos in Syria, looks for Jewish targets around th...	While Hamas struggles to control Gaza, an Israeli senior official warns there is growing concern regarding the terror organization's attempts to carry out attacks against Israeli, Jewish targets abroad The war in Gaza has been going on for 15 months and the terrorist organizations are struggling to maintain their control. An Israeli senior official explained on Tuesday that Hamas is frustrated with the situation and is seeking achievements elsewhere. Israel is increasingly concerned about attempts by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to carry out terrorist attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad. Alongside this threat, Israel is also seeing an increase in terrorism in the West Bank, directed and financed by Iran, which is smuggling large quantities of weapons into the West Bank through Jordan. Meanwhile, Israel is following with concern the 'establishment' of Hamas and Islamic Jihad members in Syria, who are taking advantage of the chaos created following the rebel-led coup and the fall of the Assad regime. Currently, there are approximately 2,000 Hamas members and approximately 7,000 Islamic Jihad members. Amid international criticism of the IDF's presence in the buffer zone between the countries, Israel fears that terrorist organizations will try to carry out terrorist attacks in the Golan Heights. The senior official explained that Israel does not have direct communication with the new Syrian leaders, but there is a backchannel for sending messages. In Israel, people are unimpressed by rebel leader Al-Julani's 'moderate messages,' saying they are focused on stabilizing the country. Do not be fooled. After they stabilize Syria, they will look at Israel. A global terrorist effort, without leaders While Israel fights Hamas in Gaza, several terror attacks against Israeli targets have been thwarted. The terrorist organizations, which draw inspiration from Iran, seek to harm Israeli and Jewish individuals, embassies and other Jewish assets. In January 2024, the Mossad and the Shin Bet revealed the identities of Hamas operatives in several European countries, following an arrest operation that took place a month earlier. On December 14, 2023, security and enforcement authorities in Denmark and Germany announced the arrest of suspects throughout Europe, who have since been prosecuted. The suspects were working for Hamas to attack Israeli, Jewish and Western targets. It was also reported at the time that the Mossad and Shin Bet had thwarted a Hamas attack in Denmark. A joint statement by the Prime Minister's Office, the Mossad, and the Shin Bet in January 2024 stated that a comprehensive picture of Hamas' terrorist activity has been revealed, including details about Hamas infrastructure, operatives and targets. It was also revealed that Hamas had purchased drones and activated criminal organizations in Europe to attack Israelis and Jews. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas draws inspiration from the terrorist attacks carried out by the Iranian regime, and similar to the IGRC, it strives to hit Israeli, Jewish and Western targets at all costs.

Los Angeles wildfire prompts evacuations amid extreme winds	A wildfire burned about 200 acres (80 hectares) and threatened homes in an upscale section of Los Angeles on Tuesday, forcing evacuations after officials had already warned of extreme fire danger from dry, powerful winds. The Pacific Palisades fire between Santa Monica and Malibu led the Los Angeles Fire Department to issue a mandatory evacuation order for a large area from the hills of Topanga Canyon down to the coastline. 'Immediate threat to life. This is a lawful order to LEAVE NOW,' read one notice posted by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Erik Scott urged against complacency because of cool winter weather, warning of 'explosive wildfire behavior' in a public service message.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by8h11ms81g	2025-01-07T12:49:57-08:00	
US shifts some military aid to Lebanon from Egypt, letter says	-US shifts some military aid to Lebanon from Egypt, letter says * Shift comes as Lebanon faces shift in Syria, enforces ceasefire U.S. President Joe Biden's administration will divert $95 million in military aid allocated for Egypt to Lebanon, which faces threats from Hezbollah and other non-state actors and is enforcing a cease-fire with Israel, according to a document seen by Reuters on Monday. The State Department notification to Congress of the planned shift calls the Lebanese armed forces 'a key partner' in upholding the Nov. 27, 2024, Israel-Lebanon agreement to cease hostilities and to prevent Hezbollah from threatening Israel. The move comes after some of Biden's fellow Democrats in Congress expressed deep concerns about Egypt's human rights record, particularly the arrests of thousands of political prisoners. In response to questions about the reprogrammed funding, a State Department spokesperson said the department was still moving forward with foreign military financing for Egypt and said the assessment that Cairo had made progress on political prisoners had not changed. In September, State said the Biden administration was overriding human rights conditions on military aid to Egypt, granting Cairo its full allocation of $1.3 billion, including $95 million tied specifically to Egypt's progress on the release of political prisoners. According to the State Department document, the funds would be made available to professionalize the Lebanese Armed Forces, strengthen border security, combat terrorism and address security requirements affected by the shift in power in Syria. 'The United States remains Lebanon's security partner of choice, and U.S. support to the LAF directly helps secure Lebanon and the wider Levant region,' the notification said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkkn9molje	2025-01-07T12:20:30-08:00	
Trump envoy heads to Qatar as hostage deal nears: 'We've had some...	Incoming U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff says there is a lot of great progress and he is 'really hopeful that by the inaugural, we'll have some good things to announce'; IDF chief issues stern warnings to Hamas of relentless pressure until all hostages are freed Incoming U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has announced plans to travel to Doha later this week to advance ongoing hostage negotiations. Witkoff stated Tuesday that a deal is nearing completion and emphasized that President-elect Donald Trump expects the agreement to be finalized before his January 20 inauguration, warning that 'all hell will break loose' in the region if it is not. 'We’re making a lot of progress, and I don’t want to say too much because I think they’re doing a really good job back in Doha. I’m leaving tomorrow to go back to Doha, but I think that we’ve had some really great progress, and I’m really hopeful that by the inaugural, we’ll have some good things to announce on behalf of the president,' Witkoff said during a press conference Tuesday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump joined the event briefly to provide an update on the talks. 'We’re working in tandem in a really good way, but it’s the president, his reputation, the things that he has said, that are driving this negotiation, and so hopefully it’ll all work out and we’ll save some lives,' Witkoff added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Pressed about the reasons for the delays in reaching an agreement, Witkoff refrained from detailing specifics. 'I believe we’ve been on the verge of [a deal]. I don’t want to discuss what’s delayed it — no point to be negative in any way,' he said. When asked if the parties were waiting for Trump to take office before finalizing the deal, Witkoff dismissed the suggestion. 'No, I think they heard him loud and clear. [This] better get done by the inaugural,' he said. Meanwhile, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi issued a stern warning to Hamas leaders during a visit to the Jabaliya area in Gaza, vowing relentless pressure until all Israeli hostages are released. 'We will not stop. We will bring them to the point where they understand they must return all the hostages,' Halevi declared during a briefing with commanders in the field. Speaking during an operational assessment in Gaza, Halevi emphasized the toll IDF operations are taking on Hamas. 'I want you to know, as I look at Hamas’ situation, they see daily what you are doing to them, and they understand this is nearing the point of being unbearable,' he said. The chief of staff praised the professionalism of IDF forces and underscored the determination to continue the mission. 'We will not stop. We will bring them to the realization that they must return all the hostages. Otherwise, the highly professional work you are doing will continue, resulting in more prisoners and more dead operatives. I know you are doing everything to minimize casualties on our side,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjuzczoi1e	2025-01-07T11:54:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/SJgRoT1iLyx/SJgRoT1iLyx_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Man accused of killing woman in New York subway fire pleads not g...	The man accused of killing a woman sleeping on a New York City subway car by setting her on fire after what prosecutors say was a night of heavy drinking pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and arson at a court hearing on Tuesday. A grand jury has indicted Sebastian Zapeta, 33, of one count of first-degree murder, three counts of second-degree murder and one count of first-degree arson in the first degree for the killing of Debrina Kawam, 57. After his arrest, Zapeta told detectives that he often drinks heavily to the point of blacking out, and that he had done so just before Kawam was killed, according to a court filing by prosecutors on Tuesday. Many were horrified by a brief video of Kawam engulfed in flames near the open doors of a train car, recorded by a bystander on the platform. According to the police account, Zapeta used a lighter to ignite the clothes of Kawam, who appeared to be sleeping on a seat in a stationary F train car at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station at about 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 22. He then used a shirt to fan the fire, the police complaint said. Kawam was pronounced dead at the scene. When police detectives showed Zapeta video of Kawam being set on fire, he told them that it was him in the video, but he did not recognize Kawam nor remembered it happening, according to the court filing by the Brooklyn district attorney's office.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrki11ilje	2025-01-07T11:15:21-08:00	
Turkey says it will mount offensive against Kurdish YPG if demand...	Turkey will carry out a cross-border offensive into northeastern Syria against the Kurdish YPG militia if the group does not meet Ankara's demands, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Tuesday, while adding that Syria's new rulers must address the issue. Turkey considers the YPG, which spearheads the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as a terrorist group linked to Kurdish militants waging a decades-old insurgency against the Turkish state. While repeatedly asking its NATO ally Washington to halt its support for the group, Ankara has carried out several incursions against the YPG in the past and controls swathes of territory in northern Syria. Since the ousting of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last month by rebels, some of whom Turkey has supported, Ankara has demanded that the YPG disband, its non-Syrian militants and foreign terrorist fighters leave Syria or are repatriated to their source countries, and its leaders turn themselves in. Speaking to broadcaster CNN Turk, Fidan said Turkey believed the new Syrian administration must address the issue of the YPG's presence, but added this may take time as a transition period is underway in Damascus. Asked what Turkey would do if Damascus was unable to address the issue, Fidan said 'whatever is necessary'. When asked what that entailed, he said 'a military operation', while adding that the new Syrian leadership had the power to battle the YPG on its own as well.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syoh5zilkx	2025-01-07T11:11:47-08:00	
British minister says Musk knows 'absolutely nothing' about child...	A British minister who Elon Musk has described as a 'rape genocide apologist' said on Tuesday the U.S. billionaire knew 'absolutely nothing' about the child sexual abuse scandals he has recently been commenting on. Musk, an ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has spent days posting messages on his social media site X accusing Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute gangs of men who raped young girls when Starmer was director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. Musk has also attacked Starmer's safeguarding minister Jess Phillips, describing her as a 'rape genocide apologist' who should be in jail. Phillips has spent much of her career working with victims of domestic violence, sexual violence and human trafficking. Musk and opposition politicians have called for a new national inquiry into the scandals after Phillips told the council of a town where sex abuse cases were reported that it should hold its own investigation. Speaking to broadcaster ITV, Phillips said Musk's comments, which she described as 'ridiculous,' turned her 'world upside down.' Responding to Starmer's criticism, Musk said on X the prime minister was 'deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes', adding: 'That's what the inquiry would show.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syinybsujx	2025-01-07T11:10:24-08:00	
Folk singer Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary dies at 86	American singer and songwriter Peter Yarrow, who found fame with the 1960s folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary, died on Tuesday at the age of 86, his publicist said. Yarrow died in the morning at his New York home surrounded by family following a four-year battle with bladder cancer, publicist Ken Sunshine said in a statement. 'Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life,' Yarrow's daughter Bethany said in a statement provided by Sunshine. 'The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest.' Yarrow formed Peter, Paul and Mary with Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers. The group helped popularize the early work of Bob Dylan and sang hits such as 'Puff, The Magic Dragon,' which Yarrow co-wrote. The trio's members were noted for their political activism. They performed at the 1963 civil rights March on Washington and at demonstrations protesting the Vietnam War. Throughout his life, Yarrow campaigned for social change and various causes, including equal rights, peace, the environment, gender equality, homelessness, hospice care, public broadcasting and education.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s111mkwjljl	2025-01-07T11:07:35-08:00	
Foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar visits Abu Dhabi in first since sta...	The visit, kept under wraps until the start of the meeting, marks the first by an Israeli foreign minister to the UAE since the war began and comes in shadow of reports of behind-the-scenes talks on the Gaza Strip, in which the Emirates were involved; The two ministers are expected to discuss 'regional developments and bilateral relations' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar met with his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday evening. The meeting, kept under wraps until it started, marks the second public visit by an Israeli minister to the UAE since the onset of the war and the first by a foreign minister. It follows a series of high-level secret meetings by Israeli officials during the war. The two ministers are currently meeting at a palace in Abu Dhabi, just hours after Reuters reported on behind-the-scenes talks involving the UAE and the United States about managing Gaza in the aftermath of the war. According to the report, the UAE and other nations, alongside the U.S., are considering a temporary governance role in Gaza until a reformed and 'strengthened' Palestinian Authority can assume control. In a statement, Sa’ar’s office confirmed his visit was at the invitation of Sheikh Abdullah, adding that the discussions are focused on 'regional developments and bilateral relations between the two countries.' The UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that 'Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan met with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. During the meeting, the two discussed regional developments, particularly the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and international efforts to secure a stable cease-fire.' Conditions for post-war Gaza governance The Reuters report, based on conversations with 12 diplomats and Western officials, outlines a proposal for temporary governance of Gaza involving the UAE, the U.S., and other nations. This governance would address administrative, security and reconstruction efforts until control could be transferred to a reformed Palestinian Authority. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly opposed such plans, the report suggests the UAE, due to its peace agreement with Israel, holds a degree of influence over his government. However, officials noted that neither Israel nor the international community has presented a clear vision for Gaza’s future. The ideas emerging from Abu Dhabi are still in preliminary stages, lacking formal endorsement or detailed frameworks. The UAE’s vision, as conveyed by officials, includes a reformed Palestinian Authority leading Gaza, with the long-term goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state encompassing the West Bank and East Jerusalem—a prospect Netanyahu is unlikely to support. A senior Emirati official emphasized that participation in any post-war Gaza plan would hinge on conditions tied to Palestinian statehood. 'The UAE will not join any initiative that does not include substantial reforms to the Palestinian Authority, its empowerment, and a credible roadmap toward a Palestinian state,' the official said. 'These elements – currently absent – are critical for the success of any post-war plan for Gaza.' As discussions continue, the path to stabilizing Gaza and rebuilding its governance remains fraught with challenges, underscoring the complexities of forging a sustainable solution for the region. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjspmeji1x	2025-01-07T10:52:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ByNXgyiLke/ByNXgyiLke_1_81_1068_601_0_small.jpg

Israel says no foreign courts have warrants issued against reserv...	Israel said on Tuesday pressure groups were pushing foreign courts to take action against Israelis over alleged war crimes in Gaza but described the actions as 'propaganda activity' and said no warrants had been issued. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, over alleged war crimes in Gaza. The warrants sparked outrage in Israel but also drew fears that similar warrants could be issued against Israelis who served in the military in Gaza. On Sunday, an Israeli reservist on holiday in Brazil left the country after a Brazilian federal judge in Salvador ordered police to open an investigation into allegations that he had committed war crimes while serving with the military in Gaza. The Hind Rajab Foundation, the pro-Palestinian group which brought the action, said it had filed evidence of alleged war crimes with the ICC against 1,000 Israelis, including video and audio reports, forensic reports and other documentation. The ICC confirmed it had received a filing and said it would 'analyze the materials submitted, as appropriate'. Israel's foreign ministry offered assistance to the reservist singled out by the action but officials said the issue was not widespread. The military has warned reservists that they could face arrest abroad over alleged war crimes in Gaza, according to documents published by Israeli media.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybeuxo8yl	2025-01-07T09:55:24-08:00

'We will take our time with the national dialogue conference to have the opportunity to form an expanded preparatory committee that can accommodate the comprehensive representation of Syria from all segments and governorates,' Shibani said. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday time was needed for Syria to pick itself up again and rebuild following Assad's overthrow, and that the damage to infrastructure from 13 years of civil war looked worse than anticipated. Turkey shares a 911-km (565-mile) border with Syria and has carried out several cross-border incursions against Kurdish YPG militants it views as terrorists.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1vodgsi1e	2025-01-07T09:52:37-08:00	
Danny Danon says other countries should fight the Houthis alongsi...	Danon, Israel's UN ambassador, says he constantly reminds the international body that Israel is in Gaza because 'we have no choice' and 'We will do whatever we have to do to bring all of the hostages back to Israel' As Trump's inauguration nears, Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, talks with Ynetnews about Israel's most pressing issues, including Iran, the Houthis, the hostages and Israel's relations with the U.S. Last week you asked for an urgent session of the UN Security Council to address the Houthi attacks against Israel. Any decisions or measures were taken in the council regarding this hostility? 'Well first I would like to thank the United States for calling for this session in the Security Council. In the debate, I told my colleagues there is no reason for the attacks from Yemen against Israel. We have no border with Yemen. We have no disputes with Yemen, and still they are sending ballistic missiles. Even my own school in my own hometown was destroyed completely from a ballistic missile coming from Yemen. I was very happy to hear the words of the U.S. ambassador and the UK ambassador. It's not only our responsibility to fight this radical organization. We expect other countries to take part in this fight.' Iran has denied any relations with the Houthis. Did Israel submit any documents or evidence that will expose this link? 'Absolutely. You know, they can deny it day and night, but when you look at the missiles, the UAVs, the technology, you understand it's all made in Iran. It's all funded by Iran. They cannot lie to the world. Everybody knows that Iran is behind the Houthis, and I think we should demand that Iran stop funding this organization.' Let's talk about the hostage deal. Are we close to bringing our 100 hostages home? 'We definitely hope so. I can tell you that both President Biden and President Trump are eager to see some development before January 20, before the inauguration of the new president. It's two weeks ahead. There's a lot of negotiations, and I hope we will hear good news, you know, we are praying for that.' Could you tell us about the special report document you have issued gathering the testimonies of the hostages that returned from Gaza? 'When you read this report and you understand what's happening in Gaza, the atrocities, you know, the tortures, the sexual abuse, starvation, you know, one cannot understand how the hostages are staying alive over there. We are praying for them, but we demand from the world not to be quiet. You know, at the UN, they always speak with me about the humanitarian aspects of the Palestinians in Gaza. What about our humanitarian rights? What about the hostages? I think it's a very important report, and we will distribute it to everywhere in the UN.' Do you feel the impact? I mean, was anyone who was exposed to the atrocities moved or changed his view? 'Absolutely, and we also bring a lot of families of hostages to the Security Council, to the General Assembly, you know, once they come and they interact with the ambassadors, you cannot sit idly by when you hear what they are going through. So we will continue to speak up and we will remind the world that we are in Gaza not because we want to be there. We are in Gaza because we have no choice. We will do whatever we have to do to bring all of the hostages back to Israel.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Security Council also heard family members of hostages who are still in captivity. Did it generate any reaction? 'Yes, you know, for the first time we were able to bring a family member to speak in the Security Council. You know, I think everybody will be moved from his words and no one can sit quietly when he sees a family member calling for the Security Council to take action and to bring his family members back home.' Where are we standing in the fight against and the efforts to close their activity in Gaza? 'So the law that passed the Knesset will be effective by the end of January, and we tell our colleagues at the UN we are willing to work with other UN organs and not with UNWA. It's about time to speak about that and to think about alternatives for UNRWA.' Last but not least, almost two weeks to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Big hopes? 'Definitely when we see the people who nominated for different positions, Sharon: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ambassador Eli Stefanik to the UN, and here in Israel, Ambassador Mike Huckabee, they're all good friends of Israel, very knowledgeable, and we are looking forward to work with all of them.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkekuys8jg	2025-01-07T09:49:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/ryj4gqxB1x/ryj4gqxB1x_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
IDF and Palestinian Authority crack down on West Bank Palestinian...	IDF forces kill terrorists and arrest 18 suspects - and a reserve soldier is seriously injured - in the operation less than a day after the deadly attack near Kedumim in the northern West Bank IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari announced Tuesday that a reserve soldier was seriously injured during an operation in the Jordan Valley. 'The soldier was taken to the hospital, and his family has been informed,' the IDF said. The exchange of fire took place in the Palestinian village of Taluza, east of Nablus, and according to the IDF the forces killed a terrorist there in a close range fight. Also, two armed terrorists were eliminated who opened fire on the soldiers. During the operation, the security forces confiscated a large number of weapons, including AK-47 rifles, and arrested 18 suspects. The operation follows Monday's shooting attack near Kedumim, in which police officer Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 35; Rachel Cohen, 70; and Aliza Reiss, 73, were murdered. Defense Minister Israel Katz arrived at the scene of the attack on Tuesday and met the civilian who neutralized the threat. Katz also held a situation assessment in the Ephraim Brigade with senior IDF commanders. 'The despicable murderous attack that occurred here yesterday is an act of war in every sense of the word, and will be responded to accordingly,' the defense minister said. 'I have instructed the IDF to bolster forces in the West Bank. We will act forcefully against the perpetrators and those who sheltered them. We will not tolerate Palestinian terrorism,' Katz said. This operation joins a long-running counter-terrorism operation in the West Bank. In addition to the IDF, the Palestinian Authority's security forces also are operating against terrorism in the West Bank over the past month. The Palestinian security forces are operating against the terrorists in the Jenin Battalion, and during the operation six Palestinian security personnel were killed in action. On Monday, senior Palestinian Authority officials met with the head of Palestinian Intelligence, Minister Majed Faraj, and decided to continue the operation. 'The PA security forces will continue their activities in Jenin and will not announce the cessation of the operation. So far, about 700 lawbreakers and terrorists have been arrested,' they said. 'Most of the members of the Jenin Battalion fled the camp, the forces are arrested them everywhere,' a senior Palestinian security source said. According to the Palestinians, the operation led to the siege of the Jenin refugee camp, and caused power and water outages, along with obstructing the arrival of ambulances. In addition, they claimed that some of the houses were converted into military sites, which led to the displacement of residents. Meanwhile, Palestinian security mechanisms continue to operate throughout the West Bank. In the operation in Atil, north of Tulkarm, three Palestinians were injured by gunfire. One of the injured suspects is the released prisoner Yousef Mahana, one of the founders of the Tulkarm Battalion belonging to Islamic Jihad.

This is media propaganda that serves the extremist ministers to garner more votes from Israelis who are angry about the attacks.' Following the deadly attack in Kedumim, Smotrich met with West Bank officials. At the meeting, the minister said that the next cabinet meeting will deal with steps to eradicate terrorism in the West Bank. 'In Judea and Samaria, as in other arenas, we must move from defense to offense and launch extensive operations inside the terrorist nests until the weapons and terrorists are completely destroyed,' said Smotrich. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by0amcql1x	2025-01-07T09:37:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/BJ11vUyO5Lkl/BJ11vUyO5Lkl_8_49_1481_834_270_small.jpg
The Houthis have established a quasi-state in Yemen, modeled afte...	Decades of war have fractured Yemen, creating a dire humanitarian crisis and enabling the Houthis to assert themselves as a key regional force Yemen, once known as 'Arabia Felix' ('fortunate Arabia') for its cultural wealth and strategic location, now symbolizes the devastation wrought by prolonged war and division. The north remains firmly under the control of the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, a group rooted in Yemen’s Zaydi Shiite minority that has established a quasi-state. Italian journalist Laura Silvia Battaglia, who has extensive experience in Yemen, says that the situation in Yemen 'is much worse than five years ago.' 'The Houthis have modeled their governance on Iran and Hezbollah, repurposing state structures to consolidate power over the past decade,' she explains. Hussein, a Yemeni journalist from Sanaa, agrees. 'The Houthis have built a self-sustaining financial system by exploiting the Yemeni population for over a decade. So even if the regime in Iran will fall, they will manage to survive anyhow and have clearly nothing to lose,' he says. The Houthis’ military actions, including recent missile attacks on Israel, align with Iran’s ideological vision of a Middle East without Israel, but do not appear to be directly coordinated. 'Their actions demonstrate alignment with Iran but also highlight their independent strategy. They have shown that they are not only an autonomous local actor but a regional one,' Battaglia said. Iran’s role in Yemen is significant but more complex than commonly depicted. While Tehran offers strategic and military support, the Houthis maintain high autonomy. Their financial resources are not solely dependent on Iran but are bolstered by an internal apparatus. 'The Houthis align with Iran’s broader geopolitical goals but have built their own funding streams through internal exploitation and international investments,' Battaglia said. 'Even before their attacks on Israel and gaining international recognition, they managed to terrorize and subsequently force a political dialogue with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. Especially now, with other militias weakened, they have clearly positioned themselves as the most active and potentially dangerous militia in the region.' Despite their strength, the Houthis’ control has not garnered widespread public support. 'The population remains divided. Some admire their defiance, while others resent their exploitation and authoritarian control,' Battaglia explains. 'They’ve also built a Stasi-like control apparatus that surveils citizens and enforces loyalty to their regime, ensuring internal dissent remains minimal,' she adds, referring to the secret police of former East Germany known for their extensive surveillance and repression. The militia has proven to be a formidable force, particularly following the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in 2023. Its actions have gone beyond aligning with the 'axis of resistance' to counter Israel, extending to disrupting international trade by damaging and halting ships in the Red Sea. 'They’ve been underestimated for years and considered to be only rebels in ‘slippers’ with Kalashnikovs, but their engineering skills and ability to repurpose drones and missiles demonstrate significant military capacity,' according to Battaglia. Hussein details the group’s ascent. 'They seized Saleh-era military assets, including weapons stockpiles and intelligence resources,' he says. And their rhetoric, which opposes U.S. and Israeli policies while supporting Gaza, has garnered them regional sympathy. 'They gain popular support by positioning themselves as defenders of major causes,' Hussein explains. Yemen’s dire humanitarian crisis is further exacerbated by deep political divisions. In the south, a fragile government supported by Saudi Arabia and the UAE struggles to maintain stability. 'The central government is heavily influenced by external powers, and its authority is fragmented by tribal and militant factions, but it is the only alternative to fight back the Houthis in the country,' according to Hussein. Battaglia adds that the central government, located in the south, is not a 'puppet.' However, she says, 'it strictly follows the directives of Arab nations, particularly the UAE, which has taken military and naval control of Aden’s coasts and city.' Over a decade of civil conflict has plunged the country into what the UN describes as the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century. Over 80% of Yemen’s 30 million people rely on humanitarian aid, but global support remains inconsistent and underfunded. In Al Hudaydah’s overstretched public hospital, staff serve over 2,000 patients daily. Funding from the World Health Organization barely covers fuel costs for six months. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hussein shared his sense of despair. 'Living conditions have significantly deteriorated because of the no-war, no-peace status the country has reached,' he says, noting that aid to Yemen has sharply declined as resources are being redirected to other global crises, such as the conflict in Ukraine, leaving Yemen further marginalized on the international stage. 'For example, Coca-Cola trucks entering from Oman face up to 50 checkpoints, with each checkpoint demanding a fee. The leadership also invests its profits internationally, with some Houthis owning businesses and assets in Dubai, China, and Russia. These investments sustain their operations and influence.' Yemen’s future hangs in the balance as its divisions grow deeper each year. Hussein expressed a glimmer of hope, saying: 'We can only hope that Yemen overcomes this ordeal, that peace prevails, and that the war ends.' Battaglia, however, paints a bleaker picture: 'Unifying Yemen into a single nation seems impossible now. The entrenched divisions and external influences have fractured the country beyond repair.'

UN says Iran executed over 900 people in 2024, including dozens o...	At least 901 people were executed by hanging last year in the Islamic Republic compared with 853 in 2023, UN human rights office says in report The number of people executed in Iran rose to 901 last year, including 31 women, some of whom were convicted of murdering their husbands after suffering abuse or being forced into marriage, theU N Human Rights Office reported on Tuesday. Most of the executions were for drug-related offenses, but political dissidents and people connected with mass protests in 2022 over the death in police custody of a 22-year-old woman were also among the victims, the UN statement said. 'It is deeply disturbing that yet again we see an increase in the number of people subjected to the death penalty in Iran year-on-year,' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement sent to journalists. 'It is high time Iran stemmed this ever-swelling tide of executions.' In total, at least 901 people were executed by hanging last year in the Islamic Republic, compared with 853 in 2023, the UN rights office said. This represents the highest number since 2015, when 972 people were executed. The 2022 protests, which sparked some of the worst turmoil since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, followed the death in police custody of Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly flouting Iran's mandatory dress code. At least 31 women were executed in 2024, UN rights office spokesperson Liz Throssell told reporters at a Geneva press briefing, representing what she said was the highest number in at least 15 years. 'The majority of cases involved charges of murder. A significant number of the women were victims of domestic violence, child marriage or forced marriage,' she added.

Qatar plans to help boost Syrian government salaries, sources say	Qatar is planning to help finance a massive boost in public sector wages promised by Syria's new government, a U.S. official and a senior diplomat said, vital assistance to the new Islamist rulers in Damascus a month after they toppled Bashar Assad. The support for the new Syrian administration has been made possible by a U.S. sanctions exemption issued by Washington on Monday, allowing for transactions with governing institutions in Syria for six months. An Arab official said talks on Qatar funding Syrian government salaries were under way and nothing had been finalized, adding that other countries including Saudi Arabia may join in the effort. A Saudi official told Reuters on Tuesday that the kingdom was committed to working with regional and international partners to help support Syria and that its current support is 'focused on humanitarian aid including food, shelter, and medical supplies.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r111hxyoljl	2025-01-07T08:25:11-08:00

Farewell to terror victim Rachel Cohen, as evil strikes again	A terrorist carried out a brutal massacre on Passover in 2002 in the home of my dear friends, the Gavish family, in Elon Moreh; In the aftermath of the tragedy, Rachel Cohen opened her home and her heart to the surviving children - yesterday she was murdered by terrorists I witnessed firsthand the boundless kindness of Rachel Cohen, a woman whose deeds of compassion made her a legend in her own lifetime - which ended on Monday at the hands of a terrorist. On that horrific night – Passover Eve 2002 – after a terrorist massacred my dear friends, the Gavish family, in Elon Moreh, Rachel Cohen opened her home to the survivors. The terrorists entered the Gavish home, firing indiscriminately, killing Rachel and David Gavish; their eldest son Avraham, a revered commander in the Sayeret Matkal; and their grandfather Yitzhak Kanner. Rachel Cohen was Rachel Gavish's closest friend. When the surviving Gavish children escaped the carnage – some climbing barefoot down a ladder from the second-floor windows while the terrorist continued his rampage – they found refuge in Rachel Cohen's home. I remember them gathered that night in her bedroom, stunned and grappling with the unthinkable task of deciding where to bury their parents, brother and grandfather, who had celebrated the Seder with them just a day earlier in that very home. During the shiva, as the family sat in their bullet-riddled living room, the Gavish children made a heartbreaking decision to leave Elon Moreh and relocate to Kedumim. How could they remain in a house that had become the site of such devastation? Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Rachel Cohen made her own decision at that moment: She left her meticulously kept home in Elon Moreh and moved to Kedumim to stay close to the Gavish children. While the Gavish family rented a home of their own, Rachel moved into a nearby house, always watching over them. Over the years, I saw her at their celebrations and memorials, steadfast in her role as a surrogate guardian. She stood by their side at weddings, as the children walked to the chuppah, and at every memorial, overlooking the graves of their loved ones. For 22 years, Rachel never wavered in her devotion. She remained an enduring presence, ensuring the Gavish children knew they were never alone. When I heard the news of a woman named Rachel Cohen murdered in a recent terror attack in Kedumim, I couldn’t believe it might be her. 'Rachel Cohen' is a common name, I told myself. There’s no way someone so dedicated to protecting her friend’s six orphaned children could meet such a fate. But when I messaged Yeshurun Gavish, my dear friend, and asked, 'Rachel Cohen? That Rachel Cohen?' his reply shattered me: 'Yes, Rachel. The finest woman we had in this land.' My brother, you’ve been orphaned yet again. We can no longer bear the evil that strikes at the heart of our infinite goodness, over and over. We simply cannot. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjwtuccuje	2025-01-07T08:15:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/rJQYnzs58yl/rJQYnzs58yl_0_90_400_226_0_small.jpg

A senior Israeli official told Ynet that Hamas is frustrated with its situation in the Gaza Strip, and is seeking achievements in attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad. According to the official, Hamas is the one pushing to carry out attacks against targets outside the country's borders.

I thought India would help me, but I was lost': The space helpin...	Israeli iNitative in India aims to help tens of thousands of Israelis who left the country amid war and find themselves having to deal with emotional baggage and trauma It happened one day in Dharamshala, amid the narrow, colorful streets of the mountainous city in northern India, Eitan Langer recounted in an interview with Ynet. Langer, a father of two who served as a detective in the Ofakim police and a reserve combat soldier in Gaza, witnessed the traumatic collapse of a building that killed 21 soldiers. A few months ago, after completing another round of reserve duty, he found himself wandering the streets of India feeling lost. His post-trauma and the heightened alertness that had plagued him since the start of the war wouldn’t let go. 'I thought India would help me, lift me up,' he admitted, 'but in the end, I got lost.' Then, among the flyers posted on café walls in Dharamshala, he saw an ad for a lecture by a former IDF officer who had fought in Gaza, Hezi Shochat, offering to help soldiers make sense of their experiences. 'Seeing Israeli social workers in India was amazing and moving,' Langer said with a smile. Shochat, a reservist officer in an elite IDF unit, a trauma-specialized social worker and a rescue volunteer with Magnus, a company that locates and retrieves travelers abroad, recognized the distress of Israelis traveling to the East between rounds of reserve duty. Together with Tamar Friedman, a trauma-focused social worker, military psychologist and Magnus volunteer, he established Hamakom ('The Place') – a support and growth space in northern India for travelers grappling with emotional challenges related to the war. Why are so many young Israelis seeking refuge in India? Shochat: 'Since October 7, the extent of physical and emotional injuries has left Israel in a state of trauma. About 1.5 million residents suffer from trauma at varying levels and 10,000 soldiers have been diagnosed with stress reactions during the war. Around 80,000 young Israelis have flown to the East to escape, disconnect and forget amid overwhelming mental anguish.' Langer, for example, was diagnosed with post-trauma manifesting as hypervigilance and sleep problems. 'At first, I didn’t understand what was happening to me. It was something new, unfamiliar,' he shared. 'Hezi helped me realize that I’d gone through incredibly difficult experiences — ones that only someone who was there could understand.' When trauma travels with you Among the colorful alleys of Goa and the tranquil streets of Dharamshala, Hamakom, operating seasonally to align with travelers' movements, serves as a beacon of hope. 'We’ve reached a critical juncture,' Shochat said. 'We realized Israel had a kind of back yard where thousands of young people are seeking refuge.' Why do breakdowns often happen in the very places they escape to? 'There are various reasons, but the main ones include the foreign environment, disconnection from family and uncontrolled use of mind-altering substances. These factors pose a real danger to individuals who are already suffering from post-trauma or instability caused by the intense experiences they’ve faced. 'We’ve seen a 500% increase in rescues of young people from the East since October 7,' he added. 'Without professional care to process these experiences, escaping to the East can exacerbate post-traumatic symptoms, trigger emotional breakdowns and even lead to psychosis.' Daily resilience workshops, music and movement therapy and one-on-one conversations are held at Hamakom. 'We don’t just provide treatment,' Shochat explained. 'We create a supportive community. Sometimes it starts with a chat over coffee on the balcony, and from there a significant healing process begins. 'Our uniqueness lies in the combination — we can talk to soldiers about PTSD in professional terms, but we can also say, ‘I was there with you in the field; I understand.’ This creates an immediate trust that’s critical for recovery.' Why India? 'It’s a natural question — why not use the resources available in Israel? The fact is, we’re at a critical crossroads. We don’t aim to administer treatment here; we aim to provide immediate support to those who need help and are in a place where they’re unsure who to turn to. 'Our rationale is to be at this critical point, preventing them from seeking harmful alternatives and guiding them toward safe paths to recovery.' A legacy of support Hamakom is dedicated to the memory of Capt. (res.) Ron Efrimi, Shochat’s unit comrade who was killed in action in Gaza. 'Ron maintained a safe and supportive space for his soldiers and was an anchor for those dealing with stress and anxiety throughout the fighting,' Shochat recalled. 'We’re the second generation of Israelis in India,' Langer reflected. 'The reservists, the older crowd — we have things to lose back home: kids and family. But the younger generation I’ve seen here, they arrive and just break down.' Did you ever feel like you were on the verge of breaking down? Langer: 'The truth is I broke down too at the end of Hezi’s lecture. I got into bed and didn’t get out for two whole days — I just slept. It was like my body did some kind of restart. I realize now that I got a life lesson here.' Following the encounter, Langer decided to return to Israel and begin psychological treatment. 'I understood that I couldn’t keep raising my kids and functioning in this state,' he admitted. 'Thanks to Hezi and the space he and the team created, not only was I able to regain myself — I even returned to reserve duty. 'Hezi managed to normalize the abnormal state I was in,' he said. 'He told me it’s okay to feel how I feel and it’s okay to accept myself even when I’m not okay.' A bridge to long-term rehabilitation The numbers speak for themselves: Since the war began, nearly half of the calls to support hotlines have been from young people ages 20–30 in the IDF, reserves, bereaved families and survivors of the Nova Music Festival massacre. Over 3,000 travelers have received support and aid at Hamakom since its establishment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We work closely with Sheba Medical Center’s Trauma Unit, NATAL and Magnus Search and Rescue,' Shochat noted. 'This allows us to ensure continuity of care even after they return to Israel. We’re not just offering immediate support — we’re serving as a bridge to long-term rehabilitation.' But to continue this vital work and provide a light for those searching for their way back to themselves, Hamakom needs support. 'We’ve launched a crowdfunding campaign,' Shochat said. 'Every donation enables us to reach out to another young man or woman, thousands of miles from home, in urgent need of help.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bk00wt59lkx	2025-01-07T06:42:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/rJAz00jKUyx/rJAz00jKUyx_0_291_1600_901_0_small.jpg

According to him, 'it is a shame for every soldier's life to continue the unnecessary fighting in Gaza. The war is currently not bringing any hostages or military or security achievements.' He added that the solution for him to end the war is a siege: 'This is the only way that has surrendered Jerusalem and its surroundings, and throughout world history, all wars.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1vzu6c8jx	2025-01-07T06:29:20-08:00	
Trump asks New York appeals court to dismiss hush money case befo...	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump asked a New York court on Tuesday to throw out his conviction on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star, and to dismiss the case before his scheduled Friday sentencing. The request to a state appeals court marked a last-ditch effort by Trump to block a lower court ruling on Monday to proceed with the sentencing on Friday, 10 days before Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. In Monday's ruling, Justice Juan Merchan rejected a request from Trump's lawyers to delay the sentencing while they appealed two of his previous rulings upholding the Manhattan jury's May guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying records Trump has long argued that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, brought the case to harm his 2024 reelection campaign. Bragg has said that his office routinely brings felony falsification of business records charges. The hush money case made Trump the first U.S. president - sitting or former - to be charged with and convicted of a crime.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rku7pt98je	2025-01-07T06:25:50-08:00

Hostage families in purgatory between hope and despair as negotia...	As negotiations with Hamas continue over a potential hostage release, families protest government inaction, file legal petitions, and demand the immediate return of all hostages; Delays in Mossad Chief Dedi Barnea’s travel to Qatar highlight stalled proceedings Amid reports of a list of 34 hostages whom Hamas claims it is willing to release, tensions remain high among their families. Mossad Chief Dedi Barnea, who was scheduled to depart for Qatar on Monday for discussions, has yet to travel. Israel continues to await Hamas' response while professional teams in Doha carry on with negotiations. Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Majed Al-Ansari, stated Monday that negotiations are ongoing 'despite challenging conditions.' He explained that 'technical delegations are meeting regularly, and talks are progressing. However, it is impossible to determine a timeline for reaching an agreement regarding Gaza.' Meanwhile, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan reiterated the organization’s position: 'A cease-fire, IDF withdrawal, and Gaza’s reconstruction without Israeli conditions are necessary. We address the issue of prisoners in Israeli jails as one unified matter, without referencing specific factions or groups.' Barnea was expected to join U.S. officials and mediators in Doha but has yet to travel, which some interpret as a sign of difficulties in the talks. Sources familiar with the negotiations said Monday that 'Barnea’s travel depends on sufficient progress. If he goes, it signals a decisive stage in the negotiations. Meanwhile, there is cautious optimism in Israel that talks are moving in the right direction.' However, others expressed skepticism. 'Barnea's travel should not necessarily be seen as a measure of Israel's seriousness,' a source said. He has traveled to Qatar before, merely to appease his superiors. A more significant indicator would be if CIA Director Bill Burns goes to Qatar, as he would not waste his time without tangible progress. The same gaps in the negotiations persist, particularly regarding IDF withdrawal and a return to the north, not just the names for the first phase of releases.' Families take legal action and protest against government inaction Separately, 112 family members of hostages filed a groundbreaking petition with the Supreme Court, accusing the government of violating two Basic Laws by 'abandoning their loved ones in Hamas tunnels in Gaza for 459 days.' The petition, filed against the government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, claims 'the government has unlawfully abandoned the hostages for 459 days, violating their constitutional rights to life, bodily integrity and human dignity.' Petitioners emphasized that their appeal to the Supreme Court is made on behalf of the hostages, requesting urgent interim and conditional orders requiring the state to explain 'why the Israeli government’s refusal to agree to a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza by the Hamas terrorist organization does not unlawfully infringe on the constitutional right of the hostages to life, bodily integrity and human dignity. Consequently, the government must act to secure their release, including agreeing to a cease-fire and withdrawing from Gaza in exchange for the hostages’ freedom.' Kobi Ohel, the father of hostage Alon Ohel, expressed his efforts to remain optimistic. 'I constantly focus on the positive, visualizing Alon with me. I want to believe the prime minister and the negotiation team are doing everything to achieve a comprehensive deal to bring everyone home,' he said in an interview with Ynet. 'I am confident the prime minister can reach a comprehensive agreement – I don’t understand why it needs to be done in phases.' Conversely, Simona Steinbrecher, the mother of hostage Doron Steinbrecher, expressed her skepticism. 'I’m not optimistic about the negotiations,' she said. 'We’ve been in this situation many times before, and things always fell apart at the last moment. There’s nothing new in the list. They keep talking, but we need to get everyone out because the conditions are horrific. If the hostages all return in body bags, there’s no future for this country. Everyone must understand that if they or their children are taken hostage, they will receive no help.' During a cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv, hostage families protested, urging decision-makers not to 'miss the historic opportunity to reach an agreement that guarantees the return of all the hostages.' The families displayed a list of all 100 hostages at the protest site. Ella Ben-Ami, the daughter of hostage Ohad Ben-Ami, stated, 'On October 7, I lost my trust in the country. I lost my sense of security in my own home. The only thing that can restore my faith and safety is the return of all 100 hostages.' Sharon Calderon, the sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Calderon, shared the emotional toll, saying, 'For 459 days, we’ve had no day or night. We’re all stuck in the same safe room as that cursed Saturday. We just want our loved ones home. We want everyone back now, in one phase. We’re not giving up on anyone—not the soldiers, the young people, the women, the fathers, no one.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Doron Zekzer, the adoptive father of hostage Idan Alexander, emphasized: 'A true victory is 100 families reunited, closing the circle. One hundred families returning to life, breathing again, resuming normalcy, and starting their healing process. The cabinet’s only focus should be on how to bring them home. The real victory image is everyone back home.' Avivit Yahalomi, the sister of Hanan Yablonka, who was murdered on October 7 and whose body was returned from Gaza, shared her pain: 'Hanan came back as a corpse from Hamas tunnels. He came back in a bag. We don’t want our hostages to return like this. We’re broken. We stand here crying out to bring them home—both the living and the dead for burial. We don’t want bags; we want them back in a deal. No family should have to receive a bag like we did. We will continue to cry out that every single hostage must come back home.' Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, addressed the negotiations, expressing optimism about the involvement of President-elect Donald Trump. 'I believe the president-elect knows how to generate public opinion and apply pressure,' he said. 'The issue of the hostages is close to his heart. The incoming administration will back Israel, and we’ll receive more support from his government.' Danon also commented on footage of hostages in Hamas captivity recently released, saying: 'The evidence is harrowing. We are sharing these details at the UN to highlight the hostages' suffering.' Former Defense Minister and IDF Chief of Staff Moshe 'Bogie' Ya’alon criticized the government in an interview with Ynet, accusing it of being willing to 'abandon the hostages' and refusing to release them, stating: 'They don’t want to end the war.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvdl39ukg	2025-01-07T06:02:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/BJWfMhKUyx/BJWfMhKUyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
This is the Emirati version of 'Gaza, the day after'	In the shadow of the talks for a cease-fire deal with Hamas, officials in Abu Dhabi are discussing the question of managing Gaza after the war, and are ready to send forces for temporary joint management with the US, but are also demanding the promotion of a Palestinian state and hoping that peace with Israel will be a lever of pressure on Netanyahu. The United Arab Emirates has discussed with Israel and the United States participating in a provisional administration of post-war Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority is able to take charge, according to people familiar with the talks. The behind-the-scenes discussions, reported by Reuters for the first time, included the possibility of the UAE and the United States, along with other nations, temporarily overseeing the governance, security and reconstruction of Gaza after the Israeli military withdraws and until a Palestinian administration is able to take over, a dozen foreign diplomats and Western officials told Reuters. The UAE is a close security partner of the U.S. and, unlike most Arab governments, has diplomatic ties with Israel. The diplomats and officials said this provides the Gulf state with some leverage over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. After more than a year of war, Israel remains reluctant to outline its own vision for Gaza and the international community has struggled to formulate a viable plan, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The diplomats and officials stressed the ideas that had emerged from the UAE talks lacked detail and had not been distilled into a formal, written plan nor adopted by any government. In the behind-the-scenes talks, Abu Dhabi is advocating for a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem under an independent Palestinian state, the sources said - something that Israel has publicly opposed. 'The UAE will not participate in any plan that fails to include significant reform of the Palestinian Authority, its empowerment, and the establishment of a credible roadmap toward a Palestinian state,' a UAE official told Reuters, in response to questions about the discussions. 'These elements - which are currently lacking - are essential for the success of any post-Gaza plan,' the official said. The PA was established three decades ago under the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, signed by Israel and Palestinians, and given limited authority over the West Bank and Gaza. It still exercises some governance in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but was run out of Gaza in 2007 by Hamas after a brief civil war. A U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters there had been talks with several partners, including the UAE, on options for governance, security and reconstruction, and that various draft proposals, plans and ideas had been put forward by partners. 'These have been deliberative discussions that continue, as we seek the best way forward,' the spokesperson said, declining to comment further on 'private diplomatic conversations.' The prime minister's office declined comment for this story. The Palestinian Authority did not respond to Reuters' questions. In addition to reforming the PA, four of the diplomats and Western officials said that Emirati officials had suggested the use of private military contractors as part of a post-war peacekeeping force in Gaza. The other sources confirmed they were briefed on what they described as Emirati post-war proposals, which included the possible use of such forces. The diplomats and Western officials said any deployment of such contractors would spark concerns among Western nations. Private military contractors, hired by the United States and other governments, have faced accusations of torture, human rights abuses, and use of excessive force, among other allegations, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The UAE official did not respond to questions about the use of military contractors. Reconstruction will take years Rebuilding Gaza, including its political institutions, is expected to take years and cost tens of billions of dollars, requiring substantial international support, following 15 months of Israel's devastating military campaign. While the UAE has criticized the conduct of Israel's military and Netanyahu himself, Israel still wants the oil-rich nation involved in post-war Gaza, according to two former Israeli officials, who declined to be identified. Like Israel, the Gulf state opposes Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group that led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. Abu Dhabi views Hamas and other Islamist groups as destabilizing forces. UAE officials have also expressed concern publicly over the war's impact on stability in the Middle East and on efforts toward greater regional integration and economic development. Asked whether Hamas was aware of proposals discussed by the UAE, Basem Naim, one of the organization's senior officials, told Reuters that after the war, Gaza must be 'distinctly Palestinian' and without 'foreign interventions.' Washington is pushing, alongside mediators Egypt and Qatar, for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israel and Hamas traded blame in late December for delays in reaching a ceasefire – which both sides had said appeared to be close last month. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington wanted to see a ceasefire deal concluded in the next two weeks. When asked about the future of Gaza, Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Donald Trump's transition team, said the U.S. president-elect - who is due to take office on Jan. 20 - would work in close coordination with Arab and Israeli partners 'to ensure that Gaza can one day prosper.' Reform of Palestinian Authority The Gulf state has said it would only send troops to a post-war multinational mission at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority and with the involvement of the U.S. Netanyahu, however, has said he is against the Palestinian Authority in its current form governing Gaza, citing his long-standing grievances over the PA's school syllabus, which he says fuels hatred of Israel, and its policy of giving salaries to families of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The UAE has called for a new prime minister to lead the Palestinian Authority, which Emirati officials frequently criticized as corrupt and inept during the closed-door talks, the diplomats and officials said, without providing specifics. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, who took office in March, has pledged to implement reforms within the Palestinian Authority whose finances have been in disarray for years as donor states have cut back funding until corruption and waste are tackled.

Fayyad served as prime minister from 2007 until resigning in 2013 after falling out with President Mahmoud Abbas, who remains in office. Reuters was unable to reach Fayyad for comment. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxcon5lke	2025-01-07T05:50:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/03/10/ryVoGEU700/ryVoGEU700_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg
Kfir Brigade completes mission in Gaza after 3 months	The Kfir Brigade, under the command of the 162nd Division, has completed its mission in northern Gaza after three months of combat in the area, the IDF announced on Tuesday.. During the mission, the troops eliminated numerous terrorists in airstrikes and close-quarters combat, some of whom participated in the October massacre. They also located weapons, destroyed underground tunnel routes, and dismantled Hamas' terrorist infrastructure, the IDF spokesman reported. The soldiers operated in multiple areas that posed a threat to IDF activity and Israeli border communities, including the Beit Lahia area and the terror stronghold in the Beit Hanoun area.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkpe002ciye	2025-01-07T05:20:41-08:00	
No more favors from Uncle Sam: Elbit to manufacture munitions for...	Israel’s Defense Ministry signs a massive deal with Elbit Systems to produce heavy air munitions and establish a national raw materials facility; The agreements aim to strengthen domestic defense manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign imports The Israeli Ministry of Defense has entered into two major strategic agreements with Elbit Systems, amounting to a total of $276 million. These agreements include the production of thousands of heavy air munitions and the establishment of a national facility for manufacturing raw materials. The overarching goal is to enhance Israel's independence in defense production and reduce reliance on foreign imports, a key objective outlined in the Ministry of Defense's plan, which was first revealed by Ynet. This initiative stems from a significant lesson learned during the Gaza war. At certain points during the conflict, the Biden administration delayed the delivery of heavy air munitions to Israel due to sharp disagreements with the Netanyahu government. Additionally, difficulties in sourcing raw materials from foreign suppliers further underscored the urgent need to reduce Israel’s dependency on imported defense supplies. Strengthening domestic production capabilities As part of the first agreement, Elbit Systems will supply the Ministry of Defense with thousands of heavy air munitions. The second agreement, led by the ministry's Planning Directorate and MAFAT (Directorate of Defense Research and Development), focuses on establishing a national manufacturing facility for raw materials. This facility will produce energetic materials critical to Israel’s defense industries, including those required for 'explosive chemistry' processes essential to bomb production. 'Today, we are laying the foundation for expanding Israel’s production self-sufficiency in two critical areas that are essential for the long-term operational capabilities of the IDF,' said Eyal Zamir, Director General of the Ministry of Defense, during the signing ceremony at Elbit Systems’ plant in Ramat HaSharon. 'These agreements will secure Israel’s independent capacity to manufacture a wide range of bombs and munitions. This historic initiative began before the war but was accelerated during it. We expect to see initial production capabilities in the near future, which will continue to expand until full independence is achieved in both areas.'

We are dedicated to significantly strengthening IDF's self-reliance in munitions production. The deep and longstanding partnership between Elbit and the defense establishment not only contributes to national security but also supports the Israeli economy and provides livelihoods for thousands of families across the country.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkumeq98ye	2025-01-07T04:30:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/11/07/9583431/9583431_1_112_980_552_0_small.jpg

First sergeant Ido Samiach falls in Gaza fighting	The 20-year-old soldier from the Nahal Brigade's special forces unit was killed in Beit Hanoun; he is the 828th member of the forces to be killed since the war began; public invited to join flag parade honoring him The IDF said on Tuesday that Staff sergeant Ido Samiach, 20 from Ganei Tikva, a member of the Nahal Brigade's special unit, fell in Beit Hanoun, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. He is the 828th IDF fatality since the war began. The Ganei Tikva municipality said he will be interned in the local cemetery on Wednesday and invited the public to join a flag parade along the road to the cemetery to honor him. His death was announced after the military said two officers, a company commander and his deputy were killed in Beit Hanoun in an anti-tank missile attack. Major Dvir Zion Revah, 28, and Captain Eitan Israel Shiknazi, 24, from the settlement of Eli, were killed in the same incident.

How Hebrew rose again: The revolutionary revival of Modern Hebrew	Comment: Today's Hebrew continues to grow, absorbing new words with the enthusiasm of a hungry IDF recruit The transformation of Hebrew from a dormant liturgical language into a vibrant modern tongue stands as one of history's most remarkable linguistic achievements. This revival wasn't just an academic exercise. It was a cultural revolution complete with street protests, family dramas, and eventually, a healthy dose of military humor. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, the stubborn visionary behind modern Hebrew, took his mission so seriously that he forbade his wife from singing lullabies to their son in any language but Hebrew. This made their child, Ben-Zion (later Itamar Ben-Avi), the first native Hebrew speaker in nearly two millennia - though one has to wonder if he occasionally dreamed in Yiddish. The Language Wars of 1913-1914 centered around the Technion in Haifa, where the proposal to use German as the primary language of instruction sparked what might be called the world's most educated riot. Students and teachers staged walkouts that would make modern social media activists proud, armed with nothing but their conviction and strongly-worded pamphlets. Key figures like Ahad Ha'am (Asher Ginsberg) argued for Hebrew as a cultural necessity, while David Yellin developed educational methodologies. Hayim Nahman Bialik expanded the language's literary capacity through poetry, and Naphtali Herz Tur-Sinai tackled the challenge of scientific terminology. The pronunciation debate added another layer of complexity. Ashkenazi Jews maintained certain distinctions lost in Sephardic pronunciation, while Yemenite Jews preserved even more elaborate sound distinctions. The adoption of Sephardic pronunciation as the standard became both a linguistic and political statement, breaking with diaspora traditions. The Hebrew Teachers Union (established 1903) faced the monumental task of standardizing teaching methods and creating new terminology. Imagine describing a smartphone using biblical Hebrew - it required linguistic gymnastics worthy of an Olympic medal. Words like 'חשמל' (electricity) and 'מחשב' (computer) emerged through clever adaptation of ancient roots. The resistance came from multiple directions: Ultra-Orthodox communities viewed secular use of Hebrew as nearly blasphemous- they preferred having Yiddish as the day-to-day language, German-Jewish intellectuals insisted on German's superiority for science, and British Mandate authorities pushed for English administration. Parents worried about their children's future in a world where Hebrew wasn't exactly LinkedIn's most requested language skill. The IDF became an unexpected linguistic laboratory, generating colorful military slang. 'Jobnik' (the one who has a job) (ג'ובניק) emerged as the slightly teasing term for non-combat soldiers, while 'Achi' (אחי, 'my brother') became the universal term of address. 'Pazam' (פז'ם) became both a countdown to release and a state of mind. Modern Hebrew has evolved into a language equally comfortable with biblical prophecies and TikTok challenges. Take: 'על הפנים' (al ha-panim) literally translates to 'on the face' but is used colloquially to mean 'terrible,' 'awful,' or 'messed up.' Today's Hebrew continues to grow, absorbing new words with the enthusiasm of a hungry recruit at the mess hall. As soldiers say, 'Yalla Bye' (יאללה ביי) - a perfect linguistic mix of Arabic and English, that would make the 1920s purists spill their café botz (Turkish coffee, literally 'mud coffee'). One anonymous Israeli soldier quipped: 'If Moses heard us speaking Hebrew today, he'd probably need a translator - and a strong drink to cope with our slang.' But that's the beauty of a living language - it evolves, adapts, and occasionally makes the ancestors raise an eyebrow or two from above. The success of Modern Hebrew stands as a testament to human determination, cultural preservation, and the unwavering commitment of a people to achieve their national linguistic renaissance, transforming what others deemed impossible into reality. Through meticulous linguistic innovation, ancient Semitic roots have been ingeniously adapted to embrace modern concepts, from 'סלפי' (selfie) to 'מטבע מבוזר' (cryptocurrency, literally 'decentralized currency'), creating a seamless bridge between biblical heritage and contemporary life. This revival demonstrates how Hebrew serves not just as a means of communication, but as a powerful tool for national Jewish identity and cultural continuity, making Hebrew unique among the world's languages as the only successfully revived ancient tongue now serving millions in their daily lives.

Hamas uses Gaza hospitals for command, distribution of arms and s...	IDF releases footage of a captured Hamas terrorist describing how the terror groups launched attacks from the hospital in Gaza believing it safe from Israeli attack moving anti-tank missiles, grenades and small arms through the facility A captured Hamas terrorist who was employed at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya said the facility was used by the terror group as a command center, a launch bad for attacks and a point for the distribution of arms to Hamas fighters. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit published on Tuesday a clip of the interrogation of the terrorist, a 21-year-old cleaner at the hospital who was a member of the Nuchbah force since he joined the terror group in 2021. The IDF arrested some 240 individuals, the largest number of terrorists caught in one location, in the hospital compound and shut it down. 'They believe the hospital is a safe haven for them because the military cannot directly target it with an F-16 missile or destroy the building since there are civilians and patients there,' said 21-year-old Anas Muhammad Faiz Al-Sharif, who described working as a cleaning supervisor at the hospital. 'I joined the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades in 2021, serving in the Nukhba Force. I was arrested at the Kamal Adwan Hospital, where medical staff was staying alongside operatives from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al-Nassr Brigades and other organizations in northern Gaza.' When asked what the terrorists were doing at the hospital, he answered: 'They were transferring equipment and weapons, like AK-47s, bullets and pistols. The weapons were brought to and from the hospital, in and out. Reconnaissance units and patrols would leave the hospital late at night.' According to Sharif, 'They [terrorists] would arrive at the hospital in the morning and distribute grenade and mortar munitions for attacking tanks, whether at Kamal Adwan, Falouja (in the Jabaliya refugee camp), or areas with newly established (terrorist) presence.' Over 240 terrorists were arrested during the operation in Jabaliya and around 20 were killed in battle. IDF Naval commandos from Shayetet 13 discovered limited weaponry at the hospital but encountered an exceptionally large number of terrorists — the largest group apprehended in a single location in Gaza since the war began. Commanders from the 401st Brigade, which spearheaded the operation, noted that some Hamas terrorists wore fake bandages to disguise themselves as wounded or sick individuals.

Courtesy of Golani: A tour through ravaged Radwan Force stronghol...	Reporter's notebook: Golani troops in South Lebanon, where destruction looms large, Hezbollah’s tactics are exposed, and personal stories of resilience emerge; tasked with dismantling terror infrastructure, securing border and ensuring residents can safely return to north We are driving along the winding mountain road through the Shi'ite town of Al-Adisa. The scenery is breathtaking, with clear skies unbroken by clouds. Yet the weather is deceptive—stepping out of the jeep, the chill of the Lebanese winter is immediately felt, piercing even through ceramic body armor. The destruction here is absolute. According to satellite images analyzed by geo-analyst Ben-Zion Maklis, 80% of Al-Adisa's homes have been destroyed. No one remains in the town, but scattered remnants of the lives lived here can still be found: a school backpack with a blue elephant illustration, a child’s lone shoe, empty packaging for cellular equipment, a grocery store frozen in time. Suddenly, by the roadside, we see his face: Hassan Nasrallah, his thick beard, black turban, and smug grin staring at us from a pierced banner made of tarpaulin. To his left is Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, and to his right, Imad Mughniyeh. This is just 430 yards from Kibbutz Misgav Am. The night before, fighters from Golani Brigade’s 12th Battalion raided the town, which had been occupied just prior to the cease-fire. Their mission was to locate and destroy as much of Hezbollah's infrastructure and weaponry as possible before IDF withdrew from Lebanon. 'Al-Adisa was supposed to serve as a launch point for the takeover of Misgav Am by a Radwan Force company,' explains the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Miran Altit, who oversees the Rami Ridge sector on both sides of the border. 'Last night’s raid uncovered six crates of rockets, anti-tank missiles, IEDs, and RPGs in a residential home.' Civilians and combat Lieutenant Omer, a platoon commander in the battalion, describes how Hezbollah used civilians as shields. 'In one of the villages, we entered a children’s room and found a toy car, a baby swing, and a blue barrel containing a combat vest and the father’s combat gear. Weapons are everywhere.' This is the battalion’s sixth combat front since the war began. On October 7, they were urgently deployed to the Gaza border region and fought in its southern region; then they moved to maneuver combat in Gaza and Khan Younis. From there, they headed north to defend Mount Dov for over seven months. When the maneuver into Lebanon began, the battalion operated in both central and western sectors. 'We carried out three large-scale raids under the 188th Armored Brigade’s battle team—in the towns of Yaroun, Aita ash-Shab, and on the Shiite ridge,' says Altit. Now, they are stationed at the peak that has loomed over the Galilee Panhandle for years. We pass through the village of Kila, where one-third of the homes have been destroyed. Dozens of anti-tank missiles were fired from here at Metula since the start of the war. To the east rises Mount Hermon, its snowy peaks glistening. To the north stands the Beaufort Fortress. These valleys and dirt roads, I recognize from my own days as a soldier in the Security Zone 30 years ago. Michael, a battalion fighter and the company commander’s radio operator, is from Metula. His parents are divorced—his father lives in the center of the country, and his mother, a special education teacher, resides in Metula. 'On October 7, when we were deployed to the Gaza border region, they took our phones. Two weeks later, before we entered Gaza, they gave them back so we could update our families. That’s when I found out my family had been evacuated from Metula.' Initially, they lived in a Tel Aviv hotel. After a few months, they moved to a rented apartment in the city center. 'In recent weeks, when I’ve been on leave, I’ve been going back to our house in Metula to clean and organize. Of everyone in my family, our house suffered the least damage—just items knocked over by shockwaves, broken glassware, and overall neglect. My grandfather’s house was hit worse, and my uncle’s house was completely destroyed by an anti-tank missile.' For Michael, fighting in Lebanon, just a stone’s throw from his home, feels like the closing of a circle. 'Most of my friends in Metula are soldiers, and every one of them will tell you it’s been their dream since childhood. We’d see the houses in Kila, Al-Adisa, and Al-Khiam, and all we wanted was to one day go in there. It’s like a dream come true, seeing Metula from the other side of the border. I even got to see our house from inside Lebanon. I see it standing, relatively intact, and I see the destruction in the Lebanese villages from which they fired at us, and I think: ‘We’re winning.’ I hope we get to go home soon.' 'This is our ultimate mission,' says Lt. Col. Altit, 'to create the conditions for the residents to return. I see farmers rehabilitating fields, chicken coops resuming operations, and residents beginning to renovate their homes. It highlights the importance of our task. My dream is that by Passover, all the residents will return, and I’ll still be here to celebrate the Seder with them.' Altit, 32, lives in Haifa and is married to Talia, a medical student at the Technion. On October 7, he was still a trainee at the Command and Staff College. 'The war caught us on our honeymoon. Two days before it started, we returned from South Africa.' When asked if, as both a resident and a family man, he would return to Metula, Kiryat Shmona, or Misgav Am now, or wait, Altit responds: 'It’s a tough question. The villages that threatened Metula and Misgav Am are destroyed, and there are no more terrorists here. I believe that thanks to the IDF’s work, the conditions for the residents’ return will soon be ripe.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last week, journalist Nahum Barnea wrote that the deployment of the Lebanese Army in the area has been slower than expected, which could delay the IDF’s withdrawal beyond the 60 days agreed upon in the ceasefire. 'That’s not my concern as a battalion commander,' says Altit. 'We’re here until we receive other orders. There’s still work to do.' Since the war began, 107 soldiers and commanders from the Golani Brigade have fallen, most from the 13th and 51st battalions, which were stationed in Gaza on October 7. The 12th Battalion has also suffered losses. 'I personally lost 15 friends and acquaintances, most from the brigade,' says Lt. Omer. 'Staff Sergeant Noam Israel Abdu was my radio operator. He fell in Gaza as a squad leader trainee on the anniversary of the October 7 attack. When we destroy a rocket launcher, we say: ‘This is for Noam.’' Michael adds: 'I want to honor two soldiers from my company who fell—Noam Abdu and Sergeant Maor Cohen Eizenkot. We think about them every day and honor them with flags, stickers, company evenings, and by staying connected with their families. When new recruits join the company after training, we tell them about Noam and Maor. We’re fighting here to continue their legacy.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkwzodquye	2025-01-07T02:06:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/yk14214273/yk14214273_0_0_935_586_0_small.jpg

HRF files complaint alleging war crimes against IDF soldier in Ar...	Pro-Palestinian group sends alleged photos and videos of soldier in Gaza claiming he used civilians as 'human shields'; Brazilian police reconsiders similar charges against troop who fled country A complaint was filed in Argentina on Tuesday by the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) claiming an IDF soldier visiting the country committed war crimes. The pro-Palestine group presented photos and video clips showing the soldier posing for cameras with a blindfolded Palestinian detained by the troops, 'using him as a human shield.' The HRF claimed it was in possession of more photographic evidence that the soldier took clothes from displaced Gazans and organized attacks against civilian infrastructure including setting homes on fire. He was heard, they claim, instructing homes to be destroyed while residents were inside and tried to destroy evidence of his actions. The foundation’s leaders include Diab Abu Jahjah and Karim Hassoun, both based in Belgium. Abu Jahjah, a long-time supporter of Hezbollah, once described the September 11 attacks as 'sweet revenge' in a 2003 New York Times interview. He also founded the Arab League in Europe and continues to post inflammatory statements against Israel on social media. Hassoun, chairman of the Arab European League since 2005, has consistently refused to recognize Israel, describing it as a 'colonialist and racist state.' Following the October 7 Hamas terror attack, Hassoun wrote: 'The Palestinians are not invading Israel; they are returning home and reclaiming their property.' The Hind Rajab Foundation’s latest actions underscore a growing challenge for Israel, as legal threats against IDF personnel escalate worldwide. By acting swiftly, the Foreign Ministry demonstrated its commitment to protecting Israeli citizens from targeted legal and political campaigns. However, the case serves as a stark reminder of the risks Israeli soldiers face abroad. Meanwhile, Brazil's federal police on Tuesday appealed to the federal court and said further inspection is required in the case of an IDF soldier the HRF filed a complaint against for alleged war crimes in Gaza, to prove his connection to the alleged incidents and allow him to be prosecuted in the country. The foundation which was named for a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was claimed to have been killed by IDF fire during the war, said that the Brazilian government decided to take action after a complaint was filed against the Israeli who arrived in Brazil a week ago. In their complaint, the foundation said his actions were part of a broader effort that included genocide and crimes against humanity, according to international law. The Israeli soldier left the country with his friends before legal action could be taken against him, his family told Ynet, adding they were relieved after a tense period of time and were awaiting his return home. 'He's out of there,' his father said. 'Everything will be fine.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Against this backdrop, local news outlet Metropoles reported a disagreement among federal police officials regarding the legitimacy of such an investigation. A request for a review of the decision read that 'technical and legal issues' surrounding such a move need resolution. According to the report, some investigators in the Brazilian police argue that a war crimes investigation against the soldier could rely on Brazil's status as a signatory to the Rome Statute, which underpins the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Others, however, believe that this is insufficient for prosecution and that a local law defining such an offense is needed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1l37oq8kx	2025-01-07T01:11:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/SyUVIsv8Jg/SyUVIsv8Jg_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

Death toll nears 100 and rising, in powerful Tibet quake	magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the northern foothills of the Himalayas near one of Tibet's holiest cities and 50 miles from Mount Everest; tremors felt in Nepal; A magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the northern foothills of the Himalayas near one of Tibet's holiest cities on Tuesday, Chinese authorities said, killing at least 95 people and shaking buildings in neighboring Nepal, Bhutan and India. The quake hit at 9:05 a.m. (0105 GMT), with its epicenter located in Tingri, a rural county known as the northern gateway to the Everest region, at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre. The U.S. Geological Service put the quake's magnitude at 7.1. At least 95 people were known to have been killed and 130 injured on the Tibetan side, China's state-run television reported six hours later. There were no reports of deaths elsewhere. Southwestern parts of China, Nepal and northern India are frequently hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Tuesday's epicenter was around 80 km (50 miles) north of Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain and a popular destination for climbers and trekkers. Winter is not a popular season for climbers and hikers in Nepal, with a German climber the lone mountaineer with a permit to climb Mount Everest. He had already left the base camp after failing to reach the summit, Lilathar Awasthi, a Department of Tourism official, said. Nepal's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) said the tremors were felt in seven hill districts bordering Tibet. 'So far we have not received any information of any loss of life and property,' NDRRMA spokesman Dizan Bhattarai told Reuters. 'We have mobilised police, security forces and local authorities to collect information,' he said. Many villages in the Nepalese border area, which are sparsely populated, are remote and can only be reached by foot. The impact of the quake was felt across the Shigatse region of Tibet, home to 800,000 people. The region is administered by Shigatse city, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism. Chinese President Xi Jinping said all-out search and rescue efforts should be carried out to minimise casualties, properly resettle the affected people, and ensure a safe and warm winter. More than 1,500 local firefighters and rescue workers have been dispatched to the affected areas, China's Xinhua news agency reported. Some 22,000 items including cotton tents, cotton coats, quilts and folding beds have also been sent to the quake-hit region, it said. Tremors, aftershocks Villages in Tingri, where the average elevation is around 4,000-5,000 meters (13,000-16,000 feet), reported strong shaking during the quake, which was followed by dozens of aftershocks with magnitudes of up to 4.4. Crumbled shop fronts could be seen in a video on social media showing the aftermath in the town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road. Reuters was able to confirm the location based on nearby buildings, windows, road layout, and signage that match satellite and street view imagery. There are three townships and 27 villages within 20 km (12 miles) of the epicenter, with a total population of around 6,900, and more than 1,000 houses have been damaged, Xinhua reported. Local government officials were liaising with nearby towns to gauge the impact of the quake and check for casualties, and China closed the Everest region to tourists after the quake, it added. The Tingri tremor was caused by a rupture in what is known as the Lhasa block in an area under north-south compression and west-east stress, CCTV reported, citing Chinese experts. Since 1950, there have been 21 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above in the Lhasa block, the largest of which was the 6.9-magnitude quake in Mainling in 2017, according to CCTV. Mainling is located in the lower reaches of Tibet's Yarlung Zangbo river where China is planning to build the world's largest hydropower dam. A magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Nepal's capital Kathmandu in 2015, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands in the country's worst ever earthquake. Among the dead were at least 18 people killed at the Mount Everest base camp when it was hit by an avalanche. On Tuesday, tremors were felt in Kathmandu, some 400 km (250 miles) from the epicenter, and residents in the city ran out of their houses. 'The bed was shaking and I thought my child was moving the bed ... I didn't pay that much attention but the shaking of (a) window made me understand that it's an earthquake,' said Kathmandu resident Meera Adhikarii. 'I'm still shaking out of fear and am in shock.' One person was injured in Kathmandu when he jumped off the top of a house after feeling the strong tremors, Nepal Police spokesman Bishwa Adhikari said. The man was being treated in hospital.

Powerful earthquake kills nearly 100 in Tibet, rattles Nepal	A magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the northern foothills of the Himalayas near one of Tibet's holiest cities on Tuesday, Chinese authorities said, killing at least 95 people and shaking buildings in neighboring Nepal, Bhutan and India. The quake hit at 9:05 a.m. (0105 GMT), with its epicenter located in Tingri, a rural county known as the northern gateway to the Everest region, at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre. The U.S. Geological Service put the quake's magnitude at 7.1.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skbpcd5uje	2025-01-06T23:51:26-08:00	
Terror victim's family wins court order to seize Palestinian Auth...	The Yaniv family, whose sons Hallel and Yagel were murdered in a terrorist attack in February 2023, secured a court order to seize $5.2 million from Palestinian Authority funds under a new law compensating terror victims and targeting terrorism financing Israel has seized $5.2 million from Palestinian Authority funds following a lawsuit filed by the Yaniv family, whose sons, Hallel and Yagel Yaniv, were murdered in a terrorist shooting at the Huwara junction in February 2023. The Jerusalem District Court approved the seizure based on a lawsuit submitted last week by the family, alongside a request for a temporary freeze of PA funds held by Israel. The lawsuit was made possible under the Compensation for Terror Victims (Exemplary Damages) Law enacted in 2024. The lawsuit targets the PA’s policy of paying stipends to terrorists and their families. The Yaniv family’s legal team argued that 'senior Palestinian officials openly declare that payments to terrorists are a supreme national value. They have even stated that if the PA had only one shekel left, it would be given to 'martyrs' and prisoners.' The legal filing also cited a previous court ruling, which rejected the PA’s defense that these payments were 'social benefits,' instead labeling them as a 'criminal incentive system.' The murder of Hallel and Yagel Yaniv Hallel Menachem Yaniv and Yagel Yaakov Yaniv, two brothers in their early 20s, were brutally murdered on February 26, 2023, in a nationalist-motivated terrorist attack near Huwara. According to the request submitted by their parents, Esther and Shalom Yaniv, through attorney Asher Shatov, founder of the Justice for Terror Victims organization, the attacker was a resident of Nablus, a city under PA control. The terrorist was killed during a firefight with Israeli security forces during an attempt to apprehend him. The lawsuit details the events of the attack, stating that the terrorist arrived at the main road in Huwara and waited for a vehicle carrying Israeli settlers. Spotting the victims’ car stuck in traffic, the terrorist approached on foot, reaching the front passenger window before firing multiple rounds at close range, killing both brothers instantly. The terrorist’s two sons allegedly assisted him in the attack and have been arrested, with legal proceedings ongoing against them. The lawsuit includes claims against these accomplices as well. The legal filing was made under the Compensation for Terror Victims Law, which came into effect in June 2024. This new legislation entitles the heirs of individuals killed in terrorist attacks to exemplary compensation of $2.6 million per victim. The law allows such claims to be made against both the perpetrators of terrorist acts and those who fund terrorism. Since the law’s enactment, Israeli courts have issued several temporary seizure orders targeting PA funds held by Israel. For instance, in November 2024, $44 million of PA funds were seized following lawsuits filed by families of victims of the Nova music festival massacre. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Adv. Asher Shetov, who represents the Yaniv family and heads the Justice for Terror Victims organization, said: 'The Compensation for Terror Victims Law, which we initiated and was passed in the Knesset this year, will lead to billions of dollars in compensation for families of terror victims. The Yaniv family’s lawsuit achieves two key goals: providing fair compensation for the family and striking a financial blow to the infrastructure that funds and incentivizes terrorist attacks. This lawsuit is part of a series of legal actions we are pursuing, and we are committed to continuing to support terror victims in filing claims to deplete terrorism’s financial sources and ensure justice for its victims.' Shalom Yaniv, the father of Hallel and Yagel, added: 'Nothing can bring back our sons or ease the pain in our hearts. However, the seizure of PA funds is a step toward justice for our family and for the victims of terrorism. It is a just and necessary action, and every family affected by terrorism should take similar steps to send a clear message that those funding terrorism will also pay the price financially. At the same time, Israel must take a firm stance on deporting terrorists. We are grateful to the Justice for Terror Victims organization for guiding us through this legal process.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjcaduqujl	2025-01-06T23:17:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/02/26/SyoRAxKAs/SyoRAxKAs_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Are Israeli soldiers at risk of arrest abroad?	Arsen Ostrovsky: Israel needs to make clear to every country that if they should try and indict or arrest an Israeli individual, that will severely harm their bilateral relations Israeli soldiers traveling abroad will need to exercise greater caution, following an investigation into alleged war crimes involving a soldier visiting Brazil, according to international human rights attorney Arsen Ostrovsky. 'So far, Israel has been able to stay ahead of this particular incident,' Ostrovsky noted. 'But that may not always be the case.' He emphasized the importance of Israel taking a strong stance to protect its citizens: 'Israel needs to make clear to every country that if they should try and indict or arrest an Israeli individual, that will severely harm their bilateral relations with the State of Israel.' Ostrovsky further stressed the need for cooperation with key allies, particularly the United States, to counter such actions. 'Israel, working with allies, primarily the United States, should make clear to other countries that if they should entertain lawfare campaigns to abuse the rule of law and international legal system for these vexatious and baseless claims, they too will suffer the consequences, including possible sanctions upon these countries,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqckbqikx	2025-01-06T21:31:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/BJsqFUr8kx/BJsqFUr8kx_0_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg

What’s driving Biden’s last-minute arms deal with Israel?	The deal is said to include heavy bombs, precision munitions, artillery shells, and fighter jet supplies With less than two weeks until Donald Trump’s inauguration, a significant change has already reshaped Senate leadership. On Friday, John Thune officially replaced Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader. McConnell stepped down after nearly two decades at the helm, making way for Thune to lead the Republican-majority Senate—albeit by a slim margin. One of Thune’s immediate challenges will be overseeing the confirmation of President Trump’s key nominees for top administration roles. Among the appointments are former Governor Mike Huckabee as U.S. Ambassador to Israel and Morgan Ortagus, recently nominated to serve as Deputy Mideast Envoy. While Huckabee’s nomination has garnered widespread support, several of Trump’s picks have sparked debate, even within Republican circles. In the House of Representatives, Louisiana Congressman Mike Johnson was re-elected as Speaker on Friday. Johnson’s leadership is expected to provide stability for Republicans as they pursue their priorities, including today’s formal count of the Electoral College votes. Johnson, a vocal supporter of Israel, previously spearheaded the House’s approval of $14 billion in aid to the Jewish state last spring. Meanwhile, reports in American media indicate that outgoing President Joe Biden plans to finalize a substantial arms package for Israel before leaving office. The deal is said to include heavy bombs, precision munitions, artillery shells, and fighter jet supplies. However, the production and delivery of some items, such as the heavy bombs, may face delays due to concerns about civilian impacts in Gaza. The State Department has already notified Congress of the proposal. Just five weeks ago, following the Lebanon ceasefire, Biden approved a $680 million arms package for Israel, signaling that additional support was forthcoming. Efforts by liberal Democrats to block arms transfers to Israel were defeated, with strong bipartisan support for Biden’s approach. In his final days, this move underscores the administration’s steadfast commitment to Israel. Biden, who often describes himself as a Zionist, leaves office with this significant gesture of support—a promising sign for the future of bipartisan backing for the Jewish state.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by00bbrq8jl	2025-01-06T20:57:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/06/B1gwA7LyHC/B1gwA7LyHC_0_95_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israelis safe after being stranded in northern Japan blizzard	Rescue team manages to reach the three IDF soldiers after concerns for their health and safety; Japan embassy thanks efforts of local authorities Three young Israelis were rescued after they were stranded since Monday morning on Mount Shirouma, part of the Nagano prefecture in central Japan, suffering from severe hypothermia. A rescue team was able to reach the three and bring them safely down off the mountain where they were met by Israel's ambassador to Japan Gilad Cohen, before being transported to hospital for treatment of frost bites and examination. Harsh weather conditions complicated rescue efforts, and friends in Israel were deeply concerned that the three may not survive the night after they reported that they are 'freezing' and their mobile phone battery was rapidly running out. Israel’s Foreign Ministry, along with the Israeli Embassy in Tokyo and the Magnus rescue company worked diligently to assist in the rescue operation. The three men, all former combat soldiers in the IDF, had traveled to the area for a snowboarding trip. Straying off their designated trail, they became trapped in an area with no viable route forward. The sudden onset of harsh weather left them immobilized and in life-threatening conditions.

Venezuela claims arrested Israeli national allegedly working as U...	Minister announces arrest of 125 suspected mercenaries from 16 countries, including one Israeli national; Israel’s Foreign Ministry says investigating; Venezuela cut ties with Israel in 2009 Venezuelan authorities announced on Monday the arrest of an Israeli national suspected of working as a mercenary for the United States in an alleged plot to stage a coup against the government. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said that a total of 125 mercenaries from 16 different nationalities had been detained as part of ongoing operations to thwart what the government described as destabilization efforts. According to Cabello, the suspects are nationals of the United States, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Peru, Spain, Italy, Ukraine, Switzerland, Lebanon, Albania, Germany, Yemen, Argentina, Guyana and Israel. Israel's Foreign Ministry confirmed it is investigating the report. The lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Venezuela—severed in 2009 following Israel's Operation Cast Lead in Gaza—may complicate efforts to obtain more information. Cabello’s statement is the latest in a series of accusations by the Venezuelan government, which has frequently blamed the U.S. for attempting to undermine its leadership. Last year, Venezuelan authorities announced the arrest of three Americans, two Spaniards and a Czech national, alleging they entered the country to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro. Cabello claimed at the time that the individuals were part of a CIA-backed plot to overthrow the government and eliminate senior officials. Venezuela also claimed that one of the arrested Americans had served in the U.S. Navy. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the past, Maduro has leveraged the detention of U.S. citizens to extract concessions from Washington. Last year, in a deal between the two nations, Maduro released 10 Americans and a fugitive wanted in the United States. In exchange, the U.S. granted clemency to Alex Saab, a close ally of Maduro arrested in Florida on charges of money laundering. U.S. prosecutors allege that Saab assisted Maduro in evading U.S. sanctions. Washington accuses Venezuela of rigging the vote in disputed elections held on July 28 last year and of committing human rights violations. Following the presidential elections, Maduro declared victory, but the opposition claimed it had won by a significant margin. The National Electoral Council refused to release detailed results. Many Western and Latin American countries recognized the opposition's claim and condemned Maduro's government. Since the elections and Maduro's declaration of victory, Venezuela has been gripped by unrest, with hundreds arrested during protests. Despite international condemnation and the lack of transparency from the Electoral Council, Venezuela's Supreme Court—which supports Maduro—confirmed his victory in August. Subsequently, the country's attorney general issued an arrest warrant for opposition leader Juan González, who refused to acknowledge the results and fled to Spain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hku950yi1g	2025-01-06T13:44:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/15/BJNpNX4T0/BJNpNX4T0_362_113_1460_822_0_small.jpg

The exemption, known as a general license, also allows some energy transactions and personal remittances to Syria until July 7. The action did not remove any sanctions. Syria suffers from severe power shortages, with state-supplied electricity available just two or three hours per day in most areas. The caretaker government says it aims to provide electricity up to eight hours per day within two months.

Israel signals reticence about incoming UN Middle East envoy	Israel rejects UN’s nomination of Finland’s Pekka Haavisto as Middle East envoy, citing concerns over bias and support for two-state solution; decision adds to tensions with UN as frustrations mount over diplomatic failures Tensions between Israel and the United Nations escalated after Jerusalem rejected UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ proposal to appoint Finland's former foreign minister Pekka Haavisto as the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East. Israel dismissed Haavisto’s nomination and requested alternative candidates, a decision that now awaits Guterres’ next steps, including consultations with the Palestinians and the UN Security Council. Israel reportedly opposes Haavisto’s candidacy due to his close ties with Guterres, his advocacy for a two-state solution, and past criticism of Israeli policies. Officials fear his appointment could exacerbate existing tensions between Israel and the UN. Haavisto, a seasoned diplomat with extensive international experience, has served in various high-stakes roles, including UN investigations in Kosovo and as the EU’s representative in Sudan and Somalia. Haavisto would replace Norwegian diplomat Tor Wennesland, who recently ended his four-year tenure. Wennesland played a crucial role in mediating between Israel and Hamas, notably averting conflicts through humanitarian measures. However, his efforts failed to prevent the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which marked a turning point in his tenure.

2 soldiers killed in northern Gaza battle, one identified	A man of truth and humility': Cpt. Eitan Shiknazi, 24, from Eli, killed by anti-tank missile in Beit Hanoun; IDF fatalities reach 827 since war The IDF announced Monday evening that Captain Eitan Israel Shiknazi, 24, from the settlement of Eli, was killed in combat in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. Shiknazi, a deputy company commander in the Nahal Brigade and a former Egoz Unit commando, was struck by an anti-tank missile. Another soldier was killed in the same incident, though his name has not yet been released. Two additional soldiers from the 932nd Battalion were seriously wounded and are receiving medical care, with their families notified. Since the start of the war, IDF casualties have risen to 827, with hundreds more wounded. Shiknazi, a graduate of the Bnei David pre-army academy and the 10th soldier from Eli to fall in the war, was mourned by his local community. Binyamin Regional Council head Yisrael Gantz described him as a heroic leader. 'Eitan lived and died with dedication to his people and land.

Two weeks before inauguration, Trump warns of ‘hell’ over hostage...	US president-elect reiterates ultimatum to Hamas; criticizing Biden for inaction, Trump promised decisive measures to secure their release U.S. President-elect Donald Trump reiterated his warning Monday that if hostages held in Gaza are not released by his inauguration on January 20, there will be 'all hell to pay.' Speaking on conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt's show, Trump criticized outgoing President Joe Biden, saying he would not rely on words like 'DON'T' but instead on decisive action, referencing Biden’s warning to Hezbollah and Iran after the October 7 massacre, where he used the word 'DON’T' to caution against their involvement in the war. When asked to elaborate on his warning, Trump said, 'Exactly what it says. If those hostages aren’t released by the time I get to office, there will be hell to pay. I don’t think I have to go into it anymore. It won’t be the word 'don’t'... There will be hell to pay. Those hostages have to get out. They have to get out now. Trump emphasized his strong alliance with Israel, saying, 'I’m the best friend that Israel ever had. You look at what happened with all of the things that I’ve gotten, including Jerusalem being the capital, the embassy getting built. I got it built. And of course, the Abraham Accords. Every major event that’s happened to Israel over the last fairly short period of time has been given through me. So I’m with Israel. I think that’s pretty obvious to everybody.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last month, Trump claimed he was working behind the scenes to assist Israel and secure the hostages’ release. 'We’ve been working hard to help Israel and the Middle East,' he said in a press conference, adding that he had spoken with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the situation. 'We had a very good conversation about what’s to come. I’ll be ready on January 20, and if the hostages aren’t home by then, hell’s gates will open, and it will be very strong.' Analysts suggest Trump’s ambiguous phrasing may hint at a reluctance to fully restart a large-scale conflict if a cease-fire takes hold before his inauguration. Hamas could interpret this dynamic as favorable, believing that a Trump administration may accept a non-active war state in Gaza rather than escalate the situation. Meanwhile, Israeli forces are reportedly preparing for intensified operations across Gaza if a deal for the hostages is not reached. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkidu3f8yx	2025-01-06T12:04:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/13/ryD00G8fG1g/ryD00G8fG1g_0_82_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
US Congress certifies Trump election victory with Harris presidin...	Democratic candidate concedes loss with call to uphold democratic norms; certification marks peaceful transfer of power amid heightened security The U.S. Congress formally certified Republican President-elect Donald Trump's election victory on Monday during a session presided over by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the November contest. The quadrennial ritual, clearing the way for Trump's inauguration in two weeks, went like clockwork and stood in sharp contrast to four years ago when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block the certification of then-President Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden. Trump continues to claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, and had warned throughout his 2024 campaign that he harbored similar concerns until his Nov. 5 defeat of Harris. Harris oversaw the roll call of the states in the vice president's ceremonial role as president of the Senate. Known for her broad smiles and upbeat demeanor in public appearances, she stood stoic with hands clasped on the dais as she handed off certificates of each state's electoral votes for Trump and herself. 'Today was obviously a very important day, and it was about what should be the norm and what the American people should be able to take for granted, which is that one of the most important pillars of our democracy is that there will be a peaceful transfer of power,' Harris told reporters at the Capitol. 'I do believe very strongly that American democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it.' Four years ago, then-Vice President Mike Pence had to preside over Biden's victory. In 2001, then-Vice President Al Gore had the same dubious distinction following a bitter battle between him and George W. Bush that ended so close that the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately had to put a stop to the legal challenges, leading to Bush being declared the winner. Sitting in the House chamber was Senator JD Vance, whose vice presidential victory was also certified by Harris. Vance stood and waved to the members in the chamber when his electoral vote total was announced. 'Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. MAGA!' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social earlier on Monday. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The joint session of Congress proceeded even as a winter storm hovered over the nation's capital, dropping about 6 inches (15 cm) of snow and snarling travel. The final certification backed up preliminary findings that Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris's 226. Republicans control White House, Congress Republicans also captured a majority in the U.S. Senate and held a narrow edge in the House in November's election, which will give Trump the party support he needs to implement his planned agenda of tax cuts and a crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally. Democrats did not try to block the certification of Trump's victory on Monday. 'We must renew our commitment to safeguarding American democracy,' No. 2 House Democrat Katherine Clark said in a statement earlier in the day. 'As elected leaders, our loyalty must be to the Constitution, first and always. We are here to honor the will of the people and the rule of law.' Security inside and outside the Capitol was heightened in preparation for the certification and was expected to remain in place through Trump's swearing-in on Jan. 20. The Capitol grounds were ringed by metal fences hundreds of yards from the U.S. Capitol, and accessible only via checkpoints guarded by uniformed police officers. Convoys of black police vehicles were on hand, led by a 10-wheel Baltimore police mobile command center. New York Police Department reinforcements were also patrolling the area. Inside, extra teams of uniformed U.S. Capitol Police officers were checking IDs at entrance sites including doors and underground tunnels leading to the House and Senate chambers. Trump has said he plans to pardon some of the more than 1,500 people charged with taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, when a mob fought with police, smashing its way in through windows and doors and chanting, 'Hang Mike Pence,' referring to Trump's then-vice president, in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden's victory. In the 2021 melee at the Capitol, rioters surged past police barricades, assaulting about 140 officers and causing more than $2.8 million in damage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hybr9hf8kl	2025-01-06T11:32:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/ryxlGiFLJl/ryxlGiFLJl_0_23_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF wary of retreat amid Lebanese army stalled action in southern...	While US Mideast envoy Hochstein affirms full IDF withdrawal from southern Lebanon, Israeli officials hint at extending presence if Lebanese armed forces fail to meet cease-fire obligations The Lebanese Army announced on Monday it has begun deploying forces in the town of Naqoura in southern Lebanon. This development comes after reports in Lebanon claimed that Israeli forces have withdrawn from the area. While IDF officials are reportedly considering extending their presence in Lebanon beyond the timeframe stipulated in the cease-fire agreement, U.S. Middle East envoy Amos Hochstein clarified during his visit to Beirut: 'IDF will withdraw from all Lebanese territory.' Hochstein, following a meeting with Lebanese Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, stated, 'IDF has begun withdrawing from Naqoura in southern Lebanon, and will withdraw from all Lebanese territory. Implementing the agreement in southern Lebanon is not easy, but we are committed to supporting the Lebanese Army.' According to Lebanon’s LBCI news outlet, a convoy of Lebanese Army and UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) troops entered Naqoura for the first time since the cease-fire agreement was established. A subsequent statement by the Lebanese Army confirmed that its forces had taken positions around the town of Naqoura and begun deploying in coordination with UNIFIL and the Five-Nation Monitoring Committee overseeing the cease-fire. The Lebanese Army noted, 'The deployment occurred simultaneously with the Israeli enemy’s withdrawal from the town.' During Hochstein’s meeting with former Lebanese President Michel Aoun, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Lisa Johnson was also present. Reports from the Saudi news channel Al-Arabiya quoted Lebanese Army sources stating that Hochstein supported the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. The Lebanese Army reportedly informed Hochstein that full deployment along the border would only be possible once Israel completed its withdrawal. According to Lebanon’s MTV news agency, Hochstein told Aoun that efforts are currently underway to facilitate the withdrawal of IDF troops from villages in southern Lebanon before the 60-day deadline expires. However, Aoun argued that the Lebanese Army’s ability to fully implement the agreement remains hindered by the continued Israeli presence in these villages. Israeli actions raise concerns over cease-fire deadline Meanwhile, reports from Lebanon describe ongoing Israeli military activity in the south. The Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported the IDF demolished several homes and buildings in the town of Al-Jibeen. Similarly, the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar claimed it had carried out bulldozing operations along Hamra Road, near a Lebanese military post, before advancing toward the village of Al-Mateet. Additionally, an Israeli Merkava tank reportedly targeted a house near the village of Ainata. The end of this month marks the expiration of the 60-day period stipulated in the cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. However, IDF has already stated it is not etched in stone. According to Al-Akhbar, a Lebanese military source accused Israel of gradually introducing new rules of engagement and attempting to solidify its freedom of movement as a permanent reality, even beyond the cease-fire period. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The source added that Lebanese military officials received indications from Jesper Jørgensen, head of the cease-fire monitoring mechanism in Lebanon, that Israel intends to extend the cease-fire period from 60 to 90 days. This extension, according to the Lebanese newspaper, would depend on Israel achieving key objectives, including ensuring that Hezbollah is unable to initiate attacks. Israeli military officials are currently considering the possibility of remaining in Lebanon beyond the cease-fire deadline. However, no final decision has been made. IDF is preparing for this option, explaining that the decision depends on Lebanon’s actions and whether its military can establish full control over southern Lebanon. Israel is hopeful that the U.S. will understand their position, emphasizing that withdrawing on time without Lebanon meeting its obligations would be problematic. It is likely the incoming Trump administration will work to prevent the collapse of the cease-fire arrangement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk1w59yi1x	2025-01-06T10:38:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/Sk6q00FYU1e/Sk6q00FYU1e_0_0_900_506_0_small.jpg
Minute-by-minute: Chilling details of deadly West Bank attack	3 gunmen open fire on cars and buses near Kedumim, killing police officer Elad Winkelstein, Rachel Cohen and Aliza Reiss; PM Netanyahu and IDF chief Halevi vow swift action Three Israelis, including a police officer and two women, were killed, and 11 others injured in a terror attack Monday morning near the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq, close to the settlement of Kedumim in the West Bank. The attackers, traveling in a car, opened fire on passing vehicles and buses along Highway 55 before fleeing toward Nablus. 9:10 a.m.: A vehicle carrying three assailants arrives from the west on Highway 55 in the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq. The attackers make a U-turn and wait in the car as other vehicles pass. 9:11 a.m.: The vehicle aligns with the traffic flow, positioning itself for the attack. 9:12 a.m.: The assailants exit the car and begin shooting at passing vehicles. Rachel Cohen and Aliza Reiss are shot at point-blank range from multiple directions and killed. The attackers also open fire on Elad Winkelstein’s vehicle. Winkelstein, traveling with his son, returns fire and attempts to flee with his child. 9:13 a.m.: The attackers fire at two buses passing through the area. One of the buses is bulletproof, mitigating casualties. 9:14 a.m.: A bystander, Ammi Barber, opens fire at the attackers but is unable to neutralize them. 9:15 a.m.: The assailants re-enter their vehicle and flee along Highway 55 toward Nablus. The IDF has launched a manhunt, sealing off nearby villages and conducting intelligence operations to locate the suspects and their accomplices. At least two of the assailants are known to Israeli security forces and are believed to be linked to Jenin and Qabatiya in the northern West Bank. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an emergency meeting with defense officials, approving measures to apprehend the attackers and enhance security in the region. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi visited the scene, vowing to capture those responsible. 'The clock is ticking for these terrorists,' Halevi said, pledging to implement measures to bypass the village and improve road safety. Of the injured, a bus driver in severe condition and five others, including two elderly women with moderate injuries, were transported to hospitals in Kfar Saba and Petah Tikva.

Canada PM Justin Trudeau says he will step down	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation on Monday, telling the nation that 'internal battles' mean he 'cannot be the best option' in the next election. Trudeau said he has asked the president of his Liberal Party to begin the process of selecting a new leader. He has faced rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister late last year signaled growing turmoil within his government. Parliament will be suspended until March 24. It had been due to resume on Jan. 27. The timing will allow for a Liberal Party leadership race. Trudeau had been the second-youngest prime minister in Canada's history when he was elected in 2015, and he had been planning to run for a fourth term in next year's election even as discontent in his party grew. He said 'I have always been driven by my love for Canada' and repeatedly described himself as a fighter.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj7zc9tijg	2025-01-06T09:01:21-08:00	
France holds Algerian influencers on charges of urging violence	Two of 3 suspects facing terror charges for inciting violence in TikTok videos, amid rising France-Algeria tensions; influencers 'Imad Tintin' and 'Zazou Youssef' posted videos advocating attacks in France, prompting arrests and potential expulsions French authorities on Sunday held three Algerians suspected of inciting violence in TikTok videos, with at least two of them facing terror-related charges. The arrests come amid growing political tensions between Paris and its former North African colony. The three posted their videos on accounts named Sofia Benlemmane, Abdesslam Bazooka and Laksas06. A video blogger known as 'Imad Tintin' was arrested Friday outside Grenoble after publishing a video urging followers to 'burn alive, kill and rape on French territory.' The post was taken down after receiving 800,000 views but hardline right-wing Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau published a video grab on his social media accounts, condemning the publication as 'vile.' A judge on Sunday placed the 31-year-old blogger under judicial supervision, Grenoble prosecutors said. He was due to appear Monday in a fast-track trial on charges of 'direct incitement of an act of terrorism,' the state prosecution service said. 'Imad Tintin' entered France in December 2021 and applied for a residence permit in August 2023 after his marriage to a French woman. But his application was refused and he is also subject to an expulsion order. In a second case, a 25-year-old Algerian identified as Youcef A. but known on social media as Zazou Youssef was remanded in custody Friday in the western city of Brest, prosecutor Camille Miansoni said in a statement. He will stand trial there on February 24 on a charge of 'publicly advocating an act of terrorism' in posts to his hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers, she said. He faces up to seven years in jail and a 100,000-euro ($103,000) fine if convicted, the statement added. Zazou Youssef appeared in a video posted on TikTok on December 31, calling for attacks in France and violence in Algeria. He was living in France on a temporary residency permit. TikTok told AFP the account from which the video was posted had been banned for posting several videos that broke its rules on hate speech. Prosecutors announced the arrests of Imad Tintin and Yousseff on Friday and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau on Sunday announced a third arrest. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The third man was detained in the southern coastal city of Montpellier for violent comments targeting an Algerian activist opposed to that country's government. Prosecutors told AFP local authorities had reported a video in which the influencer said of the activist: 'Kill him, let him suffer.' The regional prefect's office told AFP it was considering withdrawing that blogger's residence permit and issuing an expulsion order. Tensions have surged between France and Algeria after President Emmanuel Macron renewed French support for Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara during a landmark visit to the kingdom last year. Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, is mostly under the de facto control of Morocco. But it is claimed by the Sahrawi separatists of the Polisario Front, who are demanding a self-determination referendum and are supported by Algiers. French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal, a major figure in modern francophone literature, has meanwhile been imprisoned by the Algerian authorities since mid-November on national security charges. Mentioning Sansal's case on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he had 'doubts' over Algeria's commitment to a roadmap set out by the two sides in 2022 to smooth post-colonial relations. 'Zazou Youssef' and 'Imad Tintin' have joined 'the war waged in France by the Algerian regime,' Chawki Benzehra, an Algerian dissident, told AFP. Benzehra took refuge in France after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019. He accused the Algerian authorities of mobilizing a 'significant' number of influencers calling for 'violence.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1fnyffikl	2025-01-06T08:04:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/BJTvPHKI1l/BJTvPHKI1l_0_64_390_220_0_small.jpg

Tehran says detention of Iranian in Italy amounts to 'hostage-tak...	Iran slams Rome over detention of Iranian suspect accused of involvement in drone strike against US forces in Jordan Iran said on Monday the detention of an Iranian national in Italy at the request of the U.S. amounted to hostage-taking. Iranian businessman Mohammad Abedini was detained in Milan last month. He is wanted by the U.S. on suspicion of involvement in a drone strike against U.S. forces in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement. His arrest has been linked to the detention three days later of Italian reporter Cecilia Sala, who was seized in Tehran on Dec. 19 while working under a regular journalistic visa. 'We regard the pursuit or extradition of Iranian nationals in certain countries as a form of hostage-taking,' Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei told reporters. 'The main accusation against them is circumvention of unilateral U.S. sanctions,' he said in a televised news conference in Tehran. 'Fabricating a judicial cover to trap Iranian nationals is illegal, immoral, and a violation of human rights.' Asked if Sala's detention was linked to Abedini's arrest in Italy, Baghaei said: 'These matters are not related in any way.' Abedini was detained at Milan's Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in the 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Abedini is currently being held in prison and a court is due to decide this month whether to grant him house arrest while judges consider the U.S. extradition request.

Elad Yaakov Winkelstein fired shots at the terrorists before being hit by a fatal bullet in front of his son Aliza Reiss and Rachel Cohen were identified as two of the victims murdered in the West Bank terror attack on Monday. Earlier Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein was identified as well. The three were victims of the murderous attack by a terror squad near the settlement of Kedumim. The terrorists opened fire on a bus and private vehicles on route 55 before escaping the scene. A manhunt was underway. Cohen and Reiss were both educators who lived in Kedumim. Cohen was 73, a retired school counselor. She was survived by her husband and five daughters. Naomi, her daughter said her mother was full of joy, positive energies and a giving person. 'She was God fearing and an active and loved grandmother,' Naomi said. 'She was who we went to for everything. A loving mother and wife and a special and moving person.'

His son who was in the car with him when they came under attack saw his father shoot at the terrorists but then he was hit by the fatal shot to the head that killed him, in front of his son's eyes. Security officials said initial investigations of the attack revealed there were three terrorists in the squad who fired at the passing bus and cars on the road. Two of them are known to the security forces and arrived from the Jenin and Qabatia area. The officials said there was no early induction of the attack and that the terrorists lay in wait for an opportune moment to strike.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syh1xwtlyx	2025-01-06T05:01:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/ByeBKR8t8ke/ByeBKR8t8ke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Rising concerns about immigrants violence and political correctne...	Ynet’s Ze'ev discusses how political correctness hinders action. He notes that authorities’ reluctance stems from fear of stigmatizing immigrant groups while growing safety concerns fuel right-wing movements As Europe continues to address the troubling rise of crimes committed by certain immigrants and public safety concerns, we spoke with Ynet's correspondent based in Berlin, Ze'ev Avrahami, to explore the underlying issues and the role political correctness may play in hindering effective action by authorities. Why do you think these issues are often overlooked or underreported by authorities across Europe, including in Sweden, Germany, and France? First, let’s reflect on what occurred in the UK. This wasn’t an isolated problem—it happened in numerous places, and the scope and graphic details of the crimes are truly horrifying. But this isn’t confined to the UK; it’s a Europe-wide issue. If we examine the UK reports and investigations, it becomes evident that there was systemic negligence. Parents, institutions, the judicial system, and law enforcement all failed the victims—primarily white British girls from working-class backgrounds, aged 11 to 18. Meanwhile, the perpetrators were predominantly British citizens of Pakistani descent, aged 30 to 40. What’s even more distressing is that everyone knew what was happening. How much of a role does political correctness play in preventing authorities from addressing crimes committed by certain immigrant groups? It plays the central role. The reluctance to address these crimes stems from a fear of being labeled as targeting immigrants, particularly those from Pakistani Muslim backgrounds. Cultural factors also play into this—some of these groups view women as property or objects, regardless of whether they are 11 or 25 years old. The age and scope of the crimes make them particularly shocking, but the underlying issue is a reluctance to acknowledge the problem. Do you believe people in countries like the UK, France, and Sweden are growing frustrated with political correctness? Absolutely, but it’s a byproduct of deeper issues. Take Sweden, for example. It has long been considered a model of liberal democracy, with a strong welfare system and economy. Yet, today, 20% of Swedes are voting for a party with neo-Nazi roots. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: This shift is largely due to concerns over personal safety. Many Europeans no longer feel secure—whether it’s walking the streets at night or in certain neighborhoods. These fears are driving people toward the right wing, which poses significant dangers in Europe, given its history. To combat this, governments must address these concerns rather than dismiss them as overblown. There is a problem, and it needs to be taken seriously. So, in your view, this fear and frustration are key drivers behind the rise of right-wing movements across Europe? Without a doubt. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sypl1ntukg	2025-01-06T04:14:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/04/B1v1zgTF0/B1v1zgTF0_0_96_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
What can be learned from the list of hostages that may be release...	The 34 hostages that Hamas claimed it would release, whether alive or dead, in the humanitarian exchange, are the same named in an Israeli demand presented to mediators last July International media outlets published a list of 34 hostages on Monday morning, that they said was given to them by Hamas which includes 22 elderly men, 10 women, and two young children, Ariel and Kfir Bibas. According to Israeli officials, it is the list that Israel presented to mediators last July with the demand that they be among the first freed. Hamas now claims it is willing to release all 34 hostages Israel demanded, though it has not said who among them was alive and what their condition was. Hamas asserts that to verify the condition of the hostages, it requires a ceasefire of at least a week, to investigate their status. In contrast, Israel insists that Hamas must release some hostages as a 'good faith' gesture before the ceasefire begins, allowing the terror group time to find out the condition of the others. Officials also denied that any confirmation from Hamas regarding the identity of hostages to be freed, has been received. The publication of this list, one day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office categorically denied its existence, appears to be another move by Hamas to pressure Israel in the negotiations. The list, as of now, identifies 34 hostages under consideration for release as part of a humanitarian exchange. Notably, it excludes male soldiers and many young hostages, along with those officially declared dead by Israel, including Judy Weinstein, Inbar Hyman, and Ofra Kedar. As long as Israel does not agree to a full ceasefire, Hamas is expected to continue refusing to release the remaining 66 hostages not on the list, 34 of whom have been declared dead. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Sunday that Israel had not received any acknowledgment or response from Hamas regarding the hostages’ conditions. 'Israel will continue to work tirelessly to bring home all of our hostages,' they stated. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Hostage and Missing Persons Directorate, led by Gal Hirsch, updated the families of the hostages about the list published today in the media. 'This is a 'humanitarian' list that Israel handed to mediators months ago, containing names of women, children, elderly over 50, sick, and wounded,' the directorate stated. 'Hamas has not responded to the status of those listed. Negotiations continue, and we are doing everything to bring back all hostages, both the living and the deceased.' The directorate also urged the public and the media to act responsibly and avoid publishing names or rumors that could harm families or the effort to secure the hostages’ return. The list, divided into four categories, includes a variety of hostages, some of whom are women, children, and elderly individuals. In the first category, there are seven women and children who are slated for release as part of the deal. These individuals are Roni Gonen, 24; Emily Damari, 28; Arbel Yehoud, 29; Doron Steinbrecher, 31; Ariel Bibas, 5; Kfir Bibas, 1; and Shiri Silberman Bibas, 33. The second category consists of five female soldiers who were kidnapped from the Nahal Oz outpost. These are Liri Albag, 19; Karina Ariev, 20; Agam Berger, 20; Daniela Gilboa, 20; and Naama Levy, 20. The third category lists eleven men aged 50 to 85. They are Ohad Ben-Ami, 55; Gad Moshe Moses, 80; Keith Shmuel Siegel, 65; Ofer Kalderon, 53; Eliyahu Sharabi, 52; Itzhak Elgaret, 69; Shlomo Mansur, 86; Ohad Yahalomi, 50; Yousef Yousef Alziadna, 54; Oded Lifshitz, 84; and Tsachi Idan, 50. Finally, the fourth category includes eleven additional hostages. They are Hesham El Said, 36; Yarden Bibas, 35; Sagi Dekel Chen, 36; Lair Horn, 46; Omer Wenkert, 23; Alexandre Troufanov, 28; Eli-Ya Cohen, 27; Or Levy, 34; Avera Mengistu, 38; Tal Shoham, 39; and Omer Shem Tov, 21. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bytyybkijg	2025-01-06T03:34:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/04/SkvjYl1D8Je/SkvjYl1D8Je_28_99_1085_610_0_small.jpg

Palestinian foundation charges Israeli visiting Thailand of war c...	The Hind Rajab Foundation filed a complaint alleging war crimes in Thailand against an Israeli soldier visiting the country. the foundation was seeking local legal representation that is experienced in international law and crimes against humanity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjxuvntlyx	2025-01-06T02:04:05-08:00	
HFR seeks charges against IDF soldier in Thailand	Palestinian group looking for legal representation to go after troops visiting the country; Foreign Ministry mulls response to threats, issues warnings and advise to avoid danger The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) was looking for legal representation to file complaints against Israeli soldiers vacationing in Thailand accusing them of war crimes. The group filed a first complaint recently against one such soldier. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar summoned a meeting on Sunday dealing with how to protect Jews and Israelis abroad. The discussion was held after the minister's involvement in the attempted arrest of the soldier in Brazil and his consequent escape. It was the first in a series of planned meetings, and it dealt with improving cooperation between all agencies to deal with the issue. The discussion dealt with a complaint lodged by HRF in the Brazilian federal court against an IDF soldier who was visiting the country. The court ordered the police to begin an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by the soldier during the war in Gaza. From the perspective of the Israeli authorities, managing such an event includes three stages: monitoring, assessing, and understanding the extent of the danger in traveling abroad. During the discussion, Saar instructed the participants to formulate procedures for similar cases and instructed the IDF to brief the soldiers and forbid them from posting any operational activities. Minister Sa'ar also instructed to establish a hotline for inquiries from soldiers and civilians. Sa'ar also instructed to monitor organizations that operate against IDF soldiers abroad. Since the October 7 massacre, there have been 12 cases of soldiers who have been legally persecuted around the world. Based on the details, it was learned that in the second half of 2024 there was a 63% increase in online antisemitic incidents, and a 104% increase in physical antisemitic incidents. The main danger posed to IDF soldiers in countries with a hostile stance towards Israel, including Ireland, Brazil, Spain, Belgium and South Africa. Since the beginning of the war, proceedings have been opened against IDF soldiers in the following countries: Morocco, Norway, Belgium, Cyprus, Sri Lanka, the Netherlands, Brazil, Thailand, Ireland, Serbia, France and South Africa, although in all those cases, the proceedings were the result of appeals to the legal authorities and not the initiative of the local governments. The discussion also revealed that IDF soldiers were smuggled under the radar from at least five countries. However, but no arrest warrant has been issued against IDF soldiers in any country. Anti-Israel organizations such as the Hind Rajab Foundation and the March 30th Movement have requested such warrants, but have failed in every country. Behind this activity are activists linked to Samidoun, which has been designated as a terrorist organization by Israel. The Hind Rajab Foundation claims to have provided the International Criminal Court in The Hague details of a thousand IDF soldiers. The foundation was established in February last year by several Palestinians living in Brussels in memory of the 6-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, who they claim was killed by IDF forces on January 29 last year along with all her family members while they were in their car. The main problem is the fact that IDF soldiers post incriminating videos on social media, in which they record themselves carrying out activities in Gaza and Lebanon. The soldiers also post their travel plans on their platforms. The foundation collects the videos, verifies them with additional data, and contacts governments when those soldiers travel abroad according to their social media. The IDF has trouble enforcing the social media ban on operational activities. However, most cases include reservists who ignore orders. Political sources said this phenomenon will only get worse. The Hind Rajab Foundation has so far published the names of the soldiers, giving Israel enough time to rescue the soldier. In the case of Brazil, they learned their lesson, filed the complaint, and the federal court reached the decision without reporting his name. Ultimately, the foundation's announcement was enough for Israel to locate the soldier and rescue him and his friends from Brazil. Not all countries are hostile and dangerous for IDF soldiers. Israel is in contact with friendly countries, such as Hungary, the Czech Republic and Italy, which most likely will not allow pro-Palestinian organizations to concoct their arrest.

In the Netherlands, wanted notices were even posted against IDF soldiers with local citizenship who returned to the country. No one is immune, and every young person who travels abroad must be careful everywhere. What can be done? First of all, delete all videos on the Internet that could incriminate you. In addition, before traveling, it is worth checking whether you are at risk of arrest. Keeping a low profile can help and there is no need to report where you are traveling. You can wait with the posting about your trip until after returning to Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyr1amt8je	2025-01-06T01:26:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/H1aUfgL71g/H1aUfgL71g_0_170_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Sderot home hit in Hamas rocket attack	IDF intercepts one of three rockets fired on Monday, one hits border city and another falls in open area; rockets launched in the northern part of the Strip Hamas fired rockets from northern Gaza, at Sderot and the Gaza border area on Monday. One home in Sderot was hit according to preliminary reports. The Sderot municipality said three rockets targeted the city, one was intercepted, and another fell in the city while forces were searching for the third. 'We do not know of any injuries at this time but some damage to property was caused,' the municipality said in a statement. Hamas fired at Israeli communities for nine consecutive days since last week and on Saturday, a mortar shell exploded near the Erez border crossing where trucks carrying humanitarian aid into the Strip, were waiting to pass. Some damage to the crossing was reported. The IDF said on Sunday that a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) who was the deputy commander of the rocket units in northern Gaza was killed in a targeted attack. According to the military he had participated in the October 7 massacre and carried out attacks on IDF troops in the Strip.

No hostages will be freed until the Gaza war ends’	Gershon Baskin: ‘There’s very little the international community can do to pressure Hamas to make a deal’ All of the Israeli hostages will not return home unless the war in Gaza ends, according to social and political activist Gershon Baskin. 'There’s very little the international community can do to pressure Hamas to make a deal,' Baskin told ILTV. 'Hamas’s main interest is to end the war, and they’ve been saying this for months.' Baskin highlighted that it remains unclear if Hamas would be willing to relinquish governmental control of Gaza. He emphasized that this issue must be addressed politically, not just militarily. 'The issue of Hamas’s weapons and troops is still undefined, and this is something that Israel has refused to address,' Baskin claimed. 'It must be dealt with at the political level, not only the military level, if we want a deal that will bring back all the hostages. All the hostages will not come back until the war is over.' Baskin spoke to ILTV shortly before a Hamas source told Reuters news agency that it had approved a list of 34 hostages for exchange and presented it to Israel. However, the Prime Minister’s Office denied the report.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkiiqzkiyl	2025-01-05T23:57:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/04/HJnTNbwLkg/HJnTNbwLkg_0_93_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Ágnes Keleti, Jewish Olympic legend, passes away at 103	Keleti made her Olympic debut at age 31, earning one gold and three additional medals The date for the funeral of Hungarian-Israeli Olympic champion Ágnes Keleti in Budapest has yet to be announced. A Holocaust survivor and the world’s oldest Olympic champion, Keleti passed away just one week shy of her 104th birthday. Widely regarded as one of the greatest Jewish athletes of all time, Keleti leaves behind an unparalleled legacy. As Hungary’s most decorated female Olympian, she achieved sporting excellence despite the immense challenges of her youth. Keleti lost her father in the Holocaust and survived by assuming a false identity and working as a maid in the home of a Nazi-sympathizing family. The war and a severe injury kept her from competing during her athletic prime. However, Keleti made her Olympic debut at age 31, earning one gold and three additional medals. Four years later, at the 1956 Melbourne Games, she captured four gold and two silver medals at the age of 35. During the Melbourne Games, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary, prompting Keleti to emigrate to Israel. She devoted her post-competitive career to developing Israeli gymnastics, teaching physical education at the Wingate Institute for 34 years, and coaching the national team until the 1990s. In 2017, Keleti was awarded the Israel Prize for her lifetime contributions to Israeli sport. Ágnes Keleti spent her later years nurturing the next generation of athletes, leaving an indelible mark on the global gymnastics community and Israeli sports development.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk25tmku1l	2025-01-05T23:54:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/ry3M5GKUJg/ry3M5GKUJg_0_78_492_277_0_small.jpg

Musk mingles in European politics, angering governments	Instigating against the UK, EU, Germany and other officials, world's richest man stirs controversy amid potential role in Trump's government and fostering connections with far-right leaders Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a close ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has been causing a stir in Europe in recent weeks. He has demanded new elections in the UK, expressed support for Germany’s far-right party, criticized its chancellor and voiced opposition to the European Union — all of this even before Trump’s inauguration. Musk’s support for far-right figures in Europe and his criticism of moderate governments have left European leaders wondering how to deal with him. Musk wields significant influence. As the owner of the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, he’s considered a close confidant of Trump and is set to hold an official role in the new U.S. administration. Recently, Musk has been making frequent comments about European politics, where governments are attempting to combat the rise of populists and far-right leaders — figures whom Musk openly supports. At times, he shares unverified content on his platform. '[Keir] Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain,' Musk said about the British Prime Minister. The statement referred to a grave case of child sexual abuse committed by men of Pakistani origin, which authorities allegedly covered up during Starmer’s tenure as England and Wales’s chief prosecutor. Over the past few days, Musk has repeatedly commented on the matter and posted numerous posts about on social media. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting responded by saying that Musk’s accusations were false and unfounded. In a series of tweets, after the issue resurfaced in the headlines, Musk claimed that Jess Phillips, the minister responsible for preventing violence against women and girls, 'deserves to be in prison' for refusing to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips clarified that the decision to investigate was the responsibility of Oldham’s city council. Musk alleged that Phillips’ refusal was aimed at shielding Starmer from prosecution. Streeting dismissed these claims as 'shameful defamation.' Musk has also called for the release of Tommy Robinson, a prominent far-right activist in the UK, and expressed support for the Reform UK party, which opposes immigration. He recently met with Nigel Farage, the party’s leader. UK media outlets have speculated whether Musk’s support for Farage’s party, which is currently considered a fringe political force, signals an intention to donate money to the party and help it compete for power against the Labor and Conservative parties. In a surprising turn, Musk called on Farage, one of the leading figures behind the Brexit campaign, to step down as party leader on Sunday. 'The party needs a new leader—Farage doesn’t have what it takes,' Musk wrote on X. Musk’s criticism of Farage followed the politician’s distancing himself from Musk’s support for Tommy Robinson. The British government is working to combat the spread of fake news on social media and Musk compared these efforts to actions taken by the authoritative regime of Soviet Russia. During the summer, amid heated far-right protests against migrants, Musk claimed that civil war in the UK was inevitable. Musk has also called for new elections in the UK, less than six months after a general election resulted in a landslide victory for the left. 'New elections are necessary,' he said, urging King Charles to dissolve Parliament in London. Beyond the UK, Musk has cultivated relationships with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a prominent far-right leader and outspoken opponent of immigration and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whom many consider a far-right figure. Meloni has described Musk as a 'genius.' Musk criticized the annulment of election results in Romania, where a far-right candidate had won. Judges invalidated the results, citing a Russian influence campaign. Musk called the judges 'dictators.' In Germany, Musk voiced support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, claiming it’s the only political force capable of 'saving' the country. He’s scheduled a live discussion with AfD leader Alice Weidel on X. Musk also called for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to resign after a vehicle-ramming attack at a Christmas market, referring to Scholz as a 'fool.' Scholz dismissed Musk’s personal attacks but expressed concern over his support for a party advocating closer ties with Russia and a weakening of transatlantic relations. 'There are many people on social media seeking attention through extreme rhetoric. I don’t believe we should chase after Musk, and I’m happy to leave that to others. The rule is: don’t feed the troll,' Scholz added. In light of Musk’s support for the AfD, the German government accused him of meddling in the electoral system, while opposition leaders also criticized him. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Musk has also targeted the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, advocating for increased authority for the European Parliament. Musk argued that the Commission is an undemocratic body. His remarks came as the EU is attempting to curb the spread of misinformation on social media and implement regulations governing content on X. In December, researchers from the European Council on Foreign Relations warned that Musk might exploit his social media platform to 'mobilize citizens and far-right parties in an effort to raise the political costs for decision-makers in Brussels,' who aim to regulate content on X. Former EU Commissioner Vera Jourova described Musk in October as a 'promoter of evil.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byzhpdul1e	2025-01-05T22:11:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/S1Edo57Qmyx/S1Edo57Qmyx_0_232_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

British broadcaster says obtained list from Hamas that does not specify who among the captives was alive and who wad dead; Saudi channel posts names, ages of hostages it claims Hamas provides Among the 34 names of hostages Hamas claims to include in the first phase of their release, if a deal is reached, are 10 women 11 people over the age of 50 and 2 children, the BBC reported on Monday. Hamas did not specify who among those listed were alive. The children include the two little babies of the Bibas family, Ariel and Kfir who were said to have been killed although Hamas provided no proof of their deaths. There are 10 women, 11 people between the ages of 55 and 85 and two small children among the 34 hostages Hamas was willing to release in the first stage of the deal being negotiated in Qatar, the BBC said on Monday. The British broadcaster said it had obtained the list of hostages to be freed in the humanitarian release but was not told who among those listed were dead and who were alive. The list includes Ariel and Kfir Bibas, which Hamas said had been killed in an Israeli strike in November of 2023 along with their mother Shiri, although the terrorists did not provide any evidence. The father Yarden is still being held in Gaza. Also on the list are hostages that Hamas defined as 'sick.' The Saud Asharq network posted a full list that includes names and ages but the list cannot be verified. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office (PMO) said in a statement on Sunday that no list has been received by Israel yet, though the Hamas official clarified that the list was merely 'approved.' According to reports, Israel insists on the release of at least 24 live hostages and has therefore requested that Hamas also release injured male hostages under 50 years old on humanitarian grounds. Reports also suggest not all individuals listed as hostages are necessarily alive. A Hamas official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that any agreement to return hostages would depend on a deal for Israel to withdraw from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire or end to the war. 'However, until now, the occupation continues to be obstinate over an agreement over the issues of the ceasefire and withdrawal, and has made no step forward,' the official who was not identified, said.

Move expected to ease supply of basic assistance to Damascus; West cautiously hoping for greater stability in Syria, a decade after the war triggered a major refugee crisis that shook up European politics. The Biden administration plans to announce Monday that it will ease restrictions on humanitarian aid for Syria, speeding delivery of basic supplies without lifting sanctions that restrict other assistance to the new government in Damascus, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The step, approved by the administration over the weekend, authorizes the Treasury Department to issue waivers to aid groups and companies providing essentials such as water, electricity and other humanitarian supplies, the WSJ reported citing officials. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his European counterparts Thursday in Rome on Syria, as the West looks to engage the new Islamist-led leadership. The State Department did not immediately specify the participants. Blinken, on a trip that will also take him to Japan and France, will later join President Joe Biden as he pays a farewell visit to Rome that includes an audience with Pope Francis. Islamist-led forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar Assad in a lightning offensive last month after 13 years of brutal war. Western powers have since been cautiously hoping for greater stability in Syria, a decade after the war triggered a major refugee crisis that shook up European politics. The French and German foreign ministers on Friday visited Syria, although the trip was overshadowed when new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa shook the hand only of France's Jean-Noel Barrot, a man, and not Germany's Annalena Baerbock, a woman.

The foundation claimed the soldier was involved in alleged war crimes. This prompted Israel’s Foreign Ministry to act urgently, coordinating with the IDF to identify and extricate the soldier from potential legal risks. The Hind Rajab Foundation, which has targeted IDF soldiers abroad, strategically avoided naming the soldier to prevent Israeli authorities from warning him. Upon learning about the situation, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and top officials, including the ministry’s director-general, launched a coordinated effort with the IDF to identify the soldier. Within hours, consular officials contacted him and his family, emphasizing the need for immediate evacuation. The soldier, who was traveling in a small group, was flown out of Brazil early the following morning. Israeli consular staff in Brazil assisted in securing a flight, ensuring his safety. Officials determined there was no active arrest warrant against him, but the foundation’s efforts heightened concerns over his legal exposure. While no formal charges or exit restrictions were in place, the ministry conducted a 'quiet review' to ensure the soldier could safely leave the country. A local attorney had filed a request to open an investigation, but no arrest warrant or detainment order was issued. The Foreign Ministry moved preemptively, opting not to take any risks. The soldier and some of his companions have since relocated to a different country. Israeli officials emphasized the importance of avoiding unnecessary risks in such situations and urged IDF personnel to exercise caution when posting on social media, as public statements can lead to legal complications abroad. Behind the Hind Rajab Foundation The Hind Rajab Foundation, named after a six-year-old Palestinian girl allegedly killed in Gaza in January 2023, was established in February by Palestinian activists in Brussels. The organization, affiliated with the broader 'March 30' movement, claims its mission is to seek justice for alleged war crimes committed by Israel against Palestinians. The group has shifted its tactics, avoiding publicizing the names of targeted soldiers to increase their chances of successful legal action. Recent reports from the organization claim it has compiled information on over 1,000 dual-nationality Israeli soldiers involved in the Gaza war. Arrest requests have reportedly been filed in eight countries, including Spain, Ireland and South Africa.

Abu Jahjah, a long-time supporter of Hezbollah, once described the September 11 attacks as 'sweet revenge' in a 2003 New York Times interview. He also founded the Arab League in Europe and continues to post inflammatory statements against Israel on social media. Hassoun, chairman of the Arab European League since 2005, has consistently refused to recognize Israel, describing it as a 'colonialist and racist state.' Following the October 7 Hamas terror attack, Hassoun wrote: 'The Palestinians are not invading Israel; they are returning home and reclaiming their property.' The Hind Rajab Foundation’s latest actions underscore a growing challenge for Israel, as legal threats against IDF personnel escalate worldwide. By acting swiftly, the Foreign Ministry demonstrated its commitment to protecting Israeli citizens from targeted legal and political campaigns. However, the case serves as a stark reminder of the risks Israeli soldiers face abroad. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkz6vpd8yl	2025-01-05T13:04:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/SyUVIsv8Jg/SyUVIsv8Jg_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg
Italy in talks over $1.5 billion SpaceX security services deal	Italy is in advanced talks with Elon Musk's SpaceX over a 1.5 billion euro ($1.55 billion) deal for the company to provide secure telecommunications to the government, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. Discussions are ongoing and a final agreement on the five-year contract has not been reached, but the project has already been approved by Italy's Intelligence Services and Defense Ministry, the report said, citing unnamed sources. SpaceX and Italy's Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment outside regular business hours. The report said the deal involves SpaceX supplying Italy with a full range of encryption for telephone and Internet services used by the government. It also includes communications services for Italy's military in the Mediterranean area and the rollout of satellite services in Italy for use in emergencies such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters, it said. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has forged a close relationship with billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump ally.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry5fuu00lkg	2025-01-05T12:26:34-08:00	
Syrian women journalists are in the field, documenting the truth	Facing arrests, bombings and loss, Syrian women have become vital voices for truth, paving the way for change and demanding a role in Syria’s future [Idlib] Since the beginning of popular protests against the deposed Syrian regime in 2011 and the development of the conflict into armed strife, women in Syria have played a significant role in conveying the realities of events to Arab and even global communities. Syrian female journalists were present in the field under highly complex security conditions in a society unaccustomed to seeing Syrian women as field reporters. They became guardians of truth, away from bias or misinformation. Activist journalist Sanaa Al-Ali said she can barely recall how it started, due to the overwhelming events she has covered over the years of conflict, which she says culminated in the fall of the regime and President-dictator Bashar Assad’s escape from Syria to Russia. 'I found myself as an activist journalist tasked with conveying the image, voice and pain,' Al-Ali stated, recounting her displacement journey in 2012, which continued until the fall of Assad. Al-Ali recalls how she was displaced from her home in Aleppo city in early 2012, fearing the security grip and arrest, moving to live in rural Idlib. 'There, in Idlib, I had neither a house, furniture, nor a source of livelihood with my three children. It was necessary to take a clear stand as the regime declared its war on us in every way – from intimidation to detention, to sporadic bombings and deploying its army across towns and cities,' she says. Amid the targeting of civilians by Russian and Syrian regime aircraft, Al-Ali decided to become an activist, using her Facebook account to report on massacres. As she describes, this was the beginning of making her a journalist who would convey the people's voice. With the escalation of events in Syria and the growing need to support and empower journalists, journalism training courses spread rapidly in Syria. Syrian female journalists were notably among those who attended. Alongside her news reporting, Al-Ali began taking a course in first aid. Working in the medical field exposes practitioners to numerous injuries, so she started reporting some incidents through the media. She wrote about a child killed by a Syrian regime airstrike in Idlib. This story earned her first place in a journalism competition. Today, despite their difficulties, Al-Ali reflects on the years that have passed. 'My ambitions never stopped. Curiosity led me to train in photography and report preparation, and I was selected among many to become a correspondent for the Syrian agency SY+ from 2019 until now,' she explains. Given the sacrifices they have made in media and other fields, Al-Ali hopes that female journalists in Syria will secure an important role in the country's future. Working as a journalist in Syria was not easy for women, especially amid the complexities of the Syrian situation. After Aleppo fell to the Syrian regime in 2016 and hundreds of thousands were displaced to Idlib, that phase remains unforgettable for Syrians and the world, given the harsh displacement scenes broadcast by media outlets. Under challenging circumstances, Salwa Abdul Rahman faced a significant responsibility to be both a mother and father to her three children after her husband’s death. 'At the beginning of the revolution, my media participation was limited due to the dangerous security situation in Aleppo. However, after being displaced from Aleppo, I started working more extensively,' she said. 'I used to see checkpoints and restrictions. The regime treated us poorly; there were tanks in the cities. My role was limited to reporting facts and documenting events in Aleppo,' Rahman said, recalling her life before Aleppo fell and her husband died in early 2015. This left her solely responsible for three children amid war and displacement. She expanded her journalism work, writing and transmitting reports and news stories to the world. Rahman worked as a correspondent for a television channel, continuing to write and striving to enhance her skills in producing media reports. She studied journalism ethics and emphasized that 'working on the ground provides broader and greater experiences.' Regarding the difficulties she faced, she said: 'Women’s work in field journalism in Syria is inherently challenging due to the complexities of the Syrian scene, including bombing, arrest, kidnapping and numerous restrictions. However, I, like many Syrian women, challenged these circumstances and persisted in writing and working until this regime fell.' However, the current phase is even more challenging, according to Rahman, who believes that access to information has become more difficult during this period due to some journalists monopolizing news due to their proximity to the current government. This undermines journalism and warns of an unfortunate monopoly on information. Similarly, Rana Totenji (not her real name) was displaced from Aleppo after years of journalistic work documenting events through sound and image. She began a new journey in Idlib and Afrin. 'My beginnings were in 2013 when I covered news in newspapers. In 2015-2016, after being displaced from Aleppo, I became a field reporter for the Syrian channel Al-Jisr, which I have continued to do until now. I have also worked with Radio and TV Al-Kul and the Hibr newspaper,' she said. Totenji did not limit herself to journalism. She published two literary novels about Syria, discussing the revolution, camps, displacement, shelling and Damascus. She also runs a media institution that produces journalistic reports and organizes training courses in photography and television presentation. The path has not been paved with roses for Syrian female journalists. They faced arrest, persecution and death at the hands of the ousted Syrian regime and other warring parties in Syria. The Syrian Center for Press Freedoms at the Syrian Journalists Association documented 47 violations against female journalists (both Syrian and foreign) in Syria from 2011 to the end of 2024. Mohammed Al-Sattouf, director of the Documentation and Monitoring Unit at the Press Freedoms Center, stated that seven female journalists, including two foreign journalists, were killed in Syria, and 10 were injured, among them two foreign journalists. Al-Sattouf said that 'the majority of violations against female journalists were of the nature of arrest, detention and kidnapping.' The center documented 18 such cases over various years, with the highest number occurring in 2016 when four arrests were made. Four of these cases involved the arrest and detention of foreign female journalists in Syria. All 18 cases ended with the journalists’ release, except for journalist Samar Al-Saleh, whose fate remains unknown. Other violations included bans on work, security persecutions, threats and more. According to the Syrian Center for Press Freedoms reports, the ousted Syrian regime was responsible for 13 of the documented violations against female journalists. The Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its affiliated security and military apparatus were responsible for 13 as well. The Syrian opposition (now in power) committed six violations, while the perpetrators of five violations remain unknown (unknown individuals or entities). Additionally, Turkish authorities were responsible for three violations, as was ISIS, while Hayat Tahrir al-Sham committed two violations against female journalists. Reviewing Syrian female journalists' activities from 2011 until the fall of the Syrian regime, it is evident that they began to work strongly alongside Syrian youth and activists in media, politics and relief efforts. However, the emergence of ISIS in 2013, coupled with its execution of journalists, led to a noticeable decline in journalistic activity (according to the Syrian Journalists Association). This trend reversed in 2017 and peaked with the fall of the regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Syrian Journalists Association, established in exile in 2012, said in a statement that: 'Since the start of the Syrian revolution, female journalists have faced multiple risks, including death, arrest, fleeing from place to place to avoid detention and abuse. The most challenging aspect of their work was documenting violations against civilians, moving between neighborhoods through security and military checkpoints, and navigating streets occupied by snipers. Journalistic work within regime-held areas was fraught with difficulty until some areas in Daraa were liberated, after which the danger of airstrikes intensified. Many female journalists worked under pseudonyms to protect their families in regime-controlled areas.' Today, many Syrian female journalists demand a prominent role in shaping Syria's future. After years of work resembling professional journalism, they highlight women's sacrifices at the expense of their homes and families. As Rana and her colleagues expressed, they believe the homeland belongs to everyone and that everyone must contribute to rebuilding it. -This article is written by Rizik Alabi and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hk11gqpd81l	2025-01-05T12:08:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/HkosmduLJe/HkosmduLJe_531_332_708_399_0_small.jpg
Hamas says sent list with names of 34 hostages, Israel denies cla...	Terror group official says hostage deal is conditioned on complete halt in fighting and Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip A Hamas official on Sunday commented on the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal with Israel, telling Reuters that the terrorist organization 'approved a list of 34 hostages presented by Israel to be exchanged in a possible cease-fire deal.' According to the official, Hamas has stipulated that any agreement depends on a cease-fire and a withdrawal from Gaza, and a permanent halt to fighting, though the terror group sees no progress on these issues from Israel at this stage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that no list has been received by Israel yet, though the Hamas official clarified that the list was merely 'approved.' According to reports, Israel insists on the release of at least 24 live hostages and has therefore requested that Hamas also release injured male hostages under 50 years old on humanitarian grounds. Reports also suggest not all individuals listed as hostages are necessarily alive. Meanwhile, Mossad chief David Barnea may travel to Doha, Qatar, on Monday for the ongoing talks. Most of the terms have reportedly been agreed upon, except for the number of hostages to be released in the deal's initial phase. Not all individuals listed as hostages are necessarily alive Hamas now claims to have finalized a list of those hostages. The sensitive and significant matter remains under heavy secrecy by both Israel and Hamas, leaving the agreement's viability uncertain. Barnea's trip to Doha isn’t confirmed at this time, as he has only traveled to Qatar previously during high-level summits which included CIA Director William Burns and Egyptian intelligence head Hassan Mahmoud Rashad. It's unclear if such a summit is currently planned. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden’s Middle East envoy Brett McGurk is in Doha, signaling heavy American pressure to finalize a deal. However, Washington remains skeptical, despite Biden directing his team to do everything possible to secure an agreement, given his desire to conclude his term with a deal — even a limited one. Israeli officials expressed cautious optimism on the talks, suggesting a deal could be reached this week but stressed the importance of not raising the hostages’ families' hopes prematurely. Sources close to a senior Hamas leader expressed surprise that the terror group’s leadership has adhered to mediator requests and refrained from leaking details about the negotiations to the media. However, these sources told Ynet that 'the direction of the talks remains unclear and we’re still at a critical juncture. The coming days will reveal more.' They added that senior Hamas officials remain cautiously optimistic. Sources told Egyptian TV channel Al-Rad on Sunday that 'disputes remain over the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released, though partial Israeli redeployment to northern Gaza has been agreed upon.' They also reported an understanding regarding partial Israeli presence along the eastern Philadelphi Corridor near the Kerem Shalom border crossing. A meeting between mediators and the Israeli delegation in Doha reportedly lasted only an hour. Separately, an Egyptian source denied Israeli media reports claiming Egypt was preparing for military intervention in Yemen, calling it 'baseless misinformation.' Palestinian officials told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that there’s 'no discussion of a partial deal or the exile of Hamas leaders from Gaza. Talks are focused on a comprehensive agreement.' They added that the Israeli delegation must 'resolve matters with their political leadership,' noting that Netanyahu held a security meeting on Sunday, though his office denied that the discussion focused on the hostage issue. Earlier, Saudi newspaper Al-Hadath reported positive momentum toward an agreement between Israel and Hamas. The deal would reportedly unfold in phases over two to three months, with Arab and Western countries managing Gaza alongside Palestinian groups. According to the sources, the Palestinian Authority would govern Gaza in coordination with Arab and foreign countries, ensuring immunity for Hamas leaders while Israel refrains from targeting them. The agreement would include Hamas leaders' deportation from Gaza, with governance handed to an independent Palestinian body and possibly international Scandinavian forces stationed in Gaza. The U.S. would sponsor the deal between Hamas and Israel. A Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that 'today is a decisive day for the fate of the negotiations between Hamas and Israel. The mediators managed to bridge gaps with compromise solutions and are awaiting the Israeli government’s response.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The main issue in the negotiations remains how many live hostages will be released. Israel reportedly aimed to secure the release of at least 24 hostages in the first phase of the deal, insisting that Hamas include injured male hostages under 50 as part of a humanitarian exchange phase. Hamas, however, opposes this demand, claiming it wasn’t part of the initial agreements and is requesting either the release of more high-profile terrorists or a greater number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for younger hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syeacluikg	2025-01-05T11:46:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/23/SJWMZsVDT/SJWMZsVDT_0_31_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
My rabbis support me': 50 Haredi men enlist to new IDF unit	Military opens new Hahashmonaim Brigade designed to be suited to ultra-Orthodox lifestyle and religious standards; Some were accompanied by family members, while others arrived alone. About 50 young ultra-Orthodox men arrived at IDF recruitment offices across the country on Sunday and enlisted in the new Hahashmonaim Brigade. The IDF marked the first recruitment day for the infantry brigade, designed specifically to accommodate the ultra-Orthodox community's religious standards. Some of the recruits, who are slated for combat roles, were accompanied by family members, while others arrived alone. According to the IDF, some 100 ultra-Orthodox men were set to complete their induction by the end of the day and begun a six-month infantry training program. Upon completion, they will form the brigade's first reserve company. Additional recruitment drives will be held later this month and new recruits will join the basic training phase. 'I always thought about enlisting, but until two months ago, I was planning to get an exemption,' Yaakov, 22, shared. 'When I was offered the Hahashmonaim, I was thrilled.' Uriel Cohen from Bnei Brak, who had been studying at a yeshiva in Afula, was one of the recruits who joined despite family opposition. 'Two or three years ago, I was in yeshiva,' he said. 'Enlisting wasn’t even something on my mind. But about six months ago, I decided, ‘Alright, I’m doing this.’' Addressing rabbinic opposition to enlistment, he added: 'Not all rabbis oppose it. My rabbis support me.' Eliyahu Brodner from Beit Shemesh explained his motivation to join. 'After October 7, I wanted to enlist. I saw young men my age falling in the war. I didn’t feel comfortable sitting in yeshiva. I’m not exactly studying all day. I didn’t feel right about it — they’re sacrificing their lives to protect me. 'But even then, I didn’t have an option until this unit was established. It’s a new place and my rabbis told me privately, ‘Go there.’ If an individual is fully committed to his yeshiva studies, he should stay there. But for someone like me, who isn’t, he should enlist.' Another recruit, a 26-year-old father of three selected for a staff role rather than combat, explained his decision to join after realizing he couldn’t continue yeshiva studies in the coming years. The young man, who studies in a kollel and teaches at a Talmud Torah, said: 'I teach my students to do what’s needed for the people of Israel – either study Torah or contribute to the nation. Right now, what’s needed is to enlist and it’s important to set an example. I decided to start working after 10 years in a yeshiva but to do that, I need to follow the path everyone else takes.' Yossi Hertz, a 32-year-old ultra-Orthodox man from the U.S. and one of the oldest recruits in the unit, had decided to enlist five years ago but was initially turned away due to his age. 'There’s an obligation to serve and I want to do my part and fulfill my responsibility. I tell every ultra-Orthodox man: if you’re sitting in the study hall all day — that’s fine. But if you’re not learning, do something with your life,' he said.

Hezbollah leader Nasrallah killed last year inside war operations...	Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year while inside the terror group's war operations room, according to new details Sunday disclosed by a senior Hezbollah official. A series of Israeli airstrikes flattened several buildings in Beirut's southern suburbs on Sept. 27, 2024, killing Nasrallah. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people died. According to news reports, Nasrallah and other senior officials were meeting underground. The assassination of Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for 32 years, turned months of low-level strikes between Israel and Hezbollah into all-out war that battered much of southern and eastern Lebanon for two months until a U.S.-brokered cease-fire took effect Nov. 27. 'His Eminence (Hassan Nasrallah) used to lead the battle and war from this location,' top Hezbollah security official Wafiq Safa told a news conference Sunday near near the site where Nasrallah was killed. He said Nasrallah died in the war operations room. He did not offer other details. Lebanese media had reported that Safa was a target of Israeli airstrikes in central Beirut before the cease-fire but appeared unscathed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk4od8o8je	2025-01-05T10:12:34-08:00

The FBI is looking into past visits to Egypt and Canada by the suspect in the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people after a truck was rammed into a crowd of revelers, an FBI official told reporters on Sunday. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran, 42, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State extremist group, was the suspect in the attack and the FBI says he acted alone. He was killed in a shootout with police after the rampage, which also injured dozens of people and has been labeled by the FBI as an act of terrorism. 'We have also tracked that Jabbar traveled to Cairo, Egypt, from June 22 until July 3 of 2023. A few days later he flew to Ontario, Canada, on July 10 and returned to the U.S. on July 13 of 2023,' Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office, said at a press briefing. 'Our agents are getting answers as to where he went, who he met with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions in our city in New Orleans,' he added. The FBI also said Jabbar made at least two trips to New Orleans in the months prior to the attack, one in October and the other in November.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1c6i8o8jx	2025-01-05T10:06:06-08:00

Some 40% of Hamas tunnels’ still remain in Gaza, expert says	Israel intensifies its war on Hamas in Gaza, targeting terrorist while negotiating a cease-fire and hostage release deal; With heavy losses on both sides, the conflict remains unresolved, and Gaza's future remains uncertain Israel continued to pound Gaza over the weekend, as Palestinians reported tens of people killed in the ongoing war between the Hamas terrorist organization and the Jewish state. The Israel Defense Forces announced it had carried out airstrikes against over 100 targets, including Hamas terrorists and rocket launching sites. For over a year, Israel has staged a massive military operation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Its stated goals are to remove Hamas as a governing power in the territory and release all the hostages. In what appears to be an intensification of the fighting and amid the war, Hamas and Israel are engaged in indirect talks aimed at reaching a cease-fire and releasing at least some of the 100 Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas since the beginning of the war. Thousands of Israelis rallied on Saturday evening to protest the government and pressure it to reach a deal with Hamas. Several weeks ago, there was initial optimism that a deal was imminent. Now, the talks mediated by the US, Egypt, and Qatar seem to be at yet another impasse. Israel’s continued military presence in the Gaza Strip and the refusal by the current government to withdraw from the territory, a pre-condition by Hamas for any deal, has so far blocked a cease-fire from being reached. The army is not only present in Gaza, but it also continues to fight at varying levels of intensity. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued evacuation warnings for areas in the center of the Gaza Strip ahead of an operation there. The IDF also continued to operate in the north of the territory. 'The area consists of structures overlooking Israeli territory and serves as a central terror hub containing anti-tank firing positions, booby traps, shafts, numerous explosives, and launch sites for targeting Israeli territory,' the IDF said in a statement. In addition, the army continues to control the Philadephi and Netzarim corridors in southern and central Gaza, respectively, aimed at blocking Hamas from being able to re-arm and re-position itself. Adopting a policy of incursions rather than operating in the whole of Gaza continuously, the IDF has found itself often re-entering areas it has already operated in several times. This policy of 'mowing the grass,' coined by Professor Efraim Inbar and Dr. Eitan Shamir, has entangled Israel in its longest war ever. It refers to a strategy of pinpointed military operations limited in time to quell a temporary threat, barring a more permanent political solution. But, according to Shamir, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University, Hamas’ military abilities cannot be defeated as quickly as critics of the IDF strategy would like to believe. 'Hamas had over 20 years to accumulate a massive amount of firepower, dispersing it in many areas, including in its widespread underground tunnel network,' Shamir said. 'Combined with other terrorist organizations, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), it had approximately 30,000 fighters. This could take two to three years to get rid of.' Israeli forces are continuing to find weapons depots and to encounter Hamas terrorists and tunnels, in a testament to the continued Hamas presence in the territory. 'There is an estimated 40% of the tunnels still remaining, hundreds of kilometers of tunnels the Israeli intelligence was not aware of,' said Yoni Ben Menachem, an expert of Middle Eastern affairs from Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. 'There are still very long tunnels that Israel has yet to have located, some of them with hostages inside. This requires a very big operation and a massive amount of explosives that Israel currently does not possess.' Hamas stunned Israel on October 7, 2023, when it attacked the south of the country in a rampage that killed approximately 1,200 Israelis and wounded thousands more. It also took approximately 250 people hostage, 100 still in captivity. In response, Israel launched a massive war against Hamas. According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, over 45,000 Palestinians have been killed since and over 107,000 wounded. Some 390 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground invasion of Gaza. The war quickly developed into a regional, multi-front confrontation. The Lebanese Hezbollah organization and the Houthi rebels in Yemen began launching attacks against Israel, forcing it to respond and divert critical resources to other fronts. A fragile and temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah has been in place for a month now. Should it last, Israeli troops are expected to withdraw from southern Lebanon at the end of January. 'Israel does not have enough forces at this point to subdue Hamas both militarily and in its ability to govern Gaza,' Ben Menachem said. 'In order to do that, Israel needs to occupy the entire Gaza Strip and announce it is enforcing temporary military administration.' According to Ben Menachem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is waiting for major developments before progressing in that direction. One is the fate of the cease-fire and hostage deal talks, and the other is the upcoming change in the U.S. administration, with President Joe Biden's departure and Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. Netanyahu hopes Trump, who has favored his policies during his previous term, will pose less of an impediment. 'The Israeli government has so far avoided discussing its plans for Gaza after the war because of the opposition from the Biden administration to an Israeli military rule there,' Ben Menachem said. Netanyahu has not ruled out military rule in Gaza, although he has shot down calls from within his coalition to re-settle Gaza with Jewish settlements. In addition to setting Hamas’ removal from power as one of the war goals, the Israeli premier has also voiced opposition to the return of the Palestinian Authority to rule Gaza, deeming it a supporter of terrorism. 'The alternative to incursions is military rule, which will enable complete control of Gaza,' said Shamir. 'It will prevent, not completely, Hamas’ ability to rise up. But it will require a lot of resources because it is essentially occupying Gaza.' Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, ending 38 years of complete control of the territory. 'It will take a long time, but Israel’s presence in Gaza now, including its blockade on Gaza through the control of all of its entrances, is not the perfect option,' Shamir added. 'But it does meet the needs. There is not much different that Israel can do, and it will take time.' The Israeli leader is also facing calls to change the policy regarding the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza. The aid, facilitated mainly by Israel through its control of all of Gaza’s entry points, has been an issue of contention within Israel since the beginning of the war in October of last year. It has also been subject to international scrutiny and critique. Some members of the government want to see the IDF distributing the aid as a means to weaken Hamas' hold on Gaza. Right now, Israel oversees the entrance of the aid but has humanitarian organizations responsible for its dispersal, a process often hampered by Hamas’ ability to take over the aid and control its distribution. Israeli media has reported that the IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, plans to resign in the coming weeks. Halevi, who is seen by many in the Israeli public as partially responsible for the blunder that enabled Hamas’ surprise attack, is reportedly awaiting the conclusion of internal military inquiries into events that led up to the war. Halevi is believed to have been contrarian to the Netanyahu government on many issues, including humanitarian aid and the conduct of the war effort in Gaza. 'There are places in Gaza, especially in the center, which the army has not entered yet,' said Ben Menachem. 'The war in Gaza has been handled haphazardly, with a lack of strategy. Mowing the grass is not efficient and can only be done once Hamas has been won over in order to prevent it from re-grouping and not when it still has a standing army of 20,000 armed terrorists.' The presence of Israeli hostages is also believed to be one of the reasons behind decision-making in the war. 'The presence of hostages does not pose a major limitation on how the war is waged,' said Shamir. 'The IDF effort is limited by international law and the deep embedment of Hamas terrorists in the civilian population in Gaza.'

However, after 15 months of war, the terrorist organization has shown no flexibility in its demand from Israel to completely withdraw from Gaza and stop all military action against it. This is despite the massive price Palestinians have paid and the widespread damage in the Gaza Strip, which has rendered many areas unrecognizable. 'The hostages remain Hamas’ only leverage,' said Shamir.

Troops from the Givati Brigade, operating under the command of the 162nd Division, eliminated terrorist Sa’ed Saeed Zaki Dahnoun Last week in close-quarters combat, the IDF spokesman announced on Sunday. He was a company commander and deputy head of the Rocket Array in the northern Gaza Strip for the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization, according to the IDF. Sa'ed infiltrated Israeli territory and participated in the brutal massacre on October 7. Additionally, he planned and led several ambushes against IDF troops in the Beit Lahia area, the spokesman said. In footage from the operation, documented by IDF troops, two terrorists, including Sa'ed, are seen covered in blankets as they advance toward IDF forces under the cover of rain and darkness. In a swift target engagement, the troops eliminated Sa'ed. Following his elimination, the other terrorist advancing alongside him surrendered to the soldiers who had encircled him. The terrorist was apprehended by the soldiers and brought into Israel for further investigation. During his apprehension, an improvised explosive device carried by the terrorists was located.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy8dnv00ije	2025-01-05T08:11:12-08:00	
I couldn't stop crying': Ex-hostage Dafna Elyakim recalls captiv...	After being released alongside her sister in the first hostage deal, Dafna Elyakim says seeing sign of life from IDF lookout over the weekend was a relief for her and stresses need to return all hostages home Dafna Elyakim, 16, who was released from Hamas captivity in the first hostage deal in November 2023 along with her sister Ela, recounted the days she spent in captivity with abducted IDF lookout Liri Albag at an event held on Sunday. Hamas released a video on Saturday showing a sign of life from Albag, who was abducted on October 7, 2023. 'Liri would smile, laugh and try to find the positive,' Dafna shared. 'She said that if we survived what happened on October 7, there's no way they'd kill us after a month. We'd sing songs, talk about restaurants and family — anything to pass the time while we were there.' 'When I saw proof of life and her name while I was on the bus, I couldn't stop crying. It was a relief — she's alive, she's okay — but at the same time, I thought about what she must be going through and what they were doing to her there,' she shared. 'I want to tell her that she's strong, to keep being strong and that she'll come home soon. We'll get her out of there soon and everything will be okay in the end,' Dafna said. She also recalled how she endured captivity herself: 'What helped me was having my younger sister with me. It meant there was someone else from my family with me. Even now, I don't feel like I've fully returned. It feels like a dream like I'm still there with the other hostages I was with.' Dafna explained why she chose to speak at the event. 'It was important for me to come and share the story so people would know what happened on October 7 and so it won't be forgotten. We mustn't forget the hostages. We need to keep mentioning them, talking about them and – for those who can – to join protests and shout what the hostages can't. 'It's really moving to see large crowds at protests, where you can't even move when people come to show they care about the hostages. It's uplifting to see that someone still cares. We can also keep praying, hoping and doing everything to bring them all back.' On May 19, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit released a video filmed by Hamas terrorists showing Ela Elyakim, Dafna's eight-year-old sister, speaking to the camera from captivity. 'I, Ela Elyakim, the daughter of Noam, I'm eight years old. I'm asking Bibi [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s nickmane] to free us; I'm a Hamas hostage.'

A guide for IDF soldiers: Here's how to act if arrested abroad an...	Following the escape of an IDF soldier from Brazil and the arrest request for another soldier in Chile, concerns are growing about the legal threats IDF personnel face while traveling overseas; Are officers at greater risk? What should soldiers check before their flight? And how should they respond to questions after landing? Here’s what you need to know The escape from Brazil of an IDF soldier facing a court-ordered investigation and the immediate arrest request for another soldier traveling in Chile are just two examples of cases involving IDF personnel since the start of the war. Arrest warrants for Israeli soldiers have also been issued in European countries. So, what should a soldier do if arrested abroad? Are officers at greater risk? Which countries should soldiers avoid visiting? Here’s what you need to know. What should a soldier do if arrested abroad? Attorney Nick Kaufman, a defense lawyer at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, advises: 'According to Israel's Foreign Ministry guidelines, any detained Israeli – whether a civilian or a soldier – is entitled to consular assistance. A soldier arrested abroad must immediately request a visit from the Israeli consul.' Are officers at greater risk than soldiers? 'Absolutely,' Kaufman says. 'Officers are more closely linked to decision-making and policies, such as target selection and managing military operations.' Does sharing footage online increase legal risk? 'Definitely. Soldiers who post videos online provide hostile organizations with potential evidence to support suspicions against them,' according to Kaufman. Is it dangerous for a soldier who served in Gaza to travel abroad? 'The risk stems from the principle of 'universal jurisdiction,' which allows certain countries to arrest, investigate and prosecute individuals suspected of serious crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Could I be arrested abroad for actions in Gaza? 'Evidence linking an individual soldier to illegal acts would be required. Simply serving in Gaza is not enough.' How can I check if my destination poses a risk before traveling? 'Human rights organizations publish reports online detailing the application of universal jurisdiction in various countries. Consulting an international criminal law expert is strongly recommended.' What precautions should be taken before traveling? 'Soldiers should avoid posting photos or videos from their service, especially content showing destroyed buildings, even if there’s a military justification. Such posts violate operational security and could harm Israel’s image. Some countries might treat seemingly minor content, such as racist songs, as incitement to genocide.' Which countries should soldiers avoid? 'The list of countries applying universal jurisdiction changes over time. Even friendly nations like the UK, France and Spain have applied it in the past. Procedures vary – some countries require a court’s approval for arrests, while others may act based on a simple police complaint.' What should I do if questioned by authorities abroad? 'Carefully consider traveling to countries where officials may raise such questions. Lying at border control is not an option and could lead to denied entry.' Should Israel fund legal defense for soldiers arrested abroad? 'If a soldier is wrongly detained for lawful service, the state should cover their defense costs. However, this becomes problematic when there’s credible suspicion of war crimes. Funding one soldier’s defense could set a precedent requiring similar support for others accused of serious crimes.' Does Israel maintain a 'blacklist' of soldiers at risk of arrest? 'The IDF’s International Law Department provides commanders with legal advice, including on battlefield conduct to prevent future legal issues. To the best of my knowledge, there’s no 'blacklist' of soldiers at risk of arrest.' What about international legal battles against Israel? 'Israel’s response involves legal and diplomatic measures managed by a cross-ministerial team led by the National Security Council and Justice Ministry. The IDF also conducts internal investigations when necessary and emphasizes legal training for active-duty and reserve soldiers.' Will traveling become safer after the fighting ends? 'The threat may not diminish and could even intensify as Gaza opens to human rights groups and foreign journalists.' Can insurance cover arrests abroad? 'I’m not aware of any insurance company that provides coverage for arrests abroad related to alleged criminal acts. If such an option were to exist, premiums would likely be prohibitively expensive.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj311m7ol1l	2025-01-05T07:11:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/SyUVIsv8Jg/SyUVIsv8Jg_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

UNRWA denies reports it will stop operating in Gaza and West Bank	After NYT report that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees plans to end its activities in Gaza and the West Bank, the agency's communications director Juliette Thom says it is 'committed to continuing to provide essential services, calls report of agency's shuttering programs 'grossly inaccurate' UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, strongly denied today Sunday a report that it is preparing to end its activities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, in light of Knesset legislation passed that bans the organization's activities on Israeli soil. The denial comes after the report in the New York Times on Friday, which claimed that the agency 'is preparing to close its activities due to new Israeli restrictions.' The report quoted Louise Wateridge, a senior UNRWA official, as saying that the law would undermine the necessary coordination with Israel to deliver aid to the territories. According to her, 'the lives of our staff will be at risk' if information is not shared with Israeli authorities. Closing the operation 'would be a massive impact on an already catastrophic situation,',' added Jamie McGoldrick, who was in charge of UN aid operations in Gaza and the West Bank until April. ' 'If that is what the Israeli intention is — to remove any ability for us to save lives — you have to question what is the thinking and what is the end goal?' UNRWA supporters claim that the cessation of operations would be a fatal blow to the Palestinian population. 'The world has abandoned us. We have nothing but the aid we get from UNRWA to survive,' Sami Abu Darweesh, 30, who lives in a refugee camp in southern Gaza run by UNRWA, told the newspaper. 'If that stops, what will we do?' Juliette Thom, UNRWA's communications director, rejected the report, describing it as 'grossly inaccurate.' Thom noted that the agency's director-general, Philippe Lazarini, had previously stressed the agency's commitment to continuing to provide essential services. She said, 'If someone has an opinion, that doesn't mean it's right.'

Pressure on UNRWA increased after many Western countries, including the US, Switzerland and Britain, froze or halted funding to the agency, citing 'fear of funds being used for terrorist purposes,' a move that further exacerbated the difficulties for the agency. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byerrz00uje	2025-01-05T06:38:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/29/By1DGQ0g1e/By1DGQ0g1e_0_289_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Palestinians release footage showing Israeli forces disembarking from a vehicle disguised as an ambulance during a raid on a Nablus refugee camp The Palestinians on Sunday released unusual footage showing armed fighters in the Balata refugee camp in Nablus disembarking from a vehicle disguised as an ambulance. According to Palestinian reports, the video was filmed approximately two and a half weeks ago during an IDF raid on the camp. On the day of the operation, Palestinians reported the deaths of two individuals, including an 80-year-old woman. The IDF also reportedly employed a 'pressure cooker' tactic against the terrorists.

Ten years since the Charlie Hebdo massacre: Cartoons, the far-lef...	A decade has passed since four million French people took to the streets and shouted 'Je suis Charlie' after the horrific attack on the magazine by Islamists after it published a cartoon of Mohammed France will on Tuesday mark the tenth anniversary of the attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on January 7, 2015, which claimed the lives of 12 people, including the editor at the time, Stéphane Charbonnier, and wounded 11. That morning, Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into the office armed with guns and murdered those present, shouting as they left, 'We killed Charlie Hebdo. ' However, they did not kill the satirical periodical, which has been around for 55 years. As the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Gerard Bier, who survived the attack because he was in London that day, said this week, 'They didn't succeed, we want it to live for another thousand years.' On Sunday, as part of the tenth anniversary events, which led to the murder of a policewoman on the outskirts of Paris and the attack on the Kosher supermarket in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, the newspaper kicked off a competition for the most daring cartoons against God. The #Laughing at God competition received 350 cartoons from all over the world, of which 39 of the most successful illustrations were published. The cartoons, it should be noted, mock all religions. Among other things, the special issue includes an article dedicated to threats to secularism in Israel. And yet, times have changed since four million took to the streets after the massacre to shout 'JeSuisCharlie.' The Charlie Hebdo editorial office is now located in an undisclosed location, and its main writers still live under 24-hour guard. Just last weekend, the memorial plaque for the policeman murdered in the Charlie Hebdo attack was vandalized, with the graffiti 'Je suis Gaza' sprayed on it. The current editor, Laurent Sourisseau, known as Riss, accused the left of turning a blind eye to Islamic violence in a book published last month in memory of the victims of the attack: 'Politicians, journalists and intellectuals from the left continue to turn a blind eye to the threat of radical Islam in order to gain the support of Muslim communities, and in this way also fuel anti-Semitism.' Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister at the time of the attack, told the weekly Le Nouvel Obs magazine this week that 'part of the radical left cynically thinks that Muslims are 'potential clients' for election campaigns.' The special issue published this week features a survey showing that 76% of French people support freedom of expression through cartoons. Culture Minister Rachida Dati also announced this week the opening of the Museum of Journalistic Illustration in 2027, a project that has been in the works for many years.

Our struggle is for us to be free.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skl4ck008jg	2025-01-05T03:25:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2015/01/07/5802306/5802306_235_122_478_270_0_small.jpg

U.S. Special Mid-East envoy Brett McGurk also in Doha; Netanyahu summons ministerial consultation although claims it is not about hostages Mossad chief David Barnea is expected to travel to Doha on Monday for talks on a possible hostage release deal. American special envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk is already in the Qatari capital, indicating the importance that the Biden administration attaches to the meetings and the efforts to reach a deal before Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. 'This is a critical day for the negotiations between Israel and Hamas,' a Palestinian source told the Qatari Al Araby Al Jadeed newspaper on Sunday adding that the mediators were able to bridge the gap between the sides and await the response of the Israeli government later on Sunday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled a security consultation for the afternoon on Sunday, a day after the Hamas released a video of IDF solder Liri Elbag who has been held hostage for 457 days, since the October 7 massacre. Netanyahu invited the members of the small forum of the cabinet for the meeting that was announced by the Prime Minister's Office earlier with a claim that it was not in regard to the hostages. The issues that were outstanding and prevented an agreement from being reached remain the number of hostages that would be released. The Israeli aim, according to published reports, was to have at least 24 hostages freed in the first phase of the deal including wounded men under the age of 50. Hamas insists that demand was not included in the 'agreements' thus far and demand a larger number of convicted murderers to be included in the Palestinian prisoners that Israel would release from prison, in exchange.

Chilean lawyers demand the arrest of Israeli soldier hiding in Pa...	Members of the AbogadosxPalestina lawyer group call for 'the immediate arrest' of Israeli ex-soldier Saar Hirshoren, who is accused of committing war crimes in Gaza A pro-Palestinian group called AbogadosxPalestina, consisting of 620 Chilean lawyers demanded the arrest of a discharged Israeli IDF soldier Saar Hirshoren who is currently traveling in Chile for his involvement in 'crimes against humanity' and 'genocide' in the Gaza war. Earlier, a federal court in Brazil ordered an investigation into a visiting Israeli, who served in the IDF, for possible war crimes after the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) provided the court with documentation of the soldier's activity in the war in Gaza. The suspect was a survivor of the Nova music festival massacre on Oct. 7. According to reports he was able to leave Brazil before any legal action was taken against him. 'We have filed this complaint so that an investigation is carried out and as a preventive measure, the immediate arrest of this Israeli soldier is carried out so that he can be held accountable for the crimes committed and take responsibility before international criminal justice,' said lawyer and former Chilean ambassador Nelson Hadad at a press conference on Friday, who explained that the arrest must take place 'before the imminent escape attempt.' Hadad added that the 'issue is extremely urgent. We have to assume our responsibility and we cannot accept that after having massacred hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, mostly children and women, they can be allowed to come to Chilean Patagonia for vacation.' The former Chilean ambassador is one of the 620 lawyers who last year denounced the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The lawyers accuse Hirshoren of 'deliberately demolishing neighborhoods, cultural sites and essential facilities in Gaza with inhuman, cruel, degrading and abominable acts, causing ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of people,' said the senator of the conservative party Renovación Nacional, Francisco Chahuán, who leads the lawyers who filed the complaint along with Hadad. The complaint was supported by the testimony of a Palestinian woman living in Chile whose family was a allegedly a victim of the operations of the Israeli Army commando to which Hirshoren is said to belong, seeks, in the words of Hadad, 'to make international criminal justice prevail, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator.' 'The principle of extraterritoriality based on Law 20357 (which classifies crimes against humanity and genocide and war crimes and offences), together with our ratification of the Rome Statute gives jurisdiction to Chilean courts to prosecute this type of crimes,' said Chahuán. According to the member of AbogadosxPalestina, Paula Abugattas, 'the importance of this complaint is that it can kick start additional legislation in other countries where there are soldiers who have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.' The complaint filed with the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office is added to the one filed by the Belgium-based Hind Rajab Foundation, which on December 26 requested the arrest of Saar Hirshoren after being located in Argentina and, later, in Chile. The exact whereabouts of the soldier are currently unknown. The lawyers have announced that, in addition to having filed this complaint with the Chilean Prosecutor's Office, they are going to file a 'criminal action' before the International Criminal Court for the same crimes. 'We advocate for a state solution where Israel and Palestine can live side by side with full respect for international law and international humanitarian law, with secure and internationally recognized borders,' said Chahuán regarding the position regarding this historic conflict of the lawyers and of Chile, a country that hosts the largest community of Palestinians outside the Arab world.

Chairperson of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yuli Edelstein (Likud) said he would hold an urgent classified meeting to discuss the 'defense from legal persecution of soldiers abroad,' on Monday. 'For months members of the committee and I have warned, time and again, that the judicial persecution under false accusations of war crime would not stop at the prime minister and defense minister and would spread to include IDF troops,' Edelstein said. 'I am embarrassed for Brazil and its government which succumbed to the pro-Palestine legal terrorism,' he said. 'I expect to hear from representatives of the IDF and the Foreign Ministry, about their plans of action to defend our soldiers from sanctions and such criminal persecution.' Last November, the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then defense minister Yoav Gallant on suspicion of war crimes committed in the fighting in Gaza. The Brazilian federal court ordered an investigation into the Israeli after a claim was made by the Palestinian Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) which provided the court with documentation of the soldier's activity in the war in Gaza. The suspect was a survivor of the Nova music festival massacre on Oct. 7. According to the claim, the soldier, who was on a trip in Patagonia, was documented placing explosives that were used to demolish buildings where displaced Gazan's were sheltering.

Lapid asked how the Palestinians were able to work better than the government in the international arena and said a better public advocacy would have prevented such cases. Lapid also slammed Foreign Minisiter Gideon Saar who did not comment on the risk to the IDF soldier while on his visit to Brazil but chose to defend the government after the opposition leader blamed its failings for the trouble Israelis who had served in the war may now face. Saar called Lapid irresponsible for blaming world antisemitism on the government. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkiwj6wujg	2025-01-05T00:18:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/SJBr4rrIJx/SJBr4rrIJx_1_157_1601_901_0_small.jpg

The top diplomat of the outgoing US admin dismisses the 'genocide' claim while criticizing the Israeli government for not always 'doing enough' to facilitate the flow of aid into Gaza Anthony Blinken, the outgoing U.S. Secretary of State, revealed in an interview published on Saturday that he was set to travel to Saudi Arabia to hash out 'the Palestinian component' of a normalization agreement between Riyadh and Jerusalem before the horrible Hamas massacre that disrupted all Middle Eastern diplomacy. 'On October 6 we were very much pursuing normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel,' the top diplomat of the Biden administration told the New York Times. 'And in fact, I was scheduled to go to Saudi Arabia and Israel on October 10. Obviously, that didn’t happen.' 'The purpose of that trip was to work on the Palestinian component of any normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, because we believed and the Saudis also said it was hugely important to make sure that if there was going to be normalization, there was also a pathway toward a Palestinian state.' Further in the interview, Blinken dismisses claims that Israel is perpetrating a 'genocide' in Gaza, while criticizing the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for, on some occasions, not 'doing enough' to facilitate the flow of aid into the war-ravaged Palestinian enclave.

Brazil probes Israeli tourist for alleged war crimes	Brazilian federal court orders an investigation after Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) issues complaint including video, photographs showing IDF soldier during Gaza war A federal court in Brazil ordered an investigation into a visiting Israeli, who served in the IDF, for possible war crimes after the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) provided the court with documentation of the soldier's activity in the war in Gaza. The foundation that was named for a six-year-old Palestinian girl that was claimed to have been killed by IDF fire during the war, said that the Brazilian government decided to take action after a complaint was filed against the Israeli who arrived in Brazil a week ago. In their complaint the foundation said his actions were part of a broader effort that included genocide and crimes against humanity, according to international law. The foundation provided video clips, geographic locations and photos allegedly showing the Israeli placing explosives and participating in the destruction of 'entire neighborhoods' in Gaza that were claimed to have been housing displaced Gazans, last November. 'These materials prove beyond doubt the direct involvement of the suspect in these despicable acts,' HRF said. According to a report in the Metropoles online newspaper, a Brazilian lawyer explained that the investigation in Brazil was initiated because the country is a signatory of the Rome Statue. 'Any country that has signed the statue is compelled to ensure that crimes such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide must be investigated and their perpetrators must be brought to justice,' she said. It called on Brazil to immediately detain the suspect before he flees the country and 'destroys evidence,' adding that the families whose homes were destroyed have joined the complaint. The IDF last month, warned Israelis who had served in the fighting in Gaza that they could be subjected to criminal proceedings abroad and urged them to remove any social media posts they may have had, showing them during the war.

The interception triggered an alarm in Talmei Elazar in northern Israel, and residents across central Israel reported hearing explosions, including in Jerusalem, Tel Mond, Rishon Lezion, Kfar Saba, Ganei Tikva, Petah Tikva, Hod Hasharon, Kokhav Yair, Lod, Tayibe and the West Bank settlement of Sal’it.

Tragic irony': Two Israelis injured in New Orleans attack fought...	The two reservists decided to travel to the U.S. together following a year of war and were injured when the terrorist rammed them with his car; one's condition remains critical The two Israelis in their 20s who were seriously and moderately injured in the ramming and shooting attack in New Orleans this week had previously served together in reserve duty during the war, taking part in battles in both Gaza and Lebanon. Recently, they left on a six-week trip to the U.S. to recover from the past year's events. It appears they were injured by the vehicular ramming rather than the gunfire by the terrorist. They’re currently hospitalized in New Orleans and will only be flown back to Israel once their conditions stabilize. The two have known each other since their compulsory military service and had planned to conclude their U.S. trip with a visit to a relative of one of them in Florida. The Foreign Ministry aided their families to fly to Louisiana. One of them remains in critical condition due to head trauma and limb injuries, undergoing two life-saving surgeries so far. He's still in a life-threatening condition. His friend’s condition is more stable, though he sustained severe limb injuries and internal trauma. He's no longer in danger but has undergone two major surgeries as well. On Friday, his breathing tubes were removed and he was able to communicate with his family for the first time, recounting what he remembered of the attack. Israel's Deputy Consul General to the U.S. Elad Shoshan, told the New York Post: ' That’s the tragic irony. They left the terror of one country and never expected to be victims of it in another. They came here to relax, to travel. Now that’s interrupted in the most horrific way.' Shoshan mentioned that he managed to briefly communicate with the critically injured Israeli before his first surgery: 'He pressed my hand. He’s in severe pain all over his body. When people chant, ‘Globalize the intifada,’ it means importing violence from one region to another. 'And that’s exactly what’s happening. They want to bring violence and terror to America. Israel and the U.S. are fighting the same ideology, the same enemy, as on October 7. Hamas acted like ISIS, that was its inspiration—just like this terrorist.' The New Year’s Eve attack in New Orleans, which left 12 people dead and 35 injured, was carried out by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texas resident and former U.S. Army serviceman. The FBI confirmed reports that an ISIS flag was found in his car and is investigating his ties to the terror organization. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The attack took place around 3:15 a.m. local time on Bourbon Street in the heart of the city’s French Quarter, a well-known entertainment district. Jabbar was armed with an assault rifle and fired at his victims during the ramming. At one point, he exited his vehicle and engaged in a shootout with police officers, injuring two of them before being neutralized. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syszumwlje	2025-01-04T12:40:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/HydujRz8Je/HydujRz8Je_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
U.S. pessimistic on ongoing hostage deal talks in Qatar	Officials stress talks are still ongoing despite sounding skepticism amid widening gaps and release of video showing hostage Liri Albag in captivity U.S. officials briefed on the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas in Qatar, where the Israeli delegation arrived on Friday, expressed skepticism about progress on Saturday, saying, 'It'll be difficult to reach a deal by January 20,' the date of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Despite the pessimism and following Hamas’ release of a video showing IDF lookout Liri Albag who’s been held captive in Gaza since October 7, the officials clarified: 'Efforts are still ongoing. According to the Americans, reports from Doha indicate skepticism and significant gaps that hinder progress before the set deadline. Trump issued a warning to Hamas last month notifying the terror group of serious consequences should the hostages not be released. The reported skepticism is unusual, as the Americans have typically projected optimism during the negotiations. However, all involved on the U.S. side appear doubtful at this time. Still, one U.S. official suggested that the skepticism could be a positive sign, noting that negotiations often fail when optimism is high. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden’s envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk is expected to join the talks in Doha, likely to make a final push to secure a deal before Trump’s inauguration. In response to the U.S. skepticism, senior Israeli officials said, 'There’s still a chance for a deal,' though no guarantees exist. An Israeli source noted, 'Progress has been made but it’ll take more time. The outcome of the negotiations is unpredictable.' Additionally, Israel views Hamas’ release of Liri’s video at this time as an attempt at psychological warfare and public opinion manipulation aimed at extracting further concessions from Israel. The Israeli delegation, composed of Mossad, Shin Bet and IDF Military Intelligence officials, arrived in Doha on Friday morning. However, their mandate to conduct the talks was granted only in the afternoon, following a phone consultation between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team. Netanyahu 'approved the continuation of the negotiations,' giving the delegation a mandate to advance. Nonetheless, gaps remain, despite Israel describing the process as 'slow progress.' The disparities between the parties center on several issues, the most pressing being the number of hostages to be released in the deal. Hamas is willing to release a very limited number of live hostages and refuses to provide a list of names upfront, which Israel insists on as a basis for progress. Currently, the gap between the number of hostages Hamas is prepared to release and Israel's demands for a humanitarian hostage release phase is substantial. Disagreements also persist over ending the war and the military presence along the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors.

Syria's international airport to reopen in bid to show stability	De facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa announces international flights to the country will resume soon as more countries decide to open routes to Syria Syria's main airport in its capital of Damascus will reopen for international flights for the first time since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime next week, the country's new government announced on Saturday. The airport’s reopening, which was targeted multiple times by Israel according to foreign reports, is seen as an attempt by Jihadist rebel leader and de facto authority in Syria Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), to project stability. 'We assure Arab and international airlines that we've begun the reconstruction of the airports in Aleppo and Damascus with the help of our partners so they can receive aircraft from around the world,' state news agency SANA cited Syria's Civil Aviation Authority head as saying. International aid planes have already landed in Syria since the coup and domestic flights within the country have resumed. According to the AFP news agency, the first flight since Assad's escape occurred on December 18, when a plane flew from Damascus Airport to Aleppo. Qatar Airways was quick to announce its return to flying to Syria for the first time in 13 years. Meanwhile, Egypt's Foreign Ministry reported that an Egyptian cargo plane landed at Damascus Airport on Saturday, delivering humanitarian aid from Cairo to Syria for the first time since Assad's ousting. The plane carried 15 tons of supplies and food as part of Egypt's 'commitment to support our brothers, the Syrian people.' The shipment, provided by the Egyptian Red Crescent Society, was handed over to its Syrian partners and included tents, blankets, food and medical supplies.

Hezbollah chief: 'Our patience may run out before the cease-fire ...	Terror group's Secretary-General Naim Qassem warns in speech organization is ready to resume hostilities if cease-fire conditions aren't upheld including IDF withdrawal from Lebanon Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem claimed on Saturday that his terror organization successfully repelled Israel's actions in Lebanon during the war. 'For 64 days, Israel tried to advance into our territory but only managed to move hundreds of meters,' Qassem said. 'Israel failed to penetrate deeper into our land thanks to the strength of the resistance. The resistance is powerful, deterrent and effective, disrupting the enemy's objectives despite the extensive destruction and Israeli aggression,' he added. Regarding the fragile cease-fire, Qassem said, 'The resistance wielded significant power during the cease-fire. Israel was forced to request a cease-fire due to the resistance's capabilities. We faced unprecedented aggression, stood firm and broke Israel's strength. Sacrifice is the path to dignity and the resistance will continue.' 'There’s no specific timeline dictating the resistance’s actions — not in the agreement, nor with the 60-day timeframe,' he added. 'Our patience may run out before the 60 days, or it might last longer. The resistance's leadership will decide. Our patience hinges on our judgment about the right timing to confront aggression and its violations.' 'The cease-fire agreement obligates Israel to withdraw south of the Litani River. The Lebanese state is responsible for implementing the cease-fire agreement with Israel.' Qassem compared the current scenario to the 1982 Lebanon War. He noted that Israel reached Beirut easily back then, but 'during the 2024 aggression, Israel paid a heavy price without managing to advance more than a few hundred meters south of the Litani. This serves as a deterrent.' Talking about the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, Qassem said, 'What happened in Syria could have happened in Lebanon and I believe the Syrian people will play a role in the future confrontation with Israel. Resistance is our choice — to liberate the land, defend sovereignty, support Palestine and confront the spread of Israeli occupation. The resistance's leadership decides when and how to resist, using its methods and weapons of choice.' At the end of the month, the 60 days stipulated in the cease-fire agreement for the IDF’s withdrawal from Lebanon will expire. The IDF has already declared that the date wasn’t 'set in stone.' Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, cited a 'source,' on Saturday saying that the Lebanese army’s leadership claimed Israel is 'gradually imposing new rules of engagement and trying to establish its freedom of movement which will remain even after the cease-fire ends.' According to the source, Lebanese army officials received signals from General Jesper Jeffers, head of the U.S.-led cease-fire monitoring mechanism in Lebanon, during his visit to the country, about 'Israel’s intention to extend the cease-fire from 60 to 90 days.' The Lebanese outlet claimed this depended on Israel achieving its goals — ensuring that Hezbollah can’t initiate and launch attacks against the country. IDF officials have recently been considering staying in Lebanon beyond the period set in the cease-fire agreement. However, no decision has been made according to official sources and the matter remains undecided. The IDF is preparing for this possibility, explaining that the decision will depend on the Lebanese side, their conduct and whether their army achieves full control over southern Lebanon. Israel has made it clear that its decisions will be based on developments in Lebanon. If, at the end of the 60 days, the other side fails to uphold the agreement, there would be no reason not to remain deployed in the area. Israeli officials hope the Americans will understand their stance that a timely withdrawal, without Lebanon fulfilling its part, would be problematic. It’s likely the U.S. won’t allow this initiative to collapse. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Two key questions are on the table as the cease-fire deadline approaches: whether the IDF will extend its stay in southern Lebanon and whether residents will be allowed to return to their homes in the south.

IDF detains two Israelis crossing into Syria	Police report that two northern Israeli suspects were taken in for further questioning to determine the reason behind their attempted passage Two Israelis living in the northern part of the country were arrested by IDF forces on Saturday after crossing into Syrian territory in a vehicle, the Israel Police reported. They were apprehended driving on a road not far from the border. The two were detained for questioning and taken to the police to continue their investigation. The reasons for their crossing remain unclear, though it is possible they entered Syria out of curiosity or a desire to 'explore.'

Security forces report foiled drug-smuggling attempt across Gaza border via UAVs ready to ferry drugs; troops arrest Israeli suspect The IDF and police reported on Saturday foiling a drug-smuggling attempt from Israel into the Gaza Strip using a drone. Overnight, security forces stationed in the sector apprehended a suspect attempting to flee the site where he operated the drone. A search of his vehicle revealed another drone loaded with drugs, prepared for smuggling into Gaza. The suspect, an Israeli citizen of Bedouin descent, was taken into custody along with the confiscated evidence. He has been transferred for investigation by the police’s central unit in the southern district. Smuggling trends escalate Security officials disclosed that this incident is part of a broader trend observed in recent days. While overnight Saturday's attempt was successfully intercepted, 10 smuggling operations succeeded earlier this week.

The man who rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans had suspected bomb-making materials at his home and reserved the vehicle used in the deadly attack more than six weeks earlier, law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on Friday. Federal authorities searching the home of Shamsud-Din Jabbarin Houston found a workbench in the garage and hazardous materials believed to have been used to make explosive devices, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the search. The officials were not authorized to speak about the ongoing inquiry and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bysyc0lljg	2025-01-04T07:15:10-08:00	
Blinken recounts Gaza war, reveals threat that made Netanyahu app...	Outgoing secretary of state in interview recounts October 7, disagreements with Netanyahu, efforts to complete hostage deal and how he thinks the war might end On Saturday, the New York Times published an interview with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken before his end of term on January 20. In it, he spoke among other things on disagreements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, difficulties in reaching a hostage deal in Gaza and his disappointment of the world that he said forgot what happened on October 7, 2023, too fast. When Blinken assumed office, he believed he'd mediate a historic agreement—normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 'On October 6 we were very much pursuing normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. And in fact, I was scheduled to go to Saudi Arabia and Israel on October 10. Obviously, that didn’t happen.' Blinken told the outlet. 'The purpose of that trip was to work on the Palestinian component of any normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, because we believed and the Saudis also said it was hugely important to make sure that if there was going to be normalization, there was also a pathway toward a Palestinian state.' That trip never took place. Instead, Blinken arrived in Israel during the war's early days to support the embattled ally. 'Since October 7, we’ve had some core goals in mind. I was there. I was in Israel and then in the region five days later. I saw horrors beyond anyone’s imagination inflicted on men, women and children. And we were determined to do everything we could to help ensure that October 7 would never happen again.' Blinken noted that the U.S. aimed to prevent the war from spreading to other countries and fronts, a goal that, in retrospect, has seen limited success. ' We also wanted to make sure that the war wouldn’t spread, the conflict wouldn’t spread to other fronts, to other countries, because that would mean more death and destruction.,' he explained. He added that the U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration wished to protect civilians caught in a war they didn't start and had no power to stop, ensuring they received the aid necessary to survive the terrible conflict. Regarding the effort to prevent a recurrence of October 7, Blinken added, 'I think we’re in a good place. Israel has destroyed Hamas’s military capabilities. It’s eliminated the leadership that was responsible for October 7.' When the interviewer raised criticism of Israel's campaign against Hamas, Blinken responded, 'No one needs to remind me of the suffering, because it’s something that drives me every single day. It’s exactly why we’ve done everything in our power to find a way to get an end to the conflict through getting the hostages back and getting a cease-fire.' When asked if he believed Israel was complying with international law, Blinken noted, 'We, as you know, have looked and continue to look at that in depth. And we put out our own reports on this with our own assessments.' He added, 'When it comes to the actions that Israel has taken, in its just defense in trying to make sure that October 7 never happens again, we’ve said from Day 1 that how Israel does that matters.' 'An entire society that didn’t want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian in Gaza' Blinken recounted his first visit to Israel, just five days after the massacre, and how he 'convinced' Netanyahu to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza despite harsh domestic criticism. 'I spent with my team nine hours in the I.D.F.’s headquarters in Tel Aviv, six stories underground with the Israeli government, including the prime minister, including arguing for hours on end about the basic proposition that the humanitarian assistance needed to get to Palestinians in Gaza.' He explained that the heated debate stemmed from the Israeli public being in a state of total trauma in the days following the massacre. 'You had in Israel in the days after October 7 a totally traumatized society. This wasn’t just the prime minister or a given leader in Israel. This was an entire society that didn’t want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian in Gaza.,' he said. Blinken then shared the ultimatum he gave Netanyahu: 'President Biden was planning to come to Israel a few days later. And in the course of that argument, when I was getting resistance to the proposition of humanitarian assistance getting in, I told the prime minister, I’m going to call the president and tell him not to come if you don’t allow this assistance to start flowing. And I called the president to make sure that he agreed with that, and he fully did,' Blinken said. When he was asked why the U.S. continues to supply Israel with arms that harm Palestinians, especially since Hamas no longer poses a significant threat, he said, 'We have been and we remain fundamentally committed to Israel’s defense.' 'And that means that the support that the United States provides over many administrations, Republican and Democrat, over many years, that support is absolutely vital to making sure that Israel is able to defend itself, that it can deter aggression coming from many other quarters, whether it’s Hezbollah, whether it’s Iran, whether it’s the many Iranian-backed proxies, whether it’s the Houthis, you name it.' Obstacles on the way to a hostage deal Blinken added the fastest way to end the ongoing fighting in Gaza is through a cease-fire agreement that includes the release of hostages. 'There have been two major impediments, and they both go to what drives Hamas.' 'One has been whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel, we’ve seen it: Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a cease-fire and the release of hostages. And so there are times when what we say in private to Israel where we have a disagreement is one thing and what we’re doing or saying in public may be another.' When asked whether he viewed Netanyahu as a partner — amid reports that he blocked a cease-fire deal in July that could have led to the release of hostages — Blinken responded, ' No, that’s not accurate. What we’ve seen time and again is Hamas not concluding a deal that it should have concluded.' He acknowledged, however, 'There have been times when actions that Israel has taken have, yes, made it more difficult. But there’s been a rationale for those actions, even if they’ve sometimes made getting to a conclusion more difficult.' Alongside his criticism of Israel’s conduct, Blinken also strongly condemned the global community for quickly forgetting what happened on October 7 and who was primarily responsible for the current situation. 'One of the things that I found a little astounding throughout is that for all of the understandable criticism of the way Israel has conducted itself in Gaza, you hear virtually nothing from anyone since October 7 about Hamas. Why there hasn’t been a unanimous chorus around the world for Hamas to put down its weapons, to give up the hostages, to surrender — I don’t know what the answer is to that.' 'Israel, on various occasions has offered safe passage to Hamas’s leadership and fighters out of Gaza. Where is the world? Where is the world, saying, Yeah, do that! End this! Stop the suffering of people that you brought on! Now, again, that doesn’t absolve Israel of its actions in conducting the war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'But I do have to question how it is that we haven’t seen a greater sustained condemnation and pressure on Hamas to stop what it started and to end the suffering of people that it initiated.' Blinken added he believed the war would end under conditions outlined by Biden last year. ' If we don’t have the opportunity to start to try to implement it through a hostage cease-fire agreement in the next couple of weeks, we will hand it off to the incoming Trump administration, and they can decide whether to move forward with it,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2tm08iyg	2025-01-04T07:09:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/12/SJZwuoErWa/SJZwuoErWa_1_21_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Hamas releases video showing sign of life from hostage Liri Albag	Terror group releases clip as attempts at psychological warfare after previous footage of the IDF lookout was released in May; Family prohibits publication of video Hamas on Saturday released a video on Saturday showing a sign of life from IDF lookout Liri Albag, who was abducted on October 7, 2023. At her family's request, Ynet isn’t publishing the video, an image from it or the statements made in it at this time. Liri was abducted from the Nahal Oz base during her first Saturday on duty after completing her basic training, alongside four other lookouts: Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy. Liri’s mother, Shira Albag, shared the moments of terror at the base and the last messages she received from her daughter in a previous interview with Ynet. 'At 6:30 a.m., she called me and said, 'Mom, there’s a crazy rocket attack here. We jumped out of bed, there wasn’t even an alarm. We’re in the shelter.' I also heard the explosions in the background; no one here knew anything yet. I asked her if she was okay and she answered, 'Everything's fine, people are alive here. We’re in the shelter.' 'She sent me a picture and I saw it was open on both sides. I told her it wasn’t a proper shelter. Liri responded, 'Mom, it’s fine. Everyone’s here, all the girls. Don’t worry.' In hindsight, I learned that most of the girls were saying their goodbyes to their families during that time. She didn’t say goodbye — she reassured everyone that everything was fine.' Last May, the hostages’ families allowed the public release of footage from the Nahal Oz base, as recorded by the body cameras of Hamas terrorists on October 7. The released version was edited, shortened and censored from the full footage. It shows the five lookouts being handcuffed by their captors. Later, the terrorists filmed themselves leading the five to a vehicle amid the sound of heavy gunfire in the background. The video released by Hamas, which the family has declined to authorize for publication at this stage, follows a series of footage and proofs of life shared by terrorist organizations in Gaza in recent weeks.

Biden's last hoorah: $8 billion weapons package to Israel is in t...	The U.S. plans to approve an arms package for Israel, including artillery shells, precision bombs, and GPS systems, though production and delivery could take years; Meanwhile, heavy bombs and bulldozer shipments face delays due to concerns over impact on civilians in Gaza In what may be one of President Joe Biden’s final actions before leaving the White House, the Biden administration announced its intention to approve an $8 billion arms deal with Israel. On Saturday morning, The New York Times reported that the U.S. State Department had 'informally' notified Congress of the proposed deal. The deal reportedly includes artillery shells, small-diameter bombs, munitions for fighter jets and helicopters, and GPS-guided bomb systems. However, many of the munitions in the package are not intended for immediate use, as production is expected to begin soon. Delivery to Israel could take years. In the coming weeks, congressional committees are expected to review the deal and raise questions with the U.S. State Department. If concerns arise, these committees have the authority to delay the arms transfer. Despite this announcement, the U.S. is still withholding the shipment of approximately 1,300 heavy bombs for the Israeli Air Force, which Israel had purchased from Boeing with Israeli funds rather than U.S. aid. Each bomb weighs close to a ton. The U.S. has expressed concerns that the Israeli military might use these bombs in ways that could harm civilian populations. While half of the shipment—previously frozen by the Biden administration—has been delivered to the Israeli military, the other half remains in storage in the United States. Just over a month ago, and less than 24 hours after a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon was announced, President Biden approved a $680 million arms deal with Israel. At that time, American officials informed Congress of plans to supply additional Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits to Israel, which convert unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, as well as small-diameter bombs. A week earlier, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected three proposals introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, a Jewish progressive leader in the Democratic Party (Technically independent, but caucuses with the Democrats) and a prominent critic of Israel. These proposals called for halting weapons transfers to Israel following the war in Gaza, including tank shells, mortar bombs, and JDAM kits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: All senators who supported the proposals were Democrats, while members from both parties voted against them. The Biden administration opposed the measures, stating in a letter to Democratic senators prior to the vote that 'providing military equipment to Israel is an investment in its long-term security as it faces threats from Iran and elsewhere.' The letter also noted that 'the administration is continually working to improve conditions in Gaza.' Around two months ago, Ynet revealed new details about the freeze on U.S. arms shipments to the Israeli military. One of the items requested for ground forces—a shipment of 134 D9 bulldozers—has been delayed at Caterpillar factories in the United States, awaiting an export permit from the State Department in Washington. Israel had already ordered and paid for the shipment. The use of these bulldozers, primarily for demolishing structures in Gaza, has prompted significant internal criticism in the U.S., protests, and immense pressure on the Biden administration. As a result, the shipment has been frozen for several months. The impact is already being felt on the ground: according to Ynet inquiries, dozens of existing D9 bulldozers—heavily used in Israeli military operations in Gaza between November 2023 and mid-2024—are now in urgent need of maintenance. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r14mw888jx	2025-01-03T21:56:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/04/H1PSgL8L1g/H1PSgL8L1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

General Jeffers, who heads the cease-fire mechanism in Lebanon, praised the Lebanese army's dedication; Hezbollah announces it would refrain from escalation American General Jasper Jeffers, who heads the mechanism for supervising the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, visited the south of the country on Friday and expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the Lebanese army. 'I am incredibly impressed by the professionalism and dedication of the LAF. They are working around the clock to provide security and dismantle unexploded ordnance so Lebanese citizens can safely return home.' In the last few weeks, the LAF cleared over 9800 pieces of explosive ordnance from more than 80 locations,' he said. Meanwhile, Lebanese media outlets reported an expected visit by the American envoy, Amos Hochstein, to Beirut on Monday. According to the Qatari newspaper 'Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed', Hochstein will be engaged in a dual mission: monitoring the implementation of the cease-fire agreement alongside discussions regarding the presidential elections in Lebanon. According to the Lebanese newspaper Al-Jumhuriya, an important meeting of the committee supervising the cease-fire agreement will be held this coming Monday in Naqoura. Sources said that the meeting will be chaired by Hochstein which may send a message of seriousness regarding the implementation of the agreement. At the same time, parliamentary sources told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that Hezbollah will continue to maintain self-restraint and will not be drawn into a military escalation against Israel. On Thursday, Air Force fighter jets destroyed Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers in Lebanese territory. Arab media outlets reported three attacks in southern Lebanon. Earlier, an Iranian plane was reported to have landed at Beirut airport with money intended for Hezbollah and was detained by local authorities.

His suitcase, according to the report, was checked at the airport. The channel added that a US diplomat who landed in Beirut today was similarly checked. Lebanese Interior Minister Bassam Molawi later clarified in a conversation with the channel that the activities of the Interior Ministry and the airport security apparatus are intended to protect Lebanon. According to the minister, it was decided to carry out a check on all diplomats landing in the country, in a routine procedure.

The Prisoner’s Dilemma: The question of Marwan Barghouti	Amid the ongoing hostage and cease-fire negotiations with Hamas, Israel considers to release Marwan Barghouti in the prisoner exchange despite his deep involvement in Palestinian terrorism 'We are not familiar with the information provided by the media on the possibility that Marwan Barghouti will be released as part of the deal and exiled to Turkey', stated his son, Qassam in an interview. One week since his return from Qatar, where his family reportedly discussed the possibility of including his father in the deal with senior Hamas officials, he shared: 'We are comparatively more optimistic. As a family, we don’t care where he is released to, it can even be to Kuala-Lumpur'. An 'Israeli senior official' responded to the media reports on the subject swiftly and decidedly, stating: 'There is no discussion of Barghouti being released'. The dilemma whether or not to release Barghouti - One of the senior leaders of Fatah - has been deliberated for over two decades, and has received greater attention since October 7, as the chances of his release as part of a deal for the release of security prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza seem to be growing. Over the years, it has been argued among in Israeli politics and media that Barghouti is a leader with considerable clout, and that, despite his involvement in terror attacks during the Second Intifada that killed 5, for which he has been sentenced to life in prison, he remains true to the peace negotiations, and is expected to pursue a two-state solution. Others claim that he is a 'mini-Arafat', whose loyalties lie with militarism, and who will surely advance a violent struggle upon his release. Barghouti is both a national symbol and a mystery. This 65-year-old leader, who was born in Kufr Kobar, a village near Ramallah, represents the generation that grew up in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the 1970s and 1980s, forming a defiant alternative for the founding generation headed by Arafat, who came from Tunisia and took over the Palestinian Authority. Like many of his peers, he too knows Israel well, speaks Hebrew, and has held many meetings with Israelis prior to the Second Intifada. The mystery stems from the fact that, although he has been absent for over two decades (nearly one third of his life), Marwan Barghouti remains the most popular candidate for leading the Palestinian system. Public opinion polls conducted over the past decade have consistently shown him to beat any other candidate in any election scenario, including Hamas representatives. Many Palestinians explain this strange phenomenon by claiming that the people look up to 'Barghouti the symbol', despite being unfamiliar with 'Marwan the man'. The public at large, and particularly the younger generation, born after he had been incarcerated, view him as the epiphany of national ideals, primarily resistance and sacrifice. Hamas is equally aware of the potential Barghouti harbors, and it is no surprise, therefore, that they, too, insist that he be released. In their view, this could yield two gains for the terror organization: establishing an image of the war spurred by Hamas as a national campaign that has led to achievements for all Palestinians; and the return to the playing field of a beloved leader who, unlike most senior Palestinian Authority officials, shares similar views to those of Hamas, and with whom reconciliation may be reached, which would enable the terror organization to gain much-coveted presence in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority is fostering a more ambivalent approach toward Barghouti. Publicly, its senior officials support his release from Israeli prison, yet many in Ramallah are concerned about the possibility that he would become a dominant rival in the race for Abu Mazen’s throne, and worry that he will promote a reconciliation with Hamas. 'Barghouti’s release will be bad news for Israel, but also for many who enjoy his very presence', remarked a senior Fatah official in Nablus Hussam Khader sardonically, while Fadwa, Barghouti’s wife, chose her words carefully: 'The Palestinian Authority itself is interested in Barghouti’s release, but some parties are not so inclined, and are not true Palestinian patriots'. Israel’s primary concern over Barghouti’s possible release is that he will use his freedom to promote violence. The assessment that he will do so is based, inter alia, on statements he has issued while in prison glorifying the armed struggle. His son, Qassam, however, said: 'They are scaring you for nothing. My father is the ultimate partner for Israel, he is true to the two-state vision, has garnered support across the Palestinian public, and can serve as a stable, uniting, and agreed point of contact for the Palestinian side'. Although Israel denies it, Barghouti may indeed be released, and reintegrated once more into the Palestinian system very soon, whether he is exiled overseas, returns to the West Bank, or, in the less likely turn of events, ends up in Gaza. Israel fears that, upon his release, Barghouti will advocate violence, while pursuing reconciliation with Hamas, forcing Israel to take action, particularly if he will be back in the West Bank. Yet a more complex scenario will generate a second 'Jolani dilemma', meaning an attempt on Barghouti’s part to appear moderate like Syria`s current ruler - including engaging in direct talks with Western and Israeli officials - while keeping them wondering whether it is merely a smokescreen masking an extremist’s vision. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even if Barghouti will not be included in the deal, he is expected to affect the Palestinian sphere, and, in turn, Israel too. He is determined to run for the presidency in any future Palestinian elections, even from within prison walls. In the seemingly likely event that he will win them; Israel will be subject to heavy international pressure. Such a development could also lead to protest and confusion within the Palestinian Authority as it finds itself being led by a man who is being imprisoned by the very country against which he is calling his people to fight, while engaging in close civil and security coordination with Israel. Be it from prison or the squares of Ramallah, it seems the name Barghouti will be on the lips of both nations, the Middle East, and the international community for a long time to come.

IDF and police thwart drug smuggling attempt from Israel to Gaza	The IDF and police spokespersons said that 'in recent days, several smuggling attempts have been made from Israeli territory to the Gaza Strip using a drone. During the night, another smuggling attempt was made from Israel to the Gaza Strip.

How Hamas uses hospitals for its benefit and the ensuing criticis...	Hamas uses Gaza hospitals as base of operations and interrogations as a tactic, 'They can suddenly take over a ward,' testifies a Gazan resident; Gazan reporter criticized Hamas Recently, Hamas' use of hospitals in the Gaza Strip has made headlines after the IDF exposed the terror organization. During the operation at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, about 240 terrorists were arrested, the largest arrest throughout the war, including the hospital director, Hussam Abu Safiya, who according to the IDF is suspected of being a Hamas operative. In a particularly unusual step, Israel decided to seal the hospital after the operation and put it out of use, preventing it from being used again by Hamas. On previous occasions when the IDF raided hospitals in Gaza, it allowed the continuation of operations there afterward. For example, on November 15, 2023, the IDF raided Shifa for the first time and found weapons, a tunnel shaft, explosives, and evidence that hostages were held there in the first days of the war. After the IDF withdrew from the site, the hospital returned to being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad members. Immediately after the IDF withdrew for the first time, sources in the Gaza Strip say, Hamas called on a very large number of civilians to return to the hospital buildings and its courtyards, promising to distribute aid. During this time, hundreds of weapons were brought in under the assumption that IDF forces would not return to the complex. 'Specific rooms in the hospital buildings became military and security management centers,' sources in the Gaza Strip said. 'Daily meetings were held for Hamas and Jihad members in the hospital corridors. The Israeli forces monitored all these movements from the air, but Hamas continued military activity from the hospital.' On March 18 2024, IDF forces returned to Shifa in a surprise raid, in which more than 200 terrorists were eliminated and hundreds more were arrested. According to the IDF spokesperson, weapons were found hidden between patient beds in the maternity ward, along with mortar bombs, IEDs and sniper weapons. Since then, Hamas has reportedly restored the hospital which has resumed operations. Hussam Yahya, a presenter for the Qatari Al Jazeera network, admitted that Hamas used Shifa, but claimed that it emboldens the population. 'It is a living nightmare for Israel's goal of emptying Gaza and the north. The hospital miraculously returned to work after its destruction. A meeting of clan leaders was held there, which resulted in a 'statement rejecting cooperation with Israel.' In short, the very presence of Shifa is a defeat for Israel,' Yahya stated. In the comments, some wondered: 'Why gather in a hospital? You idiots.' There are currently 23 hospitals operating in the Gaza Strip, including 13 field hospitals established by the international community, in coordination with the COGAT unit. Also, 10 additional hospitals in the Strip receive supplies from Israel, including equipment and food. Hamas's use of hospitals was not limited to medical treatment. Throughout the war, the terror organization has repeated the transgression, without regard for the population that increasingly needs medical treatments that have been reduced in response to IDF raids. In Gaza, this fact is well known, but there is no one to rise up, for now. 'There are medical personnel who are related to terrorists. These are Hamas' key people in all the hospitals. On any day they can arrive, take over an entire ward without anyone objecting to it. They arrive, close a ward, and the doctor is one of their own,' a Gazan resident told Ynet. 'Before the war, everything was open to them, but the takeover of the hospitals was noticeable. At any given moment, it was possible to shut down an entire hospital without regard for mothers, the sick or the wounded. This is how a terrorist organization behaves, and there is no one to stop it.' 'Most government institutions have been destroyed and the hospitals are used for meetings of police, security and aid personnel. 'Everything is done there, it's the safest place.' Recently, the IDF disclosed Hamas has used Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. About a year ago, Hamas police summoned a man who heads an aid-smuggling gang in the Al-Qararah area of Khan Yunis for questioning. The summons was issued on October 16, and it was clearly stated that the place of questioning was the hospital. On social media, Fatah supporters wondered: 'Why does the enemy bomb hospitals or schools that house refugees? There are people in the Gaza Strip who give them an opportunity and an excuse. Summoning people to the Nasser Hospital is just a call for the enemy to bomb the patients.' These days, the use of hospitals has become more necessary for Hamas which has lost government infrastructure one after another. 'From Hamas' perspective, the air force will not bomb a hospital full of displaced and sick people. The population inside must first be evacuated, and Hamas knows this very well,' said sources in Gaza. 'Now that most of the government institutions that Hamas used before the war have been demolished, it is also using them for meetings of police officers, security personnel, and for aid matters. Everything is conducted there. This is the safest place for them.' Israeli security sources commented. 'The terrorist organizations, led by Hamas, are trying to deflect public criticism of the organization's cynical exploitation of civilian institutions and hospitals onto IDF forces,' they said, and claimed: 'Hamas fears public criticism and protests against it, and therefore it is spreading misleading and false narratives on social media to pressure Israel through the international community.' Unprecedented criticism from a journalist: 'People are dying of cold in tents' The IDF's activity at the Kamal Adwan Hospital began to sway Hamas supporters in the past week. In a recording published on social media, Al-Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, who is considered one of Hamas's top aides, criticized the organization's negotiators, saying: 'The public could have prevented what is happening in the northern Gaza Strip and prevented the destruction and damage to the hospitals. But Hamas, which is conducting the talks, is not interested in the public, and the organization continues to use slogans.' Sharif criticized the ongoing rounds of negotiations, and mentioned the suffering of the residents of the Gaza Strip. 'Hamas' claims about being flexibile in the talks are not at all interesting to the public. It is impossible to continue dragging out the ceasefire talks. The public is suffering, stop haggling over the terms of the deal. We express opposition and protest against Hamas, which is making cynical use of the situation leading to the invasion of the IDF forces into the region.' In a tweet he later published, Sharif wrote: 'The war must end immediately. We do not want what happened in the north of the Gaza Strip to be repeated in Gaza City. Gaza is drowning in sadness, loss, oppression, and pain in the face of the world's abandonment. I swear, we are dying from the cold and the winds when we are in tents.'

UNRWA reportedly preparing to cease activities in Gaza, West Bank	U.N. officials say they are preparing to shutter UNRWA operations,' the New York Times reports Friday; Decision comes after Knesset passed two pieces of legislation that bars the agency's activities on Israeli territory, such as coordinating with the IDF; UNRWA supports say this will deal a fatal blow to the Palestinians UN officials told The New York Times that UNRWA , the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, is preparing to cease its activities in Gaza and the West Bank. The report comes about two months after the Knesset passed two pieces of legislation banning the organization's activities in its territory, and which went into effect this month. After the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023, there was criticism in Israel against UNRWA over the involvement of some of its employees in the deadly attack. A UN investigation confirmed that nine of the organization's employees did indeed take an active part in the events and cooperated with Hamas. In light of the findings, the Knesset approved laws prohibiting UNRWA from operating in its territory. These laws, which will come into effect this month, prevent any cooperation with the organization. This will limit the organization's ability to continue its activities in the West Bank and Gaza, which require coordination with the IDF. 'It would be a massive impact on an already catastrophic situation,' Jamie McGoldrick, who oversaw the U.N. humanitarian operation across Gaza and the West Bank until April, told the New York Times. 'If that is what the Israeli intention is — to remove any ability for us to save lives — you have to question what is the thinking and what is the end goal?' UNRWA supporters claim that the cessation of operations would be a fatal blow to the Palestinian population. 'The world has abandoned us. We have nothing but the aid we get from UNRWA to survive,' Sami Abu Darweesh, 30, who lives in a refugee camp in southern Gaza run by UNRWA, told the newspaper. 'If that stops, what will we do?' 'We gave the government 90 days, and, actually, the entire world 90 days,' said Yuli Edelstein, the chairman of the parliamentary committee that drafted the UNRWA bills. 'Whoever truly cares about the population, let them bring about the groups that would help.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In Israel, support for the move to shut down UNRWA is growing. Knesset lawmaker Dan Illouz of the Likud, who was one of the initiators of the law against UNRWA, said: 'We succeeded! The historic law that I initiated to disconnect UNRWA from Israel is proving itself. The world is beginning to understand that UNRWA is an arm of Hamas and not an aid organization. Its employees were complicit in the October 7 massacre, its institutions hid weapons, and it educated generations of terrorists. Now, with its collapse, we are striking at the heart of the terror apparatus.' 'Israel has taken the first step – now the world must complete it. UNRWA must not only be reduced, it must disappear. This is a huge achievement for Israel’s security and the fight against terrorism!' said Illouz. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjpid8sike	2025-01-03T04:24:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/S1ec6Gj7kl/S1ec6Gj7kl_0_165_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The attack, which missed the helicopter, set off sirens at Kibbutz Be'eri for the first time in 10 months; 2 rockets also were launched from Gaza at Sderot and the vicinity; It is the eighth day in a row that sirens warning of rocket attacks have sounded in the Gaza envelope Rocket alert sirens sounded in Kibbutz Be'eri for the first time in 10 months on Friday following surface-to-air missile fired from Gaza; the shoulder-launched missile was fired at an Israeli Air Force helicopter over Gaza. This was followed Friday morning by two rockets launched at Sderot around noon. One of them exploded near Kibbutz Nir Am, the other fell in an open area. The Sderot municipality said that residents reported shrapnel on a local streets, and noted that there were no reports of any injuries or property damage. Footage from the municipal soccer stadium shows the explosions as many people watch the match there. An hour and a half before the sirens in Sderot, the alarms were sounded in Be'ari. They were triggered by a shoulder-launched missile fired by Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip at an Israeli Air Force helicopter. The missile did not hit or endanger the aircraft, which continued its operations, but since the missile was fired toward Israeli territory the alarm was sounded in Be'eri. This is the eighth consecutive day that an alert siren has sounded in the enclave. The last time there was a siren in Be'eri following rocket fire from Gaza was in March, almost 10 months ago. Since then, an alarm has sounded in the evacuated kibbutz only once, during the Iranian attack in early October.

Greenland's leader steps up push for independence from Denmark	Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede emphasised his desire to pursue independence from Denmark, its former colonial ruler, during his New Year speech, marking a significant change in the rhetoric surrounding the Arctic island's future. Egede's speech, which comes on the heels of comments by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressing his wish for 'ownership and control' of Greenland, also expressed a desire to strengthen Greenland's cooperation with other countries. 'It is about time that we ourselves take a step and shape our future, also with regard to who we will cooperate closely with, and who our trading partners will be,' he said. An independence movement has gained traction in Greenland in recent years in part due to revelations of misconduct by Danish authorities during the 20th century, including an involuntary birth control campaign launched in the 1960s. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953 but is now a self-governing territory of Denmark and in 2009 achieved the right to claim independence through a vote. In 2023, Greenland's government presented its first draft constitution. While a majority of Greenland's 57,000 inhabitants support independence, there is division over the timing and potential impact on living standards. Greenland's government has twice rejected offers by Trump to purchase the island, in 2019 and again last year, with Egede asserting that 'Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjxkciblje	2025-01-03T03:37:49-08:00	
German, French foreign ministers meet Syria's new rulers in Damas...	The foreign ministers of Germany and France said they wanted to forge a new relationship with Syria and urged a peaceful transition as they met its de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus on Friday on behalf of the European Union. Germany's Annalena Baerbock and France's Jean-Noel Barrot are the first ministers from the EU to visit Syria since rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8 and forced President Bashar al-Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family's decades-long rule. The French and German ministers met Sharaa in the Damascus People's Palace, but so far no details of their talks have been made public. Barrot similarly expressed his hope for a 'sovereign and safe' Syria that would leave no room for terrorism, chemical weapons or malign foreign actors, during a meeting with representatives from Syrian civil society organisations. Germany and France plan to offer their technical help and advice to Syria as the country drafts a new constitution, Barrot told journalists, saying that hope for the country's democratic transition was 'fragile but real'. He called for a political solution for Kurdish fighters in Syria to be integrated into the Syrian state, adding that a permanent ceasefire must be achieved, but he did not respond when asked when the EU could lift sanctions on Syria. Barrot also visited the French embassy, which has been closed since 2012, where he said France would work towards re-establishing diplomatic representation in line with political and security conditions, diplomatic sources said. As part of their visit, the ministers took a tour of Syria's most notorious prison, the vast Sednaya complex. 'Now it's up to the international community to help to bring justice to the people who have suffered here in this prison of hell,' Baerbock said.

Take me, al Golani: New Syrian leader wooed by many	Ahmad al-Sharaa is least likely to align himself with Russia, and he needs legitimacy and funding from the West including the lifting of sanctions to allow trade and foreign investments Nearly one month after the fall of the Assad regime, the new leaders of Syria are facing many challenges as they prepare for the establishment of a committee for national dialogue that will compose a new constitution and government that they hope will unite Syria's fractured society. Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, is well aware of the need to present a clean image to the West if he hopes to receive legitimacy for his rule. But while he exhibits himself as someone who seeks peace, his past in al-Qaida still overshadows many of his promises for the future. Many countries are still involved in events in Syria and the flow of leaders to Damascus continues. On Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived after representatives from Ukraine, the U.S., Turkey and Qatar, among others, visited the Syrian capital. Russia, which alongside Iran had propped up the Assad regime and was directly responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of Syrians, has also been trying to woo the new leadership even though it is hosting the deposed Syrian dictator in Moscow. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this week that Syria is a 'sovereign nation' and has the right to end agreements signed with international partners, but added that there has been no request from the new leadership for Russia to remove its bases in Syria. He said the establishment of the Russian bases were agreed through international treaties and in accordance with international law but there was no doubt that the regime change in Damascus would require certain adjustments regarding Russia's military presence in Syria, which could be negotiated by the parties. Al-Sharaa said in an interview to Saudi media that Syria has strategic interests with Russia and that he hoped Moscow would not leave in a manner that was not compatible with the bilateral relations. But it does not appear that the new Syrian leader has doubts whether to align himself with the West or the Russians. Moscow is not a real option for him. Professor Eyal Zisser, an expert on Syria and Lebanon and the vice rector of Tel Aviv University, said he believes Al Sharaa will not lean on Russia but does not want a fight with the Russians. 'He wants to project himself as moderate,' Zisser said. 'He does not want confrontation and has enough troubles. Israel has deployed troops in Syria, Iran and Hezbollah are lurking in the corner. He wants to end things with Moscow on a positive note.' Zisser believes there is an open historic account for the Syrian opposition forces with Russia, which was quick to provide a sanctuary for Bashar Assad. 'The United States can more easily reach agreements with Al Sharaa than Russia, which is still weary of Islamist groups, can. The new regime needs money to rebuild and rehabilitate Syria. Assad relied heavily on revenue from the drug trade and a new source of income is now needed. 'He needs Qatar, the Gulf nations, the U.S. and the West,' Zisser says. 'He needs sanctions lifted so that there can be trade and investments as well as financial assistance.' Qatar, aware of those needs, began establishing its position in Syria soon after the Assad regime fell, by transferring funds and ensuring its involvement in any future process. Al Sharaa's rebranding as a moderate has been helpful to portray Islam as more than terrorism. As in its dealings in Gaza, Doha appears to be providing assistance, but has other interests as well and is using its close ties to Turkey to achieve them. Turkey, which has been fighting the Kurds in northern Syria for years, has two main interests. One is the return home of Syrian refugees that have sought shelter within its borders, and the other is the fight against the Kurds who under the auspices of the U.S. and Syrian opposition forces (SDF) have taken control of large areas in northern and eastern Syria. 'Our goal is to solve the crisis in the northeast,' Al Sharaa said in the interview. 'The Kurds are an inseparable part of the Syrian population and their forces will be incorporated in the Syrian defense forces.' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Ankara would not accept the Kurds from the PKK Party – identified as a terror group, and a majority of Kurdish fighters in SDF as legitimate representatives of Syria. This will challenge Al Sharaa to decide where his alliances lie. 'The new Syrian regime is heavily reliant on Turkey to rebuild the country after Assad,' said Dr. Galia Lindenstrauss, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). 'Al Sharaa would likely choose to establish his leadership before he takes on the Kurds in a fight. ' Turkey has financial problems of its own and cannot allot funds for the Syrians, but may rely on its alliance with Qatar, she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi Arabia is also working on its ties with the new regime. 'Riyadh wants stability in Syria and has a central role to play,' Al Sharaa said. 'I hope Iran reconsiders its involvement in the region. We are seeking balanced relations with everyone and Iran must align itself with the Syrian people.' Whether or not Al Sharaa has really changed is unclear even to the many diplomats who met with him. Officials in Israel are concerned that he may be fooling the West and insist Israel's hold on the Syrian part of Mt. Hermon and the buffer zone on the Golan Heights will continue until things become clear. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk08x8sljg	2025-01-03T03:30:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/S1IlMNrLyg/S1IlMNrLyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How Israel’s biotech ecosystem is pioneering drug development	Noam Solomon: 'We have so many startups and IT companies succeeding, and we can tap into this, source amazing talent' Israel is not the global leader in biotechnology, but it is a major player in the field. According to two biotech entrepreneurs and experts, there are compelling reasons why people turn to the Jewish state for innovation. What sets Israel apart was a key theme of the 'Light of Innovation' panel at the Lights of Hope virtual event, presented this week by ILTV and Ynet News. One factor is Israel’s exceptional engineering talent, according to Noam Solomon, Co-founder and CEO of Immunai. 'We have technological units such as 8200 that create an amazing ecosystem. We have so many startups and IT companies succeeding, and we can tap into this, source amazing talent,' Solomon said. Another advantage, he explained, is Israel’s culture. Israelis have a strong mentality of 'getting things done.' The panel also featured Karin Noy, who leads the Emerging Science & Innovation in Israel portfolio for Pfizer. She highlighted Israel’s robust academic research and a well-integrated healthcare system. This system links medical providers and health insurance companies, creating a comprehensive and valuable patient data set. 'If you think about the drug development process, it's so complicated,' said Noy. 'We are starting from the discovery of new targets and then for those targets we need to validate them, we need to identify molecules and design them. And then on the translational side, to find how to match them to the right patients and then to take them to advanced clinical trials' until they are eventually commercialized. It’s a complex process, she emphasized, which is why Pfizer collaborates with small, innovative companies in Israel to address these challenges. Developing a drug today can take more than a decade and cost over $2 billion. Furthermore, 95% of investments fail. According to Solomon, the primary reason is that human immune systems respond differently to therapeutics than mice. Immunai addressed this issue by mapping and building an AI model of the immune system, allowing it to predict immune responses to therapeutics. AI, Solomon said, is unlocking insights that were previously unattainable in drug development and patient care. Using its model, Immunai has been able to determine the optimal dosage for drugs. 'Just knowing that a molecule could work is not enough; it's not a therapy. You need to decide what is the dose, what is the schedule [for taking it],' Solomon explained. 'With AI and our predictive modeling, we're able to optimize those.' For example, Immunai has used its model to find the best combination agent for oncology drugs. This includes determining which chemotherapy or anti-drug conjugate to pair with an immune agent. Pfizer is also involved in another groundbreaking AI initiative: AION Labs. AION Labs is an Israeli venture studio formed in partnership with AstraZeneca, Merck, Pfizer, Teva, the Israel Biotech Fund, Amiti Ventures, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Israel's war in Iran's planetary mixers, producing solid rocket f...	Planetary mixers critical for Iran's missile production, averts the need for on-sight fueling of projectiles, enhances precision and range of missiles; IDF images of mixers in destroyed facility in Syria reveals them for the first time to the public The IDF's revelation of the Israeli commando raid on the Iranian missile production facility used by Hezbollah in Masyaf, located in Syria’s Hama province, was the first time an image a planetary mixer, a vital component used to blend solid rocket fuel components together, was exposed to the public. Solid rocket fuel enables missiles to be launched without the need for on-site fueling, a process requiring them to be removed from underground shelters and raised upright for nearly an hour—making them easily detectable by satellites and other intelligence tools. Solid fuel also significantly enhances a missile's range and precision. The planetary mixes precisely combine materials into a homogeneous compound for solid rocket fuel production. In the raid involving 100 commando special forces, the facility that was intended for the production of hundreds of precision missiles a year, was destroyed and with it, industrial mixers. Initially the forced did not plan to completely destroy the facility but only the planetary mixers without which solid fuel could not be produced. Israel has been on the hunt to destroy Iran's planetary mixers since 2019, when a drone attack was carried out on the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut where it was awaiting transportation to one of the missile production sites the terror group had built in the area. According to Lebanese reports, a year later, the IDF navy attacked a vessel that was delivering an alternative planetary mixer to replace the one that was destroyed. Planetary mixers, that were almost exclusively in the possession of superpowers – have become some of Israel's main targets in its war against the Shiite axis. After Israel's strike on Iran on October 26, at least a dozen of them were destroyed, pushing Iran's missile production back at least two years. Each planetary mixer costs in the area of $2 million. Currently there are one or two planetary mixers estimated to be in use by members of the Shiite axis and are in the possession of the Houthi rebels.

Former US serviceman indicted for attempting to join Hezbollah	Jack Danaher Molloy, 24, travels to Lebanon and Syria in 2024 in effort to join terror group, charged with making false statement to FBI ; promotes hates, violence against Jews on social media; could face 20 years in prison A Pennsylvania man who previously served in the U.S. Army was indicted by a grand jury on charges of attempting to support Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and of making false statements to the FBI, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. Jack Danaher Molloy, 24, was a dual citizen of the U.S. and Ireland and traveled to Lebanon and Syria in 2024 to attempt to join Hezbollah, which is designated by the U.S. as a 'foreign terrorist organization,' the Justice Department said in a statement. The department said Molloy returned to the U.S. in late 2024 and continued making attempts to join Hezbollah. He had also promoted hatred and violence against Jews, the Justice Department said, adding he was formerly enlisted as an active-duty soldier in the U.S. Army from mid-March to late April in 2019. The Justice Department said Molloy lied to the FBI about his intentions to join Hezbollah when questioned upon his return to the United States in late 2024. It said he was arrested on Dec. 6 in Chicago. If convicted, Molloy faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for a material support charge. For false statement charges, he faces a maximum penalty of eight years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both.

The ground trembled': IDF unveils detail of heroic IDF commando ...	With heavy aerial cover and amid intense danger, 100 IDF commandos landed in Syria in order to dismantle an Iranian missile production facility that was on the verge of becoming operational The IDF’s daring commando operation to destroy a newly constructed underground missile production facility in Syria was revealed in full detail on Thursday. The IDF disclosed new and extensive information about the heroic operation carried out on the night of September 8. In a rare ground raid, Israeli Air Force (IAF) commandos from the Shaldag Unit targeted the massive facility built by Iran near the town of Masyaf, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Israel, deep inside Syria. 30 Syrian guards eliminated The facility was on the verge of full industrial production, capable of manufacturing 150 to 300 large, precision-guided missiles annually for Hezbollah, Bashar Assad’s regime and pro-Iranian forces in Syria. This development aimed to bypass the weapon smuggling routes from Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, which the IDF frequently targeted. Commandos discovered eight preliminary rocket engines already produced on-site but, as the facility had yet to begin full operations, its destruction at this stage was critical to prevent it from becoming a fortified and much harder target. On the night of the strike, approximately 30 Syrian soldiers guarded the facility. Most were eliminated in preliminary airstrikes by IAF fighter jets and helicopters seven minutes before the Shaldag commandos landed. Four more soldiers were neutralized at close range by the commandos on the ground. None of the IDF operatives were injured and the mission was deemed a resounding success. The mission was personally presented by Lt. Col. B., the Shaldag Unit’s commander, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. After approval from IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, the operation was launched. Lasting three hours under the cover of night, the takeover of the underground complex was executed in precisely 18 minutes from the moment the helicopters touched down in Syria. Dozens of additional Syrian soldiers were deployed to the site an hour later but were either attacked or fled after realizing the area was secured by a formidable force. Reinforcements included motorbike riders and troops in jeeps. Hundreds of additional Syrian soldiers arrived approximately an hour after the Israeli forces had withdrawn. That same night, the IAF carried out additional strikes on multiple targets across Syria including at nearby Syrian military industry sites. The IDF assessed that it took several days for the Syrian army and Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to realize the magnitude of the attack on this strategic site, codenamed 'Deep Layer' by the IDF. Its construction began in 2017 as a safer alternative to similar above-ground industrial sites targeted by the IDF over the past decade. The fall of the Assad regime in the last month likely contributed to the IDF's decision to declassify and share the operation's details. IDF intelligence's critical realization The mission was meticulously planned over a year of war in which Shaldag commandos executed over 800 operations in Gaza and Lebanon, even during the war's first month, suffering the loss of 13 operatives and officers. Preparations and modeling were accelerated in the three months preceding September after senior military and political officials were convinced of the mission's importance, despite the risks involved — such as helicopters flying at dangerously low altitudes over Lebanon and Syria — sometimes as low as 60 feet — carrying over 100 Israeli soldiers. In recent years, the IDF Intelligence Directorate monitored Iran’s construction of the 'Deep Layer' facility. Last year, as attacks on Hezbollah intensified, the unit concluded that the facility would be central to restoring Hezbollah's firepower capabilities post-war. Left operational, it could have enabled Hezbollah to produce advanced precision missiles with ranges of 40 to 300 kilometers (25 to 186 miles), capable of accurately targeting central Israel in significant numbers. The intelligence team accurately predicted the facility's layout, which included 16 production rooms, laboratories, an assembly hall, offices and storage units. Constructed in a horseshoe shape, with raw materials entering from one side and completed missiles exiting the other, it maximized security and efficiency. Eight fuel mixers for rocket engines have already been installed in the production halls, but the plant has yet to be declared operational. Consequently, security was relatively low, with only dozens of guards stationed at various posts. At night, when the underground facility was empty, the entrances were locked. Only a simple rope marked the entrance at the compound's shabby gate, still under construction. This weapons factory was unique in Syria, as it was built underground, shielded by natural concrete and layers of 60 meters to 120 meters (197 feet to 394 feet) of rocky soil. Excavation work was completed in 2021 under the close supervision of Israeli military intelligence. The IAF waited weeks for favorable weather conditions to carry out the operation, as even a minute of low cloud cover could jeopardize the mission. The Masyaf area is one of the most heavily fortified in Syria after Damascus, protected by advanced Russian-made SA-22 air defense systems and other anti-aircraft measures, including shoulder-launched missiles. Helicopters nearly touched water The helicopters flew extremely low, along carefully chosen routes, with diversions and close escort by two Apache attack helicopters, allowing them to evade the Syrian radar systems deployed in the area to protect the site. 'The entire Air Force was on high alert that night, but it wasn't enough — intelligence personnel and the Navy provided operational support, fire cover and the most precise intelligence possible for every phase of the mission,' according to the IDF. The IAF skillfully coordinated the operation with the Russians, who are stationed at their major base in Syria and with their nearby S-400 missile batteries, ensuring there were no misunderstandings or early detection that could disrupt the mission. The helicopters carrying the troops flew very low over the Mediterranean Sea, almost skimming the water, and maintained this altitude over enemy territory en route to the target. 'We practiced numerous scenarios and responses, dealt with the topography and used the area's valleys to our advantage, despite the risks of flying through them,' the military described. 'We knew a full Syrian division might respond, so speed was essential. The most critical aspect was breaching the facility's locked doors quickly. The IDF Chief of Staff constantly stressed reducing the operation’s duration,' according to the IDF. The operation was directed on the ground by Lt. Col. B. and the highest-ranking officer to set foot in Syria that night —Col. G., commander of the IAF’s 7th Squadron. The Israeli Air Force allocated four control rooms to manage the operation and synchronize all its components. 'Scenarios like a drone failing to secure an infiltration route for a few minutes require immediate backup,' the IDF noted. 'Every extreme scenario was rehearsed in advance.'Shaldag operatives landed at two preplanned temporary landing zones, 700 meters and 1.5 kilometers (0.4 miles and 0.9 miles) from the target. Just minutes before their landing, they saw explosions resulting from fighter jet strikes that isolated the compound and eliminated dozens of its guards. Inside the facility, they found weapons-casting machinery, rocket fuel imported from Iran, Iranian avionics equipment and materials that reinforced assessments that the plant was on the verge of becoming operational. According to the IDF, a former officer who headed a Military Intelligence unit had advocated to take action against the facility for years. In the years leading up to the operation, the target became a high priority for decision makers. 'We avoided opening a front against Assad for strategic reasons for a long time,' the IDF said. 'But it was clear this was part of Iran's vision — encircling Israel with a ring of fire supported by advanced manufacturing capabilities in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.' Initially, the mission seemed impossible: flying into a missile-laden, heavily fortified area, landing troops and safely extracting them. 'The critical phase was the extraction,' the IDF noted. In preparation, daily intelligence reviews were conducted on the site and its surroundings for months before the operation. When the ground shook In the nearby town of Masyaf, residents remained unaware, assuming the events were routine Israeli airstrikes elsewhere, as the IDF had conducted during the war. Four attack helicopters deployed no fewer than 100 Shaldag soldiers on the ground, equipped with heavy gear, explosives and a utility ATV left behind to facilitate the force's extraction at the mission's end. Additionally, 20 operatives from 669th Unit were deployed near the target, accompanied by an intensive care team and a mobile field operating room. This ensured immediate treatment for severe injuries without the need to evacuate troops to Israel mid-operation. The rescue unit's medics were prepared to stabilize the wounded on-site, enabling the mission to continue without jeopardizing its success. Within 90 minutes of covert, low-altitude flight, 100 Shaldag soldiers, most of them reservists, landed at the two sites. The first group swiftly breached the compound, clearing the remaining Syrian soldiers and breaking through the armored doors to the underground facility, while the second group simultaneously deployed explosives inside the factory. The first team sprinted 700 meters from the landing zone to the locked gates leading into the underground compound. 'Fifty minutes after landing, the forces were already inside,' the IDF described. 'The troops used Syrian forklifts found inside to expedite the placement of explosives. This was pre-planned and practiced back in Israel, knowing those forklifts were there,' the statement added. IDF combat engineers had meticulously prepared a special demolition plan to ensure the site's complete destruction: a quarter-ton of Israeli explosives was strategically placed, augmented by roughly 700 tons of local rocket fuel that completed the task. As the demolition expert, S., activated the trigger, the troops took cover and say they could swear that 'the ground beneath them trembled at that moment.'

In total, 49 munitions were fired, with 70 aircraft in the air for over three hours, supported by thousands of officers and soldiers on the ground in Israel. Upon the mission’s completion, IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar said: 'Amid this justified war, this was a crucial event for the nation's security. As we return safely, we can take pride and tell future generations about the significant step we took for Israel's security.' 'The Shaldag Unit’s operation deep inside Syrian territory joins a series of courageous missions the IDF has conducted over the past few months in Gaza, the Dahieh in Beirut and Iran, with the goal of destroying the Iranian Axis’ missile manufacturing capabilities,' IDF Chief of Staff Lt.

Israeli delegation to leave for Doha to continue hostage deal neg...	Israeli officials express careful optimism following Netanyahu's approval to send the team to Qatar; Arab media reports Hamas willing to complete 'one-phase' deal Israel is set to send a delegation to Doha, Qatar, on Friday to continue negotiations on a hostage deal with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement Thursday evening that he approved dispatching 'a professional delegation from the Mossad, Shin Bet and the IDF to continue the negotiations.' Earlier, Israel's envoy for hostages and missing citizens Gal Hirsch told the hostages’ families in a meeting that reports of an alleged 'deadlock' in the talks were inaccurate and that negotiations were ongoing under strict confidentiality and extensive efforts. Hirsch, who left the room during the conversation to take an urgent call regarding the negotiations, stressed that the current agreement being worked on aims to bring all the hostages home, despite Israel's refusal to meet Hamas' demand to end the war in Gaza. Senior Israeli officials reported slow progress in the talks but clarified that 'there's no breakthrough yet and gaps still remain.' They noted that mediators are increasing pressure on both sides and are pushing for an Israeli delegation to attend talks in Doha or Cairo. However, Hamas continued to refuse to provide lists with the names of the living hostages. Earlier on Thursday, Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Wednesday, met with senior Egyptian intelligence official Major General Ahmed Abdel Khalek and discussed the negotiations for the hostages' release and 'the new conditions set by the Israeli government.' According to the report, these conditions allegedly include replacing the names of 12 elderly, ill civilian hostages with those of 12 soldiers. Israel consistently claimed that Arab media reports regarding the negotiations are distorted. The Qatari newspaper further reported that the Hamas delegation's meeting with Egyptian officials included discussions on deferring contentious points to a later stage after the first phase of the agreement. The proposal will reportedly be presented to the Israeli side in an attempt to reach a resolution before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20. Egyptian sources told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Hamas is open to a 'one-phase' agreement for all hostages on the condition that Israel withdraws from Gaza and ends the war within an agreed timeframe. According to these sources, Egyptian mediators aim to implement the first phase of the agreement, believing that 'the opening move' is the most challenging, after which remaining obstacles can be addressed and the war could conclude. The outlet also noted that a Hamas delegation traveled to Doha on Thursday to discuss recent developments in the negotiations. Hamas politburo deputy head Moussa Abu Marzouk told the newspaper that 'there’s a significant opportunity for the negotiations to succeed this time.' 'The delegation's visit aims to overcome obstacles and conditions recently set by the Israeli side to continue its aggression in Gaza,' Hamas spokesperson Jihad Taha added. 'Hamas approaches all matters positively and openly, prioritizing the needs of the Palestinian people and will spare no effort to halt the aggression in the Strip. We hope for an agreement but Israel refuses to compromise on its recently imposed conditions.' The remaining gaps in the negotiations mainly concern the number of hostages to be released. Hamas is willing to release a double-digit number of live hostages, while Israel is pushing to increase the figure. The terror organization is receptive to closing the gap by returning hostages already declared dead in the first phase. Sources familiar with the details estimated that if a deal is reached, fallen Israeli soldiers and murdered civilians also will be returned early in the process. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Territorial disagreements concerning the IDF's positioning along the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors also were discussed. Hamas demanded a more significant Israeli withdrawal in the initial phase, while Israel is only willing to consider withdrawal in subsequent negotiation stages. Further disagreements revolve around Hamas' hopes to end the war versus Netanyahu's conflicting statements. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1n5c8vljx	2025-01-02T10:34:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/BJHn7VJ8Jx/BJHn7VJ8Jx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Law enforcement officials identified the man inside the Tesla Cybertruck as Matthew Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army soldier, the Associated Press and other media reported Thursday. Livelsberger was assigned to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and was on approved leave at the time of his death, a U.S. Army official said. The U.S. Army Special Operations Command would not comment on an ongoing investigation, a spokesperson said. Livelsberger had been on active duty from January 2006 to March 2011 and later served in the National Guard and Army Reserve before re-entering active duty in December 2012 as a U.S. Army Special Operations Soldier, according to a U.S. Army official. Hedoes not appear to have a criminal record. He has been linked to addresses in Colorado Springs since 2013.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by00yqpvl1g	2025-01-02T10:04:35-08:00

Despite cease-fire, IDF destroys Hezbollah rocket launchers in so...	IDF said the attack on the medium-range rocket launchers was carried out by the Israeli Air Force under the direction of the Intelligence Directorate only after the Lebanese Army did not respond to a request to neutralize the weapons Israeli Air Force fighter jets destroyed Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers in Lebanese territory Thursday evening, with the direction of the Intelligence Directorate. Arab media outlets reported three attacks in the Jbaa area and Jabal ar-Rihan in southern Lebanon. Watch the footage: There have been reports coming out of Lebanon in recent days of IDF attacks that are being carried out intermittently in the south of the country, but the footage from Thursday evening seems unusual compared to those attacks in recent weeks. An IDF spokesman said in a statement that 'The Israeli Air Force, with the direction of the Intelligence Directorate, struck Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers at a military site belonging to the terrorist organization. Hezbollah rocket launchers adjacent to an additional military site in the area of Nabatieh were also struck..' The IDF Spokesperson's Office also stated: 'As part of the enforcement of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, prior to the strike a request was sent to the Lebanese Armed Forces to neutralize the launchers that posed a threat to Israeli civilians and IDF troops. The launchers were struck only after the request was not addressed by the Lebanese Armed Forces. The IDF continues to act to remove any threat to the State of Israel in accordance with the ceasefire understandings.' Even after the cease-fire began in late November, the IDF continued its ground operations to remove terrorist infrastructure from villages in southern Lebanon. On Saturday, the IDF announced that the 300th Brigade Combat Team, under the command of the 146th Division, together with engineering forces, destroyed a 100-meter-long underground tunnel leading to a Radwan force position. 'With the assistance of the Yahalom Unit, who investigated and cleared the tunnel route of explosives and threats, the troops located rifles, machine guns, anti-tank missiles, and observation systems inside the tunnel. All the equipment was confiscated and destroyed, as well as the underground tunnel route itself. An anti-tank missile stockpile and heavy machine gun positions aimed at IDF posts were also found in the vicinity of the tunnel,' according to the IDF. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The underground tunnel route also led to a Hezbollah command center containing rocket launchers which had been used to fire at Israel during the war, along with a large number of explosives,' the tunnel also said. Hezbollah's representative in the Lebanese parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, said a week ago that 'after the cease-fire, the Israeli enemy is trying to take advantage of the opportunity and implement some of its plans in the border villages through destruction and attacks. The responsibility lies with the State of Lebanon, the Monitoring Committee (established after the cease-fire agreement), UNIFIL, the Lebanese Army, and the countries that took part in the agreement. We are monitoring this every day with the authorities. We, the people of the south, the resistance, the dahieh, the Al-Baqaa region, and Hezbollah's surroundings - we have never needed proof that the resistance is nationally necessary.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ud9uelkx	2025-01-02T09:54:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/S1mc0rNUkg/S1mc0rNUkg_0_312_720_405_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah launches 'reconstruction campaign' with Iranian backing	Terror group announces start of official efforts to fix war damages of in southern Lebanon while thanking Tehran for its extensive funding of the project; Iraq and Yemen also provided support; Among the benefits: $400 for each displaced family, $8,000 for furniture, and an annual allowance for rent On December 5, Hezbollah's Secretary-General Naim Qassem delivered a relatively brief televised speech lasting about half an hour that was meant to give hope to the average Lebanese citizen suffering from the lastest war with Israel. Behind him, on a blue backdrop, was a portrait of the terror group’s former leader Hassan Nasrallah, accompanied by the slogan 'Promise and Commitment - The Reconstruction Campaign,' a campaign aimed at assisting Lebanese residents whose homes were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. During the speech, which followed the implementation of the cease-fire on the Lebanon border, Qassem expressed gratitude to those who hosted displaced Lebanese individuals during the conflict and to various parties that supported the government and citizens. 'We thank Iran, under [Ali] Khamenei's leadership, its government, its people and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for providing this generous aid,' he said. He announced Hezbollah's decision to grant displaced families financial aid ranging between $300 and $400 and elaborated on the reconstruction campaign. 'If a home was completely destroyed and served as the primary residence, the owner will receive $8,000 for furnishing a new home and $6,000 for one year's rent if they reside in Beirut or the Dahieh district. Outside Beirut, the rental aid amounts to $4,000 annually.' Qassem thanked Tehran, 'as most of this funding was provided by them,' as well as support from Iraq and Yemen. He called on 'Arab brothers and friendly countries to assist in the reconstruction.' According to a Lebanese report, however, only Iran appeared to have answered his call. Lebanese outlet Al-Diyar reported on Wednesday that Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati informed the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea that Iran was the only country offering reconstruction aid. According to the report, he advised the ambassador not to obstruct the process, asserting that the funds would reach Hezbollah via other channels if they weren't processed by the state. Shea reportedly promised to present the matter to American officials. In recent months, numerous reports have surfaced about aid shipments arriving in Lebanon from various countries, though these don’t appear to involve reconstruction efforts. It seems that Iran, despite its own need for donations, is the primary donor to the reconstruction efforts which Hezbollah officials claim are progressing. Diplomats commented on the reconstruction issue, telling Lebanon's Al-Jadeed outlet that Arab countries including Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in aiding reconstruction efforts but won’t transfer funds without oversight or control. Hezbollah's Deputy Executive Council Chair Ali Daamoush addressed the stages of the reconstruction campaign this week, saying: 'The secretary-general established a committee tasked with supervising the reconstruction.' 'Technical teams are conducting surveys in affected areas, prioritizing families whose homes were completely or partially destroyed and allowing them to return as quickly as possible,' he added. 'To our people along the border, we say: We will rebuild the villages. Aid will promptly reach everyone in need.' 'I assure the people that the funds for the reconstruction are secured,' he promised. 'Misleading campaigns will not shake public trust in the resistance — the funding is guaranteed by the Iranian people, who extended a helping hand to the Lebanese people. Thanks to Khamenei for his love and affection for Lebanon. Thanks to Iran, its citizens and its leadership, as well as to Iraq's leadership and people and to all nations willing to assist in reconstruction.' 'The project has begun and we will complete it. We’ll return to our homes with our heads held high. We’re demonstrating the victory of reconstruction over destruction and the triumph of resistance over aggression. Those who doubted Hezbollah's ability to compensate the victims were mistaken,' he concluded. Hezbollah's Deputy Political Council Chair Mahmoud Komati also addressed the reconstruction campaign this week, stressing the terror organization's dedication to it. 'There are red lines we won’t allow to be crossed, including the resistance's weapons, finances, reconstruction and shelter,' he said. 'We don't want the help of anyone offering aid to Lebanon with conditions that affect the resistance. The residents of southern Lebanon will return to their homes and no one will stop them. We pledged patience for 60 days. The 61st day will be different,' he warned. 'The situation will change, existing forces will be treated as occupiers and we will address them accordingly.' Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese outlet Al-Manar has been covering the reconstruction campaign extensively, documenting the distribution of funds and providing updates on its progress. Over the weekend, the channel's website reported that Hezbollah's real estate organization, Jihad al-Binaa ('Jihad of Construction'), identified 185,000 damaged housing units. 'The Jihad al-Binaa Development Fund, in line with Hezbollah and Nasrallah's promise, continued its efforts to identify structures damaged by Israeli aggression through its teams, swiftly working to restore residents to their homes,' the report read. An accompanying graphic shared on the channel's X account detailed the affected buildings' locations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even before Naim Qassem's speech earlier this month, the UK-based Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat reported on Iranian support for reconstruction. The report mentioned the reopening of Hezbollah's bank, Al-Qard al-Hassan, while a Hezbollah source clarified that reconstruction and housing subsidies would not come from the bank's funds, but from Iranian money recently delivered to Hezbollah. According to the source, Iran transferred $1 billion to Hezbollah via a regional state on the first day of the cease-fire with Israel, which then began assessing damages in preparation for compensation payments. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sku7aqeuye	2025-01-02T08:13:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/BJfMFXE8ye/BJfMFXE8ye_0_0_649_366_0_small.jpg

Finland power grid operator asks court to seize tanker over cable...	Finland's national power grid operator said on Thursday it had asked a Helsinki court to seize the Eagle S oil tanker in a bid to secure the company's claim for damages related to the breakdown of the undersea Estlink 2 electricity interconnector. The cable between Finland and Estonia was damaged on Dec. 25 along with four telecoms lines, and Finnish authorities the next day boarded the tanker, which carries Russian oil, on suspicion that it caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. NATO said last week it would boost its presence in the region. Fingrid said in a statement on Thursday it had asked the Helsinki District Court to formally seize the Eagle S to help secure its financial claim. Finland's customs service has said it believes the Eagle S is part of a shadow fleet of tankers used to circumvent sanctions on Russian oil, and has formally impounded its cargo although the cargo is still on board the ship.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjnlhr4lke	2025-01-02T07:57:54-08:00	
Italy summons Iranian ambassador, demands release of journalist	Italy's foreign ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador on Thursday to demand the immediate release of reporter Cecilia Sala, who was seized in Tehran on Dec. 19 while working under a regular journalistic visa. The ministry said in a statement it had relayed 'serious concern' over Sala's detention and stressed the need for humane treatment and respect for her human rights. The Iranian embassy in Rome later said Sala was being given all the humanitarian care necessary and, for the first time, linked her case to that of an Iranian national, who was arrested last month in Milan at the request of the United States. Italian media have reported that Sala is in solitary confinement in a freezing cold cell with a neon light left on night and day. Her glasses have been confiscated and she has had hardly any contact with the outside world. Iran's official IRNA news agency reported on Monday that Sala had been arrested for 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic'. It gave no further information.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byb0nbnikg	2025-01-02T07:56:33-08:00

Netanyahu released from hospital, but corruption trial testimony ...	Four days after successful prostate surgery, the prime minister was released from Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital; Doctors recommend two-week rest, which may lead to changes in the testimony schedule in the corruption trial against him; 'He still has a recovery period ahead of him' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was released from Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital late Thursday afternoon after undergoing successful prostate surgery on Sunday, and has remained hospitalized since then - although he left the hospital on Wednesday to cast a vote in the Knesset. The hospital said in a statement that 'the prime minister's doctors reported upon his discharge that his condition is stable and he is recovering satisfactorily from the surgery. He still has a recovery period ahead of him. Medical monitoring as necessary after such surgery will continue as usual. Upon his release, the prime minister expressed his 'deep gratitude to the Hadassah specialists and the entire team, to specialists from Assaf Harofeh hospital, and his personal physician, Dr. Zvika Berkowitz, who cared for him with dedication.' Doctors have recommended that Netanyahu spend two weeks recovering and resting at home following the surgery. Therefore, those close to Netanyahu estimate that his defense attorney, Amit Haddad, will file a request with the court to cancel all or part of next week's hearings. Netanyahu and Haddad have not yet made a final decision on the matter. On Tuesday, when the prime minister realized that the coalition did not have a majority to pass the trapped profits law, which is critical to approving the budget, Netanyahu decided to leave the hospital while he was recovering from surgery and vote in favor. In the end, the law was approved by a narrow margin, with, among others, Itamar Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit faction voting against and members of Agudath Israel not participating. The doctors at Hadassah strongly opposed Netanyahu leaving the hospital for the vote, and a doctor at Hadassah told Ynet: 'It's not healthy for him.' His personal physician was present at the plenary session.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1d4mnelje	2025-01-02T06:52:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/B1mq11ObLJl/B1mq11ObLJl_0_75_1280_720_0_small.jpg

In December, the Tesla mogul endorsed the AfD, an anti-immigration, anti-Islamic party labelled as right-wing-extremist by German security services, causing consternation in Berlin, where all other parties have ruled out working with a party they regard as dangerous and undemocratic. A spokesperson for the AfD said on Thursday that party leader Alice Weidel was in touch with Musk's office, but said he could give no further details at present.

How are these Israeli organizations helping drive change for olim...	Eilon Gilad: Making Aliyah is 'essential' for securing Israel's future Making aliyah is a life-changing decision, but according to Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong, it’s also essential for securing Israel’s future. To support new olim, Belong works to remove as many obstacles as possible and ensure they feel embraced. 'We're here to support them with any aspect of their life, whether it's housing, employment, or learning Hebrew,' Gilad told ILTV during its Lights of Hope event. Gilad explained that his organization helps bridge the gap between a new immigrant’s culture and Israeli culture. For example, if someone is looking for housing, Belong will connect them with an Anglo-centric agent to assist. If they’re searching for a job, Belong helps them identify their strengths, refine how they present themselves, and showcase the value they bring as new immigrants. These are just a few of the ways Belong supports olim. Gilad participated in a panel at the event called 'The Light of Community,' which highlighted organizations helping individuals navigate significant life changes. Another organization featured was Nechama and Hatzala, which focuses on supporting Israeli soldiers. For over 15 months, Israel has been at war, and soldiers are struggling in numerous ways. Nechama and Hatzala has stepped up to meet their needs. Nechama and Hatzala is dedicated to making a meaningful impact by providing essential resources and emotional support to those on the frontlines. Through their initiatives, they help soldiers face challenges while building connections that strengthen the broader community. Shmulik Moskowitz, board member and co-founder of Nechama and Hatzala, shared how his organization 'brought as much IDF gear as we could' to the country immediately after October 7 to help save lives. Since then, their mission has expanded to include small but meaningful gestures, like delivering ice cream or soup to soldiers on the frontlines. A warm bowl of soup on a cold day can 'warm the hearts' of IDF soldiers, Moskowitz said. 'It is also a symbol of our support.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjijjxn8yx	2025-01-02T05:19:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/HJe8gQNLJl/HJe8gQNLJl_218_0_658_371_0_small.jpg

What Is judo star Peter Paltchik’s real dream?	Peter Paltchik: 'I have a dream that Olympic athletes will not struggle any more' Israeli Olympic medalist Peter Paltchik has one clear dream: that Olympic athletes no longer have to struggle financially. Judo star Paltchik immigrated to Israel with his mother as a baby. At just 23 years old, his mother worked tirelessly to make ends meet, eventually traveling to the U.S. to earn a living. During her absence, Paltchik was raised by his grandparents. It was his grandfather who introduced him to judo. However, Paltchik recalls the early days of his career being incredibly challenging due to the financial strain of pursuing sports full-time. 'It does not matter if you come from a rich family or from a poor family,' Paltchik said. 'At the end of the day, the individual Olympic athlete is poor because he needs to finance himself, he needs to support himself financially. It's flights to training camps, even to some championships, and it's full time – food, psychologists, everything in the first year is the toughest.' To address these challenges, Paltchik recently launched a foundation aimed at supporting athletes across multiple Olympic sports. He described the initiative as the 'light of my life,' adding that he feels like he is 'all of a sudden, able to give back.' The foundation raises funds to provide sports scholarships, helping young athletes achieve their dreams without the financial burdens he faced. 'I have a dream that Olympic athletes will not struggle any more,' Paltchik said. Paltchik was interviewed by ILTV as part of its Lights of Hope event.

What role does higher education have in driving the AI revolution...	Prof. Ami Moyal: Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize teaching and learning in higher education, according to Prof. Ami Moyal of Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv. Moyal highlighted four key roles that higher education institutions can play in this transformation: 1. Training Engineers, Computer Scientists, and Data Scientists Universities must provide education at all levels—bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees—while focusing on research and technology transfer to the industry to develop advanced products. 2. Training Skilled STEM Teachers Higher education must prepare educators who can implement the necessary changes in the classical education system. 3. Providing Lifelong Learning Opportunities 'When engineers enter the industry, they need updates with regards to their skills or areas of knowledge,' Moyal said. 'Academia can play a major role here.' 4. Strengthening Connections with the Education System This includes collaborative courses and partnerships between high school teachers and college professors. Speaking at the Lights of Hope event alongside David Perlmutter, Chairman of the Israeli High-Tech Human Capital Committee, Moyal emphasized the importance of the high-tech sector as Israel’s primary economic growth engine. He stressed that its role in post-war recovery will be critical, ensuring Israel has the human capital needed to sustain growth. This preparation, he said, begins with education—specifically the national STEM education continuum, which feeds the technology workforce both in quality and quantity.

High Court curtails Ben-Gvir’s police oversight powers	Justices uphold law expanding national security minister’s authority over police but issue restrictive interpretation, effectively hollowing it out; 'Once again, the court positions itself as the sovereign, trampling on the will of the voter,' Ben-Gvir protests The High Court of Justice unanimously upheld on Thursday a law that expands National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s authority over police operations but struck down, in a narrow 5-4 decision, a key provision allowing him to delineate general policy on police investigations, ruling it unconstitutional. The majority of justices ruled the clause posed a significant risk to suspects’ rights and failed to meet the legal standards for restricting fundamental rights. A minority dissented, arguing the clause did not violate constitutional principles. The broader legislation, which places police under the government’s authority and requires the police commissioner to follow the minister’s policy guidelines, was upheld. However, the court imposed strict limits, clarifying that the law permits only general policy directives and prohibits any operational interference by the minister. The court emphasized that its interpretation ensures no shift in the balance of power between the government and the police, effectively maintaining the status quo before the law’s enactment. Critics have argued that the law, a cornerstone of the coalition agreements forming the current government, undermines police autonomy and risks politicization. The court’s decision represents a compromise, preserving most of the law while addressing concerns over excessive government control in police investigations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ben-Gvir sharply criticized the ruling, accusing the court of overstepping its authority. 'Once again, the court positions itself as the sovereign, trampling on the will of the voter. This grave decision to neuter the Police Ordinance is designed to strip the minister of his authority and give control of the police to the attorney general and state prosecutor. In a democratic state, the minister in charge sets policy for the police, but the court obviously doesn’t care about that,' he said. Justice Minister Yariv Levin also condemned the ruling, describing it as undemocratic. 'In what other country can judges, who appoint themselves, strike down a law passed by parliament in three readings by a single-vote margin? Only in Israel is democracy being replaced by the rule of a handful of judges,' he said, calling for urgent judicial reforms. The law has faced legal challenges since its passage. A coalition of organizations and Knesset members petitioned the court in January 2023. The petitioners, backed by Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, warned that the law effectively turned Ben-Gvir into a 'super commissioner,' allowing undue political interference in police decision-making. They warned that a politically controlled police force is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. In June 2023, the court issued a conditional order requiring the government to justify the amendments. Baharav-Miara said in January 2024 that Ben-Gvir had overstepped his authority, including directing police actions during public protests. The court later issued an interim injunction barring him from giving operational directives to the police, particularly regarding protest management.

IDF releases official casualty numbers from war: 891 fatalities, ...	Military reports most fatalities in single conflict since Yom Kippur War and expresses concerns with upward trend in suicides, recruiting hundreds of mental health professionals to address crisis The IDF announced Thursday that 891 soldiers have been killed since the Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, marking one of the deadliest conflicts in Israel’s history. The toll includes deaths from combat, accidents and suspected suicides and is the largest since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Of the 891 fatalities, 528 occurred in 2023, with 512 attributed to operational activity. Most deaths happened around October 7, when 329 soldiers were killed, including local rapid-response teams. Another 226 deaths were recorded in 2024. Suicide cases have also surged, with 17 suspected cases in 2023—seven conscripts, four career soldiers and six reservists—compared to 14 in 2022. In 2024, suicides increased to 21 cases, including seven conscripts, two career soldiers and 12 reservists, all men. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Accidental deaths also rose during the war. Nine soldiers died in traffic accidents in 2023, including five on duty and four in civilian incidents. By 2024, 20 more soldiers were killed in traffic accidents, 17 in civilian settings. Operational accidents claimed 65 lives, 60 in Gaza and five in Lebanon, involving incidents such as friendly fire and weapon mishandling. To address the mental health crisis, the IDF has recruited 800 mental health officers, established a new mental health center with clinics nationwide, and expanded psychological support for soldiers, especially combat units. However, challenges remain, particularly in assessing the mental and physical readiness of older reservists, many aged 40-60, returning after years away from service. 'The strain of war has created unprecedented burdens on soldiers, levels we haven’t seen in decades,' an IDF official said, adding that the military expects a long-term rise in mental health challenges as the war ends and combatants transition back to civilian life. The war's toll far surpasses the decade before it, which saw 152 fatalities, including those during the 2014 Gaza war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk6zi1e8ke	2025-01-02T01:24:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/16/B1ELBq00Xm0/B1ELBq00Xm0_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg
As world focus shifts to Gaza, what is happening in Ukraine?	Ukraine’s chief rabbi describes Jewish resilience amid Russian attacks, with many displaced or making Aliyah to Israel; community continues to aid those remaining, providing food, medicine and Hanukkah events for children, elderly and soldiers With global attention focused on the war in Gaza, Ukraine continues to endure relentless Russian attacks, including missile strikes and drone assaults targeting critical infrastructure. 'Just a few minutes ago, Just now a few minutes ago there were a few explosions in Kyiv—ballistic rockets and other missiles,' Ukraine's Chief Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman told Ynet in an interview. He described how daily strikes by Iranian drones have further exacerbated issues with electricity and heating, creating dire conditions as winter sets in. Despite the war, Ukraine’s Jewish community marked Hanukkah with events for children, the elderly and wounded soldiers. 'We continue our obligation to bring light to the people during the war and bring help—humanitarian, spiritual and other kinds to the people in depression and darkness,' Azman said. According to Azman, many members of the Jewish community remain displaced, with some having made Aliyah to Israel, others relocating to Europe, and a few returning to Ukraine, often at great personal risk. 'They risk their lives but prefer to be in their own homes. Most old people live in their apartments even if they hear explosions. That's why we bring them food and medicine,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked whether he feels like the global focus has shifted away from the fighting in Ukraine to the Middle East, Azman highlights a shared threat between Israel and Ukraine, identifying Russia, Iran and North Korea as common adversaries. 'It’s the same enemy, the same evil,' he said, pointing to Iran’s provision of weapons to Hamas and Hezbollah, and Russia’s destructive role in Ukraine. 'I was in the U.S. a few weeks ago and I tried to explain to the administration about the evil of Russia. With this war, they would like to destroy not only Ukraine but help enemies of Israel too.' Azman noted that he saw strong U.S. support for Israel in Washington under the incoming Trump administration but highlighted mixed attitudes toward Ukraine. 'Some of them have problems with this and don't understand the real situation. Some understand but say they have problems and would like not to involve the U.S. in inside problems. I explained that it's not just Ukraine's problem, it's an American interest to support Ukraine because it's the same evil that is against Israel,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjywcimiye	2025-01-02T01:01:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/15/BkZQyNDW1T/BkZQyNDW1T_0_48_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Iran rejects claims of supporting Houthis as Israeli propaganda	Iranian UN ambassador denies accusations of Iranian involvement in Yemen and accuses Israel, US and UK of destabilizing region; he criticizes alleged support for attacks on Yemen and calls for accountability, urging UN to resist 'Israeli propaganda' Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the president of the Security Council this week, rejecting accusations of Iranian involvement in Yemen and accusing Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom of destabilizing the region. 'The unsubstantiated allegations made by the representative of the Israeli regime and supported by its closest ally, the United States, are an obvious attempt to scapegoat Iran to justify their own illegal actions and malicious activities in the region,' Iravani wrote ahead of a Security Council hearing on Yemen's Houthi rebels' recurring attacks on Israel. 'It is not Iran but the belligerent regime of Israel that has relentlessly pursued a policy of provocation and destabilizing activities, which poses a grave threat to peace and security in the region and beyond.' Iravani denied any violation of arms embargoes or involvement in fueling Yemen’s civil war, saying that Iran has 'always adhered to its obligations under international law and the United Nations Charter.' The ambassador accused Israel of targeting Yemen’s sovereignty and infrastructure, including Sanaa airport and the Hodeidah port, which are critical for humanitarian aid delivery. 'These illegal actions, carried out with the direct backing and complicity of the United States and the United Kingdom, constitute egregious violations of the UN Charter and international law, including international humanitarian law,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He further criticized the U.S. and UK for providing 'political cover and military support for Israel’s reckless actions,' adding that such complicity 'has emboldened Israel to act with impunity, fueling regional conflicts and undermining any prospects for lasting peace in Yemen under UN leadership.' Iravani reiterated Iran’s longstanding support for a political resolution to the Yemen conflict, calling for a comprehensive ceasefire, inclusive dialogue, and respect for Yemen’s sovereignty. He also rejected claims of Iranian interference in the Red Sea, calling them 'baseless fabrications designed to inflame tensions and serve as a pretext for further destabilization of the region by the United States and its allies.' The ambassador urged the Security Council not to be influenced by 'Israel’s propaganda,' which he said aims to distract from 'ongoing atrocities and ethnic cleansing' in Gaza. He accused Israel of illegal occupation, aggression and territorial expansion, including 'its recent occupation of over 500 square kilometers of Syrian territory and ongoing illegal occupation of the Syrian Golan.' Iravani concluded by calling on the Security Council to 'act decisively to hold the occupying regime of Israel and its enablers accountable for these grave violations of international law,' warning that failure to do so would undermine trust in the UN’s ability to maintain peace and security. Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said in response 'I’m not surprised the Iranian representative is under pressure after we exposed Iran’s terror machine operating in Yemen. Iran is the last regime that can preach morality—it funds, arms and operates terrorist organizations that ignite the Middle East. We will not be deterred by threats or remain silent in the face of Iranian incitement and lies. While Iran creates chaos and operates terror puppets, we will continue to protect our citizens and confront every threat with determination and strength.' The Houthis consider themselves an integral part of Iran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' alongside Hamas and Hezbollah. Their ideology is encapsulated in the slogan on their flag: 'Allah is the Greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews and Victory to Islam.' In recent years, Iran has significantly increased its support for the Houthi rebels. While the Houthis previously had a modest arsenal, they now possess cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and long-range drones. Estimates suggest the group has around 20,000 fighters. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcyspm8je	2025-01-01T23:28:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/By5CFXhSye/By5CFXhSye_0_73_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Dr. Einat Wilf's three takeaways from 2024	Wilf says Israel is fighting for the idea of Jewish sovereignty, for 'the ability to be masters of our own fate' Israel has just concluded one of the most turbulent years in its history. In 2024, the nation fought a multi-front conflict, facing Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iran, and more. But what lessons can Israel take from this challenging year? Dr. Einat Wilf, a former Knesset member and renowned author, shared her insights with ILTV this week, identifying three key lessons from 2024: 1. Israelis Are Willing to Fight for Their Country 'The first takeaway is that the Israelis are willing to fight, to sacrifice for the State of Israel,' Wilf said. She explained that former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar likely underestimated Israelis’ resolve, believing their dissatisfaction with the government would prevent them from fighting back. Instead, Wilf emphasized, Israelis are not fighting for a specific government or leader but for the principle of Jewish sovereignty. 'They're fighting for the idea of Jewish sovereignty, for the ability to be masters of our own fate. They're not fighting for a particular government or person, and that's why people are willing to fight,' Wilf said. 'To the extent that anyone thought that Israel is a divided society that will not be willing to sacrifice, I think that is clearly gone.' 2. Israel’s Enemies Are Devoted to Its Destruction Wilf stressed that Israel’s enemies remain committed to its destruction. 'We are facing enemies, whether it is the Palestinians in Gaza, but more generally, Hezbollah, who...they don't want a negotiable thing. They're not looking for statehood. They're not looking to achieve something that we can discuss. They want us not to be here, certainly not as a sovereign people,' Wilf said. 3. Israel Has Fallen Short of Its Grand Goals Wilf’s final takeaway is that Israel has failed to achieve its broader objectives for the war. She argued that Israel made a strategic error by framing the war as solely against Hamas, rather than addressing the underlying Palestinian ideology that rejects Jewish self-determination. 'We needed to make clear that the war needs to bring an end to Palestinianism,' Wilf concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkmxuoqu1g	2025-01-01T20:44:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/SJOKwo7LJx/SJOKwo7LJx_38_0_668_376_0_small.jpg

Palestinian sources reported early Thursday that an Israeli strike in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis, designated as a humanitarian zone, killed two individuals, including Mahmoud Salah, Hamas' police commander in the Gaza Strip. According to the reports, another high-ranking Hamas figure, Hussam Shahwan, whose rank is equivalent to brigadier general, was also killed in the attack. In addition, Gaza health officials reported that 11 people were killed in a separate strike on what they described as a 'displaced persons camp.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjdozjquyg	2025-01-01T20:19:10-08:00	
Who is 'Hamas doctor' Hussam Abu Safiya?	Kamal Adwan Hospital is classified as a military hospital under Hamas's Military Medical Services Directorate Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, along with leaders from Amnesty International and other organizations, has called for the release of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya. Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in Gaza, was arrested over the weekend during an IDF raid on the facility. Advocates claim that Abu Safiya is an innocent doctor, vital to providing medical care in the Gaza Strip. But is he? What do we know about his arrest and the allegations against him? Open-source evidence confirms that Abu Safiya holds the rank of colonel in Hamas. According to a statement released by the IDF on Saturday, he was arrested on suspicion of terrorism. The IDF also asserts that Kamal Adwan Hospital was being used as a command and control center by Hamas. What do we know about Kamal Adwan Hospital? During the raid, the IDF arrested 240 individuals, 15 of whom have been confirmed as participants in the October 7 Hamas massacre in Israel. The IDF emphasized that civilians were evacuated from the hospital before the operation began, countering claims that Israel deliberately targeted non-combatants. Additional evidence of Hamas activity at the hospital comes from a Kurdish doctor who volunteered there in the spring. After leaving Gaza, the doctor released a video describing his interactions with Hamas operatives actively operating within the hospital. In December 2023, Israel arrested and interrogated the previous director of Kamal Adwan Hospital. During his interrogation, he admitted that the facility was used by Hamas for storing weapons and housing personnel involved in actions against Israel. Kamal Adwan Hospital is classified as a military hospital under Hamas's Military Medical Services Directorate, distinct from the Hamas-run Health Ministry. This classification was confirmed in a December 2023 CNN report and supported by photographs shared on social media. One photo from 2016 shows the opening of the hospital complex, describing it as 'equipped to serve military personnel in the Ministry of Interior and National Security.' Is Kamal Adwan Hospital Irreplaceable? Contrary to claims that the loss of this facility severely impacts Gaza's healthcare system, COGAT reports that 13 field hospitals and approximately 10 local hospitals continue to operate in the region, providing essential services to the population.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkcngjqljl	2025-01-01T20:16:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/ryJOMVJ8kg/ryJOMVJ8kg_1_614_1024_577_0_small.jpg
After a year of war, what does 2025 hold for Israel?	With a new US administration and changing dynamics across the Middle East, security experts see 2025 as a year of challenges and opportunities alike for Israel As Israel prepares to ring in 2025 after 15 months of war and with 100 hostages still held in Gaza, many Israelis are unsure what the new year will hold. The Media Line asked three security experts about their predictions for Israel in 2025. Researcher Kobi Michael best summarized the consensus: '2025 will not be a less challenging and turbulent year than 2024, but it will be less bloody.' Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy in Tel Aviv, noted that Israel is entering the new year 'in a much better situation' than the previous year. Similarly, Israeli author, thought leader, and former Member of Knesset Einat Wilf told The Media Line that Israel’s enemies are in a worse position than they were one year ago. 'We have been able to recover at least part of our mojo, and people are coming back to see us as the capable, winning nation we are,' she said. 'And we have an incoming U.S. Congress and president that seem very favorable to Israel.' The perception of Israel as a respected regional power that has successfully weakened Iran could be crucial to Israel’s survival and growth in 2025. After the attacks of October 7, 2023, Israel’s regional partners began to perceive Israel as vulnerable. Allied countries in the region, particularly the Abraham Accords countries, had not anticipated Israel being caught off guard by Hamas, suffering such heavy losses, or appearing unprepared to respond. Israel had built a reputation as the region’s leader in countering the threat posed by Iran, and the attacks raised doubts about the value of normalizing ties with Israel. But despite significant challenges and mistakes, Israel’s military strategy ultimately proved effective, Michael said. Israel has had successful military achievements in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria, and mainly with Iran, a country that has now been stripped of many of its capabilities and assets. It is now exposed and in a very embarrassing position. Brig. Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi, founder and chair of the Israel Defense and Security Forum, told The Media Line that Israelis and Jews worldwide perceive Israel as moving toward a decisive victory. Avivi said that the pessimism and anxiety of the war’s earlier days had lifted. 'I see a completely different vibe,' he said. 'People feel we are winning.' He added that with President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, many Israelis feel they will once again have a strong partner in the U.S. A change of administration in the U.S. gives me even more hope. I believe there will be a much more resolute administration that shows leadership, provides moral clarity about who the good and bad guys are, and understands the need for decisive victories on all fronts to pave the way for big visions, like regional and global peace agreements. The majority of Israelis apparently share Avivi’s sentiment. A February poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that nearly two-thirds of respondents believe Trump is better for Israel’s interests than Harris would have been. Last New Year’s, Israel was fewer than three months removed from the attacks of October 7, in which Hamas fighters killed nearly 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in the bloodiest massacre to strike the Jewish people since the Holocaust. By December 2023, 117 hostages had been returned alive to Israel, including 105 in a prisoner exchange deal. At the end of the exchange, more than 130 hostages remained in Gaza. This year holds glimmers of hope that some of the hostages still held by Hamas might return home, although negotiations for a deal between Israel and Hamas appear to be faltering. This week, Israel engaged in a bloody battle against Hamas in the Gazan cities of Beit Lahia and Jabalia, two areas in which it has fought repeatedly in the past. International actors widely condemned this week’s fighting. Israel claims to have destroyed 80% of Hamas’ military infrastructure, but the Israeli military has said it controls only about a third of the Gaza Strip. As such, Hamas still appears to maintain a stronghold in some capacity, even after Israel assassinated several of its key leaders. Avivi said that in 2025, Israel needs to destroy Hamas as a governing and military entity, bring back the hostages, and make sure that a terrorist force is never again able to gain power in Gaza. 'This is achievable in 2025 and will bring a completely new reality into the Gaza Strip,' he said. According to Michael, though, there is 'no real or reasonable probability' for any reconstruction process in Gaza for the next several years. Instead, he warned, Israel may find itself stuck trying to manage the situation—either as an occupying power with temporary military control over the coastal enclave or as an army that withdraws completely, leaving Hamas to reconstitute itself. Michael added that supportive entities such as the U.S., Abraham Accords countries, or European nations are unlikely to enter Gaza until Hamas is eradicated. This challenge will, therefore, rest solely on Israel’s shoulders. Outside of Gaza, Israel faces various military challenges and opportunities in 2025. All three experts who spoke to The Media Line expressed hope for the collapse of the extremist Shiite axis, starting with its leader, Iran. If we are able to act together with the United States and a coalition and deal decisively with Iran’s nuclear sites and military capabilities, this can be a huge change and take out the biggest threat Israel has. Trump has already hinted that he would support an Israeli attack on Iran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. Michael suggested that Trump may even expect such an action before his inauguration on January 20. 'He wants to fight Iran, which is much more vulnerable, and negotiate on his terms to bring Iran to an agreement,' Michael said. He said that such an agreement would be 'much better' than the 2015 Iran deal. Wilf noted that the Iranian people might overthrow their regime, much like the people of Syria did earlier this month. A lot depends on how we handle them. They will be a test for us as to whether we again slide into a kind of comfortable closing of our eyes or will we actually remain vigilant. Developments in Syria pose questions for Israel, Wilf said. 'A lot depends on how we handle them,' she noted. 'They will be a test for us as to whether we again slide into a kind of comfortable closing of our eyes or will we actually remain vigilant.' On one hand, the leader of Syria’s most powerful rebel faction has signaled that his forces do not want a conflict with Israel. On the other hand, Turkey—a country with a president openly hostile toward Israel—is expected to play an active role in the new regime. If Turkey establishes a military presence in Syria, it could increase the likelihood of friction between Israel and Syria, Michael said. Several wild cards remain in Lebanon as well. The cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah, signed on November 27, is technically valid for only 60 days. Hezbollah has repeatedly breached the agreement, and there is little indication that it will hold beyond Trump’s inauguration. Developments in the West Bank are another source of concern for Israel in the new year. Avivi warned of rising extremism in the territories, suggesting that the army will eventually need to shift its focus to the Palestinians living there. Terrorist groups may attempt to mobilize Palestinians in the West Bank as well as Palestinian citizens of Israel to carry out attacks, Avivi said. I sincerely hope that we will not waste the opportunity to really change course both with the Palestinians and Lebanon and make it clear that we will not go back to previous arrangements, Wilf emphasized that much of Israel’s fate remains in its own hands. 'I sincerely hope that we will not waste the opportunity to really change course both with the Palestinians and Lebanon and make it clear that we will not go back to previous arrangements,' she said.

'The ideology and identity of the Palestinians that is obsessed with the nonexistence of Jewish sovereignty on any part of this land has to end,' she said. 'When that ideology dies, we can discuss anything.'

PA bans Qatari network's broadcasts, citing 'incitement and interference in internal affairs,' and freezes its operations following coverage of terror crackdown in Jenin, which PA calls 'incendiary' The Palestinian Authority (PA) officially announced Wednesday its decision to suspend Al Jazeera’s broadcasts and freeze the network’s operations in PA-controlled territories. A ministerial committee comprising the Palestinian Ministries of Culture, Interior and Communications said that the suspension will remain in effect until Al Jazeera rectifies its legal standing. The PA accused the channel of violating Palestinian laws by broadcasting 'provocative content' characterized by 'deception, incitement to rebellion, sabotage and interference in internal Palestinian affairs.' The move follows the Qatari network's critical coverage of PA security forces, particularly during its counterterrorism operation against Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) operatives in the Jenin refugee camp. The channel alleged that PA forces were responsible for the death of a journalism student during clashes, a claim the PA denied, asserting its forces were not present in the area. The PA noted that the student’s brother was a wanted Hamas operative, and she had ties to PIJ and Hamas-affiliated groups. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas condemned the PA’s decision, calling it 'a blatant violation of press freedom' and accusing the PA of silencing dissent. 'This oppressive move is part of a series of arbitrary measures the Palestinian Authority has lately adopted to restrict public rights and freedoms and strengthen its security hold over the Palestinian people,' Hamas said. Last month, PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement banned Al Jazeera’s activities in the West Bank, citing its 'incitement' during coverage of Jenin’s events, particularly against PA security forces. Fatah officials also called on Al Jazeera journalists to resign, accusing the channel of 'destroying the Arab world.' Under the new directive, Al Jazeera staff caught broadcasting from PA territories could face arrest and legal penalties. This decision echoes a similar move by the Israeli government, which previously banned Al Jazeera operations in Israel, citing its broadcasts as a direct threat to national security. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkr19xmlkl	2025-01-01T12:01:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/13/S1cVq9v8p/S1cVq9v8p_0_154_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Experts warn of Israeli intelligence lapses after seized document...	Captured Hamas documents reveal years of meticulous intelligence gathering on Israeli border towns, exposing blind spots in Israel’s security and intelligence efforts that experts say were exploited during the Oct. 7 attack In a recent reveal, Israel’s Channel 12 News exposed documents that were found during the ground operation that showed years of effort on Hamas’ part to gather intelligence about border towns and villages in Israel, including the movements and habits of leading local figures and security officers. Through meticulous information-gathering, Hamas was not only able to execute a surprise offensive but a precise one. 'It was clear for a long time that with the aid of Iran, Hamas had been collecting intelligence methodically and doing so in a professional manner,' Prof. Kobi Michael, a researcher at the Institute of National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, told The Media Line. 'This also shows Israel’s great permeability; it wasn’t too hard of a job.' On Oct. 7, 2023, thousands of Hamas terrorists stormed Israel’s border with Gaza and carried out the largest single-day terrorist attack against the Jewish state. Approximately 1,200 Israelis were killed and thousands more were injured. Hamas took 250 people into captivity, 100 of whom are still being held in Gaza, though many are presumed dead. The attack stunned Israel, and as the shock subsided, many questions were raised about Israel’s preparedness, the extent of the intelligence it had, and what could have been done to prevent such a tragedy. According to the Channel 12 News report, documents and sensitive information were collected for years. Hamas hacked surveillance cameras throughout southern Israel, and the organization managed to infiltrate sensitive systems, allowing them to diligently monitor the movements of critical security figures in the border area. Hamas did an excellent job using OSINT (open-source intelligence) and gained access to CCTV cameras, which are so prevalent today. Together, this was an endless source of intelligence. Since the attack, Israel launched a massive war against Hamas in Gaza. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed while the Israeli army has conducted thousands of airstrikes and a massive ground operation. Israeli troops are still on the ground in Gaza, though to a lesser extent than at the beginning of the war. 'In order for Israel to prevent a terrorist army to exist on its border, it needs full security control in Gaza,' Brig. Gen. (Res.) Amir Avivi, founder of the Israel Defense and Security Forum (IDSF), told The Media Line. 'These abilities, developed by Hamas, grew as a result of Israel’s lack of control on the territory.' Michael added that the Israeli army and its soldiers also lack operational discipline, often disregarding directives about information safety and the usage of social media. The defense establishment was indifferent in a sense. The local authorities also didn’t attach much importance to this issue, and it became a blind spot that widened. Hamas took advantage of the growing blind spot for years. Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, 38 years after it captured the territory from Egyptian hands during the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel maintained control of the border crossings it shared with Gaza and also its airspace and territorial waters through a strict naval blockade. Egyptian soldiers and Hamas operatives manned Gaza’s border with Egypt until Israel took control of the border town of Rafah and the crossing several months ago. 'From 2005 until October 7, with the absence of Israeli presence on the ground, there was an exponential growth of Hamas’ abilities, including its intelligence capabilities,' said Avivi. 'They developed very advanced surveillance systems which are akin to systems the Israeli intelligence holds and also operated human intelligence operations, while significantly hindering Israel’s ability to use human sources to gather intelligence.' Over the decades, the number of work permits fluctuated, often symbiotic with the rise and ease of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. These circumstances demonstrate the complexity of Israel’s relationship with Gaza and the Palestinians. Gaza residents have entered Israel to work since 1967. More work opportunities and higher wages made Israel a lucrative work destination for Palestinians. This trend continued even when Israel disengaged from the territory. This arrangement, together with Israel’s hold on most of Gaza’s borders, meant Israel and the Gaza Strip were still deeply connected, both dependent on each other. For Israel, Palestinians provided cheap labor in certain fields, such as agriculture, in which most Israelis no longer work. For Palestinians, employment in Israel was the key to improving their standard of living in one of the world’s most impoverished territories. Over the decades, the number of work permits fluctuated, often symbiotic with the rise and ease of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. One clear example of this fluctuation was in the days leading up to Hamas’s stunning attack. Days before the war, Gaza residents approached the security fence with Israel, demonstrating against the blockade. In response, Israel barred the entrance of Gaza laborers into the country for a short period. In an attempt to diffuse the tension, Israel then lifted the sanction, allowing Palestinian workers in. However, tensions were not diffused. Instead, war broke out that would change the face of the region. The economic interdependence also exists in the West Bank, territories which Israel also captured in 1967 and refers to as Judea and Samaria. Some of the territories are fully controlled by the Palestinian Authority (PA), Israel fully controls others, and some are under Palestinian civil control and Israeli military hold. In response to the war in Gaza, Israel also drastically reduced the number of Palestinian workers allowed to enter from the West Bank. From over 100,000 workers a day, the number has been lowered to a few thousand, citing Israeli security concerns and the potential for further tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. From Gaza, where the war is ongoing, there has been no entrance of workers since the fighting began. Before Oct. 7, 2023, the Israeli defense establishment and much of the political echelon believed that the entrance of Palestinians to work in Israel, both from Gaza and the West Bank, defused tensions and decreased motivation to engage in terrorism while creating an incentive to maintain the quiet between Israel and the Palestinians. 'This presumption was wrong,' said Michael. 'In Gaza, it didn’t cause Hamas to change its ideology or reduce its motivation to carry out such an attack; it didn’t create a positive impact but also created an intelligence platform for Hamas.' It was clear that work permits for Palestinians would create extensive intelligence for Hamas. According to Avivi, 'It was clear that work permits for Palestinians would create extensive intelligence for Hamas.' Throughout Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank are Palestinians who share familial connections, another vulnerability that is believed to have been used by Hamas in Gaza to collect intelligence in and on Israel. Israeli forces carry out daily raids in the West Bank against terrorist activity, detaining tens of suspects every day, making for a clearer intelligence outlook. Consequently, Israel’s ability to thwart attacks from those territories has been consistently better, and the chances of an attack similar to Oct. 7 being carried out from the West Bank are slimmer, though not non-existent. This is due to the existing familial connections and the current flow of workers into Israel. One cannot rely on technology alone for intelligence, and in the disengagement, Israel lost the critical ability to gather intelligence through human sources. While in Judea and Samaria, Israel has complete freedom to operate and control the arena through massive settlements, in Gaza, this was not possible, making the ability to generate quality intelligence non-existent. Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 made it almost impossible for Israel’s secret service to recruit Palestinian agents. The withdrawal also saw an Israeli commando unit charged with recruiting agents unable to operate from within Gaza. While Israel’s security grip on the West Bank is much stronger than it has been in Gaza, it is not immune from a similar Oct. 7 scenario. 'Israel must presume that the Palestinians are capable of gathering such intelligence on Israel from the West Bank as they did from Gaza, even though Hamas’s capabilities there are much more limited,' said Michael. 'But in the end, geography has little significance in such cases where surveillance cameras can be accessed remotely.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For now, Israel remains in Gaza, with the government vowing to retain control over security matters in the territory indefinitely. With 100 remaining hostages waiting to be released from the hands of Hamas terrorists, making up for years of little intelligence is critical. Israeli intelligence control is therefore increasing, but there are still gaps. There is a lot of intelligence about the hostages, but in order to release them, that is not enough. It is very rare that the operational conditions that allow for rescue operations exist.

Shadow students': Training the next generation of Israeli spies	Using code letters instead of full names, students from across Israel converge at a high school in Katzrin, preparing for future roles in Mossad and Shin Bet—the country’s elite intelligence agencies As early as ninth grade, students destined for Israel's primary intelligence agencies Mossad and Shin Bet are identified and enrolled in the elite Odem program, where they adopt code letters in place of full names. Jointly run by the Defense Ministry, Education Ministry, IDF, Mossad and Shin Bet, the program is described as 'the jewel of leadership in the technological arena,' created by the architects of other elite initiatives for future military recruits like Talpiot and Psagot. The first cohort in the specialized high school that was established in the town of Katzrin in the Golan Heights is now completing matriculation exams, and registration for the next class has begun. Graduates will pursue electrical engineering degrees at the Technion, alongside specialized training, exposure to security forces and participation in cutting-edge technological projects. Following this, they will undertake six years of military service, preparing for leadership roles in technology within the Shin Bet and Mossad. The program aims for gender and geographical equity, with 38% female participants and 40% from northern and southern Israel. The defense establishment seeks to raise both figures to 50%. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Roy Shefer, head of the elite programs division, said the Odem program addresses a critical shortage of technological and managerial talent in Israel’s top security units. 'Instead of waiting until the end of 12th grade for students to reach the required level, Odem begins training in 10th grade, focusing on academics like math, physics and English, as well as leadership skills,' he said. 'The goal,' he explained, 'is to give boys and girls the chance to close gaps, expand technological knowledge and develop personally during a formative stage—before decisions are made and opportunities are closed off.' A., a 12th grader from Kiryat Shmona and a member of Odem’s first graduating class, said the program aligns with his aspirations. 'I want to serve in a meaningful role where my skills can contribute to my country. After October 7, it’s clear how essential this program is. In the Shin Bet and Mossad, you rarely get credit for your actions, and no one may ever know it was you who acted. To me, that’s the beauty of it.' S., a 12th-grade student from a Gaza-border community, echoed those sentiments, tying her ambitions to her upbringing centered on service and Zionism. 'The people behind technological developments saved my life,' she said. 'Even in the current war, the critical role of technology is undeniable. I’ve always wanted to understand the work of those in the shadows and find where I can contribute. My ambition is to be one of them—protecting others quietly, ensuring no one even realizes there was ever a threat.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkxne1xujg	2025-01-01T08:52:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/yk14208247/yk14208247_1_56_1251_705_0_small.jpg

FBI investigates New Orleans shooting and ramming attack as terro...	After hours of conflicting statements, FBI officially announces investigating New Orleans attack that left 10 dead and 35 injured as act of terror; attacker killed, but identity and motives remain unknown; most victims were locals, not tourists The FBI announced Wednesday afternoon that it is investigating a ramming and shooting attack in New Orleans that killed 10 people and injured about 35 others as an act of terrorism. The official statement, which confirmed the attacker had been killed, came after conflicting earlier comments from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who declared the attack a terror incident, and senior FBI official Althea Duncan, who initially said it was not terrorism. The attack began around 3:15 a.m. local time (11:15 a.m. Israel time) on Bourbon Street, a historic road in the heart of New Orleans’ iconic French Quarter, known for its vibrant nightlife and global reputation as a New Year’s Eve celebration hotspot. According to officials, most of the victims were local residents, not tourists. Many had gathered to ring in 2025 when the attacker drove through the area, armed with an assault rifle, wearing a helmet and body armor. Authorities said the suspect fired at victims during the ramming attack and later exited the vehicle, engaging in a gunfight with police. Two officers were injured before the suspect was fatally shot. The attacker’s identity and motives remain unclear. New Orleans Police chief Anne Kirkpatrick described the suspect as 'determined' and said his goal was to 'kill as many people as possible.' CBS News reported that investigators recovered a long rifle at the scene. Mayor Cantrell was quick to call the incident an act of terrorism, while FBI official Duncan initially dismissed it as such, sparking confusion. Analysts explained that the discrepancy likely stemmed from differing definitions of terrorism: while the mayor may have referred to the broad psychological impact of the attack, the FBI adheres to its stricter definition of terrorism as an act of violence committed to advance ideological, political or religious goals, often inspired by foreign terror groups. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Later in the day, the FBI clarified that the incident was being investigated as a potential act of terrorism. Law enforcement officials also reported ongoing efforts to neutralize and safely detonate improvised explosive devices found at the scene hours after the attack. Texas license plate and rental apartment set ablaze Few details are currently known about the attacker. According to reports, the vehicle used in the ramming bore Texas license plates. On the rear of the truck, authorities found a stick or pipe holding a piece of fabric, possibly resembling a flag, which is being examined for potential messages. A security source told The Guardian that the suspect recently stayed in a short-term rental apartment about two miles from the attack site. That apartment caught fire early in the morning, forcing the evacuation of nearby residents amid suspicions it contained explosive devices. CBS News reported that investigators are examining whether the attacker had ties to foreign terror organizations or was inspired by them. Police said that 300 officers had been deployed to secure the New Year’s celebrations in New Orleans, which likely enabled the quick response. Police chief Kirkpatrick said the attacker bypassed barricades to target pedestrians, using a white pickup truck. Authorities declared the incident a mass casualty event and urged residents to avoid the area. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry condemned the attack as 'a horrific act of violence.' The White House said outgoing President Joe Biden is being updated and that he called New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell to offer 'full federal support.' Graphic footage from the scene circulated online, showing injured victims lying on the road. One witness wrote on X that they saw a vehicle accelerating through the crowd, 'knocking people down.' Another woman told local TV station WLWT that she fled the ramming and was saved 'by the grace of God.' She added that several police officers fired at the vehicle before the attacker exited, attempting to stop him. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skgdhj7ukx	2025-01-01T07:37:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/H1IzUTfIJl/H1IzUTfIJl_0_134_800_451_0_small.jpg

One of the riskiest operations': Inside Israel's high-stakes com...	In September, Israeli commandos raided an advanced Iranian underground missile facility near Masyaf, used for precision missile production; troops eliminated guards and retrieved key documents before destroying site with explosives This past September, reports emerged worldwide about an extraordinary IDF commando operation in Syria. During the mission, commando troops raided and destroyed an Iranian missile production facility used by Hezbollah in Masyaf, located in Syria’s Hama province. The world marveled at the operation, which involved landing Israeli forces deep inside Syrian territory, dozens of miles from the border. The commandos not only demolished the facility but also extracted significant intelligence material from it. However, the operation was met with official silence in Israel. Now, nearly four months later, the IDF has detailed the sequence of events during the raid. 'This was one of the most daring and riskiest commando operations the IDF has conducted outside the country in recent years — heroic, high-risk and meticulously planned by the Israeli Air Force,' an official said. 'The operation achieved its objective: neutralizing a critical strategic capability of Iran in Syria, located dozens of kilometers from Israel.' The elite Shaldag unit of the Israeli Air Force carried out the high-risk operation targeting an advanced underground missile facility near Masyaf used by Iranian forces to produce precision missiles for Hezbollah. Supported by dozens of fighter jets, helicopters and drones, the commandos neutralized guards at the facility, known as 'Deep Layer,' before rigging it with explosives and detonating it remotely. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The operation, which deployed ground forces deep in enemy territory, incurred no Israeli casualties. Troops also retrieved key documents from the site. American and Western officials later confirmed to The New York Times that Israeli special forces had rappelled from helicopters during the raid to gather intelligence. The use of ground troops was reportedly necessary due to the mission’s complexity and the need to secure materials from the secret facility. Israel had briefed senior U.S. officials ahead of the operation, which included airstrikes on the facility. On Sunday, U.S. Central Command chief General Michael Kurilla visited the IDF’s Northern Command, where he reviewed Israeli operational plans for Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxhj6f81g	2025-01-01T06:42:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/12/BybbaWQlaA/BybbaWQlaA_0_179_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Tens of thousands in Istanbul protest Gaza war	Tens of thousands of people gathered on Istanbul's Galata Bridge on New Year's Day on Wednesday to express solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Demonstrators waved Turkish and Palestinian flags and chanted 'Free Palestine' in the protest, organized by the National Will Platform, a coalition of more than 300 pro-Palestinian and Islamic groups. Bilal Erdogan, the son of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, addressed the crowd, urging support for Gaza and condemning Israel's actions there. He referred to the recent ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad by rebel forces. 'Muslims in Syria were determined, patient and they achieved victory. After Syria, Gaza will emerge victoriously from the siege,' he said.

Citing security, cost of living and lack of religious freedom, one woman says she has chosen a life in New Zealand where she would not have to live in danger and paycheck to paycheck; child of Israeli parents says knows in her heart her home is here A record-breaking number of Israeli citizens left the country in 2024. Of the 82,700 who have left, only 23,800 returned. Some cited security concerns and the high cost of living as reasons for their decision to leave. At the same time, others have decided to move to Israel and build their lives here. Yael Eltzur, 24, who moved to The Netherlands with her family when she was 13, says she always knew she would be back. 'I came to volunteer last year and that motivated me to move back and work in Israel,' she tells Ynet. 'I had just broken up with my Dutch partner a couple of months earlier and felt our cultural differences played a large part in that. I decided the best thing for me was to build a home in Israel although my parents were less enthusiastic about the idea.' She says the Hamas-led October 7 massacre strengthened her resolve. 'I've always felt that Israel would ultimately be my home but did not have the chance to leave. After October 7, that feeling intensified,' she said. 'I was single, between jobs so the timing was perfect to begin the process.' Eltzur says antisemitism also played a role in her decision. 'Europe feels unsafe for me. Antisemitism is growing and Europeans are not prepared for it. At least in Israel, the IDF is protecting us,' she says, adding that she had missed the local food, culture and society. She has family in Israel as well. 'I am sure I will miss everyone in Holland, but I feel in my heart that here is where I should be. I grew up here and would want to give my children the same childhood.'

Can Israel block a Palestinian State forever?	MK Simcha Rothman: The idea of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict has 'poisoned the minds of the entire world' The idea of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict has 'poisoned the minds of the entire world' and will never solve the conflict, according to MK Simcha Rothman, a member of Israel’s National Religious Party. Speaking to the ILTV News Podcast last week, Rothman called the two-state solution the 'first step toward the destruction of the State of Israel' and vowed to do everything in his power to prevent it. Last month, the Knesset Land of Israel Caucus began promoting the 'Israel Security Law.' This law requires a special majority of at least 80 MKs to approve any agreement involving territorial concessions, including in Judea and Samaria. If enacted, it would effectively block the establishment of a Palestinian state in any future arrangement. This marks the third piece of related legislation introduced since October 7. The first two were passed with overwhelming support. In February, the Knesset approved a resolution sponsored by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state. That resolution specifically targeted the unilateral creation of such a state amid reports of international discussions about recognizing a Palestinian state without a peace agreement with Israel. In July, the Knesset passed another resolution rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state, even as part of a negotiated settlement. This resolution was co-sponsored by coalition and right-wing opposition parties, with backing from Benny Gantz’s centrist National Unity Party. 'The Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state west of Jordan. The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the Land of Israel will pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region,' the resolution stated. Rothman told ILTV that this latest initiative is the 'last leg' in the effort to prevent such a state. The proposed law would ensure that the government cannot cede Jerusalem, territorial waters, or land beyond the Green Line—including Judea, Samaria, or the Jordan Valley—without a referendum or the approval of 80 MKs. 'We want to extend it now that everyone understands the dangers of a Palestinian state, especially so close to our cities and communities,' Rothman explained. 'This protection should also apply to Judea and Samaria, ensuring the State of Israel cannot create a Palestinian state through an agreement or any other means.' This legislative push comes as former U.S. President Donald Trump returns to the White House, with a stated goal of brokering peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Saudi leaders have indicated that progress toward a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for any peace agreement. Rothman, however, dismissed concerns that the legislation would hinder negotiations. 'In any negotiation, you say at the beginning what is not on the table,' he said. 'For Israel, a Palestinian state is not on the table. You can find another solution.' He pointed to numerous alternatives to a two-state solution proposed over the years that could provide Palestinians with rights and autonomy without compromising Israel’s security. Rothman highlighted a recent plan by former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman called 'One Jewish State.' The plan proposes granting Palestinians citizenship or residency in Israel, with civil authority over their daily lives while benefiting from living in Israel. However, it would bar them from voting in national elections, preserving Jewish governance of the State of Israel. Friedman compared this arrangement to the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. 'The peace agreement with the Saudis that we all want will happen when they understand that peace cannot be based on something we see as the destruction of the State of Israel,' Rothman said. 'If you want peace with us, you don’t want to destroy the State of Israel.' He emphasized the importance of preserving Judea and Samaria, calling it the 'biblical heartland' of the country. This region, he said, is where many significant events in the Bible took place, including in ancient Shiloh, Bethel, and Hebron, all of which have deep Jewish religious ties. Rothman argued that fighting for a Jewish state in Israel is meaningless if key locations like Jerusalem and Hebron are abandoned. 'You have less justification to hold Tel Aviv, because Tel Aviv can be built anywhere. But Jerusalem—you cannot build another Jerusalem anywhere else,' he said. 'There is only one Jerusalem. This is important for security reasons, historical justice, and because we are the indigenous people of the land of Israel. We cannot take away our heartland from our land.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1lx11tfujl	2025-01-01T04:24:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/HkIhZ6zUyx/HkIhZ6zUyx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell is calling the New Year'Day mass casualty incident that killed 10 people and injured 30 a 'terrorist attack.' The FBI is investigating what occurred early Wednesday, when a vehicle drove into a crowd on New Orleans' famed Canal and Bourbon Street in the first hours of New Yea's Day. Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's New Orleans field office, said officials were investigating the discovery of at least one suspected improvised explosive device at the scene. Earlier, the New Orleans Police Department said it was responding to a mass casualty incident Wednesday that included fatalities. NOLA Ready advised people to stay away from the area. It said the injured had been taken to five local hospitals. The incident came at 3:15 a.m. toward the end of New Year's celebrations in New Orleans and hours before the kickoff of the Sugar Bowl, a college football quarterfinal held in the city's Superdome, with thousands expected to be in attendance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hylsc3miyg	2025-01-01T04:09:39-08:00

President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia's government and the country's biggest bank, Sberbank, to build cooperation with China in artificial intelligence. Putin's instructions were published on the Kremlin's website on Wednesday, three weeks after he announced that Russia would team up with BRICS partners and other countries to develop AI. He told the government and Sberbank, which is spearheading Russia's AI efforts, to 'ensure further co-operation with the People's Republic of China in technological research and development in the field of artificial intelligence'. Western sanctions intended to restrict Moscow's access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world's major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, severely limiting its AI ambitions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1e0anzl1x	2025-01-01T04:06:40-08:00

Minister Chikli: 'Reading the Bible is also reading the best book that was ever written' Since the October 7 massacre and the ensuing war, Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism has developed several new tools to monitor and forecast antisemitism. However, according to Minister Amichai Chikli, the most effective way to combat antisemitism is through education. 'We need to make sure that young Jews are aware of their Jewish identity, [their] Zionist identity,' Chikli told ILTV during the Lights of Hope virtual event. As part of these efforts, Chikli recently launched Project Aleph Bet in collaboration with the Jewish Federations of North America, UnitEd, and Prizmah. The program focuses on increasing enrollment in Jewish day schools across North America. In addition to this initiative, Chikli emphasized that his ministry is working on several other programs to strengthen connections between Jewish communities outside North America and Israel. 'Because we have the same Torah, because we have similar history, and because we share Jewish values, from the Ten Commandments and on,' Chikli explained, the connection between Jews in Israel and the Diaspora should be natural and strong. 'Reading the Bible is also reading the best book that was ever written. It’s not just religion; it’s far more. It’s history, it’s culture, it’s drama—it’s actually good reading,' he added. 'The Bible is what connects us.'

Can renewable energy revolutionize rural Africa?	Here is how Gigawatt Impact is transforming lives with renewable energy in Africa and beyond Gigawatt Impact is a groundbreaking nonprofit dedicated to scaling renewable energy in the world’s least developed countries and vulnerable rural communities. Gigawatt Impact develops utility-scale, community-based renewable energy projects by leveraging venture philanthropy. These efforts empower communities with financial and environmental independence while addressing racial and economic injustice. The organization was highlighted this week at the Lights of Hope virtual event. The concept began 18 years ago when Co-founder Yosef Abramowitz arrived in Israel’s Arava region, intending to power the area entirely with solar energy during the day. 'It was the same time that the region in the south of Israel got a million-dollar grant from the UJA Federation of Toronto, and it started us off on our journey, which we ended up deploying $400 million of investments there,' Abramowitz recalled. 'It’s the first time I understood some grant money can unlock big investment money.' Today, Abramowitz is using the same model to help transform Africa. 'In a very poor country like Burundi, it’s very hard for investors to get their minds around investing serious money. There’s a lot of risks. So here, the philanthropic community plays a very important role, both in doing some of the studies and the community work, corporate social responsibility programs, the water pump, and other things we’re doing there,' Abramowitz explained. He shared one example: 'We just fired up 200,000 of these bricks. It had six classrooms for 1,400 students, cramming into very few classrooms. So that’s the role of philanthropy. However, our other partners were able to bring in the largest investment in Burundi’s energy history. It wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t have the philanthropic money.' Gigawatt Impact’s initiatives extend beyond Burundi. The organization is also working in Uganda, where Patrick Nzitunga leads its efforts. Many rural communities in Africa lack access to electricity, yet 90% of the population relies on farming as their main source of income. Gigawatt addresses this issue by building power plants, connecting them to the national utility grid, and selling electricity to support these communities. However, Gigawatt’s work goes beyond simply providing electricity. It focuses on empowering rural communities by boosting agricultural productivity. The organization develops community infrastructure centers to ensure energy solutions are tailored to local needs. By tackling challenges like post-harvest losses and the exploitation of farmers by middlemen, Gigawatt enables farmers—especially women—to increase their productivity, income, and overall economic independence. 'This is not about solving poverty in a ‘poor’ country; rather, it’s about addressing systemic barriers and creating opportunities through access to energy and sustainable agricultural practices,' Abramowitz said. 'Gigawatt’s work is transforming rural economies, enhancing livelihoods, and boosting local revenues.' Nzitunga emphasized that the success of these efforts can have a ripple effect across Africa. 'Many rural communities in Africa have similarities so that you can go from Uganda to Rwanda to South Sudan… We believe that the pilot we are doing in Uganda can be easily replicated, and we can raise a revolution in Africa,' he said. Gigawatt Impact’s mission is not limited to Africa—it also has a role in the United States. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund is actively collaborating with Israeli institutions to explore joint research projects and student exchange programs, aiming to advance sustainable agricultural practices. 'Israel really is at the forefront of agro-voltaic plant science and all kinds of agricultural sciences, whether it’s hardware or software,' said Weldon Turner, a co-founder of Gigawatt Impact. Turner added that they are working on initiatives to bring Israeli technology and expertise to the United States. 'The U.S. is the biggest consumer market in the world, and it’s the biggest food consumer market in the world,' he said. 'We do it one step at a time, and I think this is the real opening to provide Israeli technology to move into the United States.'

End of Russian gas to Europe as Ukraine stops pipeline transit	The start of 2025 signals the expiration of the agreement that allowed the transfer of Russian gas through pipelines in Ukraine to the European market, despite three years of war; Europe has already dramatically reduced its dependence on Russian gas, but Slovakia may be affected and Moldova declared a state of emergency Russian gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, marking the end of decades of Moscow's dominance over Europe's energy markets and the final cooperation between Russia and the West after nearly three years of war. Russia's gas firm Gazprom said it had stopped early Wednesday after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement. Russia and the Soviet Union before it have, in the past 50 years, been an inexpensive source of gas for Europe, and Ukraine was a central conduit for its supply. At its height, Russian gas constituted 35% of the European market. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, European countries began depending on alternative sources and its market share dropped to 8% after 2022. The widely expected stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European Union, unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit the bloc's competitiveness. The last remaining EU buyers of Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have arranged an alternative supply. Hungary will keep receiving Russian gas via TurkStream, which runs two pipelines under the Black Sea. Gas deliveries through Ukraine yielded considerable profits for Moscow even after many of the European nations turned to other sources and now Russia stands to lose some $5 billion annually and Kyiv will be out the $800 million in annual revenue from commissions. The latest deal between Ukraine and Russia, which has now expired, was signed in 2020 despite the tensions between the countries after the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbor Moldova which was reliant on the transit flows, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households early on Wednesday. The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the cutoff. 'The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin,' a spokesperson for the Commission said. 'It has been reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) import capacities since 2022.' Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy by buying more piped gas from Norway and LNG from Qatar and the United States. Ukraine, which refused to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already decided to abandon Russian gas. 'We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses,' Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. Cost to both sides Ukraine now faces the loss of some $800 million a year in transit fees from Russia, while Gazprom will lose close to $5 billion in gas sales. Russia and the former Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35%, but the war has all but destroyed that business for Gazprom. The Yamal-Europe pipeline via Belarus has also shut and the Nord Stream route across the Baltic Sea to Germany was blown up in 2022. Combined, the various routes delivered a record-high 201 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to Europe in 2018. Russia shipped about 15 bcm of gas via Ukraine in 2023, down from 65 bcm when the last five-year contract began in 2020.

Cam Israeli training transform pediatric cardiac care in Israel?	Simon Fisher: 'We as Israelis are so proud to be able to make our world a better place' Doctors trained in Israel and living in Tanzania and Zambia joined forces to save the lives of 10 children in Zambia, explained Save a Child’s Heart Executive Director Simon Fisher. Speaking at the Lights of Hope virtual event this week, Fisher detailed a mission to Zambia at the end of 2024. Dr. Godwin Godfrey Sharau of Tanzania and Dr. Mudaniso Kumani Ziwa of Zambia, both trained by Save a Child’s Heart in Israel, worked alongside Tanzanian and Zambian teams to perform life-saving operations. Dr. Lior Sasson, director of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery at Wolfson Medical Center, was also present, observing firsthand the collaboration between two generations of surgeons he had trained in Israel over the past 15 years. 'You should have seen the smile and satisfaction on Dr. Sasson’s face,' Fisher said, 'and the glimmer of hope for these children. We as Israelis are so proud to be able to make our world a better place.' Watch the full Lights of Hope event: Save a Child’s Heart is dedicated to saving the lives of critically ill children suffering from heart disease in countries where access to pediatric cardiac care is limited or nonexistent. Through bringing children to Israel for treatment, conducting medical missions abroad, and training medical professionals, the organization delivers hope to families, communities, and even entire nations. However, Fisher acknowledged the challenges faced since October 7. 'We’ve found ourselves in a very, very difficult situation, and against all odds, Israel is reaching out to the world and showing the better and the best face of Israel—reaching out in a humanitarian way, saving lives, teaching, giving knowledge,' he said. 'And the beauty is, it is not only done by Israelis, but it is done by Israelis in partnership with Tanzanians and in partnership with Zambians,' Fisher added. Dr. Zachias Moonde Muulu, currently in Israel to further his skills in pediatric cardiac surgery, highlighted the stark reality in his home country. 'My country has a population of 20 million people, but for years, there were no heart operations done on children,' he said during the conference. 'When you have a child with a heart problem and you do not have the medical expertise to help your child, there is no hope.' Since 2017, however, Save a Child’s Heart has been conducting operations in Zambia and training local professionals. 'So, I am now coming in as a second-generation surgeon. We have a team that has already been built by Save a Child’s Heart to conduct these operations right from home,' Muulu said. 'And so my coming [to Israel] was a joyful moment. It was not scary… it is a dream come true for me.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrpsqf8ke	2025-01-01T01:48:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/ByjChcz8Jl/ByjChcz8Jl_2_0_798_450_0_small.jpg

Picturesque coastal village of An-Naqoura, home to UNIFIL HQ, was staging ground for Radwan's planned invasion of the Galilee; Each home had munitions, explosives, rockets and its orchards hid launchers aimed at Israel; 'It is impossible to believe peacekeepers saw nothing' IDF forces on Tuesday continued to work to uncover Hezbollah terror infrastructure in the picturesque Shiite village of An-Naqoura on the Israel-Lebanon border, and adjacent to the large UN peacekeepers' base in South Lebanon. There just next to the base, in the village that was home to 5,000 residents before the war, the troops uncovered a trove of armaments. It is a staging ground for what was to be the invasion of the Galilee by Hezbollah's Radwan forces, and the occupation of Nahariya and the surrounding communities. An-Naqoura is a symbol of the failure to implement the 2006 UN Security Council resolution 1701 that ended the Second Lebanon War and that states that UNIFIL peacekeepers were responsible to ensure Hezbollah forces remained north of the Litani River. For years, the Israeli governments and the IDF failed to prevent what had come to light in the recent conflict, all along the frontier, from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the mountains in the east. 'It is impossible to believe that the UN forces did not prevent Hezbollah from amassing so many arms and munitions,' Col. (Res.) Nir Shimri, whose paratroopers have been operating in the village, said. What the military found was no less than incredible. Hezbollah set up one of its largest logistical and strategic bases on the coastal road leading from the border to Tyre and Sidon. The terror group operated alongside the UNIFIL forces that were there to protect the border and maintain stability but did nothing to stop Hezbollah. It is clearly evident that the international force was complicit in its silence, given the scope of Hezbollah's military might, revealed in An-Naqoura and dozens of other villages. 'Nearly every home had storages of military equipment and positions. These were Hezbollah's auxiliary supplies,' Shimri said. The IDF left operations in the village to the later stages of the fighting and after the cease-fire agreement came into effect because of its proximity to the UNIFIL headquarters, where the international committee established to oversee compliance with the agreement has been meeting. In November, eight UNIFIL troops were hurt from a Hezbollah rocket launch and the IDF could not allow such a mishap to be repeated. 'We had to ensure that the fighting against Hezbollah did not pose a danger to the UNIFIL camp,' an IDF commander said. 'He explained that his forces were limited in their use of firepower and had to operate with surgical precision under the gaze of the international forces. 'We had observed significant movement of UNIFIL troops along the coastal road but it appeared that they did nothing to prevent Hezbollah from doing as they will in the village.' In the village orchards, the troops found rocket launchers aimed at Israel. Nearby they found notebooks with markings of targets in northern Israel that they planned to attack. 'The launchers were under cover of the trees and we would not have been able to find them had we not entered the orchards on foot,' one soldier said. He added that the entire area between the villages was dug up with underground tunnels, command centers, weapons storages and trucks loaded with rocket launchers. 'The closer you move toward the UN base and the border, the more ammunition you find and the feeling is that UNIFIL provided cover for Hezbollah,' he said. Inside the village, the troops found explosive devices, RPG rockets and AK47 rifles in homes and yards along with Iranian missiles, anti-tank mortar shells and other weapons ready for use. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'In another world, this village could have been a tourist attraction like villages in Cyprus or Greece,' the commander said. 'You step into a well-to-do home, with expensive marble that you might see in any affluent Israeli neighborhood, and you ask yourself, why use this as infrastructure for terror? It's all so surreal.' On the eve of the cease-fire coming into effect, some in the village believed the residents could return and warned them of undetonated bombs and explosives spread on the ground. But less than three weeks later, the Abbas Awada, the municipal engineer published an angry post on the village's Facebook page, blaming Israel for carrying out a systematic destruction. He said 70% of the village, was destroyed since the cease-fire came into effect after only 35% was damaged before. Awada wrote that he was amazed at the lack of action from UNIFIL to force compliance with the cease-fire and criticized the UN troops for not preventing the damage to his village where their headquarters is located. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skh1600fiyl	2025-01-01T00:57:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/30/r1eS6t00RR/r1eS6t00RR_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Syrian activist predicts: Iran's regime will fall next	Syrian-born activist Rawan Osman: 'It is the beginning of a new Middle East' The Iranian regime will be the next to fall now that Assad’s regime in Syria has been dismantled, according to Syrian-born activist Rawan Osman. Speaking at the Lights of Hope event this week, Osman said, 'The Iranian people deserve better. It breaks my heart that I was able as a Syrian to enjoy this moment of the fall of the monster of the century. But I hope the Iranians will be able to celebrate too.' Osman was part of a panel discussing the future of regional stability. She emphasized the need to support rebel groups, despite her personal aversion to Islamist movements. 'We can handle the situation if a military action is required. But so far, what’s happening is very important,' she said. 'It is the beginning of a new Middle East.'

Report: Negotiations for hostage deal again at impasse as Hamas i...	The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday morning that, according to Arab mediators, negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the release of the hostages have once again reached a dead end. According to the report, this is because the terrorist organization has once again insisted on its demand that Israel commit to an immediate complete cease-fire. It was also reported that the Biden administration has expressed frustration with the situation, and it seems that no deal is expected until Donald Trump enters the White House.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00votz8kl	2025-01-01T00:19:15-08:00

A ‘decisive’ attack on Iran could end the regional war, says Isra...	Brigadier General (Res.) Amir Avivi: 'This coming year is going to be a very defining year, which we hopefully will see the Shia axis falling down' If Israel were to carry out a decisive attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, it could end the regional war, according to Brigadier General (Res.) Amir Avivi, founder and chairman of Habithonistim. 'Some people feel that the U.S. attacking Iran is opening a war,' Avivi said. 'No, it’s closing a war. And therefore it’s crucial to see the U.S. really leading an attack.' Speaking during the Lights of Hope virtual event, Avivi recommended a series of airstrikes lasting up to three days, which he said 'would completely change the Middle East.' 'It’s not just about hitting the head of the snake and bringing down the Shia axis,' he explained. 'It’s what will follow. And what will follow is peace agreements, is normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia,' a move he said would likely also lead to peace with countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan. The Lights of Hope event was designed to provide moments of optimism for a country and people enduring over a year of war. Avivi suggested that the tragedy of October 7 could ultimately pave the way for Israel to build a brighter future. 'This coming year is going to be a very defining year, which we hopefully will see the Shia axis falling down,' Avivi said. Watch the full Lights of Hope event: He envisioned a future where 'Israel will become the Singapore of the world. All the world trade will go through Israel,' accompanied by a path to sovereignty in Judea, Samaria, and the Jordan Valley. Avivi also expressed confidence that within the next one to three years, Israel would find a solution for Gaza. Avivi’s comments were followed by insights from former IDF Spokesperson Jonathan Conricus, now with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, who offered a more cautious perspective. Conricus highlighted the challenges of resolving the Gaza situation. 'Gaza is the area where I am the least optimistic because of the complexity of the challenge, because of how poor, uneducated, extremist, and jihadi the population in Gaza was before the war, and how strong and so many years that Hamas had to brainwash Palestinians in Gaza and therefore create a very, very difficult environment for us to operate,' Conricus said. He also voiced concerns about the ceasefire with Hezbollah, noting that 'it doesn’t provide Israel with real security assurances for people to go back to Northern Israel and for there to be a real security change.' Conricus warned that Hezbollah remains largely intact, with its weapons, personnel, and funding still in place. 'At the end of the day, as long as the Iranian regime exists, Hezbollah will exist,' Conricus concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymymkf8jx	2025-01-01T00:03:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/ByMh7YfIJx/ByMh7YfIJx_57_0_793_446_0_small.jpg

Hanukkah, New Year’s message from Israeli President Isaac Herzog	Herzog: 'In this season that takes us inward, the entire world must project their voices outward and demand, immediately, to bring the hostages home' Shalom, dear friends. From the President's Residence in Jerusalem, from so many different corners of the earth, our hearts connect around the world during these days of Hanukkah to affirm what is most true. In these darkest moments of winter, in an hour of deep grief and longing for all of us, we recall that our light still shines. It is a light that takes so many forms: lights of creativity, lights of connection, lights of progress, lights of peace. They all point to the same truth—against the darkness, evil, and pain, there is so much light, so much beauty for us to acknowledge, to celebrate, and to cultivate. Watch the full Lights of Hope event: We have seen it in countless ways since October 7, that infamous day. We have seen it in the remarkable courage of soldiers and civilians who came forward to defend, protect, and save their fellow citizens. We have seen it in the spirit of generosity, mutual responsibility, and connection that has carried us through—from within Israel and through beautiful acts of friendship and caring in communities around the world. These points of light do not, of course, take away our pain, our agony, or our responsibility. We cannot speak about darkness without thinking about our sisters and brothers still buried deep in the dungeons and tunnels of Gaza. They continue to cry out to us and remind us of our supreme duty: to free them and let them go. In this season that takes us inward, the entire world must project their voices outward and demand, immediately, to bring them home. Now. We cannot be whole without them. This is also a call for the leadership of Israel, the leadership of all the countries around us, and predominantly a call and demand to our enemies, Hamas. The presence of each of you here, my friends, shows clearly that the power of coming together in joint purpose is greater than any attempt to weaken us or divide us. We will stand together against hatred, bias, and antisemitism and stand with our communities in Israel and throughout the world. The State of Israel, with our friends and allies around the world, will rebuild. We will find a path to harness our inner light and spread it to create a kinder, softer world. Yes, we shall overcome. May we shine it together during these eight days of Hanukkah and always.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1io00ozuke	2024-12-31T23:23:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/Hy13YuM81g/Hy13YuM81g_63_0_670_377_0_small.jpg
Who’s running Gaza now?	The ‘Ladies Who Drink’ reflect on Israel this New Year: Lessons from 2024, challenges of today, and hopes for 2025 Israel is struggling to win the war against Hamas, which is regaining strength, particularly in northern Gaza, according to veteran foreign correspondent Linda Gradstein. Gradstein, a reporter for Voice of America, appeared on ILTV’s Insider this week to discuss the past year and the challenges ahead. She joined ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman, who moderates the show, alongside MediaCentral Director Laura Cornfield, freelance photojournalist Laura Ben-David, and strategic communications consultant Robin Sirkin. Gradstein, who has covered the region for decades, noted a significant contrast between Israel’s wars with Hezbollah and Hamas. While Israel’s recent targeted operation against Hezbollah was swift and effective—rendering Hezbollah 'not really a serious military force,' in her words—the war with Hamas lacks a clear resolution. 'The problem is there’s no plan for the day after,' Gradstein explained. 'The government has three options: work with the Palestinian Authority and the international community, take over Gaza permanently, or allow the status quo to continue. Right now, we’re seeing the third option play out, and in that vacuum, Hamas is regaining control.' She added, 'Who’s running Gaza now? Gangs and Hamas. They’re stealing international aid while the people of Gaza suffer.' Cornfield and Ben-David echoed her concerns. Cornfield criticized the lack of unified leadership, saying, 'There’s no one person leading the fight, and it’s a huge detriment. Nobody knows what the endgame is.' Ben-David emphasized that with 100 hostages still in Gaza, Israel cannot claim victory. The Media Battle Off the battlefield, Israel is also losing the information war, Sirkin pointed out. She argued that Israel struggles to counter misinformation effectively on social media. 'We can’t express ourselves in 280 characters,' Sirkin said, while the other side uses passion and soundbites to gain support. Gradstein highlighted another challenge: foreign journalists often lack access to critical information. She noted that the IDF and government agencies like the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) are slow to provide updates, leaving journalists to report incomplete stories. As an Israeli and Jerusalem resident, Gradstein believes the Government Press Office (GPO) could do more to assist journalists. 'I always joke that the GPO should have a desk at the airport with fresh Jaffa orange juice to welcome correspondents,' she said. Cornfield, whose MediaCenteral organization works to provide access for foreign journalists, noted that many of these reporters are 'helicoptered in' with limited knowledge of the region. Additionally, she said, some arrive with preexisting agendas, either their own or dictated by their editors. Reflecting on 2024 The panel, who are close friends and call themselves 'The Ladies Who Drink,' also gathered on New Year’s Eve to share their reflections on heroes, villains, and resolutions for the coming year. Gradstein named Rachel Goldberg Polin, the mother of murdered hostage Hirsh Goldberg, as her hero. 'She has just been a hero in the way she has handled the most horrible, horrible thing that can happen to any parent with incredible grace and incredible love for Israel and love for the Jewish people,' Gradstein said. Hirsh Goldberg was killed as the IDF approached the tunnel where he was held. Ben-David chose the Mossad as her hero, praising its science fiction-level beeper attack against Hezbollah and other counterterrorism efforts that have bolstered Israel’s security. For Cornfield and Sirkin, the villain of the year was social media. 'It’s killing us, our children, and our education,' Cornfield said. 'It’s not just controlling the narrative; it’s controlling the next generation.' A Resolution for Unity As for resolutions, Gradstein believes Israel can learn from the Ladies Who Drink. 'We come from very different backgrounds. We have very different political views. We have very different families. We have very different family situations, and yet we support each other,' she said. 'We champion each other’s successes, we help each other during hard times. 'The State of Israel should be like that,' she continued. 'We should all just relate to each other.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkfltdzlje	2024-12-31T22:15:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/Hkexlx1kLke/Hkexlx1kLke_1_279_2048_1153_0_small.jpg

Since Oct. 7 the US has given Israel $22 billion in military aid	Missiles, precision bombs, attack helicopters and armored vehicles: According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, from the outbreak of the war until August, the US transferred more than 50,000 tons of weapons to Israel. The US has provided Israel with military aid totaling approximately $22 billion since October 7 2023, which the IDF has used for its operations in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria during the war, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). According to the institute's data, between 2019 and 2023, the US supplied about 69% of Israel's weapons, a figure that rose to 78% in the subsequent period. By December 2023, the US had transferred more than 10,000 tons of weapons worth $2.4 billion to Israel, and this number jumped to 50,000 tons by August 2024, carried by hundreds of aircraft and ships. The U.S. has provided Israel with a variety of advanced military equipment, including missiles for the Iron Dome system, precision-guided bombs, CH-53 heavy transport helicopters, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, 155mm artillery shells, bunker-penetrating bombs, and armored vehicles. The institute's data also shows that the revenues of the three Israeli arms manufacturers ranked in the world's top 100 arms companies reached unprecedented levels in 2023 following the war in Gaza, and that their total revenues increased by 15%, totaling $13.6 billion. Revenues for Elbit Systems (ranked 27 in the world), for example, increased by 14%, reaching $5.4 billion. The company reported that between October 2023 and December 2023, it secured contracts worth about $900 million related to the IDF. > Israel Aerospace Industries (ranked 34) reported that 2023 was a record year for the company, with weapons revenues of $4.5 billion - a 15% increase compared to 2022. It increased the production rate to meet the IDF's demand for armaments, and accelerated the development of new systems. Rafael (ranked 42) also reported record sales and orders. In 2023, the company's arms revenue reached $3.7 billion, a 16% increase compared to the previous year. The company produces weapons essential to Israel's military strategy, such as missiles for the Iron Dome and David's Sling air defense systems. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqd2lgl1e	2024-12-31T21:29:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/01/SyP5BfbY9T/SyP5BfbY9T_0_94_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Knesset considers bill favoring crime victims’ rehabilitation nee...	Proposed law allows victims to voice their position in person before the early release of offenders, requires parole boards to weigh the impact of release on victims’ recovery alongside offenders’ rehabilitation The Knesset's Constitution, Law, Justice Committee began preparing on Tuesday for the first reading of a proposed law that would allow crime victims to express their opinions orally before the early release of the offender who harmed them. According to the proposal, initiated by opposition lawmaker Chili Tropper, the parole board would be required to consider the impact of the release on the victim's rehabilitation process. 'This law is intended to improve the current situation,' Tropper explained during the committee discussion. 'Today, the parole board is required to consider the rehabilitation prospects of the inmate but is not required to take into account the rehabilitation of the victim, who, from their perspective, carries scars that do not fade over time. It is important to consider the state of the victims even after the offender has served their sentence in prison and before their release, as part of the significant considerations the committee must weigh when making its decision.' 'There is an anomaly in the law, as until now, victims could send a letter detailing the implications of the early release, but the board was not required to consider it,' committee chair Simcha Rotman said. Adv. Noa Brodsky Levi, from the legal advisory team to the committee said the bill would outline the considerations that the parole board must weigh, including risks to the public, the inmate's family, and the behavior of the inmate in prison. 'Under certain circumstances, the board is allowed to consider additional factors,' he said. 'The Crime Victims’ Rights Law allows the victim to submit a written statement to the parole board, and in practice, the board sometimes permits the victim to appear in person, but the law does not mandate this. The proposed law would add the impact of early release on the victim to the board's considerations and allow the victim to express their opinion orally as well.' 'It’s important to express the victim's outcry' A harrowing testimony was heard in the committee from Shari Golan, one of the victims of sex offender Alon Kastiel: 'Every time I wanted to speak at the parole board, I went through a difficult ordeal. The inmate's position is automatically heard orally, but we, the victims, are not heard.' Golan described how she was required to submit letters from psychological and medical professionals and how her ability to speak was dependent on the inmate's consent to leave the hearing. 'In 2022, with the final release of the serial offender, all the victims were given only 22 hours' notice to appear,' she said. 'They couldn’t submit their opinions or come to speak. I fought to speak, and even then, they asked the man who raped me and locked me in a storeroom for his permission to leave the hearing. I feel it’s important to express the victim's outcry, whose cries are not heard during the first offense.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Public Defender's Office expressed reservations about the proposal, with Adv. Gil Shapira pointing to implementation difficulties and budgetary implications, while also raising the issue of overcrowding in prisons. 'We’ve been in a state of prison emergency for over a year, exceeding the maximum incarceration capacity,' Shapira said. 'Early release is one of the mechanisms that helps relieve this situation.' Adv. Nili Finkelstein from the Ministry of Justice noted that following challenges raised in the field, an inter-ministerial team led by the judiciary administration was established. 'The Ministerial Committee for Legislation decided to support the component of the proposal concerning the victim's right to express their opinion orally,' she said. 'Expressing this position does not make the victim a party to the process but recognizes them as a significant factor with rights at various stages of the process.' 'The issue of overcrowding and its harm to other inmates is not currently considered a factor, which is strange,' said MK Rothman. In response, MK Tropper stated, 'There’s no problem adding the issue of prison overcrowding during wartime as a consideration—it stands as no contradiction to the impact on the victim.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktdpj118jx	2024-12-31T20:28:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/07/18/S1XC5tM3q/S1XC5tM3q_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel, and the world at large, welcomes 2025	In all of the world's major cities, the new year was welcomed with much fanfare; Here are some photos that showcase how each country 'kissed under the mistletoe', including Israel Around the world, people are saying goodbye to 2024 on Tuesday and welcoming 2025 with celebrations and dazzling fireworks displays. The year 2024, the hottest in recorded history, was overshadowed by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, upheavals in the Middle East and the U.S. presidential election, which concluded with Donald Trump’s victory. As is tradition, the first to count down to the new year were the island nations in the South Pacific. In Kiribati, one of these islands, 2025 began at 12:00 PM (Israel time). An hour later, following Tonga and Samoa, the new year arrived in New Zealand—the first major country to welcome 2025. In Auckland, a spectacular fireworks display lit up the sky above the Sky Tower, the tallest building in the country, drawing massive crowds to witness the celebration. At 2:00 PM, the new year reached Australia’s east coast. In Sydney, the celebrations began early: three hours before midnight, fireworks already illuminated the sky over the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge as part of the city’s main event. Sydney, which proudly calls itself the 'New Year’s Eve Capital of the World,' used nine tons of fireworks for its display. Estimates suggested that over one million people gathered to watch the show in person. Later in the afternoon, the new year will reach countries across Asia, with Japan and South Korea welcoming 2025 at 4:00 PM. As evening turns to night, Europe will count down to midnight and celebrate with cheers and kisses as the clock strikes twelve. Celebrating in Israel as well Parties are underway all over the Holy Land. Here are two examples: In various parts of the world, there is hope to witness the Northern Lights, following a phenomenon in which a solar eruption, or 'solar storm,' intensifies the aurora and extends it to areas farther from the North and South Poles. In the United States, reports suggest that the aurora may be visible in the northern regions of the country. In the UK, it was reported that the lights might be seen in northern England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. A similar phenomenon occurred last May. > And the Americans?.. By Wednesday morning, the new year will arrive in the United States. At 7:00 AM (Israel time), the traditional dropping of the giant crystal ball will take place in Times Square (Where else?..), marking the start of 2025 in America. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rry60jczr	2024-12-31T20:12:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/rJcDdRb8yl/rJcDdRb8yl_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

Former hostage leaves marriage, expecting baby	Months after returning from captivity in Gaza, where she was held for 49 days with her two young daughters, Doron Katz-Asher discovered she was pregnant, which she calls a miracle; Now, in her 8th month, she talks about the hell of Hamas captivity, how much she misses her mother and brother who were killed by the terrorists, and her separation from husband Yoni When the nausea and sensitivity to smells and tastes started, Doron Katz-Asher knew she had to buy a home pregnancy test to confirm the feeling. It was just before the eve of the holiday of Shavuot. 'I went to the self-pay counters,' she says. 'I didn't want to stand in line and have people see that I bought the test. I did the test at home, on the morning of the holiday. When I saw two lines, I told Yoni the news. It was an exciting moment of happiness. I did feel it, but until you see a positive result, you don't know.' The fact you got pregnant after being held captive in harsh conditions is a bit of a miracle, isn't it? 'Yes. I wanted another child even before the war. It didn't happen because we weren't mature. Yoni didn't want to and that's fine, I respected his wishes. It's not easy to be with two little girls and decide to have another child. I understood why he didn't want to, and I also understood why I did.' And after the captivity? 'When I returned from there, I had doubts about whether I really wanted another child. Do I want to bring a child into a world like this or into a family in post-traumatic stress? After all, we've all been through an unimaginable experience here. Am I even capable of it? Is it good for the family? My desire reared its head again a few months after I returned from captivity. I didn't expect it to come so relatively quickly. This is the pregnancy that came after a period of poor nutrition in captivity, drastic weight loss, stress and grief. I'll be honest and say that I didn't even get my period for months. Everything together wasn't in my favor. I was surprised, and it only made me feel like it was the right thing that had to happen. The pregnancy is one of the miracles that happened to me in the last year, alongside the difficult things.' Did you feel you could? 'Yes. I think I'm strong. If I do something, it's a sign that I can do it. For my daughters, Raz (6) and Aviv (4), it will bring a lot of good. They are crazy excited about the birth, which is expected in February, and they are looking forward to it. There is no joy from me with all the complexity of the matter. It will do good for the girls and the whole family.' Katz was released from captivity with her daughters on November 24, 2023, in the first phase of the hostage deal, after 49 days in Gaza. During the kidnapping to Gaza, her mother, the late Efrat Katz, was killed by fire from an Air Force helicopter. Her brother, the late Ravid Katz, a member of Kibbutz Nir Oz's standby security squad, fought to defend the community and was murdered at the age of 51. His body was kidnapped to Gaza and rescued in July. She is already in her eighth month, and has not yet made any special preparations for the birth. She has not bought any clothes or equipment, nor has she asked to know the sex of the fetus. 'Right now, leaving a little mystery is good for me,' she says. 'If I had gotten pregnant before October 7, I would have obviously known the sex of the fetus and I would already have all the baby equipment. In the past, I had to have the clothes folded in drawers, and have lists of all the equipment and what was needed in an Excel file. That doesn't exist now. Something has been released. The need for order and organization no longer drives me. I haven't been to a single baby store yet. I'm also not thinking about names yet. 'This pregnancy is different from previous ones. The body and mind are busy with the hostages. I pray every evening that my late mother's husband, Gadi Mozes, who spent his 80th birthday in captivity, will be able to be in Israel on the day of the birth. In December 2023, Islamic Jihad released a video of Gadi, a sign of life. Since then, we have known nothing.' Didn't choose to be famous A month and a half ago, Yoni Asher, Doron's estranged husband, published a personal and open post on his Facebook account, announcing that he and his wife were separating. My first meeting with Doron, which took place in their beautiful home on a moshav in Sharon, took place just before the announcement of the separation. In our second meeting, Doron pats her stomach, is silent for a moment, and confirms things in a matter-of-fact manner. 'It's true,' she admits, 'Yoni and I decided to break up. It's not easy for me, but I will be okay and the family will be okay. The girls remain in first place for us. However, I choose to keep the circumstances of our separation within the four walls of our home. I am a private person, I did not choose to become a well-known woman in the public eye, it happened out of necessity. At least I still want to keep my personal life to myself and remain as clean as possible in the process. It's not easy for all of us. Life is complex and full of surprises, good and bad, and we have to do our best.' What can you say? 'A breakup is an emotional roller coaster and it's not a pretty thing, but for me, no matter what happened and what happens between us, we are a family, and soon we will become five. That won't change. For the sake of the children, we will always remain a family, with kindness and a smile. Even though it's difficult now, I hope we're headed for a better future.' In her life before October 7, Doron Katz- Asher, 35, was an accountant who worked for the real estate company Api Properties. If all goes well, she is expected to return to her office after maternity leave. Her managers are waiting for her and supporting her throughout this difficult year. 'I tried to go back to work a little bit recently,' she says, 'it was kind of a kick-starting attempt. I came to the office once a week. Can I tell you it was successful? Unfortunately not. I can't concentrate. Returning to a routine of home-work-children when Gadi is in the tunnels is very difficult for me. I try to come once a week. It's meaningful for me to get dressed and leave the house. I hope that after maternity leave things will look different.' Tell me about your feelings during the kidnapping. I was in some kind of emotional disconnect. You just want to stay alive, protect your daughters, and you don't understand that this is the situation you're in. When we got to Gaza, we entered the Hamas headquarters, which had hundreds of people inside. I was wounded and asked for a doctor because I wouldn't stop bleeding, and I lost consciousness twice. Then I saw that Aviv was wounded in the leg. She didn't speak from the shock. 'A car with a man and a woman in it was waiting for us outside, and after a few minutes we arrived at their house. My body was exhausted. I could barely climb the stairs. They brought in their son, who apparently worked as a paramedic, to check on me. He asked to stitch up my wounds, without anesthesia, of course. I didn't know how I would react to the pain, and I asked my daughters to move to the far end of the room, but they were so scared they wouldn't leave me. It made me feel restrained when they stitched up my wounds, despite the excruciating pain.' After 16 days, they were transferred to another place. 'We were woken up in the middle of the night and told to leave quickly, because the IDF announced that it was bombing the house. We went out into the street. It was one of the scariest moments. I was afraid that the girls would speak Hebrew, that they would cry, that something would go wrong and that we would be lynched in the middle of the street.

There we met other hostages, most of whom have already been released today, except for David Cunio. We were there for 33 days in terrible hygienic conditions and extreme hunger. My daughters defecated in the room's wastebasket, because the toilet was locked, we had to knock on the door and girls that age can't help themselves. There was a terrible smell in the room and they were sick several times. Sometimes they brought me something to bring down the fever and sometimes they simply told me to put them under a stream of cold water. They gave us half a pita a day each. I was hungry and the girls cried because they were hungry. I tried to move their sleep until the later hours, because we knew that in the morning there would be no food, so I wanted them to get up in the middle of the day and not feel hungry for many hours.' How did you communicate to your daughters what was happening? 'I told them that we are now with good people who will take care of us, and as soon as we can we will return home. To this day they ask me why Gadi isn't coming home and if all the bad guys are already in prison.' How are they today? 'Aviv and Raz are in a full and good routine of kindergarten, friends, enrichment classes and birthday parties. Everything a normal child does. Acclimating at home took time. It's not that there aren't any difficulties, they talk about the captivity as if it were yesterday. It's present in the house and we don't hide it and sweep it under the rug. They have great mental resilience. Although Aviv was very small, she remembers what wounded her and where she was and the names of the terrorists who guarded us in the hospital. They say, 'My dear, shwaye shwaye (slowly, slowly in Arabic),' and they also write in Arabic sometimes. It doesn't scare me. Today they already speak in the lexicon of 'we were kidnapped,' 'Grandpa Gadi is in Gaza,' 'The bad guys killed Grandma and Uncle Ravid.'' We are just before a new year. What do you wish for yourself? 'I can't wish myself anything good right now. I hope the new year begins with the 100 hostages at home with us, some for rehabilitation and some for burial. Until that happens, we're stuck on October 7. This won't be a new year for me, and it won't be possible to talk about a resurrection.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sjt00ufg8jg	2024-12-31T13:24:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/ByeGG7icB1x/ByeGG7icB1x_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Security cabinet meeting scrapped, Katz to discuss alternatives t...	Netanyahu insists neither Hamas nor Palestinian Authority have governing role in Gaza including distribution of humanitarian aid; official says Israel considering options for governing body Amid the stalemate in negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal, the security cabinet scheduled to meet this week has been postponed until Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recovers from surgery to remove his prostate gland. Defense Minister Israel Katz will convene a meeting with members of the government on Thursday and will discuss the day after the war and an alternative rule of the Strip to Hamas. The obstacles to the talks remain the number of hostages that would be released in the first phase of the deal, with Israel demanding twice as many Israeli captives than Hamas has agreed to free. The terror group claims Israel is demanding the release of soldiers and wounded men although they do not comply with the criteria for the humanitarian exchange. The would agree to hand over bodies of dead hostages if a deal is made. Another major obstacle is the demand to end the war. Security officials warned the government that Hamas was rebuilding its control of Gaza. Hours later a 'senior official' said that according to Netanyahu, even if a deal is made, Israel would return to the fighting in Gaza until it achieves its declared goals. That statement was an Israel admission from the senior official that Israel was heading toward a partial release of hostages that would not include an end to the war as Hamas demands, before all the hostages would be released. The prime minister is in the opinio0n that there can be no plan for the day after the war until all of Hamas's capabilities are destroyed,' the official said adding that there have been discussions in the appropriate forums on the matter.

Lebanon to chose its president two years after Aoun resignation	After Hezbollah suffers defeats in the war against Israel and is weakened politically, the path to electing a president appears clear ending years of political stalemate Lebanon will appoint a new president on January nine two years after the resignation of Michel Aoun and as no agreement could be reached on who should replace him. The Hezbollah insisted on naming the next president, leading the country to a political stalemate. But after the Shiite political party and the terror group that is its military wing, suffered crushing blows in the war against Israel, the path to electing a replacement to Aoun, may be clear. According to Lebanese law, the president must be a member of the Maronite Christian community while the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament from the Shiite sector. A power sharing agreement was devised to ensure Lebanon's 18 recognized religious groups can coexist. Its 128 Parliamentary seats are divided equally between Muslims and Christians and a president must be supported by a two-thirds majority. Aoun who has been out of office since October 2022 said in an interview last week that there was still no agreement and none of the candidates have the majority support. Among the prominent names under consideration is Joseph Aoun, who is currently the chief of the Lebanese military. He is responsible for deploying his forces along the border with Israel, under the cease-fire agreement signed in October. He is considered close to the West and therefore rejected by Hezbollah. Suleiman Frangieh who heads the Marda Party, formerly one of Lebanon's armed militias, is the favored candidate for the Shi'ite group and is also supported by Hezbollah's ally from the Amal Party, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. But after Hezbollah's losses, his chances have reduced. According to a member of parliament for Hezbollah, if Frangieh pulls out of the race, other names may be considered. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Samir Jaja led the Christian militias during Lebanon's years-long civil war. He is opposed to Hezbollah and has been considered a valid candidate fro president before.

After the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Jaja called on Hezbollah to disarm and deliver its weapons to Lebanon's army. 'The game is over,' he said of the terror group. Another recurring candidate is George Huri, a former senior military officer who also served as Lebanon's ambassador to the Vatican. According to reports, he would be acceptable to Berri but is opposed by others. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk5tppw8kg	2024-12-31T11:10:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/BkeiotZU1x/BkeiotZU1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
US imposes sanctions on entities in Iran, Russia over election in...	Iran and Russia have targeted election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns, treasury says The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on entities in Iran and Russia, accusing them of attempting to interfere in the 2024 U.S. election. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement the entities - a subsidiary of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and an organization affiliated with Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) - aimed to 'stoke socio-political tensions and influence the U.S. electorate during the 2024 U.S. election'. 'The Governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns,' Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. 'The United States will remain vigilant against adversaries who would undermine our democracy.' Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York and Russia's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Republican Donald Trump was elected president in November, beating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House. The Treasury said the Cognitive Design Production Center planned influence operations since at least 2023 designed to incite tensions among the electorate on behalf of the IRGC. The Treasury accused the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) of circulating disinformation about candidates in the election as well as directing and subsidizing the creation of deepfakes. The Treasury said CGE also manipulated a video to produce 'baseless accusations concerning a 2024 vice presidential candidate.' It did not specify which candidate was targeted. The Moscow-based center, at the direction of the GRU, used generative AI tools to quickly create disinformation distributed across a network of websites that were designed to look like legitimate news outlets, the Treasury said. It accused the GRU of providing financial support to CGE and a network of U.S.-based facilitators in order to build and maintain its AI-support server and maintain a network of at least 100 websites used in its disinformation operations. CGE's director was also hit with sanctions in Tuesday's action.

IDF seals off Gaza hospital used at terror base	Forces say Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, used as a Hamas terror hub; Over 600 civilians, 240 militants arrested, and 20 killed, on top of weapons, explosives and tunnels found at al-Shifa Hospital during similar operations; world press claims forceful evacuation of innocents The IDF has sealed off the Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya on Tuesday, in an unusual move and amid international criticism after concluding its military operation there over the weekend. In previous instances when Israeli forces raided hospitals in the Gaza Strip, operations were allowed to resume and in the Al Shifa Hospital, Hamas recently carried out extensive renovations. IDF evacuated hundreds of patients and staff from the large medical facility to the Indonesian Hospital, also located in northern Gaza. 'The hospital had become a Hamas terror base. We precisely and carefully evacuated about 600 civilians while thoroughly screening for militants,' said an IDF spokesperson following the takeover of the site last weekend. 'Combat soldiers from the 401st Brigade, operating under the 162nd Brigade and Unit 504, completed a focused counterterrorism operation at Kamal Adwan Hospital, arresting more than 240 militants, eliminated 20, and neutralized powerful explosives planted at the site.' The forces conducting the operation launched a swift and covert raid, surrounding the building located in the heart of the camp in less than an hour. As expected, the operation drew sharp international criticism, with major global newspapers and news outlets extensively covering the event. For example, the BBC headline read: 'Israel forcefully evacuates Gaza Hospital and arrests medical staff.' The report emphasized that the hospital director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, was arrested by Israel on suspicion of being a Hamas operative, 'without providing evidence' against him. The British broadcaster also cited the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health regarding the number of fatalities in the hospital area as of Friday: '50 people, including hospital staff, were killed in airstrikes.' The New York Times reported under the headline: 'IDF forces patients and medical staff to leave hospital in Northern Gaza.' A nurse working at the hospital told the American newspaper that Israeli soldiers instructed female staff and patients to leave the hospital, without immediately giving the same order to the men. > Al-Shifa Medical Center, Gaza's main hospital, which was recently renovated, underwent the most extensive raid during the war. In its vicinity, more than 200 militants were killed, and hundreds more were arrested. In September, five months after Israeli forces left the hospital, the emergency department at the medical center reopened, where hostages had been held and even murdered. The hospital is currently operating partially. Buildings at al-Shifa Hospital were used as emergency assets for the operations headquarters of Hamas' Gaza City Brigade. Additionally, during the fighting, weapons and other equipment were moved to the hospital's underground floors. As part of the IDF's activities in the hospital area, numerous weapons were discovered in the MRI building within the hospital complex, as well as an operational tunnel shaft next to a weapons-laden pickup truck. Furthermore, in the cardiology department, a weapons storage room, ammunition, and an interrogation room were found. In the physiotherapy department, explosive devices were discovered, and in the Qatari building, another explosive device and communication equipment were found. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk7bc9zlkx	2024-12-31T09:27:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/B12FfEkIJl/B12FfEkIJl_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg
Israeli arrested for drug smuggling in Mexico airport	Mexican police arrested 20-year old tourist at Mexico City’s airport for attempting to smuggle 15.4 lbs. of drugs, including cocaine and MDA, in his luggage; suspect was en route to Europe after arriving from Rome Mexican police arrested an Israeli tourist at Mexico City's international airport (AICM) on suspicion of attempting to smuggle approximately 15.4 lbs. of drugs in his suitcases—8.8 lbs. of cocaine and 6.6 lbs. of the stimulant drug MDA (methylenedioxyamphetamine). The Israeli tourist, described in Mexico as a young man in his 20s, was planning to fly to Europe. The drugs were discovered hidden in his suitcases during an X-ray inspection. The tourist had arrived in Mexico on a flight from Rome, but authorities remain uncertain whether the drugs were intended for Italy’s capital or another European city. Photos shared by Mexican customs authorities show two packages wrapped in adhesive tape and filled with pink pills. > In August, indictments were filed against nine individuals for smuggling over 728 lbs. of cocaine, valued at millions, and 6.6 lbs. of methamphetamine from Costa Rica to Israel on two occasions. The drugs were concealed in furniture and a vehicle that were shipped to the Port of Haifa aboard a cargo ship. Five of the suspects were charged with drug importation and trafficking offenses, while four others—members of the same family—were charged with money laundering offenses. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1gwyc11uyg	2024-12-31T08:24:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/B1lY3bDbUJx/B1lY3bDbUJx_0_0_992_558_0_small.jpg
A look at the Israelis spying for Iran in 2024	A dozen cases of espionage include carrying out missions for Iranian handlers in exchange for payment; ynet looks at the suspects and the charges they face They stormed into our lives a few months ago and, like mushrooms after the rain, spies of all ages from all sectors of society have been popping up the length and breadth of the country. Collaborating primarily with Iranian agents, they’ve become weekly Israeli news items. eeeee A judicial system source tells Ynet that, due to the suspected spies’ danger to the public, as soon as the interrogations become public, indictments are filed so as to keep them in judicial custody until the conclusion of legal proceedings. The police then spend months gathering further evidence to build a legal case for sentencing which, for serious espionage offences, ranges from six to 12 years. Ynet's examination reveals that the exceedingly high fees charged by lawyers for espionage cases mean defendants from lower socio-economic backgrounds have been unable to obtain lawyers to represent them and their families are still trying to raise money for their defense. In recent weeks, judges have requesteefd tehat, for cases that need to move forward, lawyers from the Public Defense should be appointed to represent suspects and defendants. Like Eli Feldstein and the NCO, arrested as part of the classified documents affair, the detainees are currently being held in solitary confinement in harsh conditions, unable to talk to their families. In recent weeks, judges have requested that, for cases that need to move forward, lawyers from the Public Defense should be appointed to represent suspects and defendants. Like Eli Feldstein and the NCO, arrested as part of the classified documents affair, the detainees are currently being held in solitary confinement in harsh conditions, unable to talk to their families. Espionage Cells exposed in Israel So Far An espionage cell uncovered this year in its full glory, included a 72-year-old father of four from Ashkelon named Motti Maman, who had always earned is living by questionable means. The affair publicized September 19 of this year, and a spy like Motti Maman, took entire nation by surprise. The same day, the State Attorney filed an indictment against Maman at the Beersheva District Court, charging him with offences against state security by contacting a foreign agent and entering an enemy country without permission. According to the indictment, Maman communicated, on Iranian soil, with local agents operating on behalf of the Islamic Republic’s intelligence agencies. He entered Iran twice and, in meetings with the Iranian agents, discussed the possibility of carrying out terrorist attacks in Israeli territory, partly amid the Ayatollah’s regimes desire to avenge the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Maman is currently held at Shikma Prison in particularly harsh conditions, 'like those of the Nukhba terrorists' according to his lawyer, Eyal Besserglick who, in recent months, has repeatedly appealed to the court to alleviate Maman’s conditions due to his poor health ensuing from his prolonged detainment. In the second case, revealed October 14, indictments were filed against Ramat Gan residents Vladislav Victorsson (30) and his partner, Anna Bernstein (18). Victorsson communicated with an Iranian official and, at the Iranian’s instruction, carried out various missions such as interring money and burning cars for which he even recruited another person alongside his partner Anna. According to the interrogation, at the instruction of the Iranian official, and while aware of his identity, Vladislav carried out various missions including spray-painting graffiti, putting up posters, and burying money. Vladislav even agreed to carry out a mission to assassinate an Israeli public figure by throwing a hand grenade at his house, and made efforts to procure weapons including a sniper-gun, pistols and pepper spray grenades. Victorsson and Bernstein are accused of offences of contact with a foreign agent, vandalism, arson and conspiracy to cause malicious damage. Victorsson is also charged with committing a terrorist act and conspiracy to commit murder. The third case, revealed a week later, October 11, involved seven Israelis who had made Aliya from Azerbaijan, including a father and son, suspected of communicating for two years with Islamic Republic officials. The seven suspects photographed army bases that were also targets in the ballistic missile attack from Iran last month. Some of the seven suspects were caught in the act of following an Israeli official they are suspected of planning to kill. Four days following their arrests, an indictment was filed against the seven suspects from Haifa and the north who include a deserted soldier and two teenage boys. The suspects are: Aziz Nisanov (43) who was the cell leader, his son Yigal Nisan (20), Alexander Sadykov (58), Vyacheslav Gushchin (48), and Yevgeny Yoffe (47), and, as mentioned, two 16- and 17-year-old teenagers whose names cannot be published. The seven are accused of a series of serious security offences. The fourth case, made public October 22, involved the arrest of seven young men aged 19-23 from Beit Zafafa, Jerusalem, on suspicion of carrying out espionage activities for Iran over a several month period. Their chief mission was the assignment of assassinating an Israeli nuclear scientist and an Israeli mayor. The prime suspect is 23-year-old Rami Alian, who admitted that he knew the operator was Iranian, and that he was proud to have been contacted by the agent. Alian was in contact with a foreign agent and was asked to carry out various missions in Israel. He then recruited further members to the cell. The seven suspects claim to have acted for nationalist reasons, but also received money for their deeds. The day after their arrest, they were indicted under the 'aiding the enemy in wartime' clause. The fifth incident, for which an indictment was filed against Asher Binyamin Wiess from Bnei Brak, October 11, for following an Israeli nuclear scientist with the intention of assassinating him at the direction of Iranian agents. He is accused of offences of contact with a foreign agent, conveying information to the enemy and obstruction of justice. According to the indictment, Wiess, at the instruction of the Iranian agent, used a go-pro camera to photograph the scientist’s car and home. The Iranian agent then sent the picture to a young man from East Jerusalem assigned to the assassination. Wiess was indicted two weeks ago. In the detention extension hearing, Wiess said that he was being held in solitary confinement in substandard conditions and that he is not permitted to talk to his family or conduct his prayers as a religious man. Wiess’s family haven’t found him private legal representation at this time. As mentioned, lawyers demand vast sums to represent suspects involved in such incidents, that the family cannot afford. The court extended Wiess’s detention by two weeks and instructed appointing a lawyer from the Public Defense. The sixth incident, also exposed October 31, involves Rafael (32) and Lala Guliyev (29) from Lod, allegedly conducting missions on behalf of the Iranians and recruiting 'Israelis in Israel from Caucasus countries.' GSS and police investigations reveal that Guliyev was recruited by Elshan (Elkhan) Agayev (56), an Azerbaijani-born operator working for Iranian intelligence. The incitement against the Lod couple charges the two with communicating with Iranian agents since 2021 with the purpose of aiding the enemy in a war against Israel and harming state security. According to the indictment, the couple received a cumulative sum of $26,000 and were charged on the day of their arrest. The seventh incident was publicized December 6, over a month later. Tahrir Safadi (21) from Mas'ade on the Golan Heights was charged with serious espionage offences. His father, Bassem Safadi who connected his son with the spies, was also arrested and questioned. Software Engineering student Tahrir was, in recent years, involved in gathering intelligence regarding IDF activities, which was then handed over to Hussam as-Salam Tawfiq Zidan, a Damascus-based journalist working with the Iranian state-owned Al-Alam News Network, who has been working in recent years for the Iranian Quds Force’s Palestine Branch, designed to assist Palestinian organizations promote terrorist activity against Israeli citizens. Artium Zolotrav (33) from Nof Hagalil was arrested as part of the eighth incident on suspicion of committing security offences involving contact with Iranian security officials and carrying out security missions in exchange for money. The Nazareth District Court later indicted him for offences of contact with a foreign agent, arson and vandalism. The security agencies’ investigation reveals that a connection was made as early as this October between Zolotrav and a character known as 'Eliad' who suggested Zolotrav carry out graffiti anti-government spray-painting missions so as to change public perception in Israeli civilian life. During the ninth incident, exposed December 1, Erdler Israel Amoyal, (23) from Jerusalem was arrested for allegedly communicating with Iranian intelligence officials and conducting security missions in Israel at their instruction, in exchange for money. GSS investigations reveal that Amoyal had been communicating with Iranian intelligence officials over social media. It was further learned that he was communicating with a profile using the handle 'Arianna,' who later transferred him to 'John,' who became his handler. The investigation also reveals that, despite Amoyal realizing at the outset of communication that the 'John' was an Iranian agent, he agreed, at his direction, to carry out intelligence-gathering missions that included photographing an address and pray-painting graffiti. Amoyal took photographs of a pamphlet reading 'Making Peace' at various Jerusalem and Tel Aviv locations. He is expected to be indicted at the Jerusalem District Court. In the tenth incident, Mohammed Saadi (19) from Nazareth was indicted on charges of contact with a foreign agent. Saadi was arrested on suspicion of conveying information to Hezbollah officials in wartime. Police and GSS investigations reveal that he had approached Hezbollah several times in recent years and even asked to join its ranks in combat. Saadi also contacted Hezbollah affiliated Al-Manar TV Lebanon, and asked if could provide them with pictures and videos, including during the war. The investigation further reveals that Saada conveyed information regarding locations of missile landings, aircraft movement, and the location of IDF forces.

Australia, New Zealand welcome in 2025	Fireworks lite up the skies in Kiribati, New Zealand, and Australia as the world says goodbye to 2024, a year marked by record heat, wars, and global upheaval Around the world, people are saying goodbye to 2024 on Tuesday and welcoming 2025 with celebrations and dazzling fireworks displays. The year 2024, the hottest in recorded history, was overshadowed by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, upheavals in the Middle East and the U.S. presidential election, which concluded with Donald Trump’s victory. As is tradition, the first to count down to the new year were the island nations in the South Pacific. In Kiribati, one of these islands, 2025 began at 12:00 PM (Israel time). An hour later, following Tonga and Samoa, the new year arrived in New Zealand—the first major country to welcome 2025. In Auckland, a spectacular fireworks display lit up the sky above the Sky Tower, the tallest building in the country, drawing massive crowds to witness the celebration. At 2:00 PM, the new year reached Australia’s east coast. In Sydney, the celebrations began early: three hours before midnight, fireworks already illuminated the sky over the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge as part of the city’s main event. Sydney, which proudly calls itself the 'New Year’s Eve Capital of the World,' used nine tons of fireworks for its display. Estimates suggested that over one million people gathered to watch the show in person. Later in the afternoon, the new year will reach countries across Asia, with Japan and South Korea welcoming 2025 at 4:00 PM. As evening turns to night, Europe will count down to midnight and celebrate with cheers and kisses as the clock strikes twelve. > By Wednesday morning, the new year will arrive in the United States. At 7:00 AM (Israel time), the traditional dropping of the giant crystal ball will take place in Times Square, New York, marking the start of 2025 in America. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byd00lfwike	2024-12-31T06:58:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/rJPbqLW8yx/rJPbqLW8yx_272_381_2366_1332_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu leaves hospital to save coalition bill	Against advice of his doctors, prime minister arrives to cast a critical vote to increase government revenue in 2024 budget; another member of the coalition in mourning for his mother also arrives to support bill Against advice of doctors Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, left his hospital bed to attend a vote in the Knesset that his coalition stood to lose. Netanyahu had surgery on Sunday to remove his prostate gland and was to spend the next days recovering. The vote, part of the coalition's efforts to increase revenue in the 2024 budget, finally passed with a small majority after the prime minister was on hand to cast his vote and another member of his coalition, who was in mourning for his mother, was called in.

The prime minister's private physician accompanied him to the Knesset and later returned with him to hospital. The crisis began when National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said his party would vote against the proposed bill unless his demand for additional funds for his ministry are provided. He was joined by the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party which demanded assurances that a law exempting Haredi men from military service, be advanced. Earlier the coalition approved millions in budgetary allotments to Haredi institutions and West Bank settlements in last minute additions to the budget that were delivered to lawmakers late on Monday night and were therefore not properly reviewed or discussed, despite opposition outrage while funds for reserve soldiers were cut. In total, 5 billion shekel were allotted on the last day of the 2024 budget. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1wncyb8ye	2024-12-31T06:39:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/B1mq11ObLJl/B1mq11ObLJl_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg

You’re almost home': Emotional call between hostage IDF soldier ...	Over a year after her rescue from Gaza, Shin Bet recording reveals operative comforting Ori Magidish in her first moments out of captivity; 'You're brave, one of a kind. Your parents are waiting'; a trembling Magidish softly replies, 'I'm okay' More than a year after her dramatic rescue from captivity in Gaza, a recording of the moments following the release of Israeli soldier Ori Magidish has been made public. The recording, unveiled on Tuesday, highlights the emotional exchange between Magidish and a Shin Bet operative after her rescue during a ground operation in Gaza. Magidish, the first hostage freed during Israel’s October 2023 campaign, was rescued 23 days after being abducted by Hamas terrorists from her post at Nahal Oz, where she served as a lookout. Just four months after her release, Magidish made the decision to re-enlist in the military, joining the Intelligence Corps. In the newly revealed recording, a Shin Bet operative reassures Magidish during the moments after her rescue: 'Ori, dear, you're in good hands. The team got you out—we’re bringing you home. You’re incredible and brave. Well done. Soon, there will be a big hug waiting for you.' Speaking from the operations control room, the operative added, 'Your parents, Chaim and Margalit, are waiting for you. You’re almost home. You’re amazing.' A clearly shaken Magidish responded quietly, 'Yes, I’m okay.' Shin Bet officials explained their decision to assign a female operative to speak with Magidish immediately after her rescue. The operative works in the organization’s Special Operations Division. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Magidish’s remarkable journey led to her being chosen as one of the torchbearers during Israel’s most recent Independence Day ceremony. Before lighting the torch, she dedicated it to her fellow lookouts: 'To my comrades who defended the borders then and continue to protect them now. To all those who made my rescue possible. Even in the darkness I experienced, I knew you would come for me.' Following her release, Magidish spoke about the strength she drew during her time in captivity. 'I believe in God. I knew He was with me and would save me. I prayed every day—not from a prayer book, but from my heart. I felt the presence of my late grandmother, grandfather, and cousin. I clung to their memory and trusted that I would be freed, whether through a deal or a rescue mission. I believed in my country and my army, and that belief gave me strength to keep going.' She also described an unshakable intuition that her rescue was imminent. 'I can’t explain it, but I knew they were coming that day. I knew they wouldn’t leave me behind. I was overwhelmed when I saw them.' Since her release, rumors have swirled about her ordeal, but Magidish has returned to a semblance of normalcy, even resuming military service. Her mother, Maggie, dismissed the speculation, saying: 'Just because she’s not in perfect condition doesn’t mean she’s broken. People have said everything from claiming she was a Shin Bet plant to labeling us a crime family. They even questioned her appearance, asking how her nails could look manicured after captivity.' Acknowledging the challenges, Maggie added, 'Ori is living her life like any young woman her age, but, of course, no one returns from captivity unchanged. She lost friends there... It’s a harsh reality we’re still living because the war continues. But we know we’re incredibly fortunate. What happened to us is nothing short of a miracle.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj00z9wwljx	2024-12-31T04:24:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/08/Skk0ezFMR/Skk0ezFMR_1_366_954_537_0_small.jpg

Drones to Eilat, the Arava and the Golan: A year of daily attacks...	Iran-aligned Iraqi militias launched yearlong drone and missile strikes on Eilat and the Golan, killing 2 Israeli soldiers; framing the attacks as support for Gaza, Israel avoided retaliating in Iraq, leaving the response to the US, which also faced losses Iraq officially announced Monday that pro-Iranian militias operating from its territory have ceased their attacks on Israel, at least for now. From strikes on U.S. bases in retaliation for American support of Israel, to the bombardment of a so-called 'Mossad headquarters' in Kurdistan, the targeting of Eilat as a key site for strikes and a deadly drone attack in the Golan Heights—this is how Iraq’s front in the Iron Swords War unfolded step by step. A ‘proxy war’ against the US The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iranian-backed militias, began their campaign on October 17, 2023, with a series of strikes targeting U.S. bases.

Rockets and drones targeted the Ain al-Assad air base in western Iraq, home to U.S. and foreign troops. The next day, October 18, more than 20 people were injured in a drone attack launched from Iraq on the Al-Tanf base in Syria.

On December 22, 2023, after the IDF published footage of a drone intercepted over Lebanese waters en route to Israel, Iraqi militias claimed responsibility for an attempted attack on the Karish offshore gas platform. The IDF did not confirm who launched the drone, and no damage was reported to the platform. Throughout the war, Iraq’s militias, positioning themselves as an additional front in Iran’s axis against Israel 'in support of Gaza,' issued numerous statements claiming responsibility for alleged drone and cruise missile launches against Israeli targets. They asserted strikes on 'critical sites' in Tel Aviv, Haifa Bay, Ashdod, the Dead Sea and other areas. However, no evidence was provided, and no interceptions or damages were reported.

How did Jimmy Carter go from peacemaker to critic of Israel?	Gerald Steinberg, CEO of NGO Monitor, says former U.S. President Jimmy Carter left behind a complex legacy Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who played a pivotal role in brokering the historic Israel-Egypt peace treaty at Camp David in 1978, left behind a complex legacy, according to Gerald Steinberg, CEO of NGO Monitor. Speaking to ILTV, Steinberg highlighted Carter’s significant contributions to the peace process, which established lasting peace between Israel and Egypt, but also noted the tensions and difficulties Carter faced with Israeli leaders, including Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Rabin. Steinberg also addressed Carter's later criticism of Israel, attributing it to his frustration with Israeli policies and his embrace of Palestinian narratives, which led to strained relationships with Israeli leaders in his post-presidency years.

Yemeni activist: Israel's actions against Houthis help save the r...	Luai Ahmed: 'The Islamic regime in Iran hates Arabs, Muslims, and Yemenis and Lebanese' When Israel targets the Houthis, it is ultimately saving the Yemeni people, according to Luai Ahmed, a Yemeni activist. Speaking to ILTV on Monday, Ahmed explained that many in the Middle East fail to realize the broader benefits of Israel's actions against terrorism. He emphasized that eliminating terrorist threats improves the region as a whole. 'A lot of people think that we should not kill terrorists,' Ahmed said. 'They think we should try to negotiate with them, but Israel has been trying to do that for the longest time and this is the only option that it has right now, is to attack back and defend itself.' Ahmed likened Iran to the head of an octopus, with the Houthis as one of its many tentacles. He underscored how the Islamic regime in Iran manipulates groups like the Houthis to further its agenda. 'The Islamic regime in Iran hates Arabs, Muslims, and Yemenis and Lebanese. They don't care. They're only using us to further their agenda,' Ahmed said. 'Their agenda is Islamic occupation. We see this Islamic occupation in Lebanon, in Yemen, in Gaza, and what they want is exactly what is written in the Houthi slogan: Death to America. Death to Israel. Now, if that is your slogan, death, there is no way that you're going to be able to create a prosperous society.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfryszujx	2024-12-31T01:44:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/HkW11iBbLJl/HkW11iBbLJl_0_0_939_532_0_small.jpg

3 A.M. sirens in central Israel: The growing threat of the Houthi...	Comment: The Houthi problem is not just Israel’s problem, the U.S., U.K. and others should get involved Sirens warning of incoming ballistic missiles have become a nightly reality for millions of Israelis in central Israel over the past week. These attacks come from the Houthis in Yemen—a fanatical group disrupting vital shipping routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since 2023, choking global trade and harming economies worldwide. Yet during the Gaza war, anti-Israel demonstrators in the West have been seen cheering for them on campuses. Why? And who are these Houthis? Who Are the Houthis? The Houthis are a Shia Muslim extremist group in Yemen, founded in the 1990s and led by Abdul Malik al-Houthi. They are notorious for their egregious human rights violations: using child soldiers and child brides, targeting civilians, employing human shields, executing members of the LGBTQ+ community, taking hostages, and enforcing gender apartheid against women. This group is defined by its murderous ideology and oppressive practices. Their official slogan and flag declare: 'Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews.' Backed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Houthis serve as a deadly proxy in Tehran’s campaign of destabilization and occupation throughout the Middle East. The Iranian regime has provided the Houthis with funding, weapons, and resources, enabling them to attack not only their neighbors but also nations far beyond the region—including Israel, the U.S., and the U.K. The Cost of Iranian Backing Iran’s influence plunged Yemen into a brutal civil war, resulting in one of the worst famines in modern history. The Houthis have exacerbated this crisis by using starvation as a deliberate weapon. Thanks to Iranian support, the Houthis have gained unprecedented territory and power, threatening Yemen's government and stability. Since October 7, the Houthis have turned their focus to destroying the State of Israel. They have fired an increasing number of drones and ballistic missiles at Israeli civilians, attacked U.S., U.K., and commercial ships in the Red Sea, and killed British and American soldiers. These attacks, carried out under the guise of 'solidarity' with Palestinians, are cheered on by uninformed college students in the West. A Global Problem Demands a Global Solution The Houthi problem is not just Israel’s problem. That is why the U.S., U.K., and Israeli forces have targeted Houthi strongholds. Despite these efforts, the Houthis remain the last proxy standing in the region. How can a country defeat the Houthis when even bombing them into the Stone Age might not be effective? After all, they already live there. Like Hezbollah and Hamas, Houthi leaders must be targeted, and their capabilities must be eradicated. But the only lasting solution is to cut off the head of the snake: the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian regime is the lifeline of Houthi atrocities and aggression. Eliminating this regime is not just a moral imperative—it’s a strategic necessity. Doing so would restore stability and hope to Yemen, Iran, and the entire Middle East.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1pimh11l1x	2024-12-31T01:15:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/31/yk13657783/yk13657783_59_0_1239_697_0_small.jpg

Putin marks 25 years in power: How the tsar crushed all his rival...	Twenty-five years after Boris Yeltsin named a little-known Vladimir Putin as his successor, the once-perceived puppet has solidified his rule; having stabilized Russia after the chaos of the '90s and built a middle class, Putin remains unchallenged despite setbacks in Ukraine President Vladimir Putin marks 25 years in power on Tuesday—a quarter century as Russia's undisputed leader during turbulent times, shaping not only domestic affairs but also significantly influencing the international arena. Putin's rise to power was unexpected. On December 31, 1999, then-President Boris Yeltsin shocked Russians preparing to celebrate the New Year and the turn of the millennium by announcing his resignation during a brief televised address. As required by Russia's constitution, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who had been in office for just four and a half months and previously served as head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) for 13 months, stepped in as acting president until elections were held a few months later. Given Putin's current status and image, it’s hard to believe that he was a relatively obscure figure at the time—not only to most Russians but also to many within government circles. His rapid ascent was largely due to Yeltsin’s declining health, which severely impacted his ability to govern. As a result, real power was wielded by a group of oligarchs known as 'The Family,' which included Boris Berezovsky, his protégé Roman Abramovich, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Mikhail Gusinsky and others. The arrangement was simple: these oligarchs ensured Yeltsin’s reelection in 1996 by financing his campaign and providing overwhelmingly favorable media coverage, and in return, Yeltsin handed over state assets worth immense fortunes for a fraction of their value. Putin, then known primarily in St. Petersburg—where he worked closely with the city’s liberal rising star mayor Anatoly Sobchak and headed the city’s powerful and lucrative Committee for External Relations—and in security and intelligence circles (the 'siloviki'), caught the attention of 'The Family.' Berezovsky even met with Putin during a family vacation in southwestern France. Putin’s relative anonymity worked to his advantage, as Berezovsky and his associates saw him as a gray, manageable figure they could control behind the scenes, extending the status quo of the Yeltsin era. However, they severely underestimated Putin’s capabilities and his ability to consolidate power, proving their assumption that he would be a puppet to be a grave miscalculation. As acting president, Putin secured a decisive victory in Russia's March 26, 2000, presidential election, winning 53% of the vote against Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov's 29%. Immediately after his election, Putin launched a systematic campaign to dismantle the power of oligarchs, severing their ties to influential positions and subordinating them directly to the Kremlin. His message was clear: those who dared to challenge him politically would face severe consequences, while those who aligned with the Kremlin’s interests could retain significant wealth and business influence. Putin’s crackdown included high-profile cases like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, who was imprisoned for years under charges of corruption and tax evasion—widely seen as politically motivated. This strategy consolidated Putin’s domestic authority and sent a stern warning to other power centers, including regional governors, as the Kremlin took full control over their appointments and elections. These moves centralized power in the Kremlin, eliminating regional and political rivals. Not Navalny, not Prigozhin, not the West: Putin’s unshakable grip Much has changed over the years along the Volga and Moscow rivers. Vladimir Putin has solidified his rule while intensifying domestic measures to crush opposition and enacting restrictive laws that have severely impacted civil society. At the same time, he successfully restored Russia's international standing, which had plummeted during the difficult decade of the 1990s and the economic turmoil following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Putin, largely aided by soaring energy prices during his first decade in power, brought substantial revenue into the state coffers and became associated in the eyes of many Russians with the stabilization of the country and the rise of a middle class earning decent wages and enjoying significantly improved living standards. Over the years, Putin has overcome numerous challenges that could have threatened his regime’s stability. These include large-scale opposition protests in Moscow led by Alexei Navalny following the 2011 parliamentary elections; the Western response to the annexation of Crimea and the ensuing international sanctions; widespread protests—beyond just Moscow and St. Petersburg—against the contentious pension reform of 2018; public outrage over Navalny's death in prison; and the anti-war demonstrations that erupted after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Each wave of public dissent only prompted Putin to tighten his grip further, deploying an increasingly powerful and wide-reaching suppression apparatus. This pattern has become especially evident in today’s Russian atmosphere, shaped by the war and strong anti-Western sentiment. Putin has leveraged the war in Ukraine to completely dismantle the remnants of the Russian opposition, freedom of speech and the fragments of civil society that still existed. As a result of these measures, there is now virtually no genuine internal threat to Putin’s leadership. The last individual who posed a significant challenge was Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led an armed rebellion in June 2023, with his Wagner Group fighters marching toward Moscow. The rebellion was ultimately quashed, and Prigozhin himself was killed two months later in a plane crash. Russia in 2025 is a nation starkly different from the one Vladimir Putin inherited in 2000. While economically and militarily stronger in some respects, the country finds itself in a de facto, albeit undeclared, war with the West—a situation teetering on the brink of direct military confrontation, fueled by the ongoing war in Ukraine. Putin’s decision to escalate the invasion of Ukraine aimed to fundamentally alter Russia’s strategic position and restore the influence lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the reality is far more complex. Russia currently occupies over 18% of Ukrainian territory but has endured severe conventional military losses and suffered staggering casualties. The conflict has brought significant strategic setbacks, including the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, the loss of the European market for Russian oil exports and an increasing dependence on China. Additionally, the war has contributed to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, a shift in Russian priorities that threatens its strategic air and naval bases along Syria’s coastline—a potential blow to Russia’s influence in the region. Despite these challenges, one lesson from Putin's 25 years in power is clear: writing off his regime prematurely is a mistake. Over the years, particularly in the past three, predictions of his imminent downfall have repeatedly emerged from Western commentators and media. Yet, Putin’s centralized, authoritarian and oppressive system—strengthened significantly in the last decade—has proven resilient. As history has shown, as long as Putin remains in good health, his hold on the Kremlin appears unshakable. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ld2zzi1e	2024-12-30T21:34:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/08/08/9411915/9411915_1_596_980_552_0_small.jpg
South Korea court approves arrest of President Yoon in martial la...	A South Korean court gave authorities approval on Tuesday to arrest President Yoon Suk Yeol after he was impeached and suspended from power for imposing martial law, marking the first time that a sitting president of the country has faced arrest. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) confirmed the Seoul Western District Court approved an arrest warrant requested by investigators examining Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law. Yoon is facing investigation on allegations that he was the leader of an insurrection, one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. Separately, his trial on impeachment is being heard at the Constitutional Court. The arrest warrant for an incumbent president is unprecedented, and deepens the political crisis that has engulfed South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. ally. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who took over from Yoon as acting president, has also been impeached by parliament, which is dominated by the opposition.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skswww11lkg	2024-12-30T20:29:39-08:00	
Guatemalan authorities on high alert for Lev Tahor members fleein...	Guatemalan authorities rescued 204 members of the Lev Tahor sect, prompting heightened border security with Mexico to prevent cult leaders from fleeing with children; The extremist sect, accused of abuse and trafficking, has a history of evading justice across multiple countries A week and a half after Guatemalan authorities rescued 204 children, teenagers, and women from the compound of the extremist ultra-Orthodox sect Lev Tahor ('Pure Heart'), security at the border with Mexico has been tightened amid concerns that sect leaders may attempt to flee with children into the neighboring country. The rescued individuals are currently being housed in welfare facilities in Guatemala City. A statement sent by the Guatemalan government to Mexico, said: 'Following the rescue of the minors, it is highly likely that this community will attempt to flee to Mexico, particularly to Chiapas, where this sect previously stayed in 1994. Both nations must remain on high alert and work together to prevent those responsible from escaping.' The statement also warned that, in an effort to 'protect their leaders, sect members may try to cross the border into Mexico illegally and blend in with the thousands of undocumented migrants who attempt to reach the United States every day.' A source in Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, within the Department for Latin America and the Caribbean, stated: 'We are on high alert and closely cooperating with Guatemala. Over the past few days, we’ve held several meetings to coordinate border monitoring.' As part of this joint effort against Lev Tahor, both countries agreed to enhance border inspections. Special police forces in Guatemala and Mexico’s National Guard are reinforcing security along the border. Authorities are taking the threat seriously, as the sect’s leaders have a long history of fleeing justice, making it unsurprising if they were to attempt to seek refuge in Mexico. The children, teenagers and women, who reportedly endured severe abuse, were rescued from the sect’s compound in Santa Rosa on December 20. Santa Rosa is a small town located about 60 miles south of Guatemala City. The rescue operation was part of a broader effort to combat human trafficking. Since its establishment in 1988 in Israel, the Lev Tahor sect has been implicated in forced marriages, human trafficking, and child abuse across several countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania and, more recently, in North Macedonia and Albania since 2022. The sect is also reportedly active in Kurdistan. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In September 2022, Chiapas police, with the support of former Mossad agents, raided the sect’s camp in Tapachula following allegations of child abuse and human trafficking. Several sect leaders were arrested and are now serving lengthy prison sentences in the United States. Lev Tahor adheres to strict dietary rules, requiring all food to meet biblical standards. Members only drink milk they can extract themselves from cows they milk, and they produce their own wine. Children are prohibited from eating sweets and are instead limited to homemade chocolate or natural options like fruit, nuts, and seeds. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylutqgukl	2024-12-30T14:08:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/S111yHb8Bke/S111yHb8Bke_140_11_780_439_0_small.jpg

Taliban say they will close all NGOs employing Afghan women	The Taliban say they will close all national and foreign nongovernmental groups in Afghanistan employing women, the latest crackdown on women's rights since they took power in August 2021. The announcement comes two years after they told NGOs to suspend the employment of Afghan women, allegedly because they didn't wear the Islamic headscarf correctly. In a letter published on X Sunday night, the Economy Ministry warned that failure to comply with the latest order would lead to NGOs losing their license to operate in Afghanistan. Itâ€™s the Talibanâ€™s latest attempt to controlor intervenein NGO activity. Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council heard that an increasing proportion of female Afghan humanitarian workers were prevented from doing their work even though relief work remains essential. According to Tom Fletcher, a senior U.N. official, the proportion of humanitarian organizations reporting that their female or male staff were stopped by the Talibanâ€™s morality policehas also increased. The Taliban deny they are stopping aid agencies from carrying out their work or interfering with their activities. They have already barred women from many jobs and most public spaces, and also excluded them from educationbeyond sixth grade. In another development, the Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzadahas ordered that buildings should not have windows looking into places where a woman might sit or stand. According to a four-clause decree posted on X late Saturday, the order applies to new buildings as well as existing ones. The United Nations also called for a reversal of this restriction, Soto Nino-Martinez said. The decree said windows should not overlook or look into areas like yards or kitchens. Where a window looks into such a space then the person responsible for that property must find a way to obscure this view to â€œremove harm,â€ by installing a wall, fence or screen. Municipalities and other authorities must supervise the construction of new buildings to avoid installing windows that look into or over residential properties, the decree added. A spokesman for the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing was not immediately available for comment on Akhundzadaâ€™s instructions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syngyqxlkl	2024-12-30T13:07:07-08:00	
Blossoming romance between Moscow and Tehran puts Israel, US on e...	As Donald Trump prepares for his inauguration, Russia and Iran are finalizing a strategic partnership agreement that will strengthen ties in defense and nuclear technology; Israeli officials fear the deal could significantly accelerate Iran’s progress toward nuclear weapons capability Just before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his return to the White House on January 20, Russia and Iran are reportedly planning to publicly sign a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. The concern in Israel is that this agreement could lead to the transfer of technology that would assist Iran in developing nuclear weapons. According to reports in Russian media, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is expected to make an official visit to Moscow on January 17, during which he and Russian President Vladimir Putin will sign the agreement, marking a crescendo in the growing closeness between Tehran and Moscow. All this, of course, unfolds against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and the strengthening of the Russia-North Korea-Iran axis, supported by solid Chinese backing. On Thursday, the Iranian Embassy in Moscow confirmed the expected visit of the Iranian president to the Russian capital. In an interview on Sunday with the state news agency Russia Today, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed the anticipated agreement. 'The agreement is intended to legally formalize the unprecedented progress in bilateral relations achieved in recent years and to document their transition to the level of a strategic partnership,' he said. 'Naturally, such a comprehensive document also has an international component,' according to Lavrov. Among other things, it pays special attention to strengthening cooperation for peace and security on regional and global levels and formalizes Moscow and Tehran's desire for closer collaboration in security, defense, counterterrorism and combating extremism, as well as against other common challenges and threats.' Lavrov added that the signing of the agreement 'will open additional opportunities for further expanding the Russian-Iranian partnership in various fields.' An Iranian diplomatic source confirmed to the Russian newspaper Izvestia that the agreement would be signed soon. 'This is a central event in our bilateral relations,' he added. 'We have been working on the agreement for several years. The signing is planned for mid-January. We need this agreement, which will outline the basic principles on which the interaction between our countries is based.' The strategic partnership agreement will have many aspects, but naturally many are focusing on its security dimension, which illustrates the tightening cooperation between the countries against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. Iran is already supplying Russia with short-range ballistic missiles, which Russia uses in its war in Ukraine, and has significantly helped with drones, including assistance in establishing a Russian factory to produce a local version of Iran's Shahed drone. It is highly likely that, as part of the agreement, Tehran will provide Moscow with an upgraded model of drones to aid in continued attacks in Ukraine. One of the key questions that has arisen is what Russia is offering in return for this Iranian assistance. Among other things, there has been talk of accelerating a deal to supply advanced Russian Sukhoi 35 fighter jets to Iran. According to reports in recent months, Iranian pilots have already been trained in Russia to fly the jets as a preparatory stage for their delivery. Russia also is likely to provide Iran with technological knowledge related to missile and military satellite production, along with advanced defense systems like the S-400. However, this is uncertain due to Russia's need for these systems in the ongoing war in Ukraine. One of the most concerning issues for Israel regarding the agreement is Iran's nuclear ambitions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel fears that the agreement could include the transfer of Russian technological knowledge and possibly even critical components for the production of nuclear weapons, including those related to the manufacturing of nuclear warheads. It is clear that any cooperation in this sensitive area would not be publicly declared. However, such a move could bring Iran significantly closer to crossing the nuclear threshold and achieving nuclear capability, something Israel is determined to prevent. Ynet commentator Ron Ben-Yishai notes that the two countries have been negotiating this agreement for over six months, possibly longer. Originally, the idea behind the agreement was to push the Americans out of the region and dismantle the Abraham Accords. But that was over a year ago when Russia and Iran thought that through the Gaza war they would divide the Middle East between them. Today, the situation is entirely different. Iran cannot guarantee Russia control over the Middle East, nor can it produce missiles (due to strikes on its solid fuel facilities). Nevertheless, talks about the agreement have continued, though Russian enthusiasm for it has waned over time. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1vqyteuyl	2024-12-30T13:02:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/07/19/rJ119BI42c/rJ119BI42c_36_39_1473_829_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu believes fighting will resume after hostage deal, senio...	Prime minister asserts that Israel will resume fighting after any hostage deal to fulfill the war’s objectives; Despite partial agreements being considered, Netanyahu insists Hamas must be fully eliminated, highlighting that post-war plans for Gaza depend on Hamas’ total destruction A senior political source responded on Monday afternoon to warnings from top security officials, revealed by Ynet, stating that 'without an alternative to Hamas before a hostage deal, we risk returning to the situation of October 6.' According to the source, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that 'even if Israel enters into a deal, fighting will resume afterward to achieve the war’s objectives.' The source effectively acknowledged that Israel is leaning toward a partial deal that will not include ending the war or withdrawing IDF troops from Gaza — conditions Hamas views as prerequisites for a comprehensive deal. 'The prime minister insists that plans for 'the day after' in Gaza cannot be implemented until Hamas is completely destroyed, along with all its capabilities,' the source said. The source added that 'the issue of 'the day after' in Gaza is being discussed and advanced in appropriate forums, not through biased briefings from those who failed entirely in their assessments. The prime minister is unwilling to accept any reality in which Hamas has a presence in Gaza. Therefore, before addressing the 'day after' scenario, Hamas must first be eliminated, hostages must be returned, and this is the main focus for Israel.' The source also noted: 'The policy being shaped by the prime minister in Gaza is that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority will have civilian control in Gaza, including over the distribution of humanitarian aid. As a result, the security establishment is exploring various alternatives. Disconnecting Hamas from humanitarian aid is intended to strip the terrorist organization of its control over the Gazan population and to promote progress in hostage negotiations.' Additionally, the political source stated that 'If the prime minister had heeded calls from his critics back then, terror leaders like Sinwar, Deif, Haniyeh and Nasrallah would still be roaming free; Hamas’ military capabilities would not have been nearly destroyed; and Iran and its terror proxies wouldn’t be struggling to recover from the devastating blow they’ve suffered. Thanks to the prime minister’s determined and thoughtful policies, Israel is achieving significant gains, protecting its security, and will meet all the war’s objectives.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier, senior security officials warned about 'a lack of focus on the 'day after' in Gaza' and the risk of returning to pre-October 7 conditions. These officials, who are well-versed in the political and security situation and support a full or partial cease-fire in the immediate term, cautioned Netanyahu that failing to discuss and decide on governance and civilian control in Gaza after the war would allow Hamas to reestablish administrative control in the region. 'In the absence of an alternative,' the officials said, 'Hamas’ rule will inevitably return. A decision must be made now, before any deal is reached. Even with a 'small' deal, Hamas will regain full control. Without a decision, we risk undermining the war’s achievements and failing to meet one of its main objectives –toppling Hamas.' This position is shared by senior officials in both the IDF and Shin Bet. They argue, contrary to the political leadership, that while Hamas’s military capabilities have been nearly destroyed – despite sporadic rocket launches (with the army noting that Hamas will retain some launch capabilities) – its governance structures remain intact. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjoh5pxu1l	2024-12-30T11:43:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/BysDqScGyg/BysDqScGyg_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

Germany accuses Elon Musk of trying to influence its election	Tycoon and Trump associate expressed support for the Alternative for Germany Party and called on Chancellor Olaf Scholz to resign; This week, he published an article in a German newspaper, and the editor resigned in protest; The coalition and opposition are united against him: 'Musk wants our country to be weak, just like Putin' The German government accused U.S. billionaire Elon Musk on Monday of trying to influence its election set to take place in February with articles supporting the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, even though it suggested they amounted to 'nonsense.' Musk, who is set to serve Donald Trump's new administration as an outside adviser, endorsed the AfD as Germany's last hope in a guest opinion piece for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, prompting the commentary editor to resign in protest. 'It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election' with X posts and the opinion piece, a German government spokesperson said. Musk is free to express his opinion, the spokesperson said, adding: 'After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.' Musk, the world's richest person, has defended his right to weigh in on German politics because of his 'significant investments' and has praised the AfD's approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation. His intervention has come as Germans prepare to vote in a parliamentary election on Feb. 23 after the collapse of the coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk also called for Scholz's resignation after a car rammed into a crowd at a Christmas market on Dec. 20, killing five people. The AfD is currently in second place in opinion polls behind the main opposition conservatives, and might be able to thwart a center-right or center-left majority in the election. Germany's mainstream parties have pledged not to work with the AfD at the national level. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The government spokesperson said Musk's endorsement of the AfD was 'a recommendation to vote for a party that is being monitored (by domestic intelligence) on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and which has already been recognized as partly right-wing extremist.'

Pro-Iran militias in Iraq halt attacks on Israel due to US pressu...	Iraqi militias halt attacks on Israel following pressure from the Iraqi government, U.S., and Iran; Israeli threats and Syria’s instability also contributed to the pause, but the issue may be reignited should a full-scale war erupt between Israel and the Islamic Republic A week after reports emerged that one of the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq had reached an agreement with the Iraqi prime minister to halt military actions against Israel, an official Iraqi confirmation arrived on Monday that the militias have ceased their attacks on Israel – at least for now. Yasser Watout, a member of Iraq’s Parliamentary Security and Defense Committee, told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the halt in militia operations against Israel for more than a month stems from pressure applied by the Iraqi government and Shiite political factions, alongside external threats that Iraq is exposed to. According to him, these pressures aim to distance Iraq from a conflict that could escalate and directly involve the country. 'Iraq has received threats from Israel and the United States due to the activities of the militias, and these threats have been a central reason for stopping their actions,' Watout explained. He also noted that the fall of Assad's regime in Syria contributed to the cessation of militia activities because they could no longer launch attacks from Syrian territory as they had in the past. 'After Assad’s fall, the militias faced significant difficulties in carrying out attacks against Israel. They relied on Syrian territory for their operations. We believe this has stopped permanently, not just temporarily,' he added. Ayed al-Hilali, a close associate of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, also stated that regional and international powers – including the United States and Iran – seeking to avoid escalation in the region, pressured Iraq and the militias to halt their attacks. He further mentioned that Israeli threats to target Iraq were another factor in the decision, saying: 'It is possible the militias are adopting a new strategy that involves maintaining silence for the time being while reorganizing their position.' Additionally, Iraqi Parliament Speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani said in an interview with the Saudi television channel Al-Hadath that: 'What is happening in Syria affects Iraq. The security deterioration in Syria will have negative consequences for the region, but we will not interfere in its internal affairs.' He added, 'Iran is concerned about what has happened in Syria. They have their own fears. Turkey's dominance in Syria is evident – this is concerning. We do not want Turkey to replace Iran in Syria.'

The militias agreed to the demands to stop their attacks against Israel, but we cannot take sides if a U.S.-Iranian conflict erupts. Israeli threats regarding strikes in Iraq are troubling, but for now, U.S. pressure has curtailed Israel's intentions to attack Iraq.' The last known attack by the militias occurred on November 24, about a month after they resumed targeting Israel and claimed responsibility for an unusual number of cross-border rocket launches. These militias maintain close ties with Hezbollah – with their relationship significantly predating the start of the current conflict. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkrupveiye	2024-12-30T09:26:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/24/Sk0sMDgRR/Sk0sMDgRR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Syrian foreign minister calls for Kuwait's embassy in Damascus to...	T l of Bashar al-Assad. His call came during a visit to the Syrian capital by Kuwaiti foreign minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya and other diplomats that signalled an openness to establish relations in the wake of the overthrow of Assad by rebel forces in early December. The Kuwaiti foreign minister and Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General Jasem Mohamed AlBudaiwialso met Syria's de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa during their visit. Al-Yahya said they discussed regional developments and cooperation. Speaking at a joint press conference, Syrian foreign minister Shibani said: 'We call with all love and joy on brothers in Kuwait to open their embassy in Damascus and resume diplomatic relations very soon.' Al-Yahya called on the international community to reconsider sanctions imposed on Syria. He also said Kuwait's leadership also appealed for aid to be sent to Syria urgently. The Sunni Muslim Arab states boycotted the former Syrian administration after Assad accepted help from Shi'ite, non-Arab Iran and Russia to put down the Sunni-led rebellion against him. In 2013, the Arab League readmitted Syria after more than a decade of suspension.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryet4pxuyg	2024-12-30T09:22:23-08:00

He also warned Tehran that Israel has the ability to strike any target in the Middle East, including in Iran, adding that Israel would not tolerate attacks by Iranian proxies. 'To the Houthis, perhaps you have not been paying attention to what has happened to the Middle East over the past year. Well, allow me to remind you what has happened to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to Assad, to all those who have attempted to destroy us. Let this be your final warning. This is not a threat. It is a promise. You will share the same miserable fate,' Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon told the U.N. Security Council. Speaking before the meeting, Danon told reporters: 'Israel will defend its people. If 2,000 kilometers is not enough to separate our children from the terror, let me assure you, it will not be enough to protect their terror from our strengths.' The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was about to board a plane at the airport when it came under attack by Israel. A crew member on the plane was injured, he said. Israel's elimination of the top leaders of the Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah and the destruction of their military structure along with Assad's collapse represent a succession of monumental wins for Netanyahu. Briefing the Security Council meeting, Assistant U.N. Secretary General for the Middle East Khaled Khiari reiterated grave concern about the escalation in violence, calling on the Houthis to halt attacks on Israel and for international and humanitarian law to be respected. 'Further military escalation could jeopardize regional stability with adverse political, security, economic and humanitarian repercussions,' Khiari said. 'Millions in Yemen, Israel and throughout the region, would continue to bear the brunt of escalation with no end.' Russia's ambassador to the U.N., Vassily Nebenzia, while condemning Houthi missile attacks on Israel, also criticized Israel's retaliatory strikes on Yemen, as well those by what he called the 'Anglo-Saxon coalition' of U.S. and British warships in the Red Sea, saying they were 'clearly not proportional.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1e8edgikg	2024-12-30T09:21:13-08:00

During the Givati ​​Brigade's operation in the area of ​​the Indonesian Hospital in the Gaza Strip, the soldiers killed terrorists who tried to escape from the medical center, arrested dozens of additional terrorists, and neutralized the booby-trapped areas near the hospital, according to the IDF Spokesperson's Office, which revealed a video located by the IDF, in which Hamas terrorists recorded themselves planting explosive devices about 45 meters from the hospital. 'This is yet another example of Hamas’ cynical use of Gaza’s civilians and civilian establishments for terrorist activity and a gross violation of international law,' according to the IDF.

Soldiers stationed on Mount Hermon face dangerous conditions	IDF soldiers on the Syrian Golan face unclear strategic goals as rising tensions with local residents sparks concern; Commanders question the mission’s necessity as troops balance defense, humanitarian efforts, and extreme conditions in a volatile and complex environment; A blizzard could put them in mortal danger Amid criticism from Northern Command officers regarding the futility of stationing hundreds of IDF troops on the Syrian side of the border on the Golan Heights, the daily routine of the soldiers is becoming clearer under the shadow of potential danger that may approach from the east. On Sunday, Ynet revealed voices from within the IDF questioning the presence of two brigades in the Syrian territories beyond the border over the past two weeks, following the fall of Bashar Assad's regime to the rebels. The IDF is not ruling out the possibility of withdrawing from populated areas where forces have entrenched themselves over the past week, near Syrian residents, and instead consolidating in open spaces. IDF reservations stem from the fact that there is no visible enemy, nor any intelligence indicating one. Soldiers are primarily engaged in self-defense under very low operational tension, alongside violent friction that has begun to develop with local Syrian residents protesting the IDF's incursion into their territory. According to warnings, this could lead to a terror effect from cells approaching the area and attempting to harm the soldiers. Two days ago, additional officers noted that, unlike the borders with the Gaza Strip or Lebanon, most of the Golan Heights is flat and easier to control through observation and firepower. Additionally, the perimeter is much larger than other borders: The tall security fence is not the actual border, and in some areas Israeli territory stretches one to two kilometers eastward, up to the barrel line marking the boundary between the two countries. Meanwhile, the daily routine of paratroopers and armored corps soldiers in the area is becoming clearer. All of them, until recently, were engaged in intense offensive missions against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Now the soldiers are primarily defending themselves in temporary outposts or abandoned Assad army posts, but also on the outskirts of the villages themselves. They patrol between five to six locations the IDF has seized in the Syrian Golan. They attempt to cover each other through ambushes and reconnaissance missions and occasionally undertake less formal tasks. For example, troops have repaired infrastructure they accidentally damaged for Syrian residents, such as water pumps and a local power line. In at least two cases, Syrian residents approached IDF soldiers requesting medical assistance for their ailments, and their requests were granted by an IDF paramedic. In accordance with the political echelon's decision, the gates to Israel have not yet been opened for them, but the IDF promises that efforts to create opportunities for cooperation with at least some of the 70,000 Syrians living opposite Israel are ongoing. Officers currently most engaged beyond the border are from the Northern Command's Population Unit, many of whom are Druze reservists. They are trying to understand the Syrians, and the Syrians are trying to understand the IDF through them. 'The officers from this unit have prevented further incidents thanks to dialogue with the local Syrians. We’ve also learned lessons from the two cases where we had to shoot the knees of key agitators during protests against us after they got too close to our forces,' the military said. 'We haven’t conducted weapons searches in their villages, even though not all of them have handed over their weapons. It’s doubtful we’ll be able to collect all their weapons because it’s part of their culture – to be armed for self-defense after what they’ve experienced in the past decade.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF also emphasized that not all sectors in the Golan have a wide perimeter and there are still dead zones in the region. 'Our presence allows us to continue fortifying the barrier – a large and critical project for defense against an invasion of Israel,' the IDF said in a statement. 'There are still Assad army outposts, slightly deeper in, that we won’t reach. We’re not there for unnecessary adventures.' Another potentially dangerous point, though not for operational reasons, is the summit of the Syrian Hermon, which Israeli forces also captured this month without a fight. Despite a swift operation by the Technology and Logistics Directorate (Atal) to prepare or establish durable outposts for soldiers at altitudes of 1.49 miles and 1.74 miles, as revealed by Ynet last week, some still point to the dangers of staying there during a snowstorm or under harsher extreme conditions than those at older outposts like Israeli and Snow Observatory, located at around 1.37 miles. The IDF is preparing for the possibility of very long days without the ability to evacuate soldiers from there if necessary, and they will have to survive on their own with emergency equipment and food now being supplied to them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknpjreuyg	2024-12-30T08:29:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/Sy4m00NtnNyl/Sy4m00NtnNyl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

He is the 825 IDF casualty since the start of the war in Gaza; Peretz was killed by an anti-tank missile strike on the building where his force was stationed in Beit Hanoun Sergeant Uriel Peretz, 23, from Beitar Illit, a soldier in the Netzah Yehuda Battalion in the Kfir Brigade, fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip, the IDF announced Monday evening. Peretz was killed by an anti-tank missile fired by Hamas terrorists at a building in Beit Hanoun where the force was stationed. Seven soldiers were injured by the anti-tank missile strike, three of them seriously, all from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion. Peretz is the 825th IDF casualty since the beginning of the war. The IDF operation in Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip began last weekend. The Beitar Illit municipality paid tribute to Peretz, 'who fell for the sanctity of God while sacrificing his life for the people of Israel and the Land of Israel.' Mayor Meir Rubinstein said: 'Our hearts go out to the family in their difficult time. The entire city mourns and sends its condolences. We pray that we will soon be able to see the 'salvation of Israel.'' On Tuesday, Rabbi Yitzhak Bar Haim, one of the rabbis of the Netzah Yehuda Association, came to visit soldiers who were on duty at the Tze'elim base, took a picture with Peretz and sent his grandmother a message. 'Hello, Mrs. Navon,' the rabbi said to Peretz's grandmother, 'I have a special experience. The Holy One, blessed be He, summoned a special grace for me to meet your cute grandson here in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of a field, in the south, before going to fight. What a cute grandson, righteous and heroic. May he end up in peace together with all the soldiers, and with God's help you will be blessed to see him, of all grandchildren, happy. May he reach his wedding and 'build a faithful home in Israel.' You are blessed to have such children. All the best, greetings to you.' The rabbi eulogized Peretz on Monday: 'He was in the medics course for three months because he had the ability to give. He was a charming young man, pleasant and noble. He took responsibility, always cared for his friends and was very much loved by everyone. I met him a few days ago, then I sent a recording to my grandmother about her grandson, that she could be proud of him and the values ​​he brought with him from home. A difficult loss, we lost one of the best.'

Although the army has already operated several times in the town of Beit Hanoun, which is located opposite Sderot, the soldiers may still find hidden long-range rockets there, even now, after almost 15 months of fighting. Over the weekend, another, fourth, Nahal Brigade was added to the long-running operation in the northern Gaza Strip, which left the Philadelphi Corridor in the southern Gaza Strip and was replaced there by the 4th Brigade (res.).

Trump loses appeal of E. Jean Carroll $5 million defamation verdi...	A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a $5 million verdict that E. Jean Carroll won against Donald Trump when a jury found the U.S. president-elect liable for sexually abusing and later defaming the former magazine columnist. The decision was issued by a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. The May 2023 verdict stemmed from an incident around 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan, where Carroll said Trump raped her, and an October 2022 Truth Social post where Trump denied Carroll's claim as a hoax. Though jurors in federal court in Manhattan did not find that Trump committed rape, they awarded the former Elle magazine advice columnist $2.02 million for sexual assault and $2.98 million for defamation. A different jury ordered Trump in January to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her and damaging her reputation in June 2019, when he first denied her rape claim. Trump's lawyers argued the $5 million verdict should be thrown out because the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, should not have let jurors hear testimony from two other women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Trump's lawyers also said the trial judge should not have let jurors watch a 2005 'Access Hollywood' video where Trump boasted graphically about forcing himself on women. But the appeals court said Trump failed to show that Kaplan erred, or that any errors warranted a new trial. Judge Kaplan also oversaw the trial that ended with the $83.3 million verdict.

Netanyahu recovers from surgery as government crisis deepens, thr...	The Haredim are threatening to oppose the budget if the draft exemption law is not advanced, and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir continues to threaten that members of his faction will also oppose it; If the government is unable to pass a budget for next year then the Knesset is dissolved automatically and goes to new elections While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is lying in the hospital recovering from the prostate surgery he underwent Sunday night, his coalition partners have increased the pressure and escalated the government coalition crisis. The Haredim, in this case the Gur Hasidic faction, are threatening to oppose the state budget if the draft exemption law is not advanced. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also threatened Monday morning that if Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich does not increase the budget for police salaries members of his faction will on Tuesday oppose the trapped profits law, that will enable the state to collect tax on the estimated 150 billion shekels of trapped profits held in personal service companies. At the same time, the opposition is refusing offsets in preparation for the proposal of a law that is supposed to bring about 10 billion shekels into the state coffers, and the coalition currently does not have a majority. All of this is happening while the prime minister is recovering from surgery. Professor Ofer Gofrit, director of the urology department at Hadassah, updated Sunday evening that the surgery went as planned and that the prime minister woke up from anesthesia and is in good condition. 'Everything, thank God, went smoothly. There is no suspicion of malignancy or cancer. It's all a benign prostate that was removed, and we only hope for the best,' he said. Meanwhile, even if we put aside the campaign to oust the attorney general, the pressure on Netanyahu is increasing. It is precisely after the coalition expansion that he is having difficulty managing his partnership with the right, and senior government officials claim: 'We must put an end to this.' Coalition officials accuse the Haredim of 'irrational' behavior, and Ben-Gvir of promiscuous conduct. Ben-Gvir, for his part, accuses Smotrich of vindictiveness, but at the same time also criticizes the National Insurance Law, which is costing the coalition about 4 billion shekels. Knesset Member Israel Eichler of United Torah Judaism has already decided to vote against the budget. 'The government is going against the Haredi public in everything,' said a confidant. 'He said at faction meetings in recent weeks that the budget should be voted against, and therefore he will vote against it tomorrow.' This behavior is shaking the coalition into the unknown. A senior government official told Ynet that 'Ben-Gvir and the Haredim are simply a scandal. Every time something doesn't seem right to them, they threaten to oppose critical laws of the state budget. Sometimes it's the conscription law and sometimes the police salary. This leads us on a direct path to dissolving the coalition and bringing elections forward.' Another source in the coalition claimed that right-wing voters will punish those who dismantle the government. 'The right-wing public is watching, they see who is strengthening the camp and who is drilling holes in it in these historic days. The public will make them pay the price,' he said. And what happens if there is no majority? If a majority is not found today for the Retained Earnings Law, which is expected to yield the Treasury 10 billion shekels in taxes in 2025, ministry officials are threatening to announce a '5 billion shekel cut in the budgets of all ministries.' A similar statement has been made before. Almost a week ago, senior officials in the Treasury Department said that 'due to ego games, Ben-Gvir will himself cause cuts in the budgets of the police, welfare, education, health, infrastructure and budgets intended for post-war reconstruction. We will call this the 'Ben-Gvir Plot,' so that they will understand what he caused.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Economic and political sources claim that what lies behind Ben-Gvir's decision is 'a power struggle against Smotrich. He is trying to show how much he cares about the salaries of the police officers, unlike the minister and the heads of the Finance Ministry.' Otzma Yehudit, in response, accused Smotrich of 'a reckless decision to harm the salaries of the police officers and prison guards.' Despite this, Netanyahu is not expected to fire Ben-Gvir following his decision to vote against the coalition, and a coalition source explained that 'the risk of such a move is too great.' At the same time, the coalition also estimates that none of the partners really intend to break up the government, but that the goal is simply 'to operate in a broken work environment with the aim of minimizing damage.' Now the question is: Will the coalition survive its two significant political minefields, the state budget and the draft exemption law? The answer is still unclear. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byhlrmliye	2024-12-30T06:03:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/28/B1gNLgpxJe/B1gNLgpxJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Alexander Granovsky is accused of setting fire to eight vehicles in various locations, photographing infrastructure facilities in central Israel, and also capturing images of former Defense Minister Benny Gantz's neighborhood; Granovsky was reportedly operated via Telegram by Iranian agents Israel Police and the Shin Bet security agency announced Monday the arrest of Alexander Granovsky, a 29-year-old Petah Tikva resident, accused of carrying out missions on behalf of Iran. Granovsky, with a criminal history of property offenses, drug-related crimes and violence, allegedly operated under Iranian directives, targeting locations in Ra’anana, Hadera, and Ashdod. Authorities claim Granovsky conducted various acts, including photographing a sensitive Israeli infrastructure site and the residential neighborhood of former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister Benny Gantz. Granovsky allegedly sent these images to his Iranian handlers. Granovsky also reportedly set fire to eight vehicles, purchased military uniforms to film himself burning them, and shared details of another Israeli citizen for potential recruitment. Granovsky was arrested earlier this month at his partner’s home. Police have requested his detention be extended ahead of an indictment at the Central District Court. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Superintendent Sarit Peretz, an officer in the International Investigations Unit, said Granovsky acted under explicit instructions, including burning vehicles, for which he received payments ranging from hundreds to thousands of shekels. In some instances, he was unpaid but claimed he needed the money. 'He told us, 'They pay me, and I do it,'' Peretz said. She added, 'Granovsky communicated with Iranian operatives via Telegram. They instructed him to act against the government and the prime minister by spraying graffiti, committing arson, and gathering intelligence. He provided details about a security officer and collected information on IDF officials, with plans to expand these efforts. He was stopped before completing all his assignments.' The investigation revealed that Granovsky had requested additional tasks before his arrest but refused certain instructions, such as burning an ambulance or a police vehicle. While he was directed to acquire firearms and grenades, he only proposed creating Molotov cocktails. 'He knew exactly who he was dealing with. He is a very dangerous individual,' Peretz concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyo5aml81x	2024-12-30T05:17:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/30/B1gyxflLyl/B1gyxflLyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Stolen lives: Inside Russia’s abduction of Ukrainian children	Nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken to Russia or occupied territories since the war began; experts describe Russia's efforts to erase their identities and Ukraine's struggle to bring them home Since the outbreak of the war in 2022, nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories without the consent of their families, Ukrainian officials say. Independent research, including research by Yale University, suggests a policy of systemic deportation of Ukrainian youth. The harrowing consequences of that policy became clear in January 2024, when an 18-year-old Ukrainian who had been sent to a foster family in Russia took his own life. Shortly before his death, he sent a voice message to his friends expressing his despair over the relocation. Ukraine says these actions meet the UN’s definition of genocide and last year, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his children’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children. Russia denies these allegations. Lvova-Belova has acknowledged that 730,000 Ukrainian children fled Ukraine for Russia since the start of the war but said that most of them came with their families. She said that Russia had taken about 2,000 children from Ukrainian orphanages, but she did not mention other allegations of widespread forced displacement. Ukrainian human rights advocates who spoke to The Media Line described a harrowing, calculated effort to undermine Ukraine’s future through the use of its youngest and most vulnerable citizens. They noted that the true extent of the abductions likely surpasses the 20,000 figure. The fate of Ukraine’s abducted children Aksana Filipishyna, an analyst with the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, traced the roots of the abducted children crisis back to at least 2014, when Ukraine raised the alarm that Russia was abducting Ukrainian children from orphanages. By 2015, Russia had launched the 'trains of hope' initiative, encouraging Russian citizens to travel to occupied Ukrainian territories and adopt Ukrainian children. 'Ukraine raised this issue on the international stage and appealed to the European Court of Human Rights,' Filipishyna told The Media Line, noting that those actions were carried out under the auspices of Pavel Astakhov, then the presidential envoy for children's rights in Russia. Russia’s own public records reveal how the policy of child relocation has taken off since the 2022 invasion. From 2022 to mid-2023, Russian authorities openly published data on government websites detailing the arrival of Ukrainian orphans in over 70 localities across 42 regions. 'The geography is vast, from border regions to deep inside Russia,' Filipishyna said, describing a deliberate dispersion of Ukrainian children across the country. She cited a 2023 public event where Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Putin’s envoy Maria Lvova-Belova discussed 'reeducation facilities' for Ukrainian teenagers who resisted Russian assimilation. 'These boys, displaying pro-Ukrainian sentiments, were to be sent to such institutions in Grozny,' the capital city of Russia’s Chechen Republic, Filipishyna said. Filipishyna noted that Ukraine had tried to clear out its state-run child care institutions on the border regions leading up to the 2022 Russian invasion to prevent children from being kidnapped. 'Most children from state institutions were successfully evacuated,' Filipishyna said. But an estimated 4,000 children remained in orphanages, foster care or other guardianships in areas like Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv. As Russia moved in, those regions saw widespread violence, civilian casualties, forced detentions and abductions. She pointed to the 2022 siege of Mariupol as another example of how Ukrainian children have been forcibly relocated. Before the siege, Mariupol’s civilian population was over 250,000, one-fifth of whom were children. The city’s infrastructure was almost entirely destroyed by relentless shelling and bombings, leaving 90% of it in ruins. 'When Russian forces entered the devastated city, they brought buses and systematically cleared out neighborhoods,' Filipishyna said. Civilians were forced out of bomb shelters and basements under the threat of complete annihilation. 'People were told they had 30 minutes before the area would be completely cleared—meaning everything that moved would be destroyed. Those seeking survival had no choice but to board the transport, which took them to so-called filtration camps in Russia,' she continued. In those camps, families with children were held for three to five days under grueling conditions. Adults underwent a rigorous 'filtration' process, and suspicions of pro-Ukrainian sentiment often led to devastating separations. 'If parents were found with pro-Ukrainian information on their phones, tattoos or laptops—or identified as local officials, activists or human rights defenders—they were immediately detained,' Filipishyna said. Those parents’ children were separated from them and transferred to orphanages or health camps in Russia. Filipishyna said that the figure of 20,000 forcibly relocated children from across Ukraine is likely understated. 'In Mariupol alone, where 51,000 children lived before the invasion, we suspect many remain unaccounted for—especially those whose families perished or whose parents were executed or detained by Russian forces,' she said. Other children were vulnerable to forced relocation after being left with grandparents or other relatives when their parents joined the military or were taken prisoner, Filipishyna said. The fate of the abducted children varies—some remain in orphanages, others have been placed with foster families and a significant number have been adopted within Russia. Research by Yale University and Ukrainian human rights groups confirms the widespread and systematic nature of these transfers. Filipishyna said her own research has found that the abductions take a serious mental toll on their victims, with the potential for lasting harm. 'Children who spent extended periods in the Russian Federation endured significant psychological manipulation,' she said. Abducted Ukrainian children are often forcibly humiliated, banned from speaking Ukrainian and made to participate in singing Russian anthems. Ties to their families are cut off, including by confiscating their phones, and some are even confined to basements. 'Children faced punishment for expressing hope that Ukraine would return or for showing any positive sentiments toward their homeland,' Filipishyna said. She added that many children reported being told by their captors that Ukraine had forgotten about them and that only Russia could offer them a future. The harsh conditions left many children, particularly teenagers, vulnerable to suicidal thoughts. 'These were children who remembered an independent, democratic Ukraine—where dignity and human rights mattered, where they could speak freely,' Filipishyna said. She emphasized that the totalitarian environment was hard to tolerate for adults, let alone children. 'It’s no surprise that some were pushed to the brink,' she said. Fast-tracked Russian citizenship for Ukrainian children Filipishyna detailed how Russia systematically altered its citizenship laws since May 2022 in order to facilitate the integration of Ukrainian children. The most recent changes, effective January 4, 2024, allow almost any adult to apply for citizenship on behalf of a child from occupied Ukrainian territories, she said. 'This adult could be a hospital director, a school principal, the head of an orphanage or even a temporary guardian,' Filipishyna said. The individual merely needs to state that the child is unaccompanied and has no established connection with relatives. 'Of course, no one attempts to establish such connections or inform Ukraine about the child’s whereabouts,' Filipishyna noted, adding that the child’s opinion is also not taken into account in the process. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After the Ukrainian child is recognized as unaccompanied, Russia replaces the child’s birth certificate and makes the child eligible for adoption. 'The system is designed to close the loop and make these children untraceable,' Filipishyna said. 'This policy isn’t just about assimilation; it’s a calculated effort to erase Ukrainian identity.' Filipishyna described the policy of child abduction as 'another facet of a systematic strategy to strip Ukraine of its future by targeting its children.' 'Children represent the future and hope of any nation. By erasing Ukrainian identity among these children, Russia seeks to weaken Ukraine’s future,' she said. She added that Russia is also hoping to benefit demographically from the introduction of Ukrainian children, who are seen as 'intelligent, curious and industrious.' The challenges of returning Ukraine’s abducted children Ukraine wants to rescue abducted children, but so far, it hasn’t managed to do so in any large-scale way, Filipishyna said. 'The full procedure envisioned by the Geneva Conventions has not been implemented, and this leaves us with slow progress on bringing these children back home,' she explained. Under the Geneva Conventions, both Ukraine and Russia are obligated to create national information bureaus to document civilians displaced by war, including children. 'Ukraine compiles lists of those we seek to locate and believe were unlawfully taken, while Russia is required to maintain a registry of individuals it has transferred or detained in occupied territories,' Filipishyna said. Ukraine’s registry, established in 2022, gathers information from sources including families, law enforcement officers, orphanage directors and other officials. According to the Geneva Conventions, both Ukraine and Russia were required to identify at least four trusted states to act as mediators in negotiations about returning displaced civilians. 'Ideally, if both sides agreed on a mediator country, intermediary bodies would form under its auspices, potentially involving organizations like the International Red Cross or the UN,' Filipishyna said. But this process has not been realized. Instead, the fate of Ukraine’s children rests with various isolated efforts. 'What we see are small-scale or individual cases of family reunifications, rather than the systematic return of orphans or children deprived of parental care,' Filipishyna said. Most cases of returned children involve families separated during the invasion, such as children who were sent to stay with grandparents in Kherson when their mother was working in Kyiv. 'Very few children have been retrieved from deep within Russia—these are not hundreds but merely dozens,' Filipishyna explained. Daria Kasianova, chairman of the Board of the Ukrainian Network for Children’s Rights, highlighted the involvement of international mediators in facilitating the return of abducted Ukrainian children. 'Countries like Qatar, the Vatican and South Africa have expressed willingness to assist, with Qatar already achieving some success,' she explained. But for now, the efforts of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union have resulted in the return of just 210 children. 'Children from Mariupol, for example, were first taken to Donetsk and later moved to Moscow suburbs. Parents and guardians began reaching out to us, but retrieving children is extremely difficult,' she said. In many cases, legal hurdles arise. 'Even mothers must gather extensive documentation to prove parental rights. Grandmothers, if the parents are deceased, are often forced to apply for guardianship under Russian law, which is absurd,' Kasianova added. Getting a child back to Ukraine is even more difficult if a child had no legal guardian in Ukraine or if their documents were confiscated. Rescuing abducted children is even more challenging when the children have been taken to Russian-occupied territories. 'Occupied territories are harder to access due to military equipment and numerous checkpoints,' Kasianova said, noting that many children fear prolonged interrogations at border crossings. She emphasized the need for streamlined international mechanisms, as the current system places significant barriers on families trying to reunite. 'It’s an incredibly challenging process that leaves many children in legal limbo, unable to return home,' she said. For the few children who manage to return to Ukraine, vast challenges remain. These children, who sometimes have no parents to return to, undergo a careful reintegration process involving long-term psychological support upon their return to Ukraine. Kasianova recounted the story of one boy who was left stranded at a Russian hospital after his parents were killed during their escape from occupied territory. In another case, a 12-year-old girl was coerced into accepting Russian citizenship and witnessed the rape and murder of a childhood friend by a Russian soldier. Even those children who don’t experience violence are deeply psychologically affected by the abduction and by having to give up their sense of being Ukrainian. 'They return deeply scarred, needing to unlearn the falsehoods forced upon them and rebuild their identities,' Kasianova said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1czlfeikx	2024-12-30T04:11:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/23/rklaH61L36/rklaH61L36_110_48_943_531_0_small.jpg
Architectural marvel or disastrous boondoggle? Sisi's new palace ...	With its pyramid-shaped hall and a mural celebrating Sisi’s coup against the Muslim Brotherhood regime, the lavish venue has left many Egyptians questioning whether their taxes might have been better spent on schools and hospitals The 11th summit of the Developing Eight (D-8) nations on Dec. 19 in Cairo left its mark on Egypt—not for its outcomes, but for the opulent venue where it was held. The D-8 group, founded in 1997, includes Egypt, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey. Among the attendees were Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. During the summit, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi warned of 'unprecedented crises in the Middle East' and highlighted the challenges developing nations face in achieving growth amid mounting obstacles. However, the event’s discussions took a backseat to the public’s fascination—and outrage—over the lavish palace hosting the summit. The newly unveiled palace, located in Egypt’s New Administrative Capital east of Cairo, boasts a footprint of 50,000 square meters within a 2.5-million-square-meter complex. Designed in a pharaonic style, it features an expansive pyramid-shaped hall for special events. The palace’s debut triggered a heated debate on social media. Some Egyptians praised it as a testament to architectural achievement under Sisi's leadership. Others criticized it as an extravagant misuse of state funds during a severe economic crisis, suggesting the resources could have been better spent on schools, hospitals and public welfare projects. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Critics also took aim at the palace’s interior decorations, which some saw as glorifying Sisi’s rule. One mural depicts Sisi’s 2013 ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, while Quranic verses adorn other walls. Notably, one verse quoting Pharaoh—'Am I not the king of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath my feet?'—was displayed with Pharaoh’s name conspicuously omitted. Sisi defends spending Addressing the criticism during a visit to a police academy two days after the summit, Sisi claimed that the palace and other facilities in the New Administrative Capital were financed by the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), a government-owned holding company established in 2016. Still, the backlash highlights longstanding grievances about Sisi’s ambitious—and costly—construction projects. Detractors argue these projects prioritize grandeur over the dire needs of ordinary Egyptians. In 2019, construction contractor Mohamed Ali accused Sisi of corruption, claiming the president was building palaces while Egyptians went hungry. Sisi famously responded, 'Yes, I am building presidential palaces—but not for myself, for Egypt.' Mounting economic pressures Egypt’s economic struggles are undeniable. According to the Qatari newspaper The New Arab, the country’s external debt has ballooned from $45.2 billion in 2014, when Sisi took office, to $152.9 billion as of June 2023. Recent regional conflicts, including the war in Gaza and Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, have further strained the economy. Egypt reportedly lost 70% of its Suez Canal revenue, a critical income source. The controversy over Sisi’s new palace is not occurring in a vacuum. Images of opposition forces seizing opulent palaces during Syria’s civil war have intensified scrutiny of such symbols of power across the Arab world. For many Egyptians, the palace serves as a stark reminder of their economic struggles and fuels questions about the priorities of their leadership. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1cej11ei1g	2024-12-30T03:32:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/29/ryGjuwSCxkg/ryGjuwSCxkg_0_37_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Berlin says Elon Musk trying to exert influence over German elect...	U.S. billionaire Elon Musk is trying to exert influence over the German election taking place in February, a government spokesperson said on Monday. 'It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election,' with X posts and an opinion piece he wrote backing the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) over the weekend, she said. Musk was free to express his opinion, the spokesperson added. 'After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.' The support of the AfD from Musk, who is set to serve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration as an outside adviser, comes as Germans are set to vote on Feb. 23 after a coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. The commentary published in German in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, flagship of the Axel Springer media group, expanded on a post by Musk on social media platform X last week in which he wrote 'only the AfD can save Germany' and praised the party's approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyqxzbxuyl	2024-12-30T02:22:13-08:00

IDF officials: 'Find Hamas alternative before any deal or we'll r...	Senior military officials warn that the lack of a clear policy for Gaza could allow the terror group, severely weakened in combat, to regain political control; 'We will lose the achievements of the war,' they caution Senior IDF officials warned Monday that failure to plan for Gaza's future governance could lead to a relapse of conditions that existed before the October 7 terror attack. 'It’s that simple,' one official said. These warnings have been repeatedly delivered to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Security officials emphasize that without decisive action on post-war governance, Hamas could rebuild its political power and regain control of Gaza. 'In the absence of an alternative, Hamas will inevitably return to power. Decisions must be made now, before any hostage deals or cease-fire agreements,' officials said. This concern resonates within both the IDF and the Shin Bet. While Hamas’ military capabilities have been decimated, officials caution that the group’s political infrastructure remains intact. Approximately 1.9 million residents, about 90% of Gaza's population, are concentrated in humanitarian zones in central and southern Gaza. The IDF has a limited presence in these areas, focusing primarily on targeted airstrikes. Meanwhile, Hamas operatives continue to exert brutal control over the local population, silencing dissent with violence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'When families try to resist, Hamas suppresses them ruthlessly. But the larger issue is the absence of leadership or energy for rebellion,' one military official explained. Security officials outline three potential paths forward Restoring Palestinian Authority control: This would involve significant international investment, primarily from the U.S. and Gulf nations, to bolster the Palestinian Authority (PA). Such a move, coupled with normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, could reshape the region. However, Netanyahu has dismissed this option, citing political constraints within his coalition. Establishing military rule in Gaza: Under this scenario, Israel would assume responsibility for Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, from food distribution to healthcare. This would come with enormous financial and diplomatic costs, which Netanyahu is reluctant to bear. Defaulting to the status quo: This would allow Hamas to gradually reclaim power, undermining one of the primary objectives of the war—dismantling the group. Lessons from the West Bank The lack of strategic planning in Gaza mirrors Israel’s approach in the West Bank. While some voices on the political right call to dismantle the PA, Netanyahu has avoided making a decision. Security forces loyal to Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas continue to fight Hamas, preventing its rise in areas near Israeli cities. 'Just last week, five PA security personnel were killed fighting Hamas,' a senior official noted. 'They tell us, ‘If we’re not strong, Hamas will take over, and it’ll be your problem too.’ Yet, Israel neither supports the PA nor dismantles it, effectively leaving it to collapse slowly.' If the PA were to fall, security officials warn, Israel would need to double its troop presence in the West Bank, a logistical nightmare. Israeli security officials stress they are not advocating for a Palestinian state or territorial concessions. Instead, they seek pragmatic solutions to safeguard national security. 'The lesson from October 7 is not just to stop turning a blind eye but to stop deferring critical decisions,' one official said. 'Difficult steps must be taken now. Hoping for quiet hasn’t worked—it’s time to face reality and act decisively.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy1ky1ei1e	2024-12-30T02:06:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/06/S1eS4ck1Jx/S1eS4ck1Jx_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Why is minimal clothing necessary for pole dancing?'	Certified psychotherapist and pole dance instructor Michali Aspis is adamant about breaking the stigma and using pole dancing as a powerful tool for treatment and self-appreciation I came across an ad inviting women to a therapeutic group involving pole dancing. What does that mean? 'I've designed a therapeutic program combining pole dancing with group discussions, focusing on body image, femininity and sexuality,' explained Michali Aspis, 32, a clinical social worker, cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist and certified pole dance instructor. Married and a mother of two, she lives in Haifa. 'The pole, due to its stigmas and cheap sexual connotations, confronts women directly, forcing them to deal with many aspects of their sexuality immediately. The room itself is full of mirrors, leading women to undergo a kind of exposure therapy — suddenly seeing their entire bodies in minimal clothing, something many avoid by only looking at their faces in the mirror.' Why is minimal clothing necessary for pole dancing? 'First, our skin is one of the points of contact with the pole — meaning that to stabilize ourselves, we use our form. Additionally, it allows women to view their entire bodies in the mirror. 'In principle, someone could decide it doesn't suit her and remain clothed but this offers a genuine opportunity to experiment in a safe, judgment-free environment full of acceptance and love. It’s about exposing oneself emotionally and physically.' What issues do women address in these workshops? 'One woman might work on childhood sexual trauma, another may deal with diminished sexuality due to motherhood. One is recovering from cancer and another was near the Gaza border on October 7 and seeks to cope with the trauma still lingering in her body. One of the aspects most severely impacted by PTSD is sexuality and it’s rarely addressed in therapy rooms because it’s seen as secondary to 'more important concerns.'' You're a social worker. How did you come across this type of therapy? 'Over the years, I realized you can't separate the body from the mind. Many struggles manifest physically, especially in the context of sexuality and sometimes conversational therapy alone isn't enough to create the necessary change. 'Unfortunately, sexuality is taboo in our society. Even in therapy rooms, very few clients dare to touch on the subject. In the case of pole dancing, it’s front and center — you address it simply by working with it.' Is there another reason you chose the pole? 'Because I want to break the stigma around it. I think it’s time we redefine the pole and use it as a tool for women to reclaim their sexuality.' What does that mean? 'In our society, women are expected to use their sexuality to please their husbands and have children. Through work with the pole, I contradict that, saying a woman's sexuality is, first and foremost, her own. 'I believe the pole, given its history, is an excellent tool for reclaiming ownership of sexuality. It’s an element through which a woman simply enjoys her body. Abroad, pole work is already a recognized therapeutic field, with doctoral research being conducted on it. For example, there’s a feminist movement called S Factor that uses the pole as a tool for connection and female empowerment.' When did you start working with pole dancing? 'About seven or eight years ago. I reached a weight of 102 kilograms (225 lbs) and then lost 36 kilograms (79 lbs), rediscovering my sexual drive. Before losing weight, I met someone who attended a pole dance class and I told myself that one day, when I slimmed down, I’d try it too.

Man replaced by machine': Is the use of AI undermining the IDF's...	Unit 8200 served as a testing ground for advanced AI systems, shaping its military strategy for years before October 7; a Washington Post report raises concerns about increased civilian casualties and weakened human intelligence under the unit’s AI-driven approach Following Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7 last year, the IDF launched an extensive aerial campaign in Gaza, leveraging years of meticulously gathered intelligence on addresses, tunnels and critical infrastructure tied to the terrorist group. However, as the target bank began to dwindle, the military turned to an artificial intelligence system known as 'The Gospel' to rapidly generate hundreds of new targets, according to a detailed Washington Post investigation. The report examines how the use of AI technologies impacted the prolonged war, including its influence on civilian casualties and the quality of Israeli intelligence. According to two individuals familiar with the intelligence-gathering operation, the deployment of AI allowed the IDF to maintain a relentless pace of airstrikes. The Post describes the software as one of the most advanced applications of military AI to date, central to Israel’s ongoing operations. It also sheds light on internal debates within the IDF over whether reliance on AI weakened traditional intelligence capabilities and if the technology’s recommendations received sufficient scrutiny. Discussions on the use of AI began years before the October 7 attack, according to the investigation. Critics within the military have argued that the AI system contributed to a significant rise in civilian casualties in Gaza. The Post bases its findings on interviews with over a dozen individuals familiar with the system, most of whom spoke anonymously due to national security concerns, as well as on internal documents obtained during its investigation. 'What’s happening in Gaza is a forerunner of a broader shift in how war is being fought,' said Steven Feldstein, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, who researches the use of AI in war. He noted that the IDF appeared to have lowered its threshold for the acceptable civilian casualty rate during the Gaza war. 'Combine that with the acceleration these systems offer — as well as the questions of accuracy — and the end result is a higher death count than was previously imagined in war.' The IDF said claims that its use of AI endangers lives are 'off the mark.' 'The more ability you have to compile pieces of information effectively, the more accurate the process is,' the IDF said in a statement to The Post. 'If anything, these tools have minimized collateral damage and raised the accuracy of the human-led process.' A week's work in 30 minutes A major transformation within Unit 8200, Israel’s elite intelligence division, has been revealed, showing a dramatic shift toward engineering and technology roles under the leadership of Yossi Sariel. According to a Washington Post investigation, by October 7, 2023, 60% of Unit 8200 personnel worked in engineering and technological capacities—double the percentage from a decade ago. This shift came at the expense of traditional roles, including experts in Arabic language, and involved the dismissal of officers critical of adopting artificial intelligence. The report highlights the integration of AI tools like 'The Gospel,' a system developed using hundreds of predictive algorithms designed to process vast quantities of data—referred to by the IDF as 'the pool.' The software generates recommendations for military targets, including tunnels, rockets and other infrastructure, which are reviewed by analysts and ultimately approved by senior officers for inclusion in the target database. A military source familiar with the systems told the Post that the AI’s image recognition capabilities allow soldiers to identify subtle patterns in satellite imagery, such as minor terrain changes indicating newly buried rocket launchers or tunnels. This level of analysis compressed work that previously took a week into just 30 minutes. However, the rapid adoption of AI has raised concerns among some officers. Critics argue the technology’s speed conceals its limitations, such as inaccuracies in Arabic-language processing, where slang and keywords were reportedly misunderstood. A former senior military official noted that intelligence reports presented to commanders often did not clarify whether data was derived from human sources or AI, complicating the evaluation process. 'Everything was treated as the same,' another former senior official said. 'I’m not even sure the person preparing the report knew the difference between the pieces of information.' The Israeli military utilizes advanced AI systems, including 'The Gospel' and 'Lavender,' to predict potential civilian casualties during operations. These tools rely on data mining software that combines image recognition from drone footage with tracking data from smartphones connected to cellular antennas to estimate the number of civilians in a targeted area. In 2014, the IDF’s accepted civilian-to-combatant casualty ratio was one civilian per senior terrorist, said Tal Mimran, a former legal advisor to the military. According to Breaking the Silence, a group citing testimonies from IDF soldiers, that ratio has risen during the current war to 15 civilians per low-ranking terrorist and exponentially higher for mid- and senior-level operatives. The New York Times recently reported the figure may be closer to 20 civilians per terrorist. The IDF has maintained that its assessments of collateral damage comply with international law, which requires distinguishing between civilians and combatants and taking precautions to minimize harm to non-combatants. Internal debate: Man vs. machine Supporters of these technologies argue that aggressive implementation of AI innovations is essential for the survival of a small nation facing determined and powerful adversaries. 'Technological superiority is what keeps Israel safe,' said Blaise Misztal, vice president for policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, who was briefed by the IDF’s intelligence division on its AI capabilities in 2021. 'The faster Israel is able to identify enemy capabilities and take them off the battlefield, the shorter a war is going to be, and it will have fewer casualties.' However, concerns about the quality of AI-generated intelligence have sparked internal divisions within the IDF. According to three sources, the reliance on such technology has shifted priorities, favoring technical capabilities over traditional practices. For example, Unit 8200 has long allowed junior analysts to bypass their immediate commanders and relay warnings directly to senior officials. Some worry that the reliance on AI systems may have undermined this practice, potentially weakening the IDF's decision-making processes.

The resignation was submitted to IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Military Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder. According to two former senior officers interviewed by the Post, the unit’s growing reliance on AI was a key factor in Israel’s lack of preparedness. They claim an overemphasis on technological findings hindered analysts from effectively conveying warnings to top commanders. 'This was an AI factory,' said one former military leader, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe national security topics. 'The man was replaced by the machine.' Sariel’s name surfaced after a security breach reported by The Guardian. A book he authored, The Human Machine Team, published on Amazon, revealed a digital trail linked to a personal Google account under his name. The account contained unique identifiers and maps tied to his work. The book outlines Sariel’s vision of integrating AI into defense, emphasizing how it could revolutionize the relationship between humans and machines in military operations. Before taking command of Unit 8200, Sariel spent a sabbatical year at the Pentagon-funded National Defense University in Washington. A professor from the institution described Sariel’s radical vision for AI on the battlefield, which he shared in his book. Sariel proposed that AI would transform all aspects of defense, including border security, turning Israel’s borders into 'smart borders' using advanced surveillance technologies. He also predicted that within five years, AI could replace 80% of intelligence analysts specializing in foreign languages. When Sariel returned to Israel, he implemented his vision. Appointed commander of Unit 8200 by then-IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi in the summer of 2020, Sariel faced internal concerns from former commanders who privately expressed worries about what they described as a 'religious attitude toward AI' developing under his leadership. Unit 8200, renowned for its cutting-edge cyber technologies and online intelligence gathering, has long held a reputation for technological excellence. However, the sheer volume of information often overwhelmed analysts. For instance, Hamas operatives frequently used the word 'watermelon' as code for a bomb, but the system struggled to differentiate between discussions about actual watermelons and encrypted messages. 'If you pick up a thousand conversations a day, do I really want to hear about every watermelon in Gaza?' one insider told the Washington Post. Under Sariel, the unit intensified its data mining efforts and restructured intelligence operations. New technologies were introduced to rapidly process algorithms in anticipation of a potential war with Hezbollah. One such innovation was an app called 'Hunter,' which allowed soldiers in the field to directly access intelligence data in real time. Long before Hamas’ surprise attack, Unit 8200 had been meticulously constructing a target bank, requiring analysts to verify findings with at least two independent sources and to continuously refresh the data, according to three individuals familiar with the program. Before a target could be added to the 'bank,' it had to be 'validated' by a senior officer and a military lawyer to ensure compliance with international law. Senior intelligence officials, including Sariel, believed machine learning could dramatically accelerate this process. 'They really did believe with all the sensors they had all around and above Gaza, I won’t say total informational awareness, but that they had a very good picture of what was happening inside,' said Misztal, who leads an organization focused on security cooperation between the United States and Israel. Following the events of October 7, Unit 8200 has reportedly increased efforts to recruit additional Arabic-speaking analysts, including those tasked with evaluating and critiquing AI systems, according to three sources cited by the Post. Meanwhile, Israeli officials are notably more restrained in their public remarks about the use of artificial intelligence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjyhbn1ikx	2024-12-29T21:40:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/06/08/Hkg7m7N1P3/Hkg7m7N1P3_46_0_1185_667_0_small.jpg

Festive gatherings ease the toll of war for Israeli soldiers	Mimi Rozmaryn: 'We can take a moment from the serious crisis that we’re facing and enjoy togetherness' Every day seems to bring news of another soldier lost in the battle against Hamas in Gaza. This grim reality has persisted for 15 months, taking a heavy toll on Israeli morale. To help ease the pain and uplift the spirits of those fighting on the frontlines, several organizations are stepping in to bring moments of joy to the soldiers. One such organization is Meir Panim, which has been hosting festive Hanukkah parties to remind everyone that even in the darkest times, there is still room for light and hope. 'We can take a moment from the serious crisis that we’re facing and enjoy togetherness, appreciating the fact that we’re able to continue our mission to help bring light to each person in need,' said Meir Panim’s Director of Global Development, Mimi Rozmaryn. 'We are really feeling the toll of this year of war and the stress on our communities,' she added. 'What we’re hearing is that the fact we’re able to keep going and provide these events—even doing things like sending pizza to families of reservists or organizing parties for troops on the frontlines—is a reminder to our communities that we stand behind them.'

Israeli surrogate faces twin pregnancy with husband in reserves	Carmel Eliyahu-Zinger says she always dreamed of being a surrogate but didn't expect to get pregnant in the middle of a war while raising three kids and worrying about her husband in extended reserve duty Carmel Eliyahu-Zinger, 36, from Kibbutz Ma'agan, who is married and a mother of three and pregnant with twins as a surrogate, recounted the story of her decision to help other couples while also dealing with the war in Gaza, her role as director of rehabilitation services at Natan Medical and her husband’s service in the IDF reserves. 'The idea of surrogacy has been with me since my teenage years. I saw a film about it and thought it was the best thing one could do, but it stayed as just an idea. I met my husband when I was 17 and when I mentioned it to him before we got married, he was appalled. 'He felt it was like giving up your own baby, your flesh and blood. After our children were born, the topic occasionally came up. As I approached my 35th birthday I realized I wasn’t getting any younger and if I wanted to act, it had to be now,' she said. 'Before the war, the mood in Israel felt like a civil war was brewing and I felt I had to do something for others to avoid succumbing to that despair. One evening, amid dinner and bath routines, I casually mentioned it to my husband, and he said, 'Well, maybe now’s the right time.' I left my details with SurMom, a company specializing in surrogacy, and they got back to me within hours. It felt almost cosmic.' 'I underwent many tests before I even found a couple to carry for: childbirth summaries, gynecological check-ups, a breast surgeon evaluation and psychological assessments. Then the company sent me stories of potential couples.' If a woman chooses this willingly, with her motives thoroughly vetted and uses her power and control over her body to give a gift to someone else, I think there’s nothing more empowering 'I initially thought I’d choose a same-sex couple for ideological reasons, but ultimately, a heterosexual couple’s story touched my heart and I couldn’t help but want to help them. My husband and I met them in July 2023 and the chemistry was immediate. From that moment, everything felt natural.' 'The war hit us during the peak of embryo transfers and hormonal treatments. My husband, a combat soldier and company commander, was in continuous reserve service from October to February, then received another call-up until recently.' 'I had to undergo intense hormonal treatments and frequent blood tests while managing three kids on my own. The emotional and physical strain was immense. At one point, I considered either committing fully or pausing and postponing the process, but I decided to continue for the sake of the couple.' 'I was juggling concerns for my husband, kids, home and work — I oversee rehabilitation services in the northern district of Natan Medical, supporting individuals with mental illnesses, and I’m also a psychotherapist. It was hard to manage everything and, just when I reached my limit, the third embryo transfer resulted in a pregnancy,' she recounted. 'I went to major check-ups with the intended parents and smaller ones on my own. My husband came home every three weeks to support and strengthen me, though the army didn’t grant him any exemptions because of me. Thankfully, I live in a kibbutz where friends could help with groceries and other tasks. My parents, in-laws and even my pregnant sister-in-law also pitched in.' 'Still, being a reservist’s wife is a lonely experience. One night, I woke up with a severe sore throat and a high fever, unsure whether to go to the hospital because I didn’t know who’d watch the kids if I were admitted.' 'People around me mostly asked why I was doing surrogacy, saying things like: 'You must be making a lot of money, enough to pay off your mortgage and loans.' I usually just go along with it and say, 'Sure, it’s all about the money.'' 'What they don’t understand is that the compensation — 170,000 shekels ($46,267) — won’t pay off a mortgage. What will I do with the money? Probably a family vacation and save the rest.' 'The pregnancy’s been challenging physically. Two embryos at 20 weeks and my belly is already huge. It’s heavy and I’m exhausted. But there’s something freeing about not having the anxieties of raising these children after birth. If these twins were mine, it’d be a very different experience. Knowing I’ll pass the child-rearing to someone else is liberating,' she said. 'There’s a debate in Israeli society about the ethics of surrogacy and the discussion itself highlights the issue. If a woman chooses this willingly, with her motives thoroughly vetted and uses her power and control over her body to give a gift to someone else, I think there’s nothing more empowering.'

Another call-up is coming soon and it’s tough, but I’m proud of my husband.

Turkish officials say Israel 'betting on wrong horse in Syria'	Ankara stressed Jerusalem's skepticism of de facto Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani) is 'beneficial to the Iranian snake' and that cooperation in the region could better both country's positions Senior Turkish officials warned on Sunday that Israel was 'betting on the wrong horse in Syria' for its skepticism toward Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani) and risks missing a rare opportunity to collaborate with the new regime that 'seeks to maintain stability in the country.' 'Chaos in Syria is beneficial to the Iranian snake; the Iranians have an interest in reigniting the civil war. Peace in Syria is bad for the Ayatollahs,' Ankara officials said. They assert that Israel is making a mistake by dismissing al-Golani. 'Israel ignores his positive overtures and actions, such as seizing weapons and his statements against Iran and Hezbollah. Israel and Turkey share mutual interests in Syria and both should cooperate to advance them,' the officials said. The officials added that, contrary to various reports, it was Israel that approached Turkey with a proposal for a military coordination mechanism between the two nations. Israel suggested dividing Syria into three geographic zones reflecting each side’s interests: Turkey would have interests in the northern sector, requiring Israeli pre-approval for operations there. Israel would have freedom of action in the south, while both sides would need to notify each other before operating in the central region. According to the officials, Turkey agreed to dialogue but rejected the geographic division proposal. Turkish officials highlighted that the coordination mechanism between Jerusalem and Ankara worked effectively during the war in Lebanon, citing instances where Turkey shared coordinates of Turkish evacuation convoys and Israel refrained from striking areas they were located in. 'There’s no reason it shouldn’t work just as effectively in Syria just as coordination worked well in Lebanon,' they said. Ankara expressed anger over Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar’s statements in favor of Israeli cooperation with the Kurdish minority in Syria. 'Israel is once again betting on the wrong horse and doesn’t understand that the Kurds controlling the Iraq-Syria border are the ones enabling Iran to smuggle weapons into Syria and Hezbollah in exchange for money,' they said. According to them, the 'Iranian snake' benefits from Syria's instability as Tehran has an interest in prolonging the conflict. 'Israel and Turkey should have a shared interest in achieving stability as quickly as possible,' they added. Since Bashar Assad’s fall and the end of the war, a significant escalation has been taking place in northern Syria between Turkish-backed rebel groups and local Kurdish forces, some of which are supported by the U.S. Turkish air force jets. Turkish forces have been striking Kurdish targets in the region and reports indicate that Ankara is amassing forces near the Syrian border in preparation for a possible ground invasion. The conflict between Turkey and the Kurds has persisted for over 40 years. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) issued an intriguing statement on Sunday quoting its imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan. In the statement, Ocalan hinted at a willingness to lay down arms and end the Kurdish struggle against Turkey. Ankara has repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that it won’t allow the People's Defense Units (YPG) Kurdish militia, which it considers the PKK's military arm, to operate in the 'new Turkey.'

Hundreds of terrorists captured: Massive IDF operation ending in ...	IDF troops captured over 240 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists in Jabaliya while neutralizing terrorist strongholds; The Kamal Adwan Hospital, used as a terror base, was cleared of civilians and secured; Fighting continued in Beit Hanoun from where rockets were fired at Israel For the 162nd Division, which has been leading the offensive operation in the northern Gaza Strip for the past three months, the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya was the last major Hamas stronghold in the city. Its fall this past weekend marked the conclusion of the operation in Jabaliya, although a few remaining tasks will continue this week. Over 240 terrorists were arrested during the operation, and approximately 20 were killed. Meanwhile, fighting continued on Sunday in Beit Hanoun, the primary target of IDF attacks in the northern Gaza Strip. In the afternoon, five rockets were launched from the area toward Sderot and its surroundings. IDF reports stated that three of the rockets were intercepted, while the others likely exploded in open areas. Shayetet 13 amphibious commandos found a small cache of weapons at the hospital in Jabaliya but encountered a massive concentration of terrorists – the largest found in a single location in the Gaza Strip – who were arrested simultaneously. Commanders from the 401st Armored Brigade, which led the operation, said some Hamas terrorists wore fake bandages to disguise themselves as patients. IDF ensured the safe evacuation of medical teams, hundreds of patients, as well as displaced women and children who had taken refuge in the hospital, transferring them to the Indonesian Hospital located on the outskirts of Jabaliya’s refugee camp. The raid on the hospital began about a week ago with an aerial pursuit of the facility, starting at 3:00 a.m. on Friday. Infantry fighters from the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade, alongside armored forces from the 401st Brigade, identified two terror squads attempting to flee the hospital as forces arrived and encircled the compound within an hour. Squads were eliminated from the air, and it became apparent to the forces that most of the surrounding 'civilian' buildings housed combat positions, booby traps, and hundreds of weapons. These were prepared for terrorists who were meant to emerge 'innocently' from the hospital, arm themselves in these nearby buildings, and mobilize for combat. A D9 bulldozer operator from the 401st Brigade, a career soldier with prior experience in operations at the hospital, led the route into the compound. His alertness prevented a major disaster. From the protected cabin of his massive bulldozer, he spotted a cable stretched across the road near the hospital entrance. He halted all forces and reported that he hadn’t seen the cable before. Specialized engineering units cautiously advanced to the location and identified the cable as part of a large explosive device, which was safely neutralized. 'Kamal Adwan Hospital had become a Hamas terror base. We carefully and precisely evacuated about 600 civilians from it, while thoroughly screening for terrorists,' said IDF officials. 'During the fighting on the outskirts of the hospital, forces eliminated 19 militants without any injuries among our soldiers. Hamas had heavily fortified its stronghold at the hospital. We still have follow-up tasks to complete at the site, and for now, no one will be allowed to return to it.' 'The 401st Brigade completed a targeted operation against a Hamas command center located inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital on Saturday,' a message from the IDF Spokesperson said. 'The forces launched a swift and covert operation, encircling the area of Kamal Adwan Hospital. As part of the operation, the forces carried out the safe evacuation of civilians from the area of the hospital. The area near the hospital is an active combat zone and rigged by terrorists with booby traps and explosives. During the operation, approximately 20 terrorists were eliminated, and powerful explosive devices planted by the terrorists were neutralized.' The spokesperson added: 'The operation was conducted following extensive intelligence-gathering efforts and based on various sources from the Intelligence Directorate and the ISA, which indicated the presence of hundreds of terrorists in the vicinity of the hospital. Field investigators from Unit 504 directed the apprehension process and conducted hundreds of field interrogations to transfer 240 terrorists belonging to the Islamic Jihad and Hamas terrorist organizations for further investigation in Israeli territory. The terrorists apprehended are expected to provide valuable intelligence to aid in the ongoing war efforts.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to IDF officials, this was one of the largest terrorist arrest operations conducted in a single location since the start of the war. 'During the arrests, some terrorists attempted to disguise themselves as patients, and others even hid in ambulances, but they were identified by the forces and detained. Among those arrested were 15 terrorists who participated in Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel on October 7 last year,' IDF stated. While Israeli forces operated near the hospital, terrorists fired anti-tank missiles and RPGs at the troops and attempted additional terror attacks, with no resulting casualties on the Israeli side. terrorist gunmen were eliminated in swift counterattacks. Additionally, Air Force targeted and killed militants attempting to flee the area. More than ten investigators from Unit 504 operated on the ground, utilizing advanced intelligence systems and technologies. Most of the interrogated militants were active members of the military wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Some field interrogations led, in real time, to the identification of additional operatives in the area. Humanitarian efforts Prior to the operation, according to IDF reports, 350 patients, escorts and staff were evacuated from the hospital in recent weeks in coordination with the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration. Tens of thousands of gallons of fuel, along with hundreds of food and medical supply packages, were delivered to the hospital. During the operation, in coordination with the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration and health officials, 95 patients, escorts and staff were evacuated to the Indonesian Hospital. Additionally, 1,320 gallons of fuel, two generators, and medical equipment were delivered to maintain essential services and operate the Indonesian Hospital. Hundreds of civilians were also safely evacuated from the area through organized routes to protect their safety. IDF identified Jabaliya as the core Hamas stronghold in the northern Gaza Strip, where hundreds of terrorists, including senior Hamas commanders, had concentrated. Despite earlier operations in the city –including a ground maneuver about a year ago and a raid by the 98th Division on its refugee camp in May – the military began operating in the area again approximately three months ago. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jbpek8ye	2024-12-29T10:23:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/rJWxlgkkUJg/rJWxlgkkUJg_0_128_974_549_0_small.jpg

The senior Hezbollah official's 4 mistresses and the time Netanya...	A New York Times investigation reveals the extent of the Israeli security apparatus' infiltration into Hezbollah, including new details about the exploding pager operation and the assassination of Nasrallah About a month after the cease-fire in Lebanon went into effect , a New York Times investigation published on Sunday reveals how deeply Israel has infiltrated Hezbollah and closely monitored its commanders over the years. The investigation, based on interviews with dozens of current and former senior officials in governments and intelligence agencies in Europe, the United States and Israel, reveals the broad scope of Israeli infiltration. Even up until Hassan Nasrallah's final moments , he did not believe that Israel would kill him. In late September, he moved to a bunker 12 meters underground. His aides urged him to take more extreme precautions to protect his life but, according to intelligence gathered by Israel and shared with its Western allies, he did not listen to them. He thought Israel was not interested in a full-scale war. Nasrallah also did not realize that Israeli spy agencies were tracking his every move, and had been doing so for years. It was also the result of two decades of systematic intelligence work in preparation for an all-out war that many in Israel knew would one day come. Building a network of sources The Second Lebanon War in 2006 ended in a stalemate for Israel. But actions during that war formed the basis for the current approach. In one operation, according to information provided by Israel to the United States, tracking devices were planted on Hezbollah's Fajr missiles which provided Israel with information about weapons hidden inside secret military bases, civilian storage facilities and private homes. In the 2006 war, the Israeli Air Force bombed the sites and destroyed the missiles. Ten current and former American and Israeli officials told the NYT that, as Hezbollah rebuilt itself, the Mossad expanded its network of human sources within the terrorist organization. For example, the Mossad recruited people in Lebanon who had helped Hezbollah set up its network of secret facilities and knew where they were. Those sources fed the Mossad with information about the locations of the bases and facilities, and helped the Intelligence Directorate monitor what was happening at those facilities. Israel generally shared intelligence about Hezbollah with the United States and its European allies. The place where Nasrallah was killed in Dahieh In 2012, the intelligence Unit 8200 obtained extensive information about the location of Hezbollah leaders and their hiding places. Five senior officials in European and U.S. intelligence agencies, based on a briefing they received from Israel, said that a significant moment came in 2012, when Unit 8200 was able to obtain a wealth of information about the precise whereabouts of Hezbollah leaders, their hiding places, and the organization's missile and rocket batteries. This operation raised confidence among Israeli intelligence agencies that, if Netanyahu carried out his threats to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, the IDF could help 'neuter' Hezbollah's ability to respond. Shortly after that operation, Netanyahu visited the headquarters of Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv, and during the visit, the unit's commander printed out all the information collected by the Intelligence Directorate about Hezbollah, and presented the huge pile to Netanyahu. 'You can now attack Iran,' he told Netanyahu, while standing next to the pile. Israel, as we know, ultimately did not attack. Over the next few years, Israeli intelligence agencies worked to refine the intelligence gathered from the previous operation and produce information that could be used in the event of a war with Hezbollah. According to a senior Israeli security official, when the Second Lebanon War ended in 2006, Israel had 'target files' on just under 200 Hezbollah leaders, operatives, weapons caches and missile sites. By the time Israel launched its major operation against Hezbollah in September, Israel’s target bank had grown to about 30,000. Turn pagers into deadly devices Ultimately, in order to gain an advantage in the war that was about to break out with Hezbollah, Israel also developed plans to sabotage the organization from within and to provide it with booby-trapped electronic devices. This was a joint operation by the Mossad and the Military Intelligence Directorate, especially Unit 8200, because it was designed to be included in Israel's war plan, a critical element in the IDF's calculations for a possible conflict, whether as a result of a planned attack by Israel or in response to a surprise attack by Hezbollah. Within the Israeli intelligence community, the devices were known as 'buttons' that could be activated whenever Israel chose to do so. To design and manufacture the buttons, Israeli engineers specialized in placing PETN explosives inside the batteries of electronic devices, turning them into small bombs. The most complex part of the operation was carried out by the Mossad, which for nearly a decade had tricked Hezbollah into purchasing military equipment and communications equipment from Israeli shell companies. First reports of explosions in Beirut The Mossad deceived Hezbollah, and the first pagers rigged with explosives were sent to Lebanon in 2015 In 2014, Israel had seized an opportunity when Japanese technology company iCOM stopped making its popular IC-V82 walkie-talkies. The devices, originally assembled in Osaka, Japan, were so popular that copies were already being produced across Asia and sold on online forums and in black market transactions. Seven American, Israeli and European officials told the Times that Unit 8200 had discovered that Hezbollah was specifically seeking the same device to equip all of the organization’s frontline forces, even designing a special vest for its men with a chest pocket that accommodated the device. Israel has begun producing its own copies of the IC-V82 walkie-talkies with minor modifications, including packing explosives into the batteries. The first Israeli-made copies arrived in Lebanon in 2015, and more than 15,000 were eventually shipped there. In 2018, an Israeli Mossad intelligence officer devised a plan that would use a similar technique to implant explosives into a pager battery. Israeli intelligence chiefs reviewed the plan, but according to three officials they determined that Hezbollah’s use of pagers was not widespread enough, and the plan was shelved. Over the next three years, Israel’s ability to hack cell phones improved even more, causing Hezbollah, Iran, and their allies to be more cautious about using smartphones. Concerned, Hezbollah’s leadership decided to expand its use of pagers. Such devices allowed them to send messages to forces in the field, but they did not reveal location data and did not have cameras or microphones that could be hacked. Israeli intelligence officers reconsidered the pager operation, and worked to build a network of shell companies to hide their Israeli identities and sell the products to Hezbollah. Israeli intelligence officers targeted the Taiwanese brand 'Gold Apollo,' known for the pagers it produces. In May 2022, a company called BAC Consulting was registered in Budapest, and a month later, in Sofia, Bulgaria, a company called Norta Global Ltd. was registered in the name of a Norwegian citizen named Rinson Josue. It was Unit 8200 that identified Hezbollah's need for the new product. The Mossad oversaw the production of the pagers in Israel, and through intermediaries, the organization's agents began marketing them to Hezbollah buyers - offering a discounted price for bulk purchases. During a meeting in March 2023, the Mossad presented Netanyahu with the gadget, without a hidden explosive. The prime minister was skeptical about the durability of the pagers, and asked Mossad head Dedi Barnea how easily they could break. Barnea assured him that they were strong. The prime minister was not convinced, abruptly got up from his chair and threw the device against the wall of his office. The wall cracked, but the pager did not. The Mossad front company sent the first batch of pagers to Hezbollah in the fall of 2023. War Games management The pager operation was not fully in place until October 2023, when war broke out following the surprise attack by Hamas. Even as Israel focused on Hamas, military and intelligence officials continued to work on plans for war with Hezbollah. Israeli intelligence analysts who had been closely monitoring Hezbollah’s use of the devices discovered a potential problem with the operation. According to a report provided by Israel to the United States, at least one Hezbollah technician began to suspect that the radios might contain hidden explosives. Israel quickly dealt with this and killed the technician in an airstrike. Along the way, Israel has collected routine and intimate details about Hezbollah commanders, including the identities of four mistresses of 'Hajj Muhsin,' the nickname of Fuad Shukar, considered Hezbollah’s most senior military commander who was assassinated in July . At one point this year, apparently feeling uncomfortable about his situation, Shukar sought help from Hezbollah’s top cleric in order to marry all four women, according to two Israeli and one European source. The cleric, Hashem Safi al-Din, who was also later assassinated, organized four separate, quick wedding ceremonies for Shukar, thus making the relationships acceptable. Meanwhile, new intelligence disrupted the planning: Hezbollah operatives suspected that someone had been 'tampering' with the pagers they were using. On September 11, suspicions arose that experts might be checking the devices, and Israel knew that it was only a matter of time before the covert operation would be discovered. On September 16, Netanyahu met with senior security officials to consider whether to blow up the pagers. 'Use it or lose it,' they told him. Some opposed it, saying it could provoke a full-scale counterattack by Hezbollah, and perhaps even lead to an attack by Iran. Netanyahu accepted the recommendation to act, and the next day, at 3:30 p.m. local time, the Mossad and Military Intelligence activated the system to activate the devices and send an encrypted message to the thousands of pagers. Seconds later, they exploded. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: U.S. intelligence officials concluded that the beeper incident was clearly done in a hurry, since - as Israel informed the United States - Rinson Jose, who headed one of the Mossad's front companies, was surprised to receive a warning that he was in danger while attending a technology conference in Boston. Jose was exposed in news reports as having participated in the operation, and the Norwegian government announced that it was demanding that he return to the country for questioning. Israel secretly pressured the Biden administration to ensure that Jose could leave the United States without returning to Norway, and the officials involved did not reveal his whereabouts, saying only that he was in a 'safe place.' Assassination confirmation For almost a year, the Intelligence Directorate, Unit 8200 and the Israeli Air Force conducted about 40 'war games' built around the elimination of Nasrallah and other senior Hezbollah leaders, according to two Israeli sources. They wanted to be able to attack them at the same time, even if they were not in the same place. The most significant decision was whether or not to eliminate Nasrallah. While Israeli officials debated, intelligence agencies received new information that Nasrallah was planning to move to another bunker, one that would be much harder to hit. On September 26, a few hours before Netanyahu was scheduled to fly to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, the prime minister met with his senior political, intelligence, and military advisers to discuss authorizing the assassination. They also had to decide whether to tell the Americans in advance. Netanyahu and other senior advisers opposed Israel informing the Biden administration about the assassination, as they believed that the Americans would pressure it not to carry it out, but that the United States would nevertheless come to its defense in the event that Iran retaliated for the assassination. They agreed to keep the Americans in the dark. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hylchykikg	2024-12-29T09:42:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/B1r80DRSJg/B1r80DRSJg_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

Should I say my last words?': South Korea plane crash is country...	Nearly 180 people were killed in the accident, including five children; Footage of Boeing aircraft prior to landing shows burning engines The deadliest air accident ever in South Korea killed 179 people on Sunday, when an airliner belly-landed and skidded off the end of the runway, erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall at Muan International Airport. Jeju Air (089590.KS), opens new tab flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok with 175 passengers and six crew on board, was attempting to land shortly after 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) at the airport in the south of the country, South Korea's transport ministry said. Two crew members survived and were being treated for injuries. The passengers’ age ranged from 3 to 78 and five of the victims were reported to be children below the age of 10. The deadliest air accident on South Korean soil was also the worst involving a South Korean airline in nearly three decades, according to the transport ministry. The twin-engine Boeing 737-800 was seen in local media video skidding down the runway with no visible landing gear before crashing into navigation equipment and a wall in an explosion of flames and debris. 'Only the tail part retains a little bit of shape, and the rest of (the plane) looks almost impossible to recognize,' Muan fire chief Lee Jung-hyun told a press briefing. The two crew members, a man and a woman, were rescued from the tail section of the burning plane, Lee said. They were being treated at hospitals with medium to severe injuries, said the head of the local public health center. Authorities combed nearby areas for bodies possibly thrown from the plane, Lee said. Investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors, Lee said. Yonhap news agency cited airport authorities as saying a bird strike may have caused the landing gear to malfunction. The crash was the worst for any South Korean airline since a 1997 Korean Air crash in Guam that killed more than 200 people, according to transportation ministry data. The previous worst on South Korean soil was an Air China crash that killed 129 in 2002. Experts said the bird strike report and the way the aircraft attempted to land raised more questions than answers. 'A bird strike is not unusual, problems with an undercarriage are not unusual,' said Airline News editor Geoffrey Thomas. 'Bird strikes happen far more often, but typically they don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves.' Under global aviation rules, South Korea will lead a civil investigation into the crash and automatically involve the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States where the plane was designed and built. ‘My last words’ Hours after the crash, family members gathered in the airport's arrival area, some crying and hugging as Red Cross volunteers handed out blankets. Many victims appeared to be residents of nearby areas returning from vacation, officials said. Families screamed and wept as a medic announced the names of victims identified by their fingerprints. Papers were circulated for families to write down their contact details. One relative stood at a microphone to ask for more information from authorities. 'My older brother died and I don’t know what’s going on,' he said. 'I don’t know.' Another asked journalists not to film. 'We are not monkeys in a zoo,' he said. 'We are the bereaved families.' Mortuary vehicles lined up outside to take bodies away, and authorities said a temporary morgue had been established. The crash site smelled of aviation fuel and blood, according to Reuters witnesses. Workers in protective suits and masks combed the area while soldiers searched through bushes. The control tower issued a bird strike warning and shortly afterward the pilots declared mayday and then attempted to land from the opposite direction, a transport ministry official said. A passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing, the News1 agency reported. The person's final message was: 'Should I say my last words?' The aircraft was manufactured in 2009, the transport ministry said. The two CFM56-7B26 engines were manufactured by CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace (GE.N), opens new tab and France's Safran (SAF.PA), opens new tab, the transport ministry said. A CFM spokesperson said, 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of Jeju Air flight 2216. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of those on board.' Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae apologized for the accident, bowing deeply during a televised briefing. He said the aircraft had no record of accidents and there were no early signs of malfunction. The airline will cooperate with investigators and make supporting the bereaved its top priority, Kim said. No abnormal conditions were reported when the aircraft left Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, said Kerati Kijmanawat, president of Airports of Thailand. The passengers included two Thai nationals and the rest are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation ministry. It was the first fatal flight for Jeju Air, a low-cost airline founded in 2005 that ranks behind only Korean Air Lines (003490.KS), opens new tab and Asiana Airlines in terms of the number of passengers in South Korea. The accident happened only three weeks after Jeju Air started regular flights from Muan to Bangkok and other Asian cities on Dec. 8. Muan International is one of South Korea's smallest airports but it has seen the number of international passengers jump nearly 20 times to 310,702 from January to November from the same period in 2022, according to government data. The Boeing model involved in the crash, a 737-800, is one of the world’s most flown airliners with a generally strong safety record. It was developed well before the MAX variant involved in a recent Boeing safety crisis. Boeing said in an emailed statement, 'We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew.' The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. All domestic and international flights at Muan airport were canceled, Yonhap reported. South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok, named interim leader of the country on Friday in an ongoing political crisis, arrived at the scene of the accident and said the government was putting all its resources into dealing with the crash. Two Thai women were on the plane, aged 22 and 45, Thai government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub said.

Staff Sergeant Yuval Shoham, 22, was killed in Jabaliya	He is the 9th graduate of Jerusalem's Himmelfarb High School to die in this war; His parents are close friends of Jon and Rachel, the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was murdered in Hamas captivity Staff Sergeant Yuval Shoham, 22, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the 9th Armored Battalion, 401st Iron Tracks Brigade, fell Sunday during combat in Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip, 'The boy is gone and I, where can I go,' the family announced, quoting the biblical statement by Reuben when he returns to the pit to rescue his brother Joseph only to find that he has beeen sold into slavery. 'Yuval Shoham, our dearly beloved son, was killed this morning in the Gaza Strip. Funeral details will be provided later.' Yuval is a graduate of Himmelfarb High School in Jerusalem, and is the ninth of its graduates to fall in the war. The school also lost Rabbi Avi Goldberg, who fell during the war and served as a teacher at the high school. Yuval's parents, Effi and Oshrat Shoham, leaders of the Hakhel synagogue community in the Baka neighborhood of Jerusalem, are close friends of Jon and Rachel, the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was murdered in Hamas captivity in Gaza, and whose body was rescued and returned to Israel. 'Hersh was here on Simchat Torah Eve. On Simchat Torah night, he was still here in the synagogue and danced here,' Oshrat said last September, after the announcement that he had been killed in captivity. 'Yesterday night, we realized with all the rumors what was happening. People from the community didn't sleep all night. At 5 a.m. we heard the news. We accompany the Goldberg-Polin family all year. Here Jon prays. Here Hersh prayed. This morning we spontaneously organized to create a space for the community. It really feels like he's our son. Everyone is very involved in the struggle. The whole neighborhood is here with Hersh signs. We didn't think it would end like this. Everyone was hoping that we would meet in the joy of liberation and not in this end. We didn't imagine such an end.' On Saturday, the IDF and Shin Bet spokespersons announced that security forces completed a joint operation at Hamas' 'terror headquarters' at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya and arrested more than 240 terrorists in the area. 'A targeted operation against terrorist targets was carried out at the hospital, following intelligence information that the area had once again been used as a Hamas terror stronghold and a shelter for terrorists, despite repeated calls to refrain from military use of medical facilities.' The joint statement also said that the forces of the 13th Battalion operated inside the hospital, and located weapons, including grenades, pistols and ammunition. 'During the operation in the area, over 240 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists and other operatives suspected of terror activities were apprehended, some of whom attempted to pose as patients or flee using ambulances,' according to the statement. 'Among the suspects taken for questioning was the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, who is suspected of being a Hamas terrorist operative, as well as Hamas engineering and anti-tank missile operatives, and approximately 15 terrorists who infiltrated Israel during the October 7th massacre.'

At the beginning of the operation, the forces of the 401st Brigade surrounded the hospital, arrested terrorists hiding in the area, and eliminated additional terrorists. The hospital was surrounded within an hour, and during the operation in the area, an anti-tank missile was fired at a force from Battalion 52. There were no casualties in the anti-tank incident. In initial field investigations by Unit 504 field investigators and Shin Bet coordinators, many terrorists who left the hospital testified that they had taken part in terrorist activity in the area. This was an extraordinary activity by Unit 504, in which the largest concentration of terrorists was investigated in one day and in one place since the beginning of the war. More than 10 investigators from the unit were active in the field, using intelligence knowledge systems and advanced technologies, and most of the terrorists who were interrogated were operatives in the military wing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

Houthis make arrests fearing 'Israeli infiltration', report says	Arabic-language news outlet claims Iran-backed terror group fears Israeli intelligence operations that could lead to targeted assassinations against its leadership; Arrests come days after Houthis claimed to have uncovered a spy network in Yemen led by the CIA and Mossad UK-based Arabic-language outlet Asharq Al-Awsat on Sunday reported that Yemen’s Houthis carried out arrests in the provinces of Saada, Sanaa and Hodeidah over fears of 'Israeli infiltration' into their ranks. According to the report, the Houthis are concerned that the terror organization’s senior leaders could be targeted as Hezbollah leaders were in Lebanon. The report noted that the arrests came only days after the Houthis claimed to have uncovered a spy network in Yemen allegedly led by international intelligence agencies including the CIA and Mossad. 'The enemy tasked the spies with conducting intelligence operations, including surveillance and pinpointing the locations of missiles, drones, naval forces and other military sites,' according to the Houthis. They also alleged the 'spies' were instructed to track and locate military, political and security leaders, as well as prominent social figures. Sources told the outlet that the Houthis are in a state of panic due to the collapse of the Iranian axis and that the arrests are meant to 'spread terror' in Yemen to suppress opposition activity and prevent the possibility of a coup, similar to events in Syria with the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. According to these sources, the Houthis are using 'Israeli threats' as a pretext to detain civilians. The arrests come amid threats against the Houthis by Defense Minister Israel Katz following his statement last week. 'We will strike the strategic infrastructure of the Houthi terror organization and eliminate its leaders — just as we did to [Ismail] Haniyeh, [Yahya] Sinwar and [Hassan] Nasrallah — in Tehran, Gaza and Lebanon. We'll do the same in Hodeidah and Sanaa,' Katz said at the time. One example of the Houthis’ concerns can be seen in a post by senior Houthi figure Hazam al-Assad, who shared images of the terror organization’s senior members featured in the report, saying: 'They’re the ones who should be worried and afraid. We will not stop supporting our people in Gaza.'

Civil war: Trump supporters clash as Musk supports worker visas	Discussion on the incoming Trump administration's policies on immigration spark war on social media as Musk seems to go against the president-elect's 'America first' principle U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s camp has been celebrating the achievement and preparing for his return to the White House next month ever since his election victory. Over the weekend, however, significant cracks emerged within his camp as his most prominent supporter clashed openly with others over immigration policy. Trump’s most vocal supporters likely didn’t anticipate a confrontation with Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who helped fuel Trump’s presidential run. Musk has been outspoken in his support for Trump’s plans for mass deportations and stringent immigration restrictions. Yet, it now seems he has one major caveat: the H1B visa, which allows foreign workers with academic or technical expertise to work in the U.S. for up to six years. This visa is a cornerstone of Silicon Valley, enabling tech professionals from around the world, including many Israelis, to live and work in the U.S. Amid a firestorm on X, Musk wrote to Trump supporters: 'F*** yourself in the face.' The controversy was sparked by Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who had been close to Trump during the campaign. She criticized Trump’s decision to appoint Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born tech entrepreneur as an advisor on artificial intelligence. Loomer highlighted Krishnan’s advocacy for lifting green card restrictions and easing the hiring of skilled foreign workers, calling these views 'directly opposed to Trump’s agenda.' Tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who will co-chair a Trump-appointed Department of Government Efficiency alongside Musk, defended the use of skilled foreign labor, saying, 'The U.S. doesn’t produce enough skilled workers and pretending otherwise will let China kick our a**.' Musk added: 'The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low.' Musk quickly realized the issue’s delicate nature as his comments alienated many Trump supporters and proponents of the 'America First' ideology. Far-right figure Ann Coulter attacked Musk, claiming he prefers H1B workers because they’re bound to their employers and can’t leave, unlike Americans. 'People like him want contract slaves,' she said, while others pointed out that Musk himself, now a U.S. citizen, is a South African immigrant. After several X users told Musk to 'go back to Africa,' he erupted on Friday, tweeting: 'The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B. Take a big step back and F*CK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.' Musk, who claimed he bought Twitter to preserve free speech online, retaliated on Saturday by showing just how little he values the principle: Loomer and others who criticized him lost their exclusive 'blue checkmarks' on the platform. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During his first term, Trump imposed significant restrictions on the H1B visa, but didn’t owe his victory to Musk at the time. In the early days of the current internal conflict, Trump refrained from intervening. However, in an interview published in the New York Post on Saturday, he appeared to side with Musk on this issue, praising the use of H1B visas. 'I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,' he said, despite having criticized them harshly in the past as 'very bad' and 'unfair' to American workers. 'I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,' Trump told the outlet. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1mltyyikl	2024-12-29T07:22:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/HJdoqQQ7kl/HJdoqQQ7kl_0_38_2205_1241_0_small.jpg

German politicians decry Elon Musk's AfD support as 'intrusive' e...	U.S. billionaire Elon Musk drew criticism from German politicians from the government and opposition on Sunday for an opinion piece he wrote backing the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) which they deemed 'intrusive' outside influence. The support of the AfD from Musk, who is set to serve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration as an outside adviser, comes as Germans are set to vote on Feb. 23 after a coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. The commentary published in German in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, flagship of the Axel Springer media group, expanded on a post by Musk on social media platform X last week in which he wrote 'only the AfD can save Germany' and praised the party's approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation. In response to the publication of his commentary, the editor of the newspaper's opinion section said on X that she had resigned. Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats and current favorite to succeed Scholz as chancellor, said in an interview with the Funke Media Group: 'I cannot recall a comparable case of interference, in the history of Western democracies, in the election campaign of a friendly country.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1t6klk8ye	2024-12-29T07:06:45-08:00

Palestinian woman killed in gun battle between Hamas and PA	Hamas accuses Palestinian Authority security forces of killing Shatha al-Sabbagh, whose brother was a member of the group’s armed wing in Jenin; PA denies involvement, blaming 'lawless individuals' for the shooting Shatha al-Sabbagh, a communication student, was fatally shot in the head Saturday night in the Jenin refugee camp, reportedly by a sniper linked to Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces, according to the Hamas-affiliated Palestinian news agency Shehab. In response to her death, Jenin authorities declared a general strike in the city for Sunday. Her brother, Moatasem Sabbagh, was a known member of Hamas’ Jenin Brigade and was killed in an earlier exchange of gunfire with PA security forces. The incident has reignited tensions between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. Anwar Rajab, the official spokesperson for PA security forces, denied PA involvement in the killing, condemning it as 'a heinous crime committed by lawless individuals who fired indiscriminately, resulting in Shatha's death and damage to a nearby house.' Rajab affirmed the PA’s commitment to enforcing the rule of law, pledging a swift investigation to bring those responsible to justice. He urged residents to cooperate with authorities and provide any information that could assist in identifying the perpetrators. The initial reports of Shatha’s death were circulated by Hamas-affiliated media, which frequently criticizes PA security forces, particularly since the PA launched a major crackdown on terror groups in Jenin. Hamas issued its own statement, condemning the killing and accusing PA security forces of escalating violence in the refugee camp. 'This heinous crime led to her death,' the Hamas statement read. 'We reiterate our demand for the Palestinian Authority to cease attacks on our people in the camp, to embrace national initiatives to avoid further clashes, and to prevent the spilling of Palestinian blood.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas later acknowledged that Shatha’s brother was a member of its military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades. The group accused the PA of deliberately targeting her. 'The PA security forces killed the sister of our martyred Qassami fighter, Moatasem, in cold blood,' the statement said. 'This criminal act is yet another addition to a dark record of actions against our people, including killings, arrests and torture.' Shatha’s family also held the PA and its security forces directly responsible. 'We see this as a premeditated crime,' the family said in a statement. 'This dangerous escalation reveals the transformation of the PA security apparatus into an oppressive force that terrorizes its own people instead of protecting their dignity.' The PA’s operation in Jenin began roughly three weeks ago and has targeted militants accused of terrorism, arms trafficking, and attacks on PA security personnel. The campaign has resulted in the deaths of five PA officers and the arrest of numerous suspects linked to militant activities, including members of the Islamic Jihad. The killing of Shatha Sabbagh has further inflamed the already volatile situation in Jenin, deepening divisions among Palestinian factions and highlighting the fraught relationship between the PA and armed groups operating in the West Bank. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1s0yarbjl	2024-12-29T05:53:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/BygjGq0Hyl/BygjGq0Hyl_268_181_379_214_0_small.jpg

Hostage release talks on verge of collapse, report	Egyptian sources tell Qatari outlet that if Israel does not alter its position, talks will fail; members of negotiating team tell families they recommend comprehensive deal to free all 100 captives, say they are bound by silence while PM tells world war will not end The talks to reach a hostage release deal and cease-fire in Gaza are on the verge of collapse, the Qatari owned Al Arabi channel reported on Sunday quoting Egyptian sources. The sources blamed Israel and said that if the government does not change its conduct, the talks will fail. At the same time officials in the negotiation team told members of family of hostages that there is a gap between them and the government. 'While the negotiating team's professional view is that there must be a deal to return all of those held captive, dead or alive, the ministers insist on a partial deal that would see only some of the hostages freed,' the officials said. 'The team was sent without a mandate to negotiate an end to the war, despite the fact that it is the main demand of Hamas in exchange for all 100 hostages.' In their conversation with the families, the officials said they were instructed to remain silent about the negotiations while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made public statements to the foreign media, promising the war would not end.

Erin Molan challenges Pope Francis: ‘What should Israel do instea...	Former Sky News correspondent to the pope: ‘Use every iota of the considerable power you have to help end this war’ Former Australian Sky News correspondent Erin Molan has issued an impassioned plea to Pope Francis, urging him to leverage his global influence to help end the war between Israel and Hamas and to secure the release of hostages held by the terror group. 'Use every iota of the considerable power you have to help end this war, fight to bring the hostages home, and repeatedly condemn the terrorists who stole them,' Molan implored in a YouTube monologue published over the weekend. 'It would be the greatest light you could bring to the world. For Israel, yes; for the children of Gaza, absolutely; for all who value life, many of whom are understandably starting to lose hope. 'This is not just a moral mission, but a sacred one,' she continued. 'Your Holiness, it’s time. It’s time to help bring them home and end this war. For the sake of all children around the world and for the sake of humanity.' Molan’s appeal comes amid growing tensions between Israel and the Pope following his recent controversial comments about the conflict. The Pope has accused Israel of genocide in Gaza, described its actions as 'cruel,' and claimed that children were being 'machine-gunned down.' These statements have drawn sharp criticism from pro-Israel voices and from Israeli leaders. The former Sky News journalist was recently in Israel to visit communities near the southern border, meet with President Isaac Herzog, and receive briefings from top leaders. During her trip, she interviewed with Ynet News and delivered an opening monologue for ILTV. Molan’s tenure at Sky News ended abruptly, sparking speculation that her termination was linked to her vocal support for Israel. While the network has denied this claim, critics have suggested that her pro-Israel stance played a role in the decision. Her plea to the Pope underscored her deep concern for the hostages and her frustration with global leadership. She emphasized, 'This is a moment for moral clarity,' urging Pope Francis to prioritize the plight of the hostages and work towards a resolution to the conflict. Molan directly confronted Pope Francis, stating that his voice is not aiding the situation but is instead a 'detriment' to the Palestinians he claims to care about. 'You lament the deaths of children in Gaza, describing their suffering as cruel—as it is, you are absolutely spot on. It is utterly devastating. The issue I have is you seemingly lay the blame, the responsibility for this cruelty, solely at the feet of Israel, which, and I say this, I promise you, with the utmost respect, you are wrong,' Molan said. 'Israel is not perfect. No country is. Every single nation involved in war will make mistakes, and some individuals, whether they be in command or troops on the ground, will do the wrong thing. History has shown us that is a certainty, no matter how justified or noble the cause may be. But the difference between them, the democratic nation, and Hamas, the terrorists, is those from Israel who do the wrong thing will be held to account.' She underscored reports by the United States and other sources showing that Israel takes extensive measures to minimize civilian casualties, even when facing an enemy that actively targets civilians. Molan emphasized that the war could end if Hamas returned the hostages and laid down its arms. She reminded her audience that Hamas initiated this conflict on October 7, 2023, when they entered Israel, brutally killing 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 250. Molan also pointed out the equal worth of children on both sides of the conflict and that all children suffer so long as the conflict continues. 'No child in the Middle East will ever have peace whilst terrorism is allowed to flourish,' Molan said. 'The people of Israel cannot allow Hamas to exist, to rebuild, and rearm again. Their mission statement is to kill Jews and destroy Israel. It’s not subtle. They don’t hide it. They don’t disguise it and show it very clearly by their actions.' She challenged Pope Francis directly, asking what he believes Israel should do if not what it is already doing. She also warned him of the broader implications of inaction, reminding him that terrorism would eventually reach the West, possibly even his community. 'The Western world is not immune to the evil we witnessed on October 7,' Molan said. 'We are already seeing elements of it in Europe and America, Canada, and Australia, and the longer we accept what occurred, sit idly by, and in some cases, inexplicably defend it, the more widespread the carnage will become.' Molan concluded with a plea for action, emphasizing the power of the Pope’s platform. 'What you say and do matters,' she said. 'You are respected and revered around the world, and rightly so. I implore you to help end the cruelty you speak of suffered by children in Gaza. Please use your formidable voice and platform to put pressure on the terrorists, those actually responsible for their heartbreaking pain.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylif6aske	2024-12-29T03:45:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/HkQ7EpRS1g/HkQ7EpRS1g_0_0_698_398_0_small.jpg
Syria's de facto leader says holding elections could take up to f...	New Syria leader says in the first interview dealing with elections in Syria that drafting of new constitution could take up to three years Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in remarks to be broadcast on Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible electoral timetable since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month. Drafting a new constitution could take up to three years, Sharaa said in written excerpts from the interview with the Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya, due to be transmitted later on Sunday. He also said it would take about a year for Syrians to see drastic changes. The comment from Sharaa, who leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that ousted Assad on Dec. 8, comes as the new government in Damascus has been seeking to reassure its neighbors that it has moved away from its roots in Islamist militancy. The group's lightning campaign ended a 13-year civil war but has left a host of questions about the future of a multi-ethnic country previously held together by decades of authoritarian Assad family rule, and where foreign states including Turkey and Russia have strong and potentially competing interests. While Western powers largely welcomed the end of Assad family rule in Syria, it remains unclear whether the group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move towards democracy. Sharaa said HTS, formerly known as the Nusra Front, would be dissolved at a national dialogue conference. The group was once affiliated with Islamic State and al-Qaeda but has since renounced both and sought to reposition itself as a force for moderation. It has repeatedly vowed to protect minority groups, who fear the new rulers could seek to impose an Islamist government and has warned of attempts to incite sectarian strife. In the interview, Sharaa said Syria shared strategic interests with Russia, a close Assad ally during the long civil war which has military bases in the country, reiterating conciliatory signals his government has made previously. Sharaa said earlier this month that Syria's relations with Russia should serve common interests. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the status of Russia's military bases would be the subject of negotiations with the new leadership in Damascus. 'It is a question not only of maintaining our bases or strongholds, but also of the conditions of their operation, maintenance and provision, and interaction with the local side,' he said in an interview with Russian news agency RIA published on Sunday. Sharaa also said he hoped the administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on Syria. Senior U.S. diplomats who visited Damascus this month said Sharaa came across as pragmatic and that Washington has decided to remove a $10 million bounty on the HTS leader's head. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rknxzarr1g	2024-12-29T03:40:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/S1znMXmur1l/S1znMXmur1l_0_187_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Babak, lock the door' - Journalist under threat from Iran hears ...	Babak Eshaghi says was not surprised to learn of Iranian plot to abduct him after being warned by and under protection of Israeli security; says his Saudi funded opposition channel reaches anywhere in Iran and is watched by many considering it reliable source 'I was not surprised,' Iran International reporter Babak Eshaghi said after a plot to kidnap and assassinate him was revealed on Saturday. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) tried to lure him to Turkey and take him across the border to Iran. 'When you are considered in Tehran to be a terror organization, you behave accordingly,' he told Ynet in an interview on Sunday. According to IranWire, an opposition outlet, the IRGC devised a scheme to lure several Iran International journalists to a border region near Iran and abduct them into Iranian territory. The outlet based its report on details from the interrogation of Mohammad Hashemzadeh, a former Iranian political prisoner currently detained in Armenia. 'I've been under threat and am in contact with Israeli intelligence and security agencies. They have been keeping me updated and I consult with them before leaving the country,' he said. 'I trust them.' Eshaghi said this was not the first time that the Iranian regime tried to harm reporters for Iran International an outlet that is funded by Saudi Arabia. 'A number of months ago, members of the regime stabbed a colleague of mine in London and a year ago, a plot to attack the building housing our newspaper was uncovered. I received a call at home a few months back and the caller told me to lock the doors. I did and walked to the window to look outside. I saw police checking something. When I asked what was going on they told me there was a suspicious object outside. Now when we see at least five different cases of Israelis willing to work for Iran in exchange for payment, Iran could be and was behind this.' In the interview Eshaghi said he once received a message on WhatsApp from Professor Meir Litvak inviting him to a meeting, only the message came when he was sitting in a hall listening to the professor's lecture. 'I spoke to him later and realized the Iranians had breached his app and were sending messages. This is a small incident. There are many more,' he said. We broadcast to Iran over some 15 satellites and no one can block us,' he said. 'Even the most remote villages receive our transmissions using a small dish.

Rescued hostage reported hearing Hebrew during captivity, IDF say...	Information given to the families of six hostages executed by Hamas near the tunnel where Kaid Farhan Alkadi was found and extracted; IDF says suspended all operations using sensors to locate hostages but none were found until bodies discovered The IDF informed families of hostages executed by Hamas in Gaza that Kaid Farhan Alkadi who was rescued by forces in August told the troops that he had heard the voice of a female speaking Hebrew nearby. Later six Israelis were found executed in a Rafah tunnel. The information was given to the families of the six slain hostages last week and was not made known to the general public until a report on local channel 12 on Saturday. The military apologized for withholding the information. They said Alkadi had told the rescuers that he had been held in seclusion and had not seen any other hostages. Alkadi was found on his own after his captors escaped. The IDF said that his report of voices would not have changed the fate of the hostages because the military suspended all operations for 24-hours to assess the situation before continuing their offensive. At that time sensors were activated and there was no indication that any other hostages were nearby.

IDF officers warn against military stay in Syria|	Intelligence suggests terrorist cells are planning to target troops on the Syrian Golan; forces struggle to find purpose in their current mission; 'troops are frustrated by a mission without a visible enemy or meaningful operations' IDF commanders warned a prolonged stay of troops in the Syrian Golan Heights would lead to escalation of violence. After a relatively calm and optimistic start to the IDF’s deployment in the Syrian Golan, marked by a bloodless takeover and constructive dialogues with local Syrian leaders, tensions have escalated. Over the past week, two significant incidents involving IDF soldiers and Syrian protesters have highlighted growing unrest. Military commanders describe an operational environment lacking clear objectives, with soldiers stationed at static positions as far as 18–20 kilometers from the border. 'It’s only a matter of time before we face a surprise anti-tank missile or mortar fire,' said a senior IDF officer in the Northern Command. 'Troops are frustrated by a mission without a visible enemy or meaningful operations, especially after transitioning from intense combat against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.' The IDF presence, including daily tank movements through villages, has drawn protests. In one incident near Quneitra, IDF soldiers fired at demonstrators, injuring at least one person. The IDF claims troops felt threatened and emphasized efforts to de-escalate, aiming to engage positively with the 70,000 Syrians living in the area. Israeli intelligence has detected early signs that Islamist rebel groups from southern Syria, including near Daraa, are considering moving toward the Golan. While no militant cells have been spotted near the IDF positions, commanders are wary of armed groups exploiting the situation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The military has focused on disarming local communities, collecting hundreds of weapons left behind by fleeing Syrian army forces. In some cases, villagers have cooperated, recalling Israel’s humanitarian aid during the Syrian civil war. However, resistance persists in areas like Jubbata al-Khashab, where the IDF issued an ultimatum for residents to surrender arms or face military action. In response to regional complexities, the IDF has committed two regular brigades to the Golan, avoiding additional reserve deployments. The mission, part of a 'forward defense' strategy, aims to prevent terrorist organizations from establishing a foothold along the border. The IDF has also extended protective measures to Druze communities in southern Syria, including Hader near Mount Hermon, signaling support amid threats from Salafist groups. Meanwhile, Syria’s de facto leader, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, continues consolidating power, reshaping alliances, and overseeing clashes between rebels and pro-Assad forces in Alawite strongholds. As the situation unfolds, the IDF remains focused on balancing security needs with the broader goal of maintaining stability in the volatile region. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkxcyuchyg	2024-12-28T22:13:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/B11120yP0B1g/B11120yP0B1g_448_457_2284_1285_0_small.jpg
Brazilian Congress defies Lula da Silva, strengthens ties with Is...	Senator Carlos Viana: 'Brazilians and Israelis share a brotherly bond. We stand firmly against anti-Semitism and international terrorism' In a bold move opposing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian parliament has strengthened its legislative ties with Israel. Earlier this month, the Brazilian Israel Allies Caucus expanded to include the Senate in Brasilia under the leadership of Senator Carlos Viana, transforming into a bicameral group of 78 parliamentarians. This development comes as relations between Brazil and Israel have reached historic lows, with the president accusing Israel of genocide and likening its actions in Gaza to the Holocaust. The expansion underscores the growing divide between the Brazilian Congress and the president. 'Brazilians and Israelis share a brotherly bond. We stand firmly against anti-Semitism and international terrorism, and today, we reaffirm our commitment to a free, democratic, and secure world,' Viana said. Viana also highlighted the historical connection between the two nations, recalling Brazil’s significant role in the establishment of the State of Israel. Brazil’s then-UN ambassador, Oswaldo Aranha, presided over and voted for UN Resolution 181, which approved the partition plan for Palestine on November 29, 1947. 'We stand with Israel and always will,' Viana declared. This is not the first time Viana has taken a strong stand in support of Israel and against Silva. In December last year, he led a solidarity mission of Brazilian lawmakers to Israel following the October 7 massacre. At the time, Viana stated, 'We want to make it clear to the people of Israel that we do not agree with the recent statements made by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva regarding the State of Israel and the Hamas terrorist group.' He added, 'We assert that Israel has the right to defend itself, to position itself, and to exist.' Silva has faced international criticism for comparing Israel to Hitler and the Nazis. He also falsely claimed that more than 12 million children had died in Gaza and Israel—an implausible figure, given the Gaza Strip’s population of approximately 2.3 million. Since then, Brazil has recalled its ambassador to Israel, and Israel declared Silva unwelcome in the country. Israeli-Brazilian relations had flourished during the tenure of former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro. Moreover, a February poll conducted by CNN Brasil revealed that 57% of the 800 respondents believed Israel was on the right side in its conflict with Hamas, while 26% said Brazil should actively support Israel in the conflict. Representative Geovania de Sá, who has chaired the pro-Israel caucus for nearly a decade, described the creation of the bicameral caucus as 'an important milestone in strengthening our partnership with Israel.' Joshua Reinstein, president of the Israel Allies Foundation, which supports the Brazilian caucus along with 53 similar bodies worldwide, praised the parliamentarians for their initiative. He emphasized the importance of their support during a challenging period for Israel. 'The new bicameral caucus is very important for Israel, especially at a time when we are under military and diplomatic attack,' Reinstein said. 'I thank Senator Carlos Viana and Congresswoman Geovania de Sá for mobilizing Brazilian deputies and senators to support Israel through faith-based diplomacy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1w7bwcskg	2024-12-28T20:50:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/HkJeQDCBke/HkJeQDCBke_2_0_1599_901_0_small.jpg

Physical abuse, torture, psychological terror, starvation, in Israel's report to the UN; teens beaten in their genitals, suffering burns; hostages witness others being murdered; Caution: hard to read content 'Teenagers were forced to commit sexual acts on each other, most women were sexually assaulted': This was described in the harrowing report spread over eight pages, that includes horrific testimony of hostages who were freed from Hamas captivity. The report that was prepared by the Health Ministry was submitted to the UN last week. It describes neglect, abuse, torture and humiliation that the hostages endured. The report begins with a description of the massacre of October 7, 2023, in the communities near the Gaza border. 'The abduction of children, women, men, and the elderly from their homes is a traumatic event, often occurring after the murder of family members or close friends. In some cases, children were taken without their parents or after their parents' murder. The terrorists caused widespread destruction, with hostages witnessing their homes burning, acts of rape and looting which took place in their communities. The captives were transported to Gaza in open vehicles, often alongside the bodies of those murdered. They endured beatings, humiliation, and verbal, physical, and sexual violence during the journey. Seven weeks after the atrocities, a deal to release hostages began. It spanned seven phases. The report notes that in the exchange, 105 hostages – 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals including 37 children (22 girls and 15 boys,) 16 elderly women and 52 adults including 27 women and 25 men, were released. In the ensuing months, one woman and four men were rescued alive and the bodies of 15 men and women were extracted from Gaza. Beating, isolation, branding, sexual assault Women, men, and children who returned from captivity reported that they endured severe physical and sexual abuse, such as beatings, isolation, deprivation of food and water, branding, hair-pulling, and sexual assault. Additionally, some of them reported that the captors sexually assaulted them or forced them to undress. 'Two of the children that were held together during captivity reported that they were held bound and were beaten throughout their captivity. Signs of binding, scars, and marks consistent with trauma were found. Additionally, two young children had burn marks on their lower limbs. One child stated that the burns were the result of a deliberate branding with a heated object. 'Both the child and adults who were with him in captivity described the incident as a purposeful branding event, not an accident. It was described as an extremely traumatic experience. Cases of Physical and Sexual Violence Against Women and Men One of the returned hostages described being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by a Hamas terrorist. 'On several occasions, captors forced women of all ages to undress while others, including the captors, watched. Some women reported that the captors sexually assaulted them. In addition, some women reported that they were tied to beds while their captors stared at them. Another woman, injured during the attack, was held in a dark isolation for 30 days, bound and unable to move. She had no contact with the outside world, received an inadequate amount of food and water, and did not receive treatment for her injury. Other women also reported starvation and abuse by their captors The men endured severe physical abuse, including continuous starvation, beatings, burns with galvanized iron (branding), hair-pulling, confinement in closed rooms with a limited amount of food and water, being held in isolation with hands and feet tied, and being denied access to the bathroom, which forced them to defecate on themselves.' The report describes how the hostages were deprived of medical treatment. ' The hostages were denied medical treatment for acute injuries caused during October 7 and subsequently, in addition to for untreated chronic conditions. Fractures, shrapnel wounds, and burns were treated inadequately, leading to complications which required additional surgeries, that could have been prevented with proper care. Upon arrival in Israel, intensive treatment was given to the returned hostages. The captors also tortured those injured by performing painful procedures without anesthesia. Many hostages also suffered from untreated chronic conditions (e.g., heart failure, diabetes, hypothyroidism), leading to severe short-term medical deterioration, such as low blood pressure, bradycardia, and hypothermia. In one case a hostage died from untreated medical complications. Also, several older women required urgent life-saving treatment due to untreated hypertension and hypothyroidism.' Starvation of hostages was deliberate, the report said. 'About half of the returned hostages described being deliberately starved during their captivity. They were given a poor diet, which often led to hunger that worsened over time. In addition to inadequate nutrition, they were kept in dark spaces, increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency. This malnutrition resulted in an average weight loss of 815 kg (10-17% of body weight), with children losing an average of 10%, and in one extreme case, a girl lost 18% of her body weight. Poor nutrition may lead to Sarcopenia, delayed wound and fracture recovery, and a weakened immune system. Malnutrition also negatively impacted cognitive function and mental health, and as for children, it may hinder development and growth.' Ahead of their release their captors attempted to improve some of the hostages' appearance and weight. ' Those who received excess food before returning to Israel were at risk of Refeeding Syndrome and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, particularly among elderly hostages. 'In cases with complex medical backgrounds, these electrolyte disorders can be life-threatening. Additionally, the hostages were denied essential medications and treatment for their injuries, leading to the risk of widespread metabolic disorders. The poor quality of food and water, combined with unsanitary conditions, led to increased morbidity among the hostages. Many suffered from diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sometimes constipation. They had limited access to showers and returned with skin infections, including Dermatitis. Infections were detected in hospital cultures (Clostridium, Salmonella, Vibrio, Shigella, Giardia, E. coli). Some were diagnosed with Q fever, while two returned hostages suffered from acute case of Q fever. Several of the elderly women developed Deep Venous Thrombosis due to age, pre-existing medical conditions without medication, and lack of mobility during captivity.' Returning hostages suffered survivors guilt The released hostages suffered survivor's guilt and trauma. Children refused to be parted from their mothers for even minutes. 'Some returned hostages had paranoid anxieties, fearing retaliation against their loved ones still in captivity if they spoke about their experiences. The inability to share their trauma with therapeutic factors, which made it harder to process their trauma. The returned hostages have been experiencing 'survivor's guilt,' feeling responsible for being rescued while their loved ones remain in Gaza. This guilt delays their return to routine and rehabilitation. Some wish to return to captivity to help those left behind, feeling they are 'not rehabilitated' as long as their loved ones are still there. The concern for those remaining is unbearable for them and their families. Many returned hostages experience fear, restlessness, emotional detachment, and confusion. Some were afraid to leave their rooms, even in the hospital's protected areas. They struggled to let go of behaviors from captivity, like barely eating and neglecting hygiene. 'Others hoarded food, fearing they would not have enough for the next day, despite knowing this was irrational. The returned hostages also reported severe nightmares and sleep deprivation, trying to avoid repeating nightmares. Some experienced derealization, struggling to accept their presence in the Israeli hospital as real, rather than a dream from captivity. They avoided anything that reminded them of their traumatic experiences, including certain foods.'

'These are actions that cannot be tolerated and demand that the world wake up and take action. The report highlights the horrors the hostages endured and reveals to the world the brutality of the enemy with whom Israel is engaged. The testimonies presented in this report serve as a wake-up call for the international community to apply increased pressure on Hamas and its supporters to free all the hostages without delay. I urge the global community to utilize all available means to end this cruelty and bring the hostages home immediately. It is a moral and humanitarian imperative, and the time to act is running out.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1cbi8asje	2024-12-28T20:16:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/10/ByxeWlM030/ByxeWlM030_0_0_1600_1066_0_small.jpg
At least 62 dead, two crew rescued in fiery South Korea airliner ...	Video shared by local media showed the twin-engine aircraft skidding down the runway with no apparent landing gear before slamming into a wall in an explosion of flame and debris At least 62 people were killed when an airliner veered off the runway and erupted into a fireball as it slammed into a wall at South Korea's Muan International Airport on Sunday, the national fire agency said. Two people were rescued, the agency said. The crash occurred as Jeju Air flight 7C2216, carrying 175 passengers and six crew on a flight from the Thai capital Bangkok, was landing shortly after 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) at the airport in the south of the country, South Korea's transport ministry said. The ministry did not confirm the reports of casualties. At least 58 bodies have been recovered but that number is not final, another fire official told Reuters. Two people were found alive and rescue operations were under way, a Muan fire official said. Yonhap news agency said three people had been rescued. Authorities were working to rescue people in the tail section, an airport official told Reuters shortly after the crash. Video shared by local media showed the twin-engine aircraft skidding down the runway with no apparent landing gear before slamming into a wall in an explosion of flame and debris. Other photos showed smoke and fire engulfing parts of the plane. Yonhap cited airport authorities as saying the landing gear may have malfunctioned due to a bird strike. A passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing, agency News1 reported. The person's final message was, 'Should I say my last words?' Bird strike is among several theories that have not been verified, an official from the transport ministry's aviation department said, adding that the investigation was ongoing. The passengers included two Thai nationals and the rest are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation ministry. The plane was a Boeing 737-800 jet operated by Jeju Air, which was seeking details of the accident, including its casualties and cause, an airline spokesperson said. Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment. All domestic and international flights at Muan airport had been cancelled, Yonhap reported. South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok, who was named interim leader of the country on Friday after the previous acting president was impeached amid an ongoing political crisis, ordered all-out rescue efforts, his office said. His chief of staff convened an emergency meeting.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skia00r0ryg	2024-12-28T19:07:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/Sybt01E0r1e/Sybt01E0r1e_0_0_800_601_0_small.jpg

Lights of Hope virtual event: Illuminating the path to 2025	ILTV and Ynet News are proud to present the Lights of Hope virtual event, streaming live on Monday, December 30 ILTV and Ynet News are proud to present the Lights of Hope virtual event, streaming live on Monday, December 30, at 9 p.m. (Israel time). The event will be available on the Ynet News homepage, ILTV News YouTube channel, and other platforms. Featuring eight inspiring panels, the event symbolizes the eight candles of the menorah, each representing a light of hope for the coming year. The themes of the panels are: Security, Regional Stability, Tikkun Olam, Sustainability, Education, Innovation, Sports, and Community. The goal is to spotlight areas where Israel and the Jewish people can find light and inspiration as they move forward into 2025. The evening will begin with a special message from President Isaac Herzog and include interviews with Ministers Amichai Chikli and Ofir Sofer. This year, Chanukah and New Year’s Eve coincide, creating a unique opportunity to celebrate both the Jewish Festival of Lights and the hope for a brighter year ahead. After a challenging 2024, marked by war and adversity, 2025 offers the promise of renewal and recovery for Israel. 'The year 2024 has been an unprecedented year for Israel,' said Maayan Hoffman, Executive Editor of ILTV. 'We’ve faced a war on seven fronts, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers defending against Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other threats. At the same time, we’ve fought another battle—a war of words on social media and in the media. These platforms have not only amplified antisemitism and anti-Zionist rhetoric but have also incited violence.' Hoffman emphasized that Chanukah serves as a reminder of resilience and miracles. 'Chanukah celebrates the courage of the Maccabees, who triumphed against overwhelming odds to preserve Judaism. It’s a holiday of light and miracles—the oil that should have burned for one day lasted eight, illuminating the Temple in Jerusalem. This is the essence of the Lights of Hope event.' The event is supported by six generous strategic partners: Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv, Belong, Gigawatt Impact, HaBithonistim, Nechama and Hatzala, and Save a Child’s Heart. 'Our strategic partners play a vital role in helping ILTV and Ynet News expand our reach and influence,' said Tom Zadok, CEO of ILTV. 'As we continue to grow as leading media outlets for the English-speaking community worldwide, we recognize that people increasingly prefer video content. We’re committed to meeting this need by delivering the most important stories and headlines from Israel each day.' Don’t miss this inspiring event. Watch live on the ILTV News YouTube channel or the Ynet homepage on December 30.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1zlovrskg	2024-12-28T18:16:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/ryuk2EABJl/ryuk2EABJl_89_0_1426_803_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah’s plot to down an Israeli plane: The tactics that foile...	Once blocked by Hezbollah's 100+ missile batteries and Syria's dense air defenses, Israel overcame these challenges with decoys, advanced drones and precision strikes, restoring air dominance and reopening Middle Eastern skies for IDF operations As they sat at their computer screens at the pit in the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv, mission officers rubbed their eyes in disbelief. Prepping for yet one more routine sortie in the north, they were convinced the sensitive strategic system had a serious bug in it. All anti-tank missile signals from Syria, red lines and icons, which had cluttered the screens for years, had disappeared. It was as if they never were. The skies had opened, clean of the enemy. The Middle East was in tatters. Fighter pilots, if they wanted, could now merrily fly in pairs, with visible operating systems, at any altitude, to any range, to any spot in Israel’s first circle of defense. In the first months of the war, there was no consensus within the IDF about revisiting flying the Lebanese skies. IAF chief Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar insisted, despite the then focus on Gaza and Hezbollah successfully downing state-of-the-art IAF UAVs at a rate of one a month in the war’s first six months. For this, Bar joined up the Military Intelligence Directorate and the Air Intelligence Group to one end – finishing this war by restoring Israel’s air supremacy in Lebanon. He didn’t know that Syria’s skies would also soon open. So, he pushed decision-makers to attack Syrian anti-aircraft defenses too. 'You must understand, our more veteran pilots are used to practicing for all the Syrian anti-aircraft dodging systems,' says a veteran IAF pilot. 'These systems took down one of our F16s last decade in the Galilee, and has affected every mission to the point of having to deploy more manpower on almost every sortie, limiting flights and implementing a totally different flight operation. 'Our people saw the screens and were in a state of shock. We used to invest so much organization and preparation before each flight just to address this very danger. In two days, we destroyed the main threat to the IAF, that’s been with us for 50 years. Suddenly, this dangerous situation, which had been going on for decades, disappeared - as if it never was. It’s as if all the missiles and rockets aimed at Israel no longer existed.' This dramatic change would never have come about were it not for, in a matter of 25 hours, the IAF destroying over 100 surface-to-air batteries of the densest anti-aircraft system on Earth – dependent on advanced Russian systems that Bashar Assad bought as new at his lowest moments last decade when his army had collapsed. 'He invested every lira and ruble to purchase anti-aircraft batteries that we destroyed in interwar attacks from the beginning of last decade, even at the height of the civil war.' The pilot adds, 'Anti-aircraft systems we attacked were sometimes replaced within the week. As the main threat to the IAF, this array was at the very heart of our intelligence.' This threat has almost doubled in recent years. Hezbollah’s appetite was whetted, and Hassan Nasrallah made it the first terrorist organization on Earth to have a state-run anti-aircraft system, albeit with slightly different operating systems, but the same Russian and Iranian-made batteries. A few weeks before destroying Syria’s anti-aircraft system, the IAF also ticked off destroying Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft system in more graduated and cunning moves, first revealed here. The air force operation destroying the Syrian army took only a few days. Assad’s arsenal was its main and most important target, certainly when compared to the MiG and Sukhoi squadrons, anyway inferior to Israel’s F15s and F16s. For years, including over the past decade, these jets conducted Israel’s real aerial warfare in Syria. 'Syrian aerial defense systems have been activated' was a code of sorts from initial official statements coming out of Damascus that could be reported in Israel, following any of the thousands of attacks in Syria for which Israel did not claim responsibility. On Syrian soil, there are still active, even highly advanced, anti-aircraft batteries, such as the S-300. These, however, have always been, and still are, in Russian hands at air bases such as Khmeimim. The IDF isn’t ruling out the possibility of destroying them to prevent them from falling into the hands of dangerous elements. Assad’s army deployed its anti-aircraft array wisely: Primarily around the capital Damascus, not far from the Golan Heights, and in 'Little Syria' where the Alawite community, of which Assad’s family is part, is concentrated; the coast above Lebanon that includes the strategic port cities of Latakia and Tartus. The radars themselves are deployed across the whole country. The Syrian air force’s operational, command and control capabilities have always gotten good grades from the IAF. There were many very close encounters with hundreds, sometimes only dozens of meters, separating these missiles from blue and white planes. 'These bases, that we knew so well, like the Syrian army camps, have been simply abandoned,' says an IDF source. To what extent was the IAF caught by surprise? 'The air force had no contingency plan for destroying the Syrian army and its anti-aircraft array. The vast operation of around 400 attacks in 72 hours was prepared swiftly in a matter of days, literally out of thin air - witness to the IAF’s tremendous operational flexibility. 'Syria’s entire surface-to-air array was destroyed along with both its mobile and portable batteries, the kind greatly absorbed by Israel in the Yom Kippur and 1982 Peace for Galilee wars. They’re fast and deadly, with efficient ranges covering 20-40 km, and there are the SA-17 and SA-22 with further ranges. Some have proven effective in not only endangering jets but also perusing and downing IAF bombs. 'The IDF noticed Assad’s army starting to move around some of its batteries, apparently to protect them from rebels who had begun their conquests, mobilizing Israel into preparing for action. The anti-aircraft danger now remaining in the second circle in Iraq has also suffered serious blows from Israel this past year. This system, however, is considered lower quality than that of Syria. 'Iran also, obviously, has advanced aerial defense, including S-300 batteries. They too suffered severe blows by the IAF in October. We now know that Syria’s anti-aircraft array, along with its radars, seems to have been linked up to Israel’s number one enemy’s ground-to-air batteries.' Saturday night, October 7, 2023, at precisely 8 p.m., a select planning, operations and intelligence team convened in a side room at the Air Force’s new base at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. As the IDF was struggling to recover from its loss of control from the Hamas invasion, and fighter squadrons were landing their first strikes on Gaza, this group of Air Force officers conducted their first situation report for a distant and strategic mission in a sector that was, in fact, calm on that horrific day. The discussion was led by head of the IAF’s air supremacy division Lt. Col. I. who was hardly four months into the job at the time. The aim was to destroy this air anti-aircraft array built up by Hezbollah over the years preceding the war. The Air Force rarely flew over Lebanon in recent years for fear of its manned aircraft being shot down by Hezbollah. The situation worsened between 2021 and 2023, as the IAF kept even simple high-altitude photographic sorties to a bare minimum. One of the world’s most powerful air forces was compelled to use more satellites to investigate a rocket factory in the Bekaa Valley or keep tabs on Hezbollah officials in Beirut's Dahieh district. Hezbollah’s gamble of invading Israel also involved it becoming the first terrorist organization on Earth to set up an anti-aircraft array of 100 large surface-to-air missiles. This included advanced, unique and innovative detection radars reliant on Syria’s anti-aircraft array - the densest on Earth - alongside Iranian and Russian systems and information. In closed-door talks over the past decade, Air Force officials sought to calibrate and reduce expectations. 'It was clear that at least one plane would be shot down in the Third Lebanon War, not only helicopters like in the Second Lebanon War,' they said. 'The public should know that’s what we’re preparing for.' Israel’s deterrence against Hezbollah and the unprecedented erosion of its air supremacy delved into an almost humiliating nadir in February 2020. Hezbollah exhibited an extraordinary and daring display of its surface-to-air capabilities: An SA-8 missile was launched at an advanced Hermes 450 UAV conducting a reconnaissance mission in the north. The UAV was downed, but Israeli policy remained unchanged: Serious targets in Lebanon must not be attacked, even more so north of the Litani River – so as not to be drawn into escalation with Hezbollah. A danger to Israeli planes By the evening of October 7, Lt. Col. I. already realized that air supremacy would not be achieved in one single strike. A startling image flickered on the screen before the convened team. Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft rings covered a line from Haifa, east across the Jezreel Valley, and included the Ramat David Air Base. As the months passed, and intelligence probes accumulated, it became apparent that Hezbollah’s cover stretched as far as the Atlit-Kineret line. This meant that any Israeli aircraft, military or civilian, flying over the northern third of Israeli sovereign airspace was in danger of being taken down by Hezbollah. 'From that October 7 discussion onward, we went into fighting mode, with an ever-growing operational team,' says Air Intelligence Group Lebanon Air Supremacy Division chief, Lt. Col. A. 'Unlike in the Military Intelligence Directorate, here at IAF intelligence, we don’t gather intelligence for information about the enemy, but rather we collect information needed for each operation. At that first discussion, we already understood we were heading toward a multi-front war. We prepared an array whose entire purpose was protecting the Air Force.' This array was a far cry from the 'Terrorists in flip flops with shoulder-held missiles' à la 1990s Afghanistan or Maroun El Ras 2006. In addition to the Russian-made S-300 and S-400s, which the Russians also have, a game-changing, effectively state-owned, anti-aircraft array was built up over the past decade in central and southern Lebanon. It included relatively advanced versions of Soviet missiles such as radar-based SA-6, SA-8 and SA-22 missiles alongside the jet-based and optical target identification-based Iranian Sayyad, Taer and 67 anti-aircraft arrays. These are loitering anti-aircraft missiles that can 'tour' in the air for 20 minutes, and when its homing device identifies a target, it locks into pursuit. The Taer can reach a range of 100km and is similar in shape to a UAV. In the first months of the war, the IAF was concerned that such missiles would also shoot down civilian planes en route to Beirut airport. 'Even if we swiftly deny involvement and show proof, just imagine what would happen if, in the middle of a war, a French passenger plane were shot down off the coast of Lebanon,' says an IAF source. 'They’d blame us just like they blamed us in 2018 when 15 Russian soldiers were killed as a Russian Ilyushin plane was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft during an attack on Latakia attributed to Israel.' Hezbollah’s array included the deployment of SA-6 and SA-22 batteries around Beirut airport, that were attacked in recent months. 'Lebanon also had vested interests in our taking out these batteries, endangering Lebanese skies,' says Lt. Col. I. 'At the start of the war, we sent the world a warning: Whoever flies to Lebanon, risks facing an air defense systems reliant on a terrorist organization.' Five advanced mid-sized Hermes UAVs shot down Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft array, mainly during the first half of the war when the learning race between the two sides peaked and incorporated Iranian weapons industries and engineers. Lt. Col. I. and Lt. Col. A.’s team investigated and gathered information about the array, and understood the extent of the danger to the IAF’s freedom of action. This endangered Apache helicopters assisting forces on the ground as well as intelligence gathering sorties to Tyre. The greatest concern was that these batteries would be moved around and further deployed. The SA-22 battery, considered the most dangerous of them all, can be placed on the ground floor of a three-story building in Nabatieh or an underground parking lot of a 14-story building in the crowded Dahieh district. The IDF wasn’t monitoring these hundreds of anti-aircraft Hezbollah targets 24/7. It was enough for a truck covered in tarpaulin, or a couple of missile trucks, to drive a few hundred meters to fire at IAF jets, and we’d lost. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Air Force also failed to appreciate the level of skill of Hezbollah's anti-aircraft cells that, in recent years, were returning from several-week operational training courses in the Iranian army with end-of-course air shows over Syria. 'They had no intention of totally paralyzing the IAF from operations in Lebanon,' say IAF officials. 'It was enough for them to show one success, like taking down an F-16 with a pilot abandoning a mission on Lebanese soil or, Heaven forbid, getting killed.' A month into the war, on November 8, scores were settled. Three weeks earlier, Hezbollah had managed, for the first time in the war, to shoot down its first Hermes 450 IAF done with an SA-67 battery. The IDF received the green light from the political echelon to kick off its offensive deep into Lebanon. General Staff Operations Directorate chief, Maj. Gen. Oded Basyuk gave Lt. Col. I.’s team the go-ahead. Operation Mountain Air was underway. The IAF nicknamed the first surface-to-air battery attacked in Lebanon, an advanced SA-22 battery, the 'Nexus.' The IAF used a small missile for 'roof knocking' in the dead of night. Families living nearby fled for their cars within ten minutes. The massive secondary explosions in the house, reminiscent of a fireworks display, left no room for doubt. There had been at least eight large missiles on the destroyed multiple-barrel launcher. Those hesitant months were utilized to gather deep intelligence on Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft array. The young officers in the colonel lieutenants’ team understood that an organized plan to destroy the enemy’s anti-aircraft array could be prepared only with ongoing aerial presence. The danger, however, meant that the bulk of the operation in the first months of the war was carried out by the use of drones. 'For Hezbollah, taking down a drone is an achievement,' says Lt. Col. I. 'They know that doing so ostensibly restricts our monitoring or aerial assassinations of their commanders and operatives in the field.' At some point, the air supremacy team learned something new about Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft array: The network connecting the batteries wasn’t dense, but rather dispersed and independent. 'If you were to ask a Syrian army battalion commander, he’d tell you it’s extraordinary and makes no sense, as anti-aircraft batteries were being deployed on some hilltop, next to the radar and other mechanisms protecting it,' says I. 'We had to engage with this array, even at the risk of taking down our own drones. If we hadn’t done that, we might have saved a drone or two, but weakened our capabilities of harming Hezbollah.' Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft array had 3,000 operatives and took serious blows in the war, losing its top commanders. Most operatives are alumni of professional training in Iran and Syria. They’re divided into three geographical areas: the southern anti-aircraft array; the Beirut unit and the Bekaa unit. 'Our young guys knew that there was an advanced surface-to-air battery in a certain place, but couldn’t say where,' says Lt. Col. A. Facing this challenge, the air force managed to develop covert ruses and deceptions to confuse Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft operatives. 'We implemented these crazy ideas that came from below, from 20-year-old officers who invented a variety of aerial ambushes and knew the right moment to strike.' At the end of December last year, the aerial supremacy unit caused a Hezbollah anti-aircraft cell to remove a truck with a large launcher on it from a hiding place in an orchard, that was destroyed in a precision attack, this time from an Israeli missile ship stationed near Tyre. As the hesitation declined from one month to the next, Hezbollah’s ambitious anti-aircraft array, laying the groundwork for the opening shots of its planned September Operation Northern Arrows, was systematically eroded. 'The conditions for starting the major strikes we afflicted on Hezbollah, including those assassinating its leaders, was complete IAF freedom of action in Lebanon. Without that, we’d have been in a quite different place,' I. continues. Complete freedom of action means F-15s, not just stealthy F-35s flying at 4000 feet, but rather actually over Beirut’s Dahieh high-rise rooftops. A young aircraft supremacy officer also pushed for another method to make this difficult for Hezbollah: A supersonic boom used as a regular fighting pattern – generally by F-35 Adir planes. This is a deafening noise that can sound like a bomb, caused when a jet exceeds the 1.1 Mach speed of sound, creating a shock wave. In one of his final speeches before his assassination, Hassan Nasrallah and the residents of Beirut were treated to an especially loud supersonic boom. 'It can shatter windscreens, has a huge impact on the population, and moves things for Hezbollah,' says one officer. 'To restore deterrence, it’s important to us that Lebanon should know that our planes are free in their airspace. I remind you, Beirut has no sirens or warning systems.' The freedom of aerial action has another benefit for the Air Force. It’s more effective. Jets can get closer for strikes in Syria, as these strikes can be conducted from Lebanese skies, taking full advantage of the country’s topography. Despite these achievements, the IAF believes Hezbollah still has firepower, albeit much less than before the war. IAF planes no longer face the same dangers. Israel believes that as soon as the cease-fire is fully implemented, the array will be rebuilt with Iranian support and lessons will have been learned. So, the IDF demands to counter in practice any effort to rearm Hezbollah. Alongside the large surface-to-air missiles, Hezbollah also has thousands of shoulder-fired missiles (man-portable air-defense systems [MANPADS]), in its possession since the 1990s. This tactical array has been upgraded in recent years and includes an aerial rocket converted to explode in the air, triggered by a time-activated fuse; a broad range of classic anti-aircraft mortars (varying in diameter from 12mm through to 100mm) designed primarily to hit helicopters and anti-tank missiles converted into anti-aircraft missiles with a dedicated fuse for precision targeting helicopters - effectively 'air mines', used in areas such as valleys or the Litani or Saluki rivers where the IAF planes are expected to fly low. These mines explode a few dozen meters above the source of sound or movement detected by its dedicated sensors. They accordingly demand high maintenance and are battery operated. A Hermes drone was shot down by one such MANPADS in the war in the north. During the Egoz unit’s difficult battle in early October, in which six soldiers were killed, Hezbollah operatives shot shoulder-held missiles that almost hit Apache helicopters descending to low altitude in a dangerous area to help soldiers. 'We live in the Northern Command and hold weekly meetings about freedom of action with its commander, Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin to whom this matter is very important, mainly as a critical matter for continuance,' the IAF says. 'We have to continue flying unrestrictedly over Lebanon. Over the years, we lost our intelligence grip there, and we can’t make the same mistake again.' Proof of the mission’s importance flickers on a screen behind these officers: Two pictures of a broad single-story building in Bekaa, deep inside Lebanon near the Syrian border, that was used as a warehouse for advanced Hezbollah weapons. There are two versions of this picture: one taken during the intelligence gathering sortie in recent months, the other before the war. 'Iran has invested many millions in Hezbollah’s surface-to-air anti-aircraft array, turning it into one of its heaviest arrays,' say the aerial supremacy officers. 'The Lebanese army also has anti-aircraft capabilities but hasn’t used them against us. We couldn’t have carried out the major assassinations, including Nasrallah without close air reconnaissance.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkz8a1chyg	2024-12-28T13:24:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/H1QLM4004yg/H1QLM4004yg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Terrorists posing as patients': Inside the IDF's largest Gaza ra...	401st Brigade encircles Kamal Adwan Hospital in an hour, arresting over 240 terrorists, including hospital director; some suspects try fleeing in ambulances; Unit 504 interrogations on-site leads to capture of additional Hamas and PIJ operatives The IDF reported on Saturday that it completed a focused operation targeting a Hamas command center within the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. Over 240 suspects were reportedly apprehended. Among those detained were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), including 15 individuals connected to the October 7 attacks on Israel, as well as engineering and anti-tank missile specialists and the hospital director, suspected of Hamas ties. Some suspects reportedly attempted to disguise themselves as patients or escape using ambulances. The IDF said that the 401st Armored Brigade secured the hospital’s surroundings while Shayetet 13 special forces conducted precise actions inside, seizing weapons such as grenades, firearms and other military equipment. Troops encountered resistance, including anti-tank fire, but successfully neutralized the attackers. Alongside Shayetet 13 commandos, combat teams from the 401st Armored Brigade, Unit 504 field investigators and Shin Bet forces, all under the command of the 162nd Division and guided by intelligence from the IDF Intelligence Directorate (AMAN) and the Shin Bet. At the outset, 401st Brigade combat teams encircled the hospital, arresting terrorists hiding in the area and eliminating others. The encirclement was completed within an hour. During the operation, an anti-tank missile was fired at a 52nd Battalion force, but no injuries were reported. Initial interrogations conducted on-site by Unit 504 investigators and Shin Bet operatives revealed that many of the terrorists exiting the hospital had participated in terror activities in the area. This marked a significant achievement for Unit 504, which handled the largest single-day concentration of detainees since the start of the war. Over ten investigators employed advanced intelligence systems and technologies, with most of the terrorists identified as members of the military wings of Hamas and PIJ. Real-time interrogations also led to the identification of additional terrorists in the vicinity. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the operation, terrorists fired anti-tank missiles at forces near the hospital and attempted additional terror attacks. IDF and Shin Bet personnel sustained no injuries, and the attackers were swiftly neutralized. Israeli Air Force aircraft also struck and killed terrorists attempting to flee the area. In the weeks leading up to the operation, the IDF coordinated with COGAT to evacuate 350 patients, caregivers and medical staff from the Kamal Adwan Hospital. Additionally, tens of thousands of liters of fuel and hundreds of food and medical supply packages were delivered to the hospital. During the operation, 95 more patients and staff were transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, accompanied by 5,000 liters of fuel, two generators and additional medical supplies to ensure its essential functionality. Hundreds of civilians were also evacuated safely via designated routes. In a parallel operation in Jabaliya, Multi-Dimensional Unit commandos identified and eliminated terrorists from the air, while Kfir Brigade soldiers located and dismantled explosive devices in the area. Over the weekend, a fourth IDF brigade, Nahal, joined the northern operations, moving from its previous position in southern Gaza near the Philadelphi Corridor, where it was replaced by the 4th Reserve Brigade. Nahal forces are now operating in Beit Hanoun alongside the Kfir Brigade. Jabaliya has been identified by the IDF as a Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza, hosting hundreds of terrorists, including senior commanders. Despite prior IDF operations in the city, including a ground maneuver last year and a 98th Division raid on its refugee camp in May, the area remains a critical focus for military activity. IDF forces have been conducting operations there for the past three months to address persistent threats. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryzyit6byx	2024-12-28T10:02:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/28/r1oaGsarkl/r1oaGsarkl_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

Iran says 2025 'important year' for nuclear issue	Tehran braces for renewed US 'maximum pressure' policies under Trump administration; amid concerns over potential sanctions and military actions, Iranian rial hits all-time low, reflecting growing economic uncertainty Iran, bracing for a possible re-imposition of incoming U.S. president Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' policy, said on Saturday that 2025 would be an important year for its nuclear issue. Trump in 2018 reneged on a deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of U.S. and UN economic sanctions. '2025 will be an important year regarding Iran's nuclear issue,' Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Beijing, adding in remarks aired by Iran's state TV that he had discussed the issue in talks with his Chinese counterpart. He did not mention Trump by name, however, or spell out how the year might be significant. Iranian leaders' main concern may be that Trump could empower Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its crucial oil industry.

Report: Iran’s Revolutionary Guard plotted to lure and kidnap Isr...	Former political prisoner in Armenia reveals IRGC planned to lure Iran International reporter Babak Eshaghi and another journalist to Turkey-Iran border region; Eshaghi to Ynet: 'I trust my country’s intelligence and security services' The opposition news outlet IranWire reported Saturday that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) planned to kidnap Babak Eshaghi, an Israeli journalist working for the Saudi-funded opposition channel Iran International. According to IranWire, the IRGC devised a scheme to lure several Iran International journalists to a border region near Iran and abduct them into Iranian territory. The outlet based its report on details from the interrogation of Mohammad Hashemzadeh, a former Iranian political prisoner currently detained in Armenia. The investigation revealed that members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard pressured Hashemzadeh and an associate to lure several Iran International journalists to a border city near Iran, where they would be abducted into the Islamic Republic. Hashemzadeh, originally from the southeastern Iranian city of Bandar Abbas, relocated to Armenia after working in Antalya, Turkey. During his interrogation in Armenia, he disclosed that while imprisoned in Iran, Revolutionary Guard operatives tried to persuade him and his cellmate—who was formerly a friend of Eshaghi—to entice Eshaghi and another Iran International reporter to travel to the border city for the abduction. According to the report, the plan failed due to the refusal of Hashemzadeh and his cellmate, Mehdi Behnam, who had been sentenced to five years in prison in Iran. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response to Ynet, Eshaghi said: 'This is not the first time the Islamic regime in Iran has tried to harm Iran International journalists. We are the free, true and independent voice of news in Iran and the world. A few months ago, regime operatives stabbed my colleague Pouria Zarati in London, and last year, there was a revealed plan to attack our channel’s building and harm our journalists. As an Israeli journalist, I trust my country’s intelligence and security services. I will continue my work with the channel.' Iran International has long been a target of the Iranian regime, particularly since its intensive coverage of the widespread protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. The channel’s satellite broadcasts allowed it to reach audiences inside Iran, further amplifying its influence. According to the Daily Mail, Tehran labeled the channel a 'terrorist organization' in December 2022. That same month, British broadcaster ITV revealed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had plotted to assassinate two Iran International TV hosts, Sima Sabet and Farhad Farahzad, in 2022, in knife attacks outside their homes, similar to the stabbing of Zarati. The Daily Mail reported that the assassins were offered more than £150,000 for the job, but the plot was thwarted when one of the would-be attackers turned into a double agent. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by72h9ahyl	2024-12-28T06:42:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/28/SJPVMKpByl/SJPVMKpByl_200_109_1016_572_0_small.jpg

Cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah on verge of collapse?	Hezbollah accuses Israel of exploiting the fragile ceasefire as Israeli forces continue targeting southern Lebanon's terror infrastructure; Amid rising tensions, Lebanon warns of the agreement's collapse while Hezbollah hints it may intervene if Israeli operations persist, threatening renewed conflict in the region Lebanese network Al-Akhbar, closely aligned with Hezbollah, reported on Saturday morning that concerns over the fragility of the ceasefire are growing as it enters its second month, citing Israeli military activities in border villages as a potential tipping point. Serving as a mouthpiece for the Lebanese militant group, the network stated that while Hezbollah remains committed to the ceasefire, it has begun signaling that it will not hesitate to act on Lebanon’s 'right to self-defense' as stipulated in the agreement. According to Al-Akhbar, Hezbollah has warned that if Lebanon’s official security forces fail to curb what it describes as Israeli 'attacks,' the group will intervene directly. Hezbollah’s representative in the Lebanese parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, accused Israel of exploiting the ceasefire to implement plans for destruction and aggression in the border villages. He placed responsibility on the Lebanese state, the international monitoring committee established after the ceasefire, UNIFIL, the Lebanese Army, and the various countries involved in the agreement. 'We, the people of southern Lebanon, the resistance, Hezbollah’s supporters across Dahieh and the Bekaa, have never needed proof that resistance is a national necessity,' Fadlallah declared. In a morning editorial, Al-Akhbar’s editor, Ibrahim Al-Amin, argued for the necessity of resisting what he called Israeli violations. He claimed that a loophole in the ceasefire allows Israel to act with impunity while the monitoring forces lack the authority to stop its actions in border areas. Al-Amin further alleged that while the Lebanese Army has expressed concern to the Americans over Israel’s actions, the U.S. has dismissed these complaints. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati reportedly told the U.S. that Israeli operations threaten the agreement but received no meaningful response. Similarly, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri conveyed concerns to Washington, warning Israel’s actions could legitimize military responses from Hezbollah. According to Al-Amin, Israel has destroyed twice as much in border villages over the past month as it did during 14 months of prior conflict, preventing residents from returning to their homes and restricting ambulance and civil defense teams from recovering bodies. He asserted that Israel’s actions are restoring the legitimacy of resistance, whether by Hezbollah or other groups, adding that while people are weary of war, the cost of confrontation with Israeli forces would be less than the cost of continued Israeli actions. IDF operations continue across the border Hezbollah’s grievances arise from the fact that, despite the ceasefire, IDF has continued ground operations aimed at clearing southern Lebanese villages of terrorist infrastructure. IDF announced on Friday that the 226th Brigade, under the command of the 146th Division, remains active in the area while adhering to the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon. Forces are currently operating in the westernmost village of Al-Naqoura, where dozens of Hezbollah terror infrastructures used for attacks against Israel have been uncovered. Troops discovered military equipment and weapons stored in civilian buildings, including a building disguised as a pharmacy that contained explosives, RPG missiles, and AK-47s. Additional finds included rockets, mortars, and launchers aimed at Israeli territory, as well as a truck carrying 40 rocket tubes. All the equipment was confiscated and destroyed. Al-Akhbar regularly reports on Israeli operations in southern Lebanon, where, under the ceasefire agreement, armed forces not officially affiliated with Lebanon’s military are not permitted to operate. Nonetheless, IDF continues to identify and target terror-related sites in the region, with occasional airstrikes resulting in casualties. Recent strikes have targeted rocket launchers, significant weapons caches, smuggling routes, and armed militants. A delicate agreement on shaky ground Hezbollah has largely refrained from responding to Israeli strikes since the ceasefire, with the exception of one mortar attack on Mount Dov earlier this month. The group suffered significant losses during the conflict, particularly in its final months, which included the elimination of senior leadership and IDF ground maneuvers in southern Lebanon. While IDF operations have continued post-ceasefire, their intensity has decreased substantially, likely contributing to Hezbollah’s apparent interest in preserving the current status quo to avoid reigniting the conflict. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Lebanese Army, now deployed in villages across southern Lebanon, claims to have dismantled terrorist infrastructure in recent days. Meanwhile, IDF remains in border areas, actively targeting Hezbollah operatives who violate the ceasefire. In the past month alone, over 40 Hezbollah operatives have reportedly been killed, adding to the approximately 3,000 militants killed and 7,000 wounded over the past year—roughly a third of Hezbollah’s estimated 30,000 combatants. In areas where the Lebanese Army has established control, IDF has withdrawn back to Israeli territory. However, Israeli forces continue engineering operations to destroy Hezbollah bunkers and internal combat tunnels. IDF clarified this week that the initial 60-day ceasefire period is not a 'sacred deadline' and that implementation of the agreement’s stages will proceed gradually under U.S. oversight. For the first time, the United States is leading the enforcement mechanism for the ceasefire, described as operating under an 'American umbrella.' The fragile ceasefire remains precariously balanced, with both sides closely monitoring each other’s actions. While Hezbollah appears to be avoiding direct confrontation, its rhetoric and warnings suggest that any perceived overreach by Israel could risk pulling the region back into conflict. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byifdrpbje	2024-12-28T00:59:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/ByffmWGnSyl/ByffmWGnSyl_1_124_1601_901_0_small.jpg

WZO Chairman speaks about one of the most challenging times to be...	Following the loss of his brother-in-law during the Nova party on October 7, the head of the World Zionist Organization has taken on a project of revitalizing the Gaza border region by introducing not only evacuated residents, but bringing those who wish to make aliyah as well, because overseas, 'Jews are afraid to walk the streets' Yaakov Hagoel, Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, lost his brother-in-law, Assaf Schlesinger, a paramedic at the Nova music festival, on October 7. In an interview with 'Mamon' section of Yedioth Ahronoth, he speaks for the first time about the painful family tragedy, shares insights on a complex $407 million project to rehabilitate the north and south of Israel and addresses why the World Zionist Organization is still relevant 76 years after the establishment of a Jewish state. And what does Hagoel, a longtime Likud member, have to say to Miki Zohar, who is working to replace him? 'Miki's attempts are a testament to the influence and power I hold. It’s unfortunate that during a time of war, when there is so much to do, I’m dragged into dealing with this.' How do you cope with such a situation? 'These were the hardest days our family has ever faced. We went from hospital to hospital amidst the terrible chaos. During the shiva, the rabbi who came to visit me mentioned that it was his seventh shiva that day. My brother-in-law left behind twins, a boy and a girl. My personal experience with this family tragedy connects me to the suffering of the families of those kidnapped. When I speak with them, I’m reminded of the heavy sense of uncertainty and fog that envelopes you. It’s extremely difficult. My eldest son served over 100 days in Gaza, took a brief leave to attend his son's Brit Milah, and returned to reserve duty. My daughter-in-law’s family also suffered a loss during the war—a cousin who was killed at Nahal Oz. We went from one funeral to the next. Our nation is in trauma.' Yaakov Hagoel assumed his role four years ago for a five-year term, amid one of the most difficult and challenging times for Jewish communities around the globe. 'Since October 7, attitudes toward the World Zionist Organization have shifted. There is greater awareness of our activities and goals. Antisemitic incidents worldwide have surged dramatically. We are witnessing an eightfold increase in Antisemitic events, amounting to hundreds of such incidents per day globally. The most troubling issue is that many Jews in the diaspora are beginning to accept this situation as normal. 'They view it as ‘the price of being Jewish outside Israel.’ Even worse, many have lost faith in the ability of law enforcement in their countries to protect them. One of the most shocking recent events was the pogrom against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam. The Israeli government managed to evacuate most of the fans back to Israel in record time, but the Jewish community that remained there is experiencing a deep crisis. I sent a team to Amsterdam, and they spent Shabbat with the Jewish community. The situation was extremely distressing—they were afraid to leave their homes. 'As Israelis, we fail to grasp how deeply the sense of security for our brothers and sisters in the diaspora has been shaken. I am in daily contact with representatives of Jewish communities worldwide, and I hear repeatedly that their fears today are far greater than they’ve been in years past. Jews are afraid to walk the streets, reluctant to place mezuzahs on their doorposts. Over the past year, Jewish students have felt unsafe standing out on U.S. campuses or have preemptively chosen not to send their children to such campuses at all.' Any silver linings? 'One of the things that has strengthened me the most during this past challenging year has been witnessing thousands—literally thousands—of Jews from around the world coming here to volunteer and help, despite travel warnings and the ongoing war. They’ve been willing to assist with anything, from agricultural harvests to any task we’ve asked of them. The Jewish diaspora has also contributed an enormous sum of nearly two billion dollars over the past year to various projects in Israel. This moves me deeply and is far from something I take for granted.' What can we expect for the relationship between world Jewry and Israel after the war? 'Based on the number of immigration files that have been opened, we estimate that around 100,000 immigrants are expected to arrive in Israel after the war. Since October 7, despite the complex security situation, approximately 33,000 people have already made Aliyah. As the chairman of the Zionist movement, of course, I would be delighted if everyone chose to make Aliyah, but I respect each individual's right to decide where to live and raise their children. On one hand, I encourage Aliyah, but on the other, I support strengthening Jewish communities in the diaspora because they have the right to exist and thrive anywhere in the world.' 25 years together The World Zionist Organization (WZO) was founded in 1897 by Theodor Herzl at the First Zionist Congress. The organization owns the Jewish National Fund (Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael), holds a 50% stake in the Jewish Agency for Israel and Keren Hayesod (United Israel Appeal), and manages around 20 subsidiary companies, including the rehabilitation organization HaMashkem. With an annual budget of approximately 150 million shekels and a workforce of about 500 employees—240 of whom are emissaries stationed worldwide—the WZO oversees subsidiaries that generate millions more. 'As Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, I essentially serve as the head of a massive holding company,' says Yaakov Hagoel. It’s no surprise that numerous political figures, both within Likud and beyond, have their sights set on gaining control over the WZO. Hagoel was elected to his position following a heated internal battle within World Likud, and political circles are already preparing for the next elections slated for October 2025. This battle revolves around control of enormous budgets, high-ranking positions with significant salaries, and considerable power. Hagoel is seen as a close ally of Danny Danon in World Likud. Danon's control over World Likud and WZO institutions has drawn rivals like Miki Zohar and David Bitan, who have set their sights on these centers of power. Zohar has already signed agreements with political opponents such as Benny Gantz, Avigdor Lieberman, and even Meretz, dividing control over roles and influence in the various bodies under the WZO’s purview. 'I view Miki Zohar’s attempts to take my place as a significant indication of the influence and power I hold in this position,' says Hagoel. 'I was elected four years ago after a very intense battle. Even then, Miki Zohar, along with the Prime Minister and other senior ministers, tried to sway the elections. That battle taught me to value this role even more. I am a democrat and respect the rules of the game. It saddens me, however, that during a time of war, when there is so much to be done, I am being drawn into election matters a year ahead of time.' Could your connection to Danny Danon be working against you? 'Danny is my close friend, a dear person. We’re the same age group, and we first met in the Beitar Movement. We’ve shared a journey of over 25 years together. It’s rare in Israeli politics to have friendships that last this long. I have tremendous respect for Danny, and he reciprocates. There aren’t many people who would leave the Knesset, as Danny did, and say, ‘Friends, if I’m not a senior minister and find myself on the backbench, I’ll return to the place where I’ve made a real impact.’ And that’s what Danny did. Danny is made of the same material I am: the place where we know we can make a difference is the place we strive to be. And I’ll do everything I can to be re-elected. Once every five years, the Jewish world holds elections. Seven hundred delegates are chosen, representing the Jewish people both in Israel and the diaspora. It’s like the parliament of the Jewish people—it’s my sacred space.' Why do we still need an organization like the World Zionist Organization when a Jewish state has existed for decades? 'The State of Israel is a state for all, including the Arabs, and that’s perfectly fine. However, there are specific Jewish interests that we are responsible for, both in Israel and in the diaspora: combating Antisemitism, encouraging Aliyah, and rescuing Jews in distress. The World Zionist Organization leads projects aimed at strengthening the connection between Jews in the diaspora and the State of Israel. It actively promotes Aliyah and helps with the absorption of immigrants in Israel, supports settlement efforts, and contributes to the development of infrastructure across the country. Additionally, the WZO serves as a representative and authoritative body for the Jewish people in the international arena. It continues to play a vital role in mobilizing donations and resources for national causes.' A life of service and Zionist commitment Yaakov Hagoel, 53, is married to Tchiya and the father of four (a 16-year-old son, a 19-year-old daughter who serves as a paramedic in National Service, a 22-year-old son, and a 27-year-old son). He is also a grandfather to two. Born in Tel Aviv, his family moved to Arad when he was seven. 'My parents were true Zionists,' he says. 'Back in the 1970s, moving from the center of the country to the periphery was considered a significant step.' Hagoel began his public service career in the Betar Movement in Arad. 'As a teenager, I founded Betar in the city,' he recalls. 'Later, I was one of the first non-kibbutz members to do a year of service in Ofakim, where I founded a Betar branch when I was 18. Afterward, I joined a Betar Nahal group at Kibbutz Misgav Am. Back then, doing a year of service was something only kibbutzniks did. My whole life has been dedicated to Betar. I’ve held every position imaginable in the movement, eventually becoming its global CEO. Everything I’ve accomplished has been through my own hard work. I even met my wife through Betar. I’ve always wanted to go into politics to make an impact, though I didn’t think it would be in the Jewish world. At the time, I imagined becoming a mayor.' Leading rehabilitation efforts in the wake of the war Since the war, a central focus of the World Zionist Organization has been assisting displaced residents from northern and southern Israel and rehabilitating destroyed communities. The WZO is managing 1.5 billion shekels from the Israeli government for this extensive project. 'We’ve helped establish seven new neighborhoods for evacuees: Shfayim and Kibbutz Ruhama for residents of Kfar Aza, Karmi Gat for evacuees from Nir Oz, Hazerim for residents of Kibbutz Be’eri, with caravans for 300 families and a separate dining hall, Mishmar Ha’emek for those displaced from Nahal Oz, Ashalim for residents of Kerem Shalom, Ramat HaNegev for evacuees from Kibbutz Holit. We worked on tight schedules to ensure children could begin the school year in September. Additionally, the Settlement Division of the WZO is assisting six evacuated regional councils, encompassing a total of 47 communities.'

We turned to Jews around the world and asked for their help. The response was incredible—we received 500 keys to apartments in Israel owned by Jews living abroad. We took full responsibility for these properties, including insurance and property management, in a heartwarming project we named ‘My Home is Your Home.’ These apartments were used not only by evacuees from the Gaza border communities but also by residents of Netivot, Ofakim, and Ashkelon seeking temporary shelter. Jews even offered us their luxury homes in Rehavia, Jerusalem, for the evacuees. Some stories were incredibly touching. One Jewish family offered a home filled with valuable art pieces. I declined that offer, but it illustrates the profound solidarity among Jews worldwide.' How much have you invested in helping evacuees? 'In addition to our assistance for southern evacuees, we invested 28 million shekels in aid for evacuees in the north. It’s painful to say, but during a tour of the north, we saw that there is almost nothing left of Metula. On the way there, I also saw the Roaring Lion memorial—a landmark I know intimately from my days in the Betar Movement. It was heartbreaking to see the area in its current state. It feels just like when our parents arrived here, starting from scratch in the wilderness. A few months ago, we took on an additional responsibility: providing support to the families of hostages and returnees. This is perhaps the most sacred mission we’ve undertaken. Until then, the families of the hostages were cared for by a directorate under the Prime Minister’s Office. The WZO essentially civilianized this directorate. Colonel (Res.) Yaron Cohen, who knows every family that has experienced this unimaginable nightmare, remained in his role, joined by our appointed director, Ilan Or.' What is your vision for the future if you’re re-elected as chairman? 'In my view, the real dream isn’t just to return the residents to the Gaza border region but to bring dozens of families of new immigrants to the area to strengthen it. Immigration is not just an economic growth engine—it’s a message of hope and faith in the State of Israel. When people choose to come here despite everything, it strengthens us all. I sit in Herzl’s chair, in an office where Ben-Gurion once sat. It’s a great privilege to continue this legacy and lead the World Zionist Organization into the challenges of the 21st century.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkvjvmthkl	2024-12-27T23:01:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/07/r1Ph8NfbJJx/r1Ph8NfbJJx_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Sara Netanyahu under the scope over alleged witness harassment in...	Sara Netanyahu, the Prime Minister's wife, is under scrutiny for allegedly intimidating a key witness in her husband’s corruption trial; A TV investigation revealed messages where she reportedly pushed for a campaign against the witness, raising severe legal and ethical implications Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing potential legal trouble after allegations surfaced that she may have tried to intimidate a key witness in a corruption case against her husband. The controversy stems from an investigative report by the TV program 'Uvda,' which revealed text messages allegedly sent by Sara Netanyahu to Hani Blivis, a close aide to the Prime Minister, who was known as a powerful figure in his office. In these messages, Sara Netanyahu reportedly urged Blivis to 'go after' Hadas Klein, a key witness in Case 1000, involving accusations of the Prime Minister and his wife receiving expensive gifts, such as champagne and cigars, from billionaire Arnon Milchan in exchange for political favors. In her messages, Sara Netanyahu reportedly wrote, 'We need to go after Hadas Klein, Arnon Milchan’s secretary, who has been defaming us for years. She lies, slanders, and is vile.' Shortly after these messages were sent, negative posts about Klein began appearing on social media, raising suspicions that Sara Netanyahu may have been involved in witness harassment and obstruction of justice. This prompted Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and State Attorney Amit Isman to instruct the police to open an investigation. For the police to pursue charges, they will need to prove Sara Netanyahu had 'criminal intent'—in other words, that she intended to intimidate Hadas Klein. They will also need to establish a clear connection between the messages allegedly sent to Bleiwis and the social media posts that followed. Witness harassment, the potential charge in this case, is a criminal offense under Israeli law, punishable by up to three years in prison. To convict someone of this offense, prosecutors must demonstrate two main components: intent to harass and evidence linking the harassment to the defendant. A recent example of such a case occurred in 2018, when a man was convicted of harassing Nir Hefetz, a former spokesperson for Netanyahu and a state witness in another case. The man had sent Hefetz a threatening letter, calling him a 'snitch,' and was later sentenced to community service and a fine. This investigation into Sara Netanyahu faces a unique challenge: the phone that allegedly contained the incriminating messages belonged to Hani Blivis, who has since passed away. While the police may still use the messages as evidence if they can establish their authenticity, the defense could argue it’s impossible to verify the circumstances under which the messages were sent, creating potential doubts about the evidence’s reliability. If the investigation progresses, Sara Netanyahu will likely be summoned by the police first for an open testimony and, depending on the evidence, could face formal questioning under caution. The investigation could take months, as the police will need to gather evidence, coordinate with witnesses, and verify findings. There’s also a possibility that the investigation could expand to include other individuals who may have assisted or been involved in the alleged harassment. The investigation is further complicated by the police’s prior criticism of the 'Uvda' report, describing it as 'distorted and false.' Despite this, the investigation will be handled by the Lahav 433 anti-corruption unit, with close oversight from senior prosecutors to ensure objectivity, particularly given its connection to Sara Netanyahu and the ongoing corruption trials involving her husband. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Finally, there are questions about whether these alleged offenses are still within the statute of limitations. For standard cases of witness harassment or obstruction, the statute of limitations is five years. However, if it’s found that Sara Netanyahu conspired with others to harass Hadas Klein, the statute of limitations could extend to ten years. This case could have significant implications—not just for Sara Netanyahu but also for the broader legal battles surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trials, which have been a focal point of Israeli politics in recent years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy7dpzahyg	2024-12-27T21:57:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/SyU7S7jSJe/SyU7S7jSJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How IDF uses explosive-laden APCs to clear booby-trapped areas in...	IDF develops a new method using the old M-113 armored personnel carriers, packing them with explosives, and remotely detonating them to clear booby-trapped areas in Gaza; method was also used in Lebanon against Hezbollah Explosions heard across central Israel on Thursday evening originated from a unique IDF tactic initially developed at the start of the current war and previously used in southern Lebanon. The method involves old M-113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) loaded with tons of explosives, which are remotely detonated to clear booby-trapped areas before troops enter. Residents reported feeling intense blasts as far away as Tel Aviv, Hod HaSharon, and Jerusalem. One Tel Aviv resident described the explosions as 'earth-shaking,' while another in Hod HaSharon said, 'The windows shook twice.' The IDF has not issued a formal statement on the incident, though police attributed the noise to military activity in Gaza. Led by the 401st Brigade under the 162nd Division, the operation followed intelligence from the Shin Bet and Military Intelligence Directorate. The IDF claimed the site housed terrorists, terror infrastructure, and ongoing hostile activity. Footage from Gaza showed partially clothed residents with hands raised being escorted by IDF forces surrounded by tanks. Additional visuals from the hospital showed signs of fire damage. According to Palestinian sources, the IDF gave hospital occupants 15 minutes to evacuate before communication with the facility's management ceased. 'Throughout the war, Hamas has used the hospital as a key operational center, sheltering militants and conducting terrorist activities,' an IDF spokesperson stated. The military had previously operated in the area in October and warned against using the facility for military purposes. The IDF emphasized efforts to avoid harming civilians, patients, and medical staff. 'We are operating in a focused manner to minimize harm to uninvolved individuals,' the spokesperson said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas accused the IDF of committing war crimes, alleging the forces 'burned' Kamal Adwan Hospital and mistreated patients, staff, and displaced individuals during the operation. 'The decision to burn the hospital after storming it and abusing its occupants is a war crime and a flagrant violation of international laws and humanitarian values,' a Hamas statement read. The group claimed the IDF systematically targets medical facilities and infrastructure in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry, managed by Hamas, said the fate of medical staff and patients remains unknown following the operation. The ministry added that the IDF had recently forced evacuations at the Indonesian Hospital under similar circumstances, calling it a further display of 'contempt for global humanitarian values.' The IDF rejected Hamas’ accusations, asserting its compliance with international laws regarding medical facilities. Military officials stressed their efforts to facilitate the evacuation of patients and staff from Kamal Adwan Hospital to other facilities. 'The IDF, in coordination with international organizations and local health officials, has ensured defined evacuation routes using ambulances to guarantee continued medical care,' a military statement read. The IDF highlighted ongoing actions to deliver medical supplies, food, and fuel to hospitals in the area. Despite the IDF’s efforts, the military condemned Hamas for its alleged systematic violations of international law. 'Hamas exploits civilian infrastructure and endangers lives by embedding military operations within medical facilities,' the spokesperson added. As the war continues, the IDF’s operations in Gaza and their impact on medical facilities remain a focal point of global scrutiny. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkt16f3hje	2024-12-27T11:58:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/HyeNraDnSJe/HyeNraDnSJe_0_1_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Israel's future mediator with Iran? The sultan who keeps his door...	One of Sultan Haitham of Oman's first actions upon taking office was ensuring his son would succeed him, securing his legacy; Oman’s strategic location forces the Sultan to navigate delicate diplomacy, maintaining good relations with both Iran and the US while offering medical aid to Yemen's Houthis; Could Trump’s entry pave the way for Israelis to visit Muscat? Haitham bin Tariq Al Said is the Sultan and Prime Minister of Oman, Yemen’s thriving neighbor, and ranks among the Middle East’s most important brokers, always operating beneath the radar. He took power only five years ago on the death of his cousin, Qaboos bin Said who ruled Oman for 49 years – almost half a century. He maintains good relations with Iran, the US, and the Houthis, and conducts covert relations with Israel. Sultan Qaboos died in 2000 after battling cancer for 6 years. He had no children of his own but was close to his cousins, one of whom became the new sultan. Didn’t publicly declare his successor, but rather recorded a statement that was kept in a sealed envelope. After Qaboos’ death, Oman State TV reported that the envelope had been opened and that the family had 'accepted his wise advice' and vision. The TV channel soon after declared Haitham sultan. Qaboos conducted overt relations with Israel for years: In 2018, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a rare visit to Oman, meeting with the sultan at his palace in the capital, Muscat. Former President Shimon Peres visited Oman in 1996, as did then prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1994. Oman was the first Gulf state to approve Israeli diplomatic presence in its territory. Further diplomatic representation was then set up in other countries in the region. This momentum, however, came to a halt in the first two decades of the 21st century due, inter alia, to the stalemate on the Palestinian issue. Oman is very different from its neighbor to the west. 'Qaboos revolutionized his country,' Gulf expert Dr. Shaul Yanai tells Ynet. 'He took a country replete with never-ending civil wars and stabilized it. He managed to keep Oman out of regional wars, and the Arab Spring all but bbypassedOman. Almost nothing happened there.' Although Sultan Haitham has introduced some changes, since assuming power, he has promised to adhere to the sultanate’s policy of neutrality and non-intervention in both regional and international conflicts. 'Unlike Qaboos, Haitham is pareve. Haitham is following in Qaboos’ footsteps. He was chosen and trained by him to continue the tribal distribution of wealth and deal with minorities' says Dr. Yanai. 'He’s carrying on the traditional line, nd is even taking steps bacbackwardaboos was a cultural revolutionary of sorts. Haitham isn’t like that. He’s calmer.' Little is known about Sultan Haitham’s private life. He was born in 1955 in the capital Muscat and is married to Ahad bint Abdullah bin Hamad Al Busaidiyah with whom he has four children. His father was Sayyid Tariq bin Taimur who served as prime minister 1970-1972. Haitham graduated from Oxford in 1979 and before assuming power, served in various official roles in Oman, most recently as Minister of Heritage and Culture from 2002 through to his inauguration. In the 1990s, he served as Secretary General for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Special Envoy for Sultan Qaboos. He also headed Oman’s special committee overseeing the country’s future planning through 2040. He’s known for his love of sports and soccer and served as president of the Oman Football Association. In his first days as sultan, he made efforts to stabilize his rule, turning Oman for the first time, into a 'dynastic monarchy.' As mentioned, his predecessor had no children to inherit the position, and there was fear of a monarchy crisis and internal struggles. Haitham, however, declared that the crown prince would be the Sultan’s firstborn son, thereby fortifying his family’s position. 'Haitham appointed a successor. He already has a designated, heir, providing him with a certain stability' says Dr. Yoel Guzansky, senior researcher and head of the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). 'In the meantime, he’s doing good things for Oman that have contributed to stability, most importantly turning Oman into a dynastic monarchy - essentially toeing the line with other such Gulf states.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In his first speech after taking office, Sultan Haitham promised to continue his predecessor’s foreign policy of peace and economic development and hasn’t implemented any revolutionary measures. 'He’s pretty much continuing Qaboos’ regional policies in terms of relations with Iran and quiet, discreet mediation with the Americans', says Dr. Guzansky. 'He understands Oman’s strength and capabilities, cultivated by Qaboos for years. He’s now reaping the rewards.' Haitham’s four-and-a-half years in office have been generally stable with no serious crises. Despite Oman’s economic development in recent decades, making the country a world success story, Oman is still regarded as relatively poor. 'Oman exports around 10 million barrels,' says Dr. Guzansky. 'Oman is poor in natural resources in Gulf terms. This makes things hard as there were years when oil prices were low.' Like other monarchs, Haitham’s solution wasto increaseg the burden shouldered by the citizens. 'All of the Gulf states have done that,,' says Dr. Guzansky. 'He’s levying VAT and has slightly reduced fuel subsidies, so everything became slightly more expensive. It’s not very significant as it’s still low, but this change is common in many Gulf states that are ‘rentier states’ in that they provide their citizens with nearly everything in exchange for not participating in the political process. There are no political parties, but rather absolute rule.' In Qatar, for example, citizens receive education, health, education, cheap housing and further benefits. Oman, however, can give its citizens less, and its population is larger. 'Haitham isn’t rich like the Emir of Qatar or the President of the UA, E,' says Dr. Guzansky. Another problem facing Oman, which has become a big problem for the sultan in recent years, is the Houthis who have taken control of much of the country’s territory. Prof. Uzi Rabi senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, Tel Aviv University tells Ynet, 'Historically, and now too, there’s enormous concern that practically and realistically, Yemen is becoming a haven for extremely dangerous terrorist organizations. Tensions must be reduced and stability established. The least healthy thing for Oman is having a dangerous Yemen next door.' Oman and its leader are very worried about the terrorist organizations operating in Yemen. 'It’s not a dangerous country in the sense of increased terrorist trends. Oman believes that, as a monarchy in the Gulf, it will become a target for terrorism. Oman is very concerned about the situation in Yemen' says Prof. Rabi. Despite the implications for Oman of the fighting in Yemen, the country has conducted and still conducts, good relations with the Houthis. 'The Houthis receive medical care in Oman. It’s been reported that their contraband comes via Oman - which turns a blind eye, - and that Omani planes are used to fly the senior ranking Houthi wounded' says Dr. Guzansky. He further says that these activities have ultimately been good for Oman in that it has assisted the Saudis in negotiations with the Houthis and also helped the Americans in mediation. Oman isn’t making any great declarations. It is, however, a very important country. I mediate between Iran and the United States, Iran and Saudi Arabia, and before the current war, almost reached an agreement between the latter who are fighting one another in Yemen. Although not regarded as such in Israel, Oman is an important broker, the mediation conducted behind the scenesfocusesg primarily on the Gulf and the Middle East. Haitham visited Tehran in May 2023 and discussed various diplomatic, defense, and regional matters – two days after Oman mediated a Belgium-Iran hostage release. Haitham’s visits to Saudi Arabia, Qatar,r anBritainan are viewed as part of maintaining good relations with all his important partners. His 2021 visit to Saudi Arabia was the Omani sultan’s first political visit to the kingdom in over a decade. 'This is a country that is very good at maintaining good relations with everyone, be on a high or low light, never completely closing the door,' says Dr. Rabi. He says that the Omanis understand that, they talk to the Houthis and Iranians, they’re very important in the eyes of America and the West. 'They’re brokering the Qatari version, with much less toxic aroma of the Muslim Brotherhood, and more on a functional level. They’re not shouting about it. Oman is quietly accruing lots of credit points.' Oman and its leader have very good relations with Tehran. Both Iran and the US trust Oma. 'The problem is that Qatar is competing with Oman on this front and has greater economic capabilities, 'says Dr. Guzansky. 'Qatar also mediates in Africa, and South America, and helps the Americans in Afghanistan. Oman has a global presence, operating on a slightly different scale.' Dr, Guzansky adds, 'I’m not sure the Haitham has the capabilities Qaboos had. Qaboos was Oman and Oman was Qaboos. The country was molded in his image.'Inn tribal societies, mediators are very important and attain a very special status. 'Mediating honestly and correctly serves as a protection of sorts for the country, as regional powers will come to her to resolve issues that can avert war,' says Dr. Yanai. Oman has always maintained neutrality, never, for example, joining in sanctions on Iran. So, Iran can use Oman as a back door for selling oil, goods, and banking systems much more freely than Qatar can' says Dr. Yanai. 'Qatar has gotten itself into trouble with other Gulf states,s,' says Dr. Yanai. 'The Americans need Oman to mediate with Iran due to the endless friction in the Strait of Hormuz that connects the Gulf of Oman in the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf.' If the strait closes, much of the world’s daily energy can’t pass through, so it’s important for all sides that Oman remains neutral and Oman is very happy in that role.' Now, with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, the region is starting to wonder what would happen to Iran if the tough sanctions policy is reinstated. 'I’m not sure the Omanis are as happy as other countries, es,' says Prof. Rabi. 'If Trump imposes tough sanctions on Iran, and he may well do that, Oman will have to follow suit rather than playing backhand. If anyone’s thinking of attacking Iran or hindering Iran’s production capabilities, Oman can serve as a base for, quite quickly, restoring these capabilities.' So, despite foreseen regional changes, says Dr. Yani, the clear rule over the past century in the Gulf has been that oil must flow. World economic stability is dependent on oil flowing and on a neutral Oman cooling Riad and Tehran. Oman and the sultan have acquired a very important position in the Gulf and the entire Middle East without placing themselves in the center like Qatar. 'This all due to Qaboos and then Haitham,' says Dr. Yanai. Amid efforts to remain neutral, Haitham must sustain a very delicate tribal balance within Oman. Oman is home to a great deal of Shiites from a variety of countries, including Iranians immigrating for work. There are considerable sized communities, keeping up their relationships with their home countries and Muscat encourages inter-cultural and inter-religious tolerance. Dr. Yanai explains 'Any of the parties can use the western tribes, in the desert near Yemen, to instigate riots if Oman takes a clear side. The embers are always burning, and the regime is sure to subdue them.' Regional conflicts, such as the Houthis in Yemen or Iran’s involvement in Lebanon, have taught Haitham that he must ensure his country doesn’t become pa awn in political games. Oman’s unique ethnic makeup also has a great impact on Haitham’s desire to act as a quiet mediator, without standing out. Most of Oman’s residents are Ibadis, Islam’s third largest sect - a moderate faction, distinct from both Shiites and Sunnis. 'Traditionally, the Ibadi’s haven’t wanted to attract too much attention. Saudi Arabia and Iran are both extremist, theocratic powers - in Saudi Arabia, Wahabi, in Iran, Shiite. The Ibadis could easily be declared heretics if they were to upset anyone. They have always kept a low religious profile' says Dr. Yannai. Israel and Oman conduct informal relations, with covert ties between the countries since the 1970s, including covert, and later overt, visits. Following the Abraham Accords, Oman published an official statement of support, though later stressed that it did not intend to normalize relationsshortlye. In February 2023, Oman announced it would allow Israeli airlines to fly in its airspace. This decision, however, was reversed due to the war.' Then Transport Minister Israel Katz visited Oman in 2018 and received a warm public welcome. With swords, he joined his hosts in an Omani traditional dance to the sounds of a familiar folk song. Minister Katz presented his hosts and Arab ministers with his plan for a rail connection to the Gulf states. The future of relations between the countries, however, is unclear. 'The future is shrouded in fog. It very much depends on the Palestinian issue' says Dr. Guzansky. 'The matter concerns them greatly. There’s a tendency to go in the anti-Israel direction. It started before the war and has since intensified. There are covert talks, but I’m looking ahead. The day will come that Israel needs a conduit to Iran, for all kinds of reasons. Oman could be the address for that.' Over the years, Israel has had good relations with Oman, albeit behind the scenes. 'Israel is remembered for its past assistance in stabilizing Qaboos’ power. Now everything’s more complicated' says Dr. Guzansky. 'In recent years, there have been calls from parliament to scale down ties. When the war broke out, this was true for the entire Arab region. Oman has publicly gone in this direction. It should be noted, however, that there are also quiet, covert, channels.' During Haitham’s reign, however, there’s been a retreat of sorts, explains Prof. Rabi. 'The attitude to Israel is slightly less open and more critical than in Qaboos’ time. We’re seeing an attitude taking the back seat, leaving all doors open.' He says there’s less enthusiasm about promoting moves with Israel, and certainly not the countries who signed the Abraham Accords, but also not like during his predecessor’s time. Qaboos was the first to make efforts to develop diplomatic relations with Israel following the Oslo Accords' says Prof. Rabi. 'In 2000, following the First Intifada, there was a regression. This taught Oman to tread carefully. We’re seeing a deliberate, partial, retreat, telling Oman not to be as bold as in the past. Ultimately, this is demonstrated by having a special relationship with the US, but the Strait of Hormuz means that Iran is also very important to Oman which is revisiting its policy from Qaboos’ time. Let’s just hope some war doesn’t break out in the Gulf. Haitham has toed the line with Arab consensus on questions concerning the Palestinian story. 'Haitham is now in a very interesting position, with Trump on his way back and rumors flying about promoting Israel-Saudi normalization', says Prof. Rabi. 'Much of what Haitham is doing, is preparing lots of bargaining chips for the sultanate for the shifts in the Middle East’s geopolitical sands – such as sanctions on Iran and normalization with Saudi Arabia. If this does happen, Oman will go there, albeit crawling – without ruining what it’s already built up with other parties. Oman’s pace has always been very slow. Oman won’t be waking up one morning and doing a 180 turnaround. It will stand in what it feels is a comfortable middle ground, and tilt the pendulum slightly in the direction the Middle East is going.' Prof. Rabi says that we are facing great changes in the Middle East. Trump wants to complete the Abraham Accords and Oman is on the list, after Saudi Arabia. The Americans assume Saudi Arabia is a game-changer in terms ofitss power and size, and that this will be finalized through Oman. Prof. Rabi sums up: 'The sultanate wants calmam and stable Middle East. I want to think Oman won’t make deals with the devil, as ultimately, it fears it could swallow her up.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybcmf2rje	2024-12-27T10:54:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/01/11/9713818/9713818_1_243_980_552_0_small.jpg

Israel awaits Hamas decision to finalize the hostage release deal	Hamas has yet to provide the lists of hostages held for 448 days, as Jerusalem officials say 'Hamas needs to make a decision to finalize the deal'; US officials have presented hostage families with analyses suggesting that Hamas should agree to a deal before Trump takes office Senior Israeli officials said Friday that Hamas has yet to provide lists of hostages, and while negotiations continue, Jerusalem is urging Hamas to make a decision. 'Hamas needs to make a choice and open the door to finalizing the deal,' they said. The families of Israeli hostages have been waiting for official word on a potential deal as they mark 448 days since 100 hostages, both alive and deceased, were taken by Hamas terrorists to Gaza. Meanwhile, U.S. officials expressed optimism that a hostage deal could be reached, or at least an initial step, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. 'There are signs it's coming together, and there’s still a good chance for a deal,' they told family members’ representatives. The U.S. also outlined why Hamas might consider reaching an agreement now, ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent comments, blaming Hamas for reneging on previous agreements, have not fazed U.S. officials. They understand Netanyahu’s political constraints, they said. In the meantime, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker has launched a crowdfunding campaign to support her fight for his release. 'I can’t rely on anyone else,' she said. 'I need the public’s help.'

'I picture hugging Matan every night before I sleep and every morning when I wake up,' she said. 'The knowledge that he's alive and knows what I’m doing for him is my light in this dark time.' While hopeful, Zangauker remains determined to reach a comprehensive deal. She criticized Netanyahu for proposing only a partial deal, arguing it involved 'selecting between the lives of citizens.' She also claimed the government had not authorized the negotiators to address ending the war, a key Hamas demand for releasing all hostages. 'Our fight will not end with the first deal,' Tsangoker stressed. 'It will only end when Israel agrees to end the war in exchange for Matan and all the hostages.'

US defense system intercepts Yemen missile for the first time sin...	Deployed in October, the U.S.-supplied THAAD air defense system successfully intercepted its first ballistic missile early Friday, launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen; 'We’ve waited 18 years for this' says one of the American soldiers operating the system The U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, deployed in Israel since October, successfully intercepted a ballistic missile launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen early Friday—marking its first operational use in the country. The missile launch occurred against the backdrop of Israel's extensive air operation, 'Operation Sounds of the Vineyard,' targeting Houthi positions in Yemen on Thursday night. The operation, described as Israel's most significant strike against the terror group to date, prompted the missile launch in retaliation. Sirens blared across central Israel, including the Tel Aviv area, Sharon, and Shfela regions, at 3:29 a.m. The interception prevented any casualties or direct damage. However, Magen David Adom (MDA) reported treating 18 people for injuries sustained while rushing to shelters. Two others were treated for anxiety. The missile launch briefly disrupted air travel. Four El Al flights en route to Ben Gurion Airport from Paris, Athens, Berlin, and Munich were rerouted over the Mediterranean. Landings resumed approximately 30 minutes after the sirens ceased.

The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the attacks 'unacceptable,' stating they undermine regional stability and must stop. France reaffirmed its commitment to Israel’s security and regional stability. The THAAD system, operated by approximately 100 U.S. soldiers stationed in Israel, is designed to intercept missiles at high altitudes, even outside the atmosphere, using kinetic energy. Similar in capability to Israel’s Arrow missile defense system, THAAD can target various stages of an enemy missile's flight path. The U.S. deployed the THAAD system to Israel at its request, both as a strategic deterrent and a display of military support in the region.

Italian journalist arrested for over a week in Iran, Italy says	Rome accuses Tehran of taking journalist Cecilia Sala, 29, under arrest and placing her in solitary confinement; Iran fails to respond to claims An Italian journalist has been under arrest in Iran for more than a week, Italy's foreign ministry said on Friday, adding it was following the case with the 'utmost attention'. Cecilia Sala, 29, works for the newspaper Il Foglio and for podcast company Chora Media. She was arrested by police in Tehran on December 19, the ministry said in a statement. Italy's government 'has worked with Iranian authorities to clarify Cecilia Sala's legal situation and verify the conditions of her detention', the statement said. Chora Media said in a separate statement that Sala was being held in solitary confinement in the Evin prison in Tehran and that no reason had been given for her arrest. There was no immediate confirmation of the arrest by Iranian officials. It was not clear whether it might be linked to tensions between Rome and Tehran after Iran last week summoned a senior Italian diplomat and the Swiss ambassador, who represents U.S. interests in the country, over the arrest of two Iranian nationals. One of the men was arrested in Italy at Washington's request. Chora Media said Sala had left Rome for Iran on December 12 with a valid journalist visa and had conducted several interviews and produced three episodes of her 'Stories' podcast. She had been due to fly back to Rome on December 20. The Italian ambassador to Iran visited Sala in prison on Friday, the ministry and Chora said. The journalist has also been in phone contact with her family, they said. Chora said news of her arrest was not immediately made public as her family and Italian authorities had hoped that keeping it quiet could help secure her swift release. The foreign ministry urged the media to exercise 'maximum discretion' over the case, while Chora launched a #FreeCecilia hashtag. 'Her free voice has been silenced, and neither Italy nor Europe can tolerate this arbitrary arrest. Cecilia Sala must be freed immediately,' Chora said.

Israel remains vigilant': A month into cease-fire agreement with...	Military officials recount Hezbollah violations treated by the IDF and stress forces are ready to act against terror group if needed; US enforcement mechanism aids in easing tensions The cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah on the northern border came into effect a month ago. Despite skepticism, suspicions, violations and mutual accusations, it's holding for now. IDF forces remain deployed in most of the areas where they operated during the ground operation. However, the agreement’s enforcement mechanism isn’t fully functional yet. Lebanon has expressed doubts about Israel's willingness to withdraw from its territories at the end of the 60 days stipulated in the agreement. The IDF also doesn't regard the deadline as sacred. During a Security Cabinet meeting held at the IDF Northern Command this past week, security officials reported a decrease in Hezbollah's attempts to violate the agreement. Simultaneously, there’s been improvement in the work of the cease-fire enforcement mechanism, headed by a U.S. general. Cooperation between Israel, the IDF and the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) has been described as excellent. Still, violations of various kinds take place. Israel is allowing the mechanism to address them while continuing to act independently when immediate threats are identified. 'That’s why we work alongside it, but we still enforce it ourselves at this stage,' an Israeli official said. 'It looks better now than it did before, but like in Syria, Israel remains vigilant.' According to IDF data, the IDF has eliminated 44 terrorists, conducted 25 strikes in Lebanon and documented 120 Hezbollah violations since the cease-fire began. Conversely, Lebanon accused Israel of violating the agreement in An-Naqoura, citing airstrikes, the raising of the Israeli flag in a Lebanese village and roadblocks, excavation work and explosions in areas like Yaroun and Kfar Kila — actions seemingly intended to achieve unfulfilled war goals. Lebanese officials, meanwhile, doubt Israel's readiness to withdraw from Lebanese territories as stipulated. If Israel fails to to so, Hezbollah might respond with force, claiming Israel breached the agreement which could reignite regional escalation and place the Lebanese army in a precarious position against the Shiite terror organization. The Lebanese drew criticism the 'slow pace' of the agreement’s enforcement mechanism, which they argue allows Israel to continue its operations in the country’s south. Beirut fears Israel aims to provoke Hezbollah into retaliating, thereby framing it as responsible for collapsing the cease-fire. Hezbollah, though battered, has so far exercised relative restraint while issuing warnings about time running out. The IDF remains prepared to stay in locations beyond the border if the Lebanese army fails to meet its commitments or achieve full control over the area. For now, Israel is dismantling weapons caches and tunnels in approximately 15-20 villages near the border while driving back Lebanese civilians attempting to return to the area. Meanwhile, the IDF enforces the cease-fire and has targeted dozens of terrorists approaching the border or preparing rocket launches against Israel. One significant from which the IDF withdrew during the first month of the cease-fire was the Al-Khiyam region, the northernmost area where Israeli forces operated in, extending into Lebanon from the Upper Galilee and paralleling the northern Hula Valley. The IDF drew back after the Lebanese army deployed in the area and began searching for and confiscating Hezbollah rocket launchers in the Litani and Saluki Valleys. The cease-fire’s implementation is meant to proceed gradually for the IDF, with the withdrawal date — while set — not taken as immutable. The possibility of an extended presence in parts of southern Lebanon is being considered. In recent days, most IDF activity has been focused on destroying underground complexes in the western sector, near villages where Lebanon has claimed violations. Attack helicopter strikes against identified Hezbollah operatives have also been reported in these areas. Unlike the 2006 cease-fire under UN Resolution 1701, which ended the Second Lebanon War, this time, the enforcement mechanism is led by an American general rather than weak UNIFIL inspectors. This change means that immediate strikes will be carried out with minimal bureaucratic hurdles if the IDF detects preparations by Hezbollah for attacks against Israel or short-term threats. For less immediate threats, such as the construction of observation posts or bunkers, the IDF will report the location to the American enforcement mechanism. A drone will verify and document the violation and the Lebanese army will be required to address it. Failing to do so will enable the IDF to act. This approach also extends to arms smuggling from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah. By collaborating with the American-led enforcement mechanism, Israel aims to address potential threats effectively while maintaining the option to act unilaterally if necessary.

IDF officer holds son’s bris at kibbutz where harrowing October 7...	Moshe Barsheshet and his wife Renana hold their newborn son’s circumcision ceremony at Kibbutz Holit where he bravely fought terrorists during Hamas' attack 'When I heard about the chaos in the south, I immediately knew it was something big,' recalls Moshe Barsheshet, reflecting on the day that changed the course of Israel’s history — and his own life. 'I was an IDF company commander when a soldier named Rafael Hayun connected us with two people from Kibbutz Holit.' 'They told us the kibbutz was devoid of military presence and infiltrated by Hamas terrorists. Although I was instructed not to head in, I decided to go anyway. On the way, we witnessed horrifying scenes,' he recounts. When Barsheshet and his team arrived at Holit, the situation was dire. 'We discovered around 60 terrorists in the kibbutz,' he says. 'Houses were burning and there were many wounded. We engaged in a fierce battle, during which some of our comrades were injured. But by dawn we regained control of the kibbutz with the help of additional military forces.' Barsheshet and his unit worked tirelessly to evacuate the wounded to the kibbutz gate, clear homes, and rescue survivors. The experience left a profound mark on him. 'I feel a deep connection to the kibbutz, its people, and the place itself,' he says. 'A person who experiences battle or a significant event either becomes repelled by the location or deeply attached to it. My life could have ended there and terrorists cruelly took the lives of so many. But for me, it was essential to return to that place, find closure and raise a new generation where there was once so much sorrow and blood.'

'We brought catering, invited the soldiers who were with me that day, kibbutz members and security personnel,' he shares. 'It was an incredibly emotional and joyful moment — to bring new light to a place once shrouded in darkness. It truly felt like closing a circle.' Barsheshet shared a deeply personal message. 'I’m a settler from Kiryat Arba and they’re kibbutz residents from Holit. Before October 7, our paths rarely crossed. But the terrorists’ bullets didn’t discriminate between us.' 'We need to set aside our divisions,' he says. 'We all know how fractured the nation was before. I want to raise my children with certain values and holding the Brit milah at Holit is part of that. It’s a testament to our shared humanity and resilience.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1zjjrjh1g	2024-12-27T01:30:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/By0I9Z00S1x/By0I9Z00S1x_460_196_759_427_0_small.jpg

Mideast expert: Here's why Iran is panicking ahead of Trump's ret...	Prof. Mordechai Keidar: 'The Iranians and all their supporters are in a panic because of what could happen in the United States' Israel must remain 'very careful' until January 20, while U.S. President Joe Biden is still in office. However, at least one Middle East expert predicts a dramatically different situation under Donald Trump. Bar-Ilan University Professor Mordechai Kedar told ILTV News that after January 20, based on Trump’s statements and the individuals he has nominated, it is likely that 'the Islamists are shaking and shivering.' 'The Iranians and all their supporters are in a panic because of what could happen in the United States,' Kedar said. 'They are afraid that President Trump, when he walks into the White House, will allow anyone to do whatever they like to the Iranians and to their tentacles.'

New Damascus governor wants 'peace' with Israel, says its fears a...	Maher Marwan, appointed by Syria's de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, says many Syrians wish for coexistence as Israel remains skeptical Maher Marwan, the new governor of Damascus appointed by Syria’s de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), made a surprising statement calling on the United States to establish peace between Syria and Israel. 'There exists a people who want coexistence. They want peace. They don't want disputes. We want peace, and we cannot be an opponent to Israel or an opponent to anyone,' he said in an interview with U.S. public radio network NPR. However, he acknowledged Israel’s concerns, saying, 'It's natural for Israel to be worried about certain factions.' He added, ' Israel may have felt fear, so it advanced a little, bombed a little, etc. We have no fear towards Israel, and our problem is not with Israel. And we don't want to meddle in anything that will threaten Israel's security or any other country's security.' A U.S. official confirmed that the new Syrian administration's message was relayed to Israel but noted that the White House isn’t urging either side to take steps toward establishing relations at this time. Direct dialogue between the U.S. and the Syrian rebels has been ongoing since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, culminating in the removal of the $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa’s head due to his past jihadist activities. Israeli officials have indicated that while the Americans understand Israel’s security needs and concerns, they believe Israel should give the new regime a chance. Conversely, Israel maintains a far more skeptical stance. Syria’s transitional government, led by al-Sharaa, recently announced several appointments, including new governors for the country’s provinces, one of whom is Maher Marwan. The governors will serve for three months in the timeframe allocated to form the new government. According to reports in Arab media, Marwan was born in Damascus in 1979. He actively participated in the protests in Syria starting in 2011 and has lived in Saudi Arabia, Damascus the city of al-Qaryatayn in the Homs countryside and later in Idlib. He studied at Idlib University and held various positions under the Syrian opposition, which now controls the country. Israeli officials appear unfazed by the governor's remarks. Sources in Jerusalem told Ynet earlier this week, 'The burden of proof is on al-Sharaa and his people. We mustn’t forget their ideological foundations.' According to these sources, the 'warm' messages from Damascus’s new leadership remain an enigma as no one knows which direction the new regime will take. While al-Sharaa and his team are saying the 'right things,' the post-October 7 mood in Israel is marked by skepticism and fears of a 'charm offensive' meant to deceive the West. Al-Sharaa isn’t affiliated with the Islamic State (ISIS). He was once active in al-Qaeda but left the organization years ago, pivoting toward other jihadist yet more Syrian nationalist-oriented paths. In the past, he also led al-Nusra Front during its affiliation with al-Qaeda and the group itself maintained ties with Israel.

Under Assad, Syria was united through brute force; al-Sharaa envisions a 'different Syria,' with parliamentary representation for all sects. He claimed he seeks no confrontation — not with Israel, nor with the Druze, Alawites or Turks. For now, it’s clear that he and his team are working to calm tensions, whether out of genuine intent or as a calculated manipulation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryygiasbyx	2024-12-26T23:15:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/r1BYMpsBJe/r1BYMpsBJe_198_75_923_520_0_small.jpg

What do Christian Zionists need to do to support Israel?	‘Liquid Prophecy’ and Loud Voices: Experts weigh in on how Christians can stand with Israel today What does Israel need from Christian Zionists? This was one of the questions that three experts on Israel-Christian relations sought to answer this week on Christmas Eve. During ILTV’s Insider, Maj. (Res.) A.Y. Katsof, founder and director of The Heart of Israel; Ilse Strauss, news bureau chief of Bridges for Peace; and Pesach Wolicki, executive director of Israel365 Action, shared their Christmas messages with North American evangelicals, who, according to recent reports, make up about 25% of the population. 'Pray for Israel,' was Katsof’s message. 'I see there are so many churches praying for Israel, reading Psalms, praying for the peace of Jerusalem, praying for the peace of Judea and Samaria,' he said. On the other hand, he urged them to visit and 'put boots on the ground.' Katsof runs 'Settlers’ Cellar' in Eish Kodesh, where he grows grapes harvested by Christians and produces what he calls 'liquid prophecy'—wine made in the ancient tradition of the Israelites, whose first kingdom was in the area. 'Come to the land. See it for yourself,' Katsof said. 'We’re waiting to greet you and let you taste some liquid prophecy.' Wolicki encouraged Christians to stand up for Israel and the Jewish people in their own communities. 'Be loud. Be proud,' he said. 'The pro-Hamas supporters are a tiny, little fringe minority, but they’ve taken to the streets. We need Christians not only to pray for Israel but to be out there in public, standing up, making their voices heard.' He emphasized that such actions would 'matter a lot to the Jewish community,' adding, 'You’ll see more and more Jewish arms open to the relationship if Christians do that.' Strauss, however, focused on empowering Christians to strengthen themselves. 'Educate yourself,' she advised, addressing ILTV’s Christian Zionist audience directly. 'Make sure you have the facts. You can’t stand in front of someone who comes with an accusation of genocide, and your answer is, ‘Yes, but it’s God’s chosen people.’ Have the facts on the ground. Listen to people in the know. Make sure you are an expert.' She concluded, 'Your voice matters. So make sure that when you have that 30 seconds, you use it wisely.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjl6inssjg	2024-12-26T20:42:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/11/rkbGP1gxGyg/rkbGP1gxGyg_0_0_1000_563_0_small.jpg
The 'diplomatic Iron Dome' Israel didn't know it needed	MK Moshe Tur Paz and Josh Reinstein predict Trump’s Christian Zionist-backed administration will usher in a transformative era for Israel A sea change is expected on January 20, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, and Israel is poised to feel its impact, according to Joshua Reinstein, President of the Israel Allies Foundation. 'When Trump comes in, he is going to sign a variety of executive orders. I don’t think you’re going to see any more lawfare like the International Criminal Court. I think you’re going to see the end of UNRWA [The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]. You’re going to see Jerusalem embassies opening up one after another,' Reinstein told ILTV News on this week’s podcast. 'It’s a new dawn. And this is thanks to our Christian allies. This is what we’ve been working for over the last 21 years—to mobilize Christians around the world to stand with Israel and create real political action. 'I think the best is yet to come for faith-based diplomacy,' he added. Reinstein spoke with ILTV shortly after MK Moshe Tur Paz was appointed co-chair of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus. This caucus, one of 54 worldwide, is designed to mobilize political support from lawmakers who stand with Israel out of faith. While the caucus is open to all, it primarily includes Christians who view Israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Tur Paz, a member of the centrist Yesh Atid party, has been involved with the caucus for four years. Reflecting on the challenges Israel has faced, he said, 'In the past year, we have confronted Iran in ways we never have since the country’s founding.' He emphasized the importance of U.S. support, saying, 'Now, we need the Americans there with us. We have faced antisemitic voices around the world. When we have Donald Trump and his administration on our side, it’s a completely different battle—a stronger way to fight.' Tur Paz also expressed optimism about the future. 'We know we may have new challenges ahead, but we have a strong friend in the United States—in Congress and the White House. That’s a big, big thing for Israel.' Reinstein believes the Trump administration will be 'the most pro-Israel administration in the history of American-Israel relations, even more so than the last Trump administration, which was probably Israel’s greatest supporter to date.' He attributes this to the Republican Party’s strong base of Bible-believing Christians and Trump’s selection of like-minded individuals for key positions. 'For example, Peter Hegseth, nominated to be Secretary of Defense, is an evangelical Christian. The U.S. Ambassador to Israel nominee, Mike Huckabee, is also an evangelical Christian,' Reinstein said. 'These individuals, and many others, support Israel not just for political or economic reasons, but because of their faith. That’s a kind of support that doesn’t waver,' he stressed. Reinstein anticipates a wave of embassies opening in Jerusalem soon after Trump takes office, with countries from Africa, Latin America, and even Europe expressing interest. While he did not confirm specifics, he suggested Argentina might be next, followed by nations like Fiji, Malawi, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Romania. 'As the Trump administration works with Israel, there could be a package of benefits for countries that recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. This aligns with official U.S. policy and, of course, Israel’s policy,' Reinstein explained. A Diplomatic Iron Dome The role of Christian Allies Caucuses has grown significantly since the October 7 Hamas massacre. Reinstein described them as 'the diplomatic Iron Dome of the State of Israel,' with around 1,500 legislators advocating for Israel in their own parliaments since the war began. 'We’re seeing faith-based diplomacy in action worldwide,' Reinstein said. 'For example, Australia’s parliamentary Israel caucus passed legislation banning antisemitic symbols in public. This is crucial in a country that has seen an unprecedented spike in antisemitism.' In another case, the Dutch parliament decided to phase out funding for UNRWA, following advocacy by former caucus co-chair and Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel. She visited the Netherlands twice to highlight how UNRWA had been infiltrated by terrorists. Even at the International Criminal Court, when a case against Israel was publicly presented, 500 Christians stood outside waving Israeli flags. Some Jews have historically been hesitant to work with Christians due to a history of antisemitism and persecution. However, both Reinstein and Tur Paz said these attitudes are shifting. 'Eighty percent of our diplomatic successes now come from faith-based diplomacy,' Reinstein said. 'People are realizing there’s nothing more powerful than Christian support for Israel. There are 15 million Jews in the world and a billion Christians.' Tur Paz agreed. 'Faith-based diplomacy is great for Israel and the world. I’d like to see similar partnerships with Muslims,' he said. 'It’s about people-to-people and faith-to-faith. If we can work together in this way, it’s a great path for the world.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aixhohye	2024-12-26T19:56:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/04/Bkv1FQiga/Bkv1FQiga_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF officer killed in combat in northern Gaza	Maj. Hod Shriebman falls in battle in Jabaliya; another Multidimensional Unit soldier seriously wounded; unit has faced heavy losses, including its commander and 3 soldiers in Jabaliya; tank soldier severely wounded by sniper The IDF reported on Thursday that Major Hod Shriebman, 27, a company commander in the Multidimensional Unit (888), from Tzofit, was killed during combat operations in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. Just three months ago, Shriebman married his partner, who shared photos on Facebook, celebrating their 'happy day.' In a separate incident early Thursday, Captain (res.) Amit Levi was killed in the central Gaza Strip. Since the outbreak of the war, 823 Israeli soldiers have lost their lives. During the encounter in which Major Shriebman fell, another soldier from the Multidimensional Unit, also known as the Ghost Unit, was seriously wounded. Additionally, a tank commander from the 401st Armored Brigade's 9th Battalion was severely wounded in northern Gaza due to sniper fire. In October, a battle in Jabaliya claimed the lives of an officer and three soldiers from the Multidimensional Unit: Captain Yehonatan (Joni) Keren from Moshav Moladot, Staff Sergeant Nisim Meital from Hadera, Staff Sergeant Aviv Gilboa from Neve Tzuf and Staff Sergeant Naor Haimov from Rosh HaAyin.

In the crosshairs: The children of Hamas officials who were assas...	Since the outbreak of the war, Israel has intensified its focus on targeting the children of senior Hamas officials, many of whom hold significant roles within the terror organization; this strategy has reportedly escalated in recent weeks The children of senior Hamas leaders remaining in Gaza have reportedly been in Israel's crosshairs since the outbreak of the war. However, according to Arab media reports, targeted killings of these individuals have only intensified in recent weeks. 'Being the child of a Hamas leader grants significant social status in Gaza, even amid public anger against them,' sources in Gaza said. 'These families often have access to resources, know how to hide effectively and can secure food and shelter. They are also well-acquainted with Gaza's infrastructure, some of which Israel has yet to reach.' The first reported assassination occurred on December 28, when the IDF killed Muhammad Issa, the son of Marwan Issa, then deputy head of Hamas’ military wing and the organization's third-ranking leader. Both father and son were killed in separate strikes. Muhammad, who had been battling cancer for years, had unsuccessfully sought medical evacuation from Gaza prior to the war. In April, Israeli forces struck a significant blow by eliminating three sons and three grandchildren of Ismail Haniyeh, the former head of Hamas' political bureau. The six were killed in a targeted strike on the Shati refugee camp in western Gaza. Haniyeh himself was later reported killed in Tehran. In November, Ala’a and Baha’a Barhoum, sons of senior Hamas figure Fawzi Barhoum, were killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Taba’in school in Gaza City. According to local sources, they were there to deliver salaries to Hamas personnel. August saw the killing of Ismail Nofal, the son of Ayman Nofal, a commander in Hamas' military wing and a close associate of Mohammed Deif. Both father and son were killed in separate airstrikes, with Ayman Nofal eliminated early in the war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sources told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that Israel conducted a drone strike in the Jabaliya refugee camp last month, killing Taher Ghandour, the son of Ahmed Ghandour, the commander of northern Gaza and head of Hamas' rocket program. Ahmed Ghandour was killed in November 2022 in a tunnel strike in Jabaliya. Other recent casualties include Imad Salman, son of Rafat Salman, a former senior military operative in northern Gaza; Sohaib and Hassan Rajab, sons of Wael Rajab, a deputy commander who was also killed in Jabaliya; and Ahmad Abu Askar, son of Mohammed Abu Askar, Hamas' administrative chief in the camp. Broader operations Among other targeted killings, Israel eliminated Mohammed Al-Sharafi, son of Youssef Al-Sharafi, a senior Hamas political bureau member; Ibrahim Harb, son of Yasser Harb, another political bureau member; and Sohaib Al-Biyari, son of a prominent commander in Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, and Ibrahim Mohammed Sinwar, a nephew of Yahya Sinwar. Israel has reportedly attempted to assassinate Muamin Al-Jabari, son of Ahmed Al-Jabari, a former deputy of Mohammed Deif who was assassinated in 2012. That attempt was unsuccessful. Additionally, Asharq Al-Awsat reported that Israel recently killed one of Deif’s brothers in a strike on his Khan Younis residence. The intensifying campaign reflects Israel’s strategy of targeting the inner circle of Hamas leadership, aiming to disrupt the organization’s infrastructure and command network while also addressing the families’ roles in Gaza’s conflict dynamics. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syp0z11sbyg	2024-12-26T09:20:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/10/HyPQu74lC/HyPQu74lC_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Inside Israel’s largest Yemen strike: Control tower, power statio...	Israel’s Air Force launches largest Yemen strike yet, targeting Sanaa Airport and other key locations; 'No Houthi leader will escape Israel’s reach,' Katz says Israeli officials confirmed the country’s largest airstrike in Yemen since the war began, targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Sanaa and other key locations. The operation involved 25 aircraft, including fighter jets, reconnaissance planes and tankers, and hit infrastructure critical to Houthi operations. Targets included Sanaa International Airport, where the control tower and landing aids were destroyed to prevent Iranian supply shipments. Civilian aircraft used by the Houthi government were also hit. Additional strikes targeted Hodeidah’s port, a power station with five turbines and oil facilities. Damage reports from Yemeni media indicated the airport’s runways, terminal buildings and the Haziz power station south of Sanaa were also struck. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz observed the operation from the Israeli Air Force command center alongside IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar. 'We are determined to cut off this terror arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' Netanyahu said. Katz added, 'Those who harm Israel will be hunted. No Houthi leader will escape Israel’s reach.' Halevi emphasized the IDF’s long-range strike capabilities, saying, 'Once again, we’ve shown we can reach and eliminate any threat to Israel’s citizens, with precision and power.' Houthi-affiliated Yemeni network Al Masirah reported three deaths and 16 injuries from the strikes on Sanaa airport. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was at the airport during the strike. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Writing on X (formerly Twitter), he said, 'The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge – just a few meters from where we were – and the runway were damaged. At least two people were reported killed at the airport. One of our plane’s crew members was injured. We will need to wait for the damage to the airport the be repaired before we can leave.' A senior Israeli official defended the operation: 'If the Houthis don’t understand force, they’ll understand even more force.' Another source suggested future escalations: 'The Houthis only respond to direct action, and that action will come.' Israel emphasized close coordination with the U.S., which provided intelligence for the strike. A source described the operation as a 'Hanu-Christmas' collaboration, underscoring the partnership between the two nations. The strikes follow a series of Houthi ballistic missile launches, with four incidents in the past week alone. These attacks triggered widespread nighttime alarms across central Israel, causing destruction at a school in Ramat Efal and in Tel Aviv. Israeli officials stressed that further measures are on the table to address the escalating threat. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1wrsmih1x	2024-12-26T08:54:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/rylV0wWjH1e/rylV0wWjH1e_0_152_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Pro-Palestinian leaders removed from Michigan’s student governmen...	University of Michigan student government president Alifa Chowdhury removed alongside vice president after blocking funding to pressure university to cut ties with Israeli companies, supporting harassment of Jewish students and encouraging meeting disruptions The University of Michigan’s Central Student Government has removed its president, Alifa Chowdhury, and vice president, Elias Atkinson, citing misconduct tied to their controversial pro-Palestinian activism and incitement of violence against Jewish students. Chowdhury and Atkinson, elected in April amid a wave of campus protests against Israel, spearheaded initiatives that included boycotts targeting Israeli companies or firms allegedly profiting from the Gaza conflict. Their actions put them at odds with university administrators and the Jewish community on campus. The 40-page resolution outlining their dismissal accused the two leaders of failing in their roles, eroding trust within the student body of approximately 50,000. 'Their decisions not only harmed student organizations but also undermined the community’s confidence in its elected leadership,' the resolution stated. 'Their inability to protect student representatives, coupled with their endorsement of violence and harassment, represents a severe breach of duty.' Chowdhury and Atkinson ran on a platform titled 'Shut It Down,' promising to sever the university’s ties with companies they claimed supported the Gaza conflict. Early in their tenure, they suspended $1.3 million in annual funding for student clubs—ranging from debate teams to dance groups—until the university complied with their demands. The funding freeze crippled hundreds of student organizations, prompting backlash from students who accused the duo of disregarding the broader campus community. The funds, derived from mandatory student fees, were blocked at the governance level, leaving clubs scrambling for resources. University administrators attempted to mitigate the fallout with temporary loans, but tensions escalated. Protests disrupted student government meetings, with reports of physical threats against council members. Chowdhury and Atkinson frequently skipped meetings to avoid reversing their decisions. 'The campus became a political battleground, leaving students to bear the brunt,' said the president of one major student club. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The unrest peaked on Oct. 8, when Chowdhury and Atkinson encouraged protesters to storm a meeting discussing the funding freeze. Jewish council members reported threats, verbal assaults and even spitting incidents during the disruption. Additional allegations against Chowdhury included unauthorized changes to the student government’s official Instagram account credentials. The Jewish student population at the University of Michigan is among the largest at U.S. public universities, with roughly 6,500 members, including 5,000 undergraduates and 1,500 graduate students. In tandem with their removal, pro-Palestinian students filed a lawsuit this week against the university, alleging constitutional rights violations stemming from the administration’s handling of anti-Israel protests. Filed in Michigan’s district court, the lawsuit accuses the university of disproportionately targeting pro-Palestinian students with disciplinary actions, including campus bans, job terminations, and employment restrictions. The lawsuit details incidents such as arrests during a 2023 sit-in at the university president’s office, where law enforcement from 10 counties was present. Protesters reported physical mistreatment, including one instance where a student’s hijab was forcibly removed. The university has not commented on the allegations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknxkyorkl	2024-12-26T06:53:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/06/SJAQvPIfA/SJAQvPIfA_1_407_719_405_0_small.jpg
Israeli officials: '100 aircraft took part in Yemen air raid'	Israeli officials confirmed that the Air Force carried out its largest strike to date in Yemen, targeting key infrastructure, including Sanaa International Airport. The control tower was rendered inoperable, and civilian aircraft used by the Houthi administration were also hit. The strikes extended to Hodeidah’s port and a power station. Officials noted that 100 aircraft participated in the operation, which was coordinated in advance with the United States. 'We said the Houthis would pay a heavy price. If they don’t understand force, they’ll understand even greater force,' an Israeli source said, adding that this strike will not be the last. Lebanese network Al Mayadeen, affiliated with Hezbollah, alleged the strikes targeted sick passengers at Sanaa Airport.

An Israeli official confirmed to Sky News Arabia that Israel carried out strikes on Sanaa International Airport, marking its response to a series of ballistic missile launches by the Houthis targeting Israel. According to Yemeni sources, the strikes hit the airport’s control tower and damaged aircraft stationed there. Some reports claim all targets were civilian, with casualties reported, though exact numbers remain unclear. Additional strikes reportedly hit the Haziz power station near Sanaa and locations in the port city of Hodeidah.

This attack follows last week’s Israeli strike on Yemen—the first to target Sanaa since the war began and the third Israeli operation in Yemen since October 7. The Houthis have launched multiple missile attacks on Israel. The strikes occurred as al-Houthi delivered his regular Thursday speech, a platform often used to boast about attacks on Israel.

IDF changed rules of engagement shortly after October 7 attack, r...	International outlet's extensive investigation, citing Israeli military commanders, claims IDF approved 'unprecedented' strikes against Hamas in Gaza with up to 20 civilian casualties approved per attack; Military denies accusations An investigation has revealed that the IDF dramatically changed its rules of engagement and restrictions on targeting civilians in Gaza immediately following Hamas' terror attack on October 7, 2023, the New York Times reported on Thursday. The shift led to what has been described as one of the most intense bombing campaigns in contemporary warfare. According to the investigation, at exactly 1:00 p.m. on October 7, 2023, for the first time in the history of conflicts with Hamas, a senior IDF command issued an order granting mid-ranking officers extensive authorization to target thousands of locations in Gaza. These included lower-priority Hamas operatives who had not been high-value targets in previous operations. Under these orders, officers were allowed to approve strikes that could risk the lives of up to 20 civilians — significantly more than the restrictions that had previously been in place. Most strikes in past operations were only approved after officers determined there would be no civilian casualties. In some cases, up to five civilian casualties were permitted and rarely was the threshold raised to 10 or more. According to a senior IDF officer interviewed by the newspaper, the military changed its engagement rules because it believed Israel faced an existential threat during the initial hours of Hamas' surprise attack which resulted in the massacre of 1,200 Israelis and the kidnapping of 250 others to Gaza. This was while terrorists were still present inside Israel. The senior officer said that it was imperative to exert significant force to neutralize the threat, executing thousands of strikes in a short time. This necessitated decentralizing strike authorization, typically reserved for senior command. These critical hours were further complicated by the looming fear of a potential Hezbollah invasion from Lebanon, which required the IDF to divert considerable forces to that front. The investigation claimed that in its effort to dismantle Hamas' capabilities in Gaza, Israel significantly weakened oversight mechanisms meant to prevent harm to civilians. It adopted 'flawed' methods for identifying targets and assessing risks to innocents, ignored warnings from IDF officers and U.S. officials about deficiencies and failed to conduct thorough post-strike investigations or punish wrongdoers. The American outlet noted that its findings were based on the review of dozens of military documents and interviews with over 100 soldiers and other sources, including over 25 individuals involved in strike approvals. The report said that in order to significantly expand the target pool in Gaza — part of the pledge to counter the attack on Israel and destroy Hamas — the number of Palestinian civilians who could be endangered in each strike was also increased. The outcome, according to the investigation, was the IDF dropping nearly 30,000 bombs and munitions on Gaza — more than the total used in the subsequent eight months combined. The investigation found that another order issued by IDF command at 10:50 p.m. on October 8 indicated the scale of civilian casualties deemed acceptable during those early days of the war. According to the order, strikes on military targets in Gaza could cumulatively risk the lives of up to 500 civilians daily. This limit was reportedly removed two days later, allowing officers to approve an unlimited number of strikes they deemed lawful. A 500 casualty limit: precaution or quota? IDF sources told the outlet that the removed restriction was actually a precaution meant to limit the number of strikes per day. However, Professor Michael N. Schmitt of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, argued that mid-level officers might have interpreted it as a 'quota' of permissible civilian deaths per day. Following the limit’s removal, Hamas-controlled authorities in Gaza often reported daily death tolls exceeding 500, though it remains unclear how many were civilians, terrorists or casualties from previous days. The investigation highlighted Shaldan al-Najjar, a senior Islamic Jihad terrorist, as an example. During Operation Protective Edge in 2014, the IDF reportedly took numerous precautions to keep civilians away from his house before attacking it. These included calls to neighbors warning of the impending strike and implementing the 'roof knock' procedure, commonly used before targeting buildings suspected of containing weapons or tunnel entrances. As a result, everyone, including al-Najjar himself, evacuated with no casualties. However, when the IDF targeted a house he visited on October 10, 2023, no prior warnings were issued. The strike killed al-Najjar along with 20 of his extended family members, including children and a two-month-old baby. In some cases targeting Hamas leaders, senior IDF officers approved strikes knowing they could endanger over 100 civilians each — actions the outlet described as ' crossing an extraordinary threshold for a contemporary Western military.' The IDF reportedly conducted strikes at such a rapid pace that the pre-war target database was depleted within days. As a result, the military adopted a new and 'unproven' system for identifying targets, relying on artificial intelligence heavily. According to the report, a system called 'The Gospel' was used to cross-reference information from various sources, including phone calls, satellite imagery and cellular tracking. The IDF also maintains extensive databases, one of which is known as 'Lavender,' containing phone numbers and addresses of suspected terrorists. A chaotic mood Israel's control over Gaza's communication networks allowed for the monitoring and tracking of Palestinian phones. However, six IDF officers told the outlet that these databases sometimes contained outdated information, increasing the risk of misidentifying civilians as terrorists. The investigation further alleged that the IDF frequently relied on a simplistic statistical model to assess risks to innocents during strikes. Sometimes targets were bombed just hours after being identified, allegedly increasing the likelihood of errors. The model mainly estimated risks based on cellular activity in broad areas near strike zones rather than detailed intelligence tracking of specific structures as was customary in previous Israeli operations. The IDF’s air campaign was most intense during the initial weeks of the war. Palestinians claim that 15,000 people were killed in the first two months — a figure reported by Gaza's Hamas-controlled Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and terrorists and has faced skepticism over its data. Regardless, amid international outrage during that period, the IDF reportedly reduced its use of bombs from November 2023 onward to conserve munitions and tightened strike protocols, including halving the number of civilians allowed to be endangered in low-priority strikes. Despite this, the death toll in Gaza continued to rise, with Palestinians claiming over 45,000 fatalities to date. The dramatic and extensive investigation comes as Israel faces allegations of genocide in Gaza, including a lawsuit filed against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Israel firmly denied these accusations, stressing its compliance with international law and its efforts to minimize civilian harm, such as mass evacuation orders for entire cities, leaflets dropped from the air and warnings via social media. Israeli officials frequently highlight Hamas and other terror groups' use of civilians as human shields, embedding terrorists and weaponry in residential buildings and hospitals. According to the outlet, IDF officers must ensure that the risks posed by airstrikes are 'proportional' to the military value of the target and take feasible precautions to protect innocent lives under international law. However, the investigation stressed that officers have considerable discretion because the rules of warfare are ambiguous regarding what constitutes a feasible precaution. The report, citing about a dozen sources who spoke to the New York Times, claimed that some IDF officers involved in the bombing campaign became far less stringent about adhering to military protocols after the shock of the October 7 massacre. While some commanders worked hard to maintain compliance, five senior officers reportedly described the mood in the military using the term 'harbu darbu' (A Hebrew slang expression coined from the Arab harb wadarb: Battles and war). The outlet noted it received a 700-word response from the IDF and included excerpts of it alongside interviews with senior officials to understand the policies. The IDF confirmed that the rules for approving strikes changed after October 7 but stressed that its forces have 'consistently been employing means and methods that adhere to the rules of law.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: IDF representatives explained that the changes to strike protocols were made in the context of an 'unprecedented and hardly comparable to other theaters of hostilities worldwide.' The response cited the massive scale of Hamas' deadly terror attack, the terrorists’ use of civilians as human shields and the extensive tunnel network as factors influencing military target selection and the ability to take various precautions before strikes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryi00s09r1x	2024-12-26T05:10:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/22/SyVUNsj4T/SyVUNsj4T_0_124_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Moshe disappeared in Israel's 'Bermuda Triangle', and he's not th...	Searches still continue for several Israelis who went missing in the area between Safed and Meron including Moshe Eliezer Ilovitch, whose family refuses to give up efforts to find him The area between the northern Israel cities of Safed and Meron has earned the nickname 'Bermuda Triangle' for good reason. Its dense, open terrain, spiritual aura and holy sites intertwine with years of poverty and neglect, culminating in the tragic disaster that has claimed the lives of 45 people. The region's nature attracts shady figures and cult members who seem to find it a lawless space, leaving the price to be paid by tens of thousands of law-abiding citizens. This phenomenon has also led to a troubling pattern of disappearances — ranging from a young girl to an elderly man. On Wednesday morning, the Israel Police’s Canine Unit, Safed police station and other organizations launched yet another operation to locate some of the missing individuals: Moshe Kleinerman (16 at the time of his disappearance) missing since March 25, 2022, near the Tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai; Haymanot Kasau, 9, who vanished in Safed on March 25; Raphael Chaim Hadad, 60, last seen in the Safed area on November 18, 2022; David Israel Padida, 28, missing since October 15, 2024, also from Safed, and Moshe Eliezer Ilovitch, 37, who disappeared on May 18, 2019, near Meron just before the Jewish holiday of Lag B'Omer. The missing individuals’ families assisted in the search, which focused on caves, pits, thickets and hiding spots. Yet, like many previous efforts, this operation ended with no breakthroughs. 'It’s been a long time since searches took place,' said Aharon, Moshe’s son. 'It’s always relevant to try finding something new, there’s been no trace of my dad since he disappeared.' The list of the region’s missing extends even further. It includes, for example, Yoram Fliter, 32, a Safed resident who disappeared under mysterious circumstances on October 8, 2023, though his car was later found near Beit Shemesh; Shalom Dahan, 60, missing since February 15, 2017, in Hatzor HaGlilit; and even Haviv Ben Abu, 80, who went to Meron on Lag B'Omer eve in 1995 and has not been seen since. The home burned down during the searches Aharon, who was 16 when his father Moshe disappeared, still recalls the shock and fear when his father didn’t answer the phone on that Saturday night. Since then, his family has lived with one question looming over them: What happened to him? 'I have no answers, only hope,' he says. Moshe was 42 at the time of his disappearance. He lived on Mount Meron after his divorce and worked in Safed. He was last seen at the Tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai on the morning of May 18, a few hours before he vanished. 'There were no prior indications, nothing unusual,' Aharon says, describing his father as someone who loved the area and handled personal struggles just like anyone else. Aharon, now 21, is the second of Moshe's five children. He was supposed to spend that Sabbath with his father, but Moshe stopped answering his phone as early as Thursday. 'I was waiting for him to call me Saturday night, but it never happened,' he recalls. Concerned, Aharon went to his father’s home the next day, but five and a half years later, Moshe is still missing. The family had lived in Mevo Modi’im, but Moshe had moved to Meron a few months earlier following his separation from his wife. The children frequently visited him for Sabbaths and holidays and were planning to spend Lag B’Omer with him. Aharon recounts that his father and friends were evicted from their rented apartment days before the holiday to make way for foreign visitors willing to pay high sums for accommodations near the celebration. This common practice in the area forced them to camp in tents nearby. On May 17, about an hour before the Sabbath, a friend drove Moshe from Safed to Meron, reporting nothing unusual in his behavior. CCTV cameras recorded Moshe at the tomb at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday. He then walked toward the tents. Since then, no trace of him has been found. The area, a dense forest with pits and rugged terrain, has caused others to lose their way in the past. Despite extensive searches, no sign of Moshe or the other missing individuals has been found. According to Aharon, his father struggled after the divorce but showed no worrying signs. 'It was a mutual decision and everything ended amicably,' he says. 'We even visited him together with my mom.' On Sunday evening, May 19, Aharon and his younger brother went to Meron to investigate. 'I went to the tent where he stayed and all his belongings were there — except for him,' he says. The next day, the family reported him missing to the police. Amid their anguish, the family faced another tragedy when their home in Mevo Modi’im burned down completely. 'I was out searching for my dad when a friend told me the town was on fire. My sister called, saying the younger siblings had been evacuated,' Aharon recounts. Homeless and overwhelmed, they rented an apartment in Safed to stay close to the search area. 'He might have wandered into a forest' Eli Ben-Tovim, a veteran search volunteer in northern Israel, has known Aharon since his father's disappearance. 'I met the family the day they reported Moshe missing. Aharon was only 14 and seeing his mother running around with a baby stroller to search for her husband was heartbreaking,' he says. Ben-Tovim noted that recent searches resumed in previously restricted forested areas following the war. 'If someone’s lost, injured or worse we should’ve found them. It’s unusual if we don’t.' Meron, he adds, attracts individuals seeking solitude or refuge. 'But Moshe wanted to see his family. I don’t think he intended to disappear. He might’ve wandered into a forest, fallen or gotten hurt.' Initially, the family felt the police weren’t making enough effort but they saw improvement after Israel’s Canine Unit joined the case. 'They’ve supported us ever since,' Aharon says. 'Police involvement felt dismissive before that.' Even after Moishi Kleinerman’s disappearance in the same area, Aharon remains skeptical of law enforcement’s dedication. 'Every few months, they’d call my mom to ask if we found him and hang up,' he says. 'They would have found him if they truly wanted.' Monetary reward leads to tips, not breakthrough The family even offered a monetary reward — first 50,000 NIS ($13,628), then 100,000 ($27,256) — but every lead ended in disappointment. Aharon recalls traveling to Jerusalem after receiving an unclear photo suggesting Moshe had been spotted. 'I rushed there before Sabbath, but a video later confirmed it wasn’t him.' Aharon has taken on his father’s role, supporting the family and strengthening bonds among his siblings and extended relatives since May 18, 2019. 'We’ve grown closer. We’re a strong family, and we’re all waiting for him,' he says. 'He’s missing from everything — Sabbaths, meals, daily life trips,' Aharon says, his voice heavy with emotion. 'He wasn’t there for my younger brother’s bar mitzvah three years ago. My brother initially refused to celebrate without him. 'We had to convince him and it was a very charged event. We went to the Western Wall with our grandparents and the whole family — but my dad wasn’t there. I hope he’s back in time for my wedding,' Aharon said.

After all this time, all I have left is hope. I feel he’s alive but I can’t explain why he hasn’t contacted us. 'If he’s listening, I want him to know that we’re still strong and waiting for him no matter what — me and the rest of the kids. I’ve even imagined waking up one morning and seeing him smiling next to me. That would be a joy beyond words.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bji5x69sjg	2024-12-26T04:23:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/HkwheOZSye/HkwheOZSye_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

The women were questioned for hours after they placed the leaflets featuring pictures of hostages under the heading 'Let My People Go' on seats in the synagogue where a member of Knesset prays The Attorney General's Office has closed the case against the three women who were arrested in September for placing leaflets in the synagogue where Knesset member Yuli Edelstein prays in Herzliya. The leaflets placed on seats in the synagogue featured pictures of several hostages, including the Bibas family, under the heading 'Let My People Go.' The police said at the time that 'three suspects, residents of Herzliya, were arrested for questioning on suspicion of trespassing into a synagogue in the city and distributing leaflets there.' It was also reported that 'during the investigation, the police noticed flyers scattered inside the synagogue with pictures of the hostages.' The suspects were arrested and brought to the police station for questioning.' The women were then interrogated for about eight hours and released to their homes under restrictive conditions.

Journalists are mishandling critical evidence in Syria needed for...	Absence of capable personnel to safeguard institutions after the Assad regime’s collapse has led to the mishandling of documents and potential criminal evidence that journalists, in a race for exclusives, have found in prisons and security branches From the collapse of the Syrian regime and the flight of former President Bashar Assad, a deluge of news stories has emerged from a nation struggling to recover. Syria, described as a vast prison under the Assad regime, has revealed dozens of detention centers and security branches rife with evidence of war crimes. Many media professionals have observed that much of this reporting lacks proper oversight, partly due to the chaotic handling of sensitive documents left in these facilities. Journalists, in a race for exclusives, often accessed these sites without authorization, mishandling materials that could serve as critical evidence in prosecuting crimes. Arab media, for example, widely reported on documents retrieved from security branches implicating former officials in war crimes. Yet many of these documents subsequently disappeared, erasing evidence vital for accountability. Syrian political analyst Wael Al-Khalidi criticized journalists entering government facilities without authorization from the new Syrian administration. He stressed that any handling of documents should occur under the supervision of national authorities, warning that journalists otherwise risk being perceived as 'thieves' pilfering sensitive material – a scenario that has indeed occurred. Ibrahim Hussein, director of the Syrian Center for Media Freedoms, highlighted the need for professional standards, urging reporters to prioritize their safety and ethical integrity. 'Journalists must also be familiar with local and international laws regarding handling forensic evidence. It is essential not to tamper with, move, or alter evidence unless necessary to preserve it,' he explained. Similarly, Mohammad Al-Sattouf, a member of the Journalists’ Association, emphasized the importance of verifying the authenticity of documents and preserving their integrity. He advised consulting experts to validate evidence and maintain confidentiality, particularly when dealing with sensitive investigations or witness testimonies. Ethical violations have also recently extended to the treatment of former detainees. Some media outlets, such as Al Jazeera, were criticized for bringing former prisoners back to their cells and asking them to reenact the conditions of their detention. Observers condemned this as a severe breach of journalistic ethics, turning reporters into interrogators. Al-Sattouf pointed out that journalists have an ethical duty to respect privacy and avoid publishing graphic images or content that violates the dignity of victims and their families. Instead, he stressed the need for balanced coverage that delivers the facts while upholding humanitarian principles. Journalist Ahmed Alayan condemned such practices as a descent into 'media madness.' He attributed these ethical breaches to the lack of professional standards in many media organizations, calling for immediate reform to prevent further harm. The proliferation of misinformation in Syria, compounded by years of violence and suppression, represents another significant challenge. Misleading narratives have fueled hatred and distorted facts, both locally and globally. Ahmed Primo, director of the verification platform Taqat, warned of the dangers of misinformation in the context of detention and imprisonment. He cited examples of well-intentioned misinformation that undermined the credibility of verified testimonies, videos and photos. Primo highlighted a case involving the BBC, where the network misled the public by claiming its correspondent in Damascus facilitated the release of a former detainee, who later turned out to be a security officer complicit in crimes. He also emphasized the critical role of the new Syrian authorities in maintaining evidence integrity. 'While we advocate for media freedom, there must be guidelines to ensure responsible reporting,' he said. The mishandling of evidence, Primo argued, risks obstructing justice. Sensitive materials must be preserved for prosecuting perpetrators rather than exploited for journalistic scoops. Since the collapse of the Syrian regime, the state-run media has remained largely paralyzed. Officials cite a lack of qualified personnel to manage even basic operations, such as running the state television network. Despite widespread public demands for a robust national media to report on ongoing developments, Syrian state media remains conspicuously absent, leaving a vacuum of reliable information. A source close to the Ministry of Information in the new Syrian government stated that the level of chaos in state institutions following the fall of the regime was not as extensive as might have been expected, considering the magnitude of the event. The source noted that the fall of the regime in such a manner could have resulted in even greater disorder. The source, who requested anonymity, highlighted the severity of the mishandling of documents, which could serve as criminal evidence, that occurred in prisons and security branches. However, this occurred due to the absence of capable personnel to safeguard these institutions after the regime’s collapse. In this context, Ibrahim Al-Qaddah, a member of the Syrian military cadre, said that the situation has now reached an acceptable level of stability. He affirmed that all institutions and their documents are currently protected, and the government has expressed its willingness to cooperate with any international body seeking to investigate crimes.

Hamas official says situation in Gaza makes compiling hostage lis...	Arab outlet cites official as saying talks between Israel and the terror group continue; Israel denies receiving list detailing live hostages in Hamas captivity A senior Hamas official told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed Thursday overnight that claims suggesting Mohammed Sinwar was inflexible and refused to provide a full list of living Israeli hostages as part of efforts to ensure a hostage and cease-fire deal are false. According to the official, Hamas has provided such a list — including those its members managed to contact through the factions responsible for holding them. Israel has consistently denied that such a list was delivered throughout the talks. The official added that the terror organization has held talks with other factions holding hostages, but that it was impossible to communicate with all of them due to the situation in Gaza. He further said Hamas has affirmed during negotiations its willingness to provide a complete list of living hostages once the situation in Gaza stabilizes and after a cease-fire is achieved. The official also noted that the local leadership of the Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, operates in 'harmony' with the terror group’s political leadership, asserting there’s 'complete agreement' between them. He said Khalil al-Hayya, who served as former leader Yahya Sinwar’s deputy, has effectively been authorized to make decisions in the negotiations as the head of Hamas's negotiation team. Al-Hayya is part of a leadership council Hamas established following Sinwar’s assassination, which includes four other key Hamas figures: the movement’s leader abroad Khaled Mashal, Hamas leader in the West Bank Zaher Jabarin, the head of Hamas’s Shura Council Muhammad Darwish and senior official Nizar Awadallah. The outlet also reported that one unresolved issue pertains to the release of Palestinian prisoners. According to the report, the release of some 'high-profile' prisoners — including Marwan Barghouti, Ahmad Sa’adat, Abbas al-Sayed, Abdullah Barghouti, Ibrahim Hamed and Hassan Salameh, along with two senior Islamic Jihad officials — would be postponed to the final stage of the deal. An Israeli source reiterated that Barghouti would not be released.

Shocking report on hell experienced by hostages rescued from Gaza...	A draft report by the Ministry of Health, based on testimonies from hostages who were released or rescued from Gaza, describes the difficult time they spent in captivity and the consequences. The immune system weakened by the lack of food, the mental state deteriorated due to the abuse they experienced - and the fear of 'immediate feeding syndrome after starvation' for hostages who return in the future Neglect, torture and humiliation: The Ministry of Health has recently completed work on a draft special report that includes hard-hitting testimonies from the hostages who were released in the previous deal or rescued from Hamas captivity in Gaza. Once the work on the report is complete, it will be transferred to the Justice Ministry and presented to the United Nations committee that deals with torture. 'It contains materials that tell the story of those who returned from captivity over the past year, some in the major return operation in the last week of November 2023, and some in other cases of rescue,' a senior official at the Health Ministry said of the report. The Health Ministry was careful to word the information provided in the report in a way that would prevent identification of the freed hostage and there is no mention of ages or family composition. The senior official at the Health Ministry added that the report 'includes information that the returning hostages did not share in the first weeks after returning home. As time passed, they allowed themselves to share more. It describes many aspects of neglect, torture, humiliation, and physical and mental abuse.' According to the draft, some of the hostages experienced a very large weight loss, and they experienced starvation and malnutrition. In adults, this was reflected in a loss of 8 to 15 kilograms, and in children there was an average loss of 10% of their pre-captivity weight, in some cases a loss of 18% of their weight. The report noted that this loss has significant consequences, such as 'muscle breakdown and a weakened immune system. As a result of appalling hygiene, and unclean water, hostages suffered from stomach pains and diarrhea during their time in captivity. All of this has serious psychological consequences, certainly when it comes to children.' It was also noted that, in preparation for the return operation last year, the captors fed the hostages. This was reflected in the blood tests of the survivors of captivity. The report describes the fear in Israel of what is defined as 'immediate feeding syndrome after starvation.' After 446 days in captivity, the fear that the captors will give the hostages still in Gaza to food gain weight - putting their lives at risk - is even greater. According to the draft report, the hostages were held alone in the dark for days, tied hand and foot, and given very little food. They were beaten all over their bodies, some had their hair pulled out, and in some cases their skin was burned with an iron heated over a hot fire. Others testified to a lack of showers and to being forced to defecate on themselves. It is also noted that several hostages described having their bandages changed without painkillers, and that they experienced immense pain under medical treatment. The hostages who were released were in very poor sanitary conditions, and sometimes it took days and hours before they were allowed to go to the bathroom. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The purpose of publishing the report is to tell the world what the hostages went through in Hamas captivity, given that the health of some of them has deteriorated in the long time that has passed since the previous hostage return deal. A senior official in the Health Ministry concluded: 'The most important thing is that those who can influence, certainly in the world, will understand that they need to put pressure on Hamas and make them return the hostages home.' Health Minister Uriel Bosso told Ynet: 'I see this as a significant report that describes the horrors the hostages endured and will expose to the world the cruelty of the enemies we face. The evidence presented in it is a wake-up call for the world to put more pressure on Hamas and its supporters to release everyone, now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b13c0kqskg	2024-12-25T23:32:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/16/r1gfuE008Mke/r1gfuE008Mke_0_96_1280_721_0_small.jpg
