Kidnapped Elizabeth Tsurkov 'may have been transferred to Iran', ...	Iraqi prime minister does not know where Israeli-Russian researcher kidnapped in Baghdad in 2023 is being held; Official says 'any decision regarding her will come only from the government in Tehran'; Emma, ​​Elizabeth's sister, tells Ynet: 'For the first time since the kidnapping - there is room for optimism' Iran is believed to be involved in the detention of Israeli-Russian researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was kidnapped in Baghdad in 2023 by the Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi official told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the official, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani 'does not know where Tsurkov is being held,' adding that 'it’s a stroke of luck she’s still alive. Usually, captives don’t survive the interrogations.' Two senior officials in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump have joined efforts to secure Tsurkov’s release: Adam Boehler and Rep. Mike Waltz. Boehler, Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs, told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya that the U.S. is pressuring Iraq’s prime minister, who 'continues to claim he doesn’t know where Tsurkov is being held,' but has acknowledged that the Iran-backed Iraqi Hezbollah militia abducted her. Reuters reported Monday that Boehler traveled to Iraq about three weeks ago to meet with senior officials and attempt to break the deadlock in locating Tsurkov. In an interview with Ynet from the United States, Emma Tsurkov, Elizabeth’s sister, said: 'I’ve spoken directly with Adam Boehler several times, and I’ve also met his team. The updates are encouraging. It’s amazing that in just a few weeks of determined effort, they’ve made more progress than in the previous two years. I really hope this pressure from the Americans works soon so I can hug my sister again.' 'They’re very careful not to give me false hope, but in all my conversations with Adam Boehler, he’s been incredibly kind and patient. I don’t know how he finds the strength to speak with hostage families with such empathy,' Emma Tsurkov said. 'He told me the same thing Steve Witkoff said when I met him in Washington a week and a half ago — that they are working on this, that my sister is important to them, and that it’s unacceptable to them for a Princeton student to be held captive in a country allied with the U.S.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Addressing claims from Iraqi officials that Tsurkov may have been transferred to Iran, Emma Tsurkov said: 'I’ve heard that before. If I had a dollar for every time an Iraqi official told me that, I could buy Iraq. It’s a convenient excuse they keep repeating, but it’s not true. She is not in Iran. The Iraqi government knows exactly who is holding her because the terror group detaining her is part of the Iraqi system.' 'We’re afraid to be optimistic too soon,' she added. 'Until I’m holding her in my arms, it’s not over. But for the first time since the kidnapping, there’s reason for hope. She’s alive. She’s in Iraq.' No longer branded a 'Zionist spy' American diplomatic efforts have also impacted how Tsurkov is described on Iraqi social media. She is no longer labeled a 'Zionist spy' or 'CIA agent,' as she was forced to declare in a previously recorded video released by her captors. Now, social media posts refer to her as 'the Israeli researcher who entered Iraq on a Russian passport, ignoring the ban on Israeli citizens.' Tsurkov was abducted in March 2023 in Baghdad’s Karrada district. Iraqi social media reports claim Iran is pushing for a prisoner exchange deal in return for her release. The proposed deal reportedly includes freeing Emad Ahwaz, a naval officer linked to Hezbollah and captured by Israel; Iranian terrorist Reza Nouri, imprisoned in the U.S.; and an Iranian 'infiltrator' held in Cyprus. While some speculate that Tsurkov was transferred to Iran for interrogation and negotiations, an Iraqi official told Ynet that Prime Minister al-Sudani 'has no precise information on her whereabouts but does know who kidnapped her.' This is the second time the U.S. has pressured al-Sudani to act, the official said. 'The first time, less than a year ago, he was confident she would be released and even made promises to the Americans. It didn’t work. This time, for more than a week, the Americans have been threatening Iraq with direct economic sanctions.' The official, who lives with his family in Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone, explained that Israel cannot intervene directly to secure Tsurkov’s release. He confirmed that Kataib Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia responsible for her abduction, still holds her in an undisclosed location. He said Tsurkov was kidnapped after leaving a café with an Iraqi citizen — possibly someone who betrayed her and handed her over to the militia. 'There’s full documentation and witness testimony from people on the street who reported the kidnapping to Baghdad’s security forces,' he said. 'The prime minister sent police and intelligence officials to speak with the militia leaders. They promised to ‘arrange her release,’ but nothing happened. When they followed up, the response was: ‘We don’t know where she is.’' The Iraqi official also confirmed that, for months, U.S. officials believed Tsurkov had been taken to Iran for questioning. 'It’s possible she was moved there secretly, or Iranian intelligence agents were brought in to interrogate her,' he said. 'It’s a miracle she’s still alive. Usually, hostages are executed during interrogations. Her foreign identity is working in her favor.' He added that Prime Minister al-Sudani would prefer to hand her over to the Americans but genuinely doesn’t know where she’s being held. According to the official, the U.S. has demanded Iraq 'resolve the case of the Israeli hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov,' who entered Iraq on her Russian passport. Israel reportedly appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to intervene, but he has not acted. 'That’s why the Americans are emphasizing her Israeli citizenship and threatening Iraq with sanctions if it doesn’t act quickly,' the Iraqi official said. Nearly a year after her abduction, a video surfaced of Tsurkov pleading in Hebrew for her release. In the recording, she 'confessed' to working for Israel’s Mossad and the CIA and 'demanded' Israel stop its 'heinous attacks.' Before her kidnapping, Tsurkov was an outspoken critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and publicly stated, 'If I’m kidnapped, don’t pressure anyone to secure my release.' Despite that, U.S. mediators are applying heavy pressure on Iraq, warning of punitive measures if Tsurkov isn’t freed soon and handed over to the Americans. According to the Qatari daily Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Adam Boehler has threatened Iraq with economic and diplomatic consequences, making it clear the U.S. holds Iraq responsible for ensuring her release. While the Iraqi government says it is taking steps to locate her, there has been no cooperation from her captors. 'We believe Iran is involved and giving the orders,' the Iraqi official said. Last week, Iraq’s National Security Adviser Qasim al-Araji announced renewed efforts to locate Tsurkov, but so far, they have not succeeded. 'No group in Iraq has claimed responsibility for holding the Israeli-Russian researcher,' he said. 'The Tsurkov case is directly linked to Iran,' the senior Iraqi official concluded. 'Only they will decide her fate.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjbeb3ro1l	2025-03-11T23:36:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/11/yk14292454/yk14292454_0_29_691_389_0_small.jpg

Taking over influence the US is backing away from' : Europe begi...	With Washington treating alliances as negotiable rather than essential, Europe is forced to take on a greater role in security and international diplomacy; 'There’s a power vacuum, and it’s going to be filled' Over the past decade, the geopolitical landscape between the United States and the European Union has undergone significant changes. The once-stable transatlantic alliance is experiencing fractures, driven by shifting U.S. policies and Europe’s push for greater autonomy. This evolving relationship is evident in responses to international crises, such as the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as Europe’s renewed focus on military capabilities. A transatlantic divide: The US steps back, Europe moves forward Historically, Washington has led, with Brussels following its direction. However, recent years have disrupted this dynamic, particularly during the Trump administration. Mattia Diletti, a researcher in the Department of Communication and Social Research at La Sapienza University in Rome, argues that the shift is not due to Europe pulling away but rather to the US stepping back. 'It is not Europe that dissociates itself from the United States, but it is the United States that dissociates itself from Europe, from NATO,' according to Diletti. 'This administration has decided to intervene in a transformative way on the liberal order that the United States has shaped after World War II.' This change reflects a broader departure from the post-World War II multilateral system, moving toward a more transactional approach based on spheres of influence. As Diletti explains: 'What is changing is the system of international relations with the abandonment of a multilateral system based on international institutions led by the United States, toward another model based on spheres of influence.' The Ukraine war: Europe fills the US void The shift in U.S. engagement is most evident in Ukraine. With Washington showing hesitancy in sustaining its support, Europe has been compelled to take a more active role in Kyiv’s defense. Steven Terner, an American geopolitical analyst, describes this transition. 'Europe is going to pick up the slack that the United States is dropping,' he said 'So Europe will continue to support Ukraine, and it’ll support Ukraine probably even more than the US was, because it’s afraid of being left without the United States entirely.' Yet, the consequences of reduced US involvement extend beyond military aid. Terner warns that Washington’s reluctance to fully back Ukraine is weakening its global standing: 'The risk is the United States is simply losing geopolitical influence by not supporting Ukraine. It’s losing credibility with Europe, and it’s losing credibility with all of its allies internationally. And Europe is taking over the influence that the United States is backing out of.' Rearming Europe: A new military power emerges In response to these geopolitical shifts, European nations have significantly increased their defense spending. The European Union has announced an ambitious $800 billion plan for security and military development. Diletti sees this as a crucial step, though one that remains largely theoretical. 'We are evoking a future of an autonomous Europe politically and militarily, but from a practical and material point of view, we are far from it,' he said. Despite growing defense budgets, he remains skeptical about Europe's ability to act decisively: 'The transformation of political Europe, for me, is like a soap bubble. Europe must change its approach to decision-making. Otherwise, all this movement risks becoming a soap bubble.' The Middle East: Europe and the US on diverging paths Beyond Ukraine, differing approaches to Middle Eastern conflicts further illustrate the widening gap between the U.S. and the EU. The Trump administration’s stance on Israel and Palestine, particularly regarding the Gaza crisis, clashed with European leaders, who supported an Egyptian-led peace initiative. Terner points to Europe’s limited ability to enforce its policies: 'Even though Europe supports the Arab and Egyptian plan, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be implemented, because they can’t implement it without Israel.' Similarly, Diletti questions whether Europe has ever wielded real influence in the region: 'Clearly, it is an attempt to gain autonomy and to reason in terms of reasonable terms. But the question remains: Have Europeans ever really had much influence in this region?' A new world order? The growing divide between the U.S. and Europe is forcing both to reconsider their roles in global affairs. While Europe pushes for strategic independence, the U.S. appears increasingly focused on a transactional foreign policy, treating alliances as negotiable rather than essential. 'Everywhere that the United States pulls out of will be filled by somebody else. There’s a power vacuum, and it’s going to be filled,' Terner observes: For now, Europe seems ready to step into that gap. Whether it can truly establish itself as a dominant geopolitical force or remain hindered by internal divisions remains uncertain.	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rkt11dqcoke	2025-03-11T21:40:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/HJ23vdkiyl/HJ23vdkiyl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Is Jesus angry? Kanye West's church burned down	The property the antisemitic rapper purchased next to his church in Los Angeles burned to the ground, destroying his hopes of expanding his house of worship; Neighbors in the area obtained 12,000 signatures for a petition calling for the property not to be sold to him citing his offensive and antisemitic statements It seems Kanye West has managed to anger not only people on Earth but perhaps higher powers as well—Jesus, for instance. How else to explain the fate of the abandoned church building the embattled rapper purchased for $1.5 million, only for it to burn to the ground? On Monday, reports surfaced that West’s hopes of expanding his church in Los Angeles went up in flames after the adjacent building he bought was destroyed by fire. West acquired the one-story property in the San Fernando Valley in 2023. The building was previously owned by Cornerstone Christian Church, located next door. Despite West’s declarations that he planned to expand his church, he never followed through. The property remained neglected and abandoned. Neighbors had long complained about the building’s deteriorating condition even before the fire. Reports also noted that prior to the sale, more than 12,000 people had signed a petition urging the church not to sell the property to West, citing his offensive and antisemitic statements. Nevertheless, the sale went through, particularly after West formed a close relationship with Cornerstone’s former pastor, Ronald Nagin.

So far, the rapper has not commented on the incident. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjpwdb0jkl	2025-03-11T15:37:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/rkSaQVstJl/rkSaQVstJl_0_21_681_384_0_small.jpg
Trump's hostage envoy visited Iraq to push to free kidnapped Eliz...	U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler traveled to Iraq last month to push for the release of Israeli-Russian researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was kidnapped in Iraq nearly two years ago, three sources familiar with the matter said. Since taking office, Boehler has stepped up efforts to secure the release of Tsurkov, a Princeton University student who went missing in Iraq during a research trip in March 2023, publicly urging the Iraqi government to help her get home. Tsurkov is being held in Iraq by the Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran, according to Israeli officials. Boehler is trying to negotiate a deal under which Tsurkov will be released in exchange for six members of Iran-aligned Lebanese militia Hezbollah, one of the sources, adding that there was a whole of government effort to bring her back. 'The United States cannot tolerate hostage-taking of U.S. nationals or those of our partners such as Israel. We have and will continue to underscore with the Iraqi government the urgency of securing Elizabeth Tsurkovâ€™s release,' a State Department spokesperson at Boehler's office said. In a February 5 post on social media platform X, Boehler advocated for Tsurkov's release. 'Elizabeth Tsurkov is a Princeton student held hostage in Iraq! The @IraqiPMO consistently made false promises to the prior administration about releasing her. BUT NOW @realDonaldTrump IS ON TO YOU,' Boehler said, tagging the official handle of Sudani's office. He said if Tsurkov does not come home, then the Iraqi prime minister's office is 'either incapable and should be FiRED or worse COMPLICIT. Bring Elizabeth home now!' Under the previous administration of former President Joe Biden, Tsurkov's family struggled to get Washington to throw its weight behind the efforts to secure her release. U.S. officials then said there was little they could do because she is not an American citizen. 'March 21 will be the two year anniversary of my sister's kidnapping. Hopefully she will not endure March 21 in their custody,' Emma Tsurkov said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on the phone on February 25 with Sudani. While a State Department statement on the conversation did not mention a discussion on Tsurkov, one of the sources said Rubio pushed the Iraqi prime minister on her case.

USAID employees ordered to shred records, court filing says	An official at the U.S. Agency for International Development has ordered employees to shred a large volume of records, according to a court filing on Tuesday by government employee unions asking a judge to block the move.

'Shred as many documents first, and reserve the burn bags for when the shredder becomes unavailable or needs a break,' Carr wrote. The unions said the directive 'suggests a rapid destruction of agency records on a large scale' that both violates federal record-keeping law and could destroy evidence in their case.

Houthis announce renewal of naval blockade on Israel: 'Until aid ...	Almost 24 hours after ultimatum from Iran's envoys in Yemen expired, Houthi terrorist leaders announced they will again attack any ship linked to Israel: 'We salute the Palestinian people and we will stand by them' ; The Houthis have not threatened to fire at Israeli territory, but the Air Force is prepared for any scenario Following the expiration of the Houthi ultimatum on Tuesday evening, the spokesman for the Iran-backed militia in Yemen, Yahya Saree, announced that the maritime blockade on Israel would continue 'for another month, until the crossings into Gaza are opened for humanitarian aid.' He added, 'The Yemeni forces salute the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank, and affirm that they stand alongside the Palestinian resistance.' Earlier Tuesday, Houthi Defense Minister Mohammed al-Atifi said the group’s forces were 'ready and fully prepared to carry out the leadership’s instructions to support Gaza and assist Palestinian fighters.' The Houthi cabinet issued a similar statement, warning it was 'prepared for any developments or consequences resulting from Yemen’s support for Gaza and Palestine.' The Houthi ultimatum specifically threatened to resume attacks on 'Israeli ships,' rather than firing missiles or drones at Israeli territory. Still, the Israeli Air Force remains on high alert, although officials said this level of readiness is standard and not the result of a new threat. Last week, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said naval operations against Israeli ships would resume if humanitarian aid shipments to Gaza did not restart within four days. That deadline passed at midnight Monday. On Tuesday, he reaffirmed the group’s warning, saying Houthi forces were ready to act and that military operations would begin immediately if aid shipments did not resume. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli officials believe Hamas requested the Houthis renew their blockade as a way to pressure Israel not to resume fighting in Gaza. Houthi leaders made similar threats last month, warning they would restart rocket attacks from Yemen if cease-fires in Gaza or Lebanon collapsed. Israel has been preparing for the possibility that the Houthis will follow through on their threats, which could include both a renewed naval blockade and missile attacks. Officials said Israel is working closely with U.S. Central Command and is expecting a stronger American response than during President Joe Biden’s term. Former President Donald Trump, in his first month in office, designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization and imposed sanctions on senior Houthi officials. Israel has struck Houthi targets in Yemen five times during the current war. Despite heavy damage to some of their key assets, the Houthis are threatening a 'second round' of attacks. Israel’s most recent strike in Yemen was Jan. 10, just days before the transition of power in Washington. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jsoxasjl	2025-03-11T13:30:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/04/HkUa8gJ656/HkUa8gJ656_0_111_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Like putting Dracula in charge of blood bank': Saudi Arabia, despite poor track record on women's rights, now leads the UN Commission on the Status of Women, sparking criticism over its influence on global gender equality policies Despite its questionable record on women’s rights, Saudi Arabia took over as chair of the UN Commission on the Status of Women on Monday and will lead the annual global summit on gender equality on March 21. 'This is surreal. Appointing Saudi Arabia to head the world’s leading body for women’s rights is like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank,' said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, a Geneva-based independent human rights organization. Neuer added that Saudi Arabia now holds a key position to influence the commission’s agenda and decisions. 'Despite cosmetic reforms, Saudi Arabia continues to subject women to legal discrimination, effectively keeping them enslaved under a male guardianship system that was codified into law three years ago—ironically, on International Women’s Day.' 'The Personal Status Law, which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as a ‘quantum leap forward,’ entrenches discrimination against women in family life and preserves many of the most oppressive aspects of the guardianship system,' Neuer said.

The arrest of a Columbia graduate heavily involved in anti-Israel protests on campus for alleged ties to Hamas, has increased tensions on a campus already grappling with destructive protests, free speech debates, and accusations of antisemitism As Monday dawned in New York City’s Morningside Heights neighborhood — home to Columbia University and Barnard College as well as three of the nation’s leading religious seminaries — residents of this urban college community struggled to absorb the dramatic events of the past two weeks. Students heading to class on this sunny yet chilly morning and residents strolling along Claremont Avenue and Morningside Drive alike seemed overtaken by a somber mood. 'I cannot believe what has taken place here,' said a Columbia professor walking his dog near the campus who requested anonymity. He said that the quality of life for everyone in the neighborhood has been severely impacted. 'I am very concerned about what comes next,' he said. While the professor was reacting to the local protests, marches, rallies, encampments and building takeovers of the past two academic years, he was referring most immediately to news of federal agents storming a Columbia-owned residence on Saturday night, just blocks from his own apartment, arresting Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil, a 29-year-old Palestinian graduate of Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, was a mainstay of anti-Israel protests at Columbia during the previous academic year. He was the self-described spokesperson for Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), an anti-Israel group on campus. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the impetus for the dramatic arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents was Khalil’s violation of 'President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting antisemitism' and 'activities aligned to Hamas,' the US-designated terror group. Khalil, whose pregnant wife is an American citizen, was taken to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana, though his whereabouts were not known for 36 hours after his arrest. Agents threatened to revoke his student visa and his green card. Trump has vowed to deport Khalil, but a federal judge blocked the deportation order until a conference on Wednesday. Some critics call the arrest indicative of a new McCarthyism, while others say the move was simply meant to force American colleges to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and guarantee that the rights of Jewish students are safeguarded. EJ Kimball, director of interfaith engagement at the Combat Antisemitism Movement, described Trump’s call to deport Khalil as 'common sense.' 'Those opposed need to reassess their own values,' Kimball said. 'This is not about weaponizing antisemitism or silencing free speech; this is about enforcing the rule of law and about universities failing to uphold the civil rights law.' Shoshana Aufzien, a first-year student in a double degree program at Barnard and the Jewish Theological Seminary, said that a mood of anxiety has come over Columbia’s campus since the arrest—a mood she said is likely unwarranted. 'I empathize with students who are worried about ICE being on campus but also believe that you should not be concerned if you are not fomenting pro-terror, antisemitic sentiments,' Aufzien said. 'There was a reason [Khalil] was arrested,' she added, describing him as being part of a 'really insidious group of CUAD people who have material ties to US-designated terror groups.' Shai Davidai, an Israeli Columbia business professor and outspoken advocate for Jewish students, also defended the arrest. 'Like Mahmoud Khalil, I too am on a green card. Unlike Khalil, I don’t support US-designated terrorist organizations, take over university buildings, and call for the genocide of anyone,' he posted on X. 'He wasn’t arrested for speaking up. He was arrested for breaking the conditions of his stay here.' By Monday afternoon, Davidai’s X account was flooded with accusations by supporters of Khalil, alleging that Davidai had reported him to ICE, a charge that Davidai denies. The Anti-Defamation League similarly lauded the Trump administration’s 'broad, bold set of efforts to counter campus antisemitism' in a post on X, though it added that 'any deportation action or revocation of a green card or visa must be undertaken in alignment with required due process protections.' While some groups were pleased to see stronger responses to antisemitism, others were concerned about the arrest’s implications. A spokesperson for the New York Civil Liberties Union characterized Khalil's arrest and detainment as an 'extreme attack on his First Amendment rights.' Bend the Arc, a progressive Jewish political organization, characterized the White House’s move as 'authoritarian,' accusing the new administration of cynically claiming to combat antisemitism while furthering its own political agenda. 'We’ve been afraid this day would come since campus protests began. Free speech and education are pillars of our democracy, and a healthy democracy is what keeps Jews safest,' the group wrote on social media. Reflecting on the incident, Jewish student activist Eliana Goldin expressed a more nuanced reaction. 'I’m a Columbia student, and the lack of critical thinking is astounding. Just because people disagree with ICE detaining Khalil doesn’t mean there’s not rampant antisemitism on campus. But apparently holding two seemingly contradictory ideas together is too difficult for the Ivies,' Goldin wrote on X. Two weeks before Khalil’s arrest, on Wednesday, February 26, protestors wrapped in keffiyehs and face masks descended on Barnard’s Milbank Hall, disrupting classes and barring passage to anyone who needed to access the building’s services. For six hours, the group congregated outside the office of Barnard Dean Leslie Grinage. The catalyst for that protest was the expulsion of students who stormed a History of Modern Israel class at Columbia the previous month. Disrupting the lesson, the masked students passed out anti-Israel fliers, one of which featured a picture of a jackboot stomping on a Star of David. During the February protest inspired by the expulsions, a Barnard public safety officer was injured badly enough to require hospitalization. Recordings of the protest, which was organized by Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, showed administrators unsuccessfully attempting to reason with the impassioned protesters. One video that went viral on social media showed Barnard professor Jackie Orr heckling public safety officers and confronting a student about 'whether you support a genocide.' The next week, on Wednesday, March 5, protesters were back in force at Barnard’s Milstein Library. By that point, the protests had become so predictable that one Jewish first-year student at Barnard wearily texted this reporter: 'They took over a building. Classic.' This time, protesters displayed an effigy of Barnard President Laura Rosenbury, distributed pro-Hamas literature, and hung posters praising slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. After a bomb threat was phoned in, the university called the NYPD to clear the building—a move that many universities have seen as a last resort in the decades since the Vietnam protests of the 1960s. Videos filmed by students showed the police wrestling recalcitrant protesters onto the lawn and binding their hands with zip ties before taking them away in police vans. Two days later, as the weekend loomed, came the stunning news that the Trump administration was halting $400 million in funding earmarked for Columbia as punishment for the school’s failing to protect its Israeli and Jewish students. The administration said that Columbia would be the first of 10 universities to face financial sanctions. That day, Columbia’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, released a statement in which she said Columbia was 'working with the federal government to address their legitimate concerns' regarding antisemitism on campus. She noted that the cancellation of funding would have immediate effects on 'research and other critical functions of the university, impacting students, faculty, staff, research, and patient care.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At a community-wide Shabbat dinner later that day, scores of Jewish students and faculty at Barnard and Columbia congregated for a festive meal in Morningside Heights. While the mood was festive, students shared difficult stories of their experiences on campus. They affirmed to one another how challenging it has been to be publicly Jewish at Columbia, as Zionism—and sometimes Judaism itself—has become heavily stigmatized. Speaking publicly, a well-known Columbia professor affirmed Armstrong’s sincerity in her efforts to fight antisemitism while validating the students’ experiences and concerns. She urged them to stay and 'fight the good fight' rather than hand the campuses over to antisemites and Israel-haters. The professor also cautioned the students against being manipulated by politicians who have their own agendas and goals that are not in sync with those of Jewish students. 'Do not allow yourselves to be used,' she warned. The resolve to stay and fight was also expressed by Barnard first-year student Aufzien. 'I’m really worried about the value of my degree depreciating,' she confessed, adding that she has been advised several times by concerned family members and friends to switch to Stern College, the women’s school of Yeshiva University. 'I would not be having the commensurate experience at Stern. Leaving is not a panacea,' Aufzien said. 'We have to fix this problem, as it doesn’t seem that the administration can or will.'

Ukraine says ready for 30-day cease-fire, as US resumes military ...	The United States agreed on Tuesday to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine immediately after talks in Saudi Arabia in which Kyiv voiced readiness to accept a U.S. proposal for a 30-day cease-fire in its conflict with Russia, the countries said in a joint statement. The Trump administration imposed the measures a week ago to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to enter talks to end the war with invading Russian forces. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would now take the offer to the Russians, and that the ball is now in Moscow's court. 'The President wanted this war to end yesterday... So our hope is that the Russians will answer 'yes' as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,' Rubio told reporters, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump, after the statement was issued. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was in Saudi Arabia but did not participate in the talks, said the cease-fire was a 'positive proposal,' that covers the frontline in the conflict, not just fighting by air and sea. The two sides also said Washington and Kyiv agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources, a deal that has been in the works for weeks and was thrown into limbo by an acrimonious White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky last week. Zelensky said the two countries would work to finalize the minerals agreement. National security adviser Mike Waltz said that 'the Ukrainian delegation today made something very clear, that they share President Trump's vision for peace.' Waltz said negotiators 'got into substantive details on how this war is going to permanently end,' including long-term security guarantees. The announcements emerged as senior officials from Ukraine and the United States opened talks in Saudi Arabia focused on ending Moscow's three-year war against Kyiv. The discussions started only hours after Russia shot down over 300 Ukrainian drones. It was Ukraine's biggest attack since the Kremlin ordered the full-scale invasion of its neighbor. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel later this week to Moscow, where he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. The person cautioned that scheduling could change. Earlier in the day, journalists were briefly allowed in a room where a senior Ukrainian delegation met with Rubio, who smiled at the cameras and when asked about his expectations for the meeting, gave a thumbs-up and replied, 'Good.' Across the table, Ukrainian officials, including the country's top diplomat and defense chief, showed no facial expressions as the meeting got underway at a luxury hotel. However, Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak told reporters that the most important thing was 'how to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.' He said security guarantees were important to prevent Russia from invading again in the future. It was the first meeting between the two sides since the Oval Office blowup between Trump and Zelensky last month. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister was also on hand as American, Saudi and Ukrainian flags could be seen in the background. Officials did not answer any of the journalists' shouted questions. The delegations met for about three hours in the morning before taking a break, and officials said the talks continued in the afternoon. There was also no immediate comment from Ukrainian or U.S. officials on the massive attack in which 343 drones targeted 10 Russian regions, leaving three people dead and 18 wounded, including three children, officials said. The Kremlin is sticking to its conditions for peace The Kremlin has not publicly offered any concessions. Russia has said it's ready to cease hostilities on condition that Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and recognizes regions that Moscow occupies as Russian. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory. Russian forces have held the battlefield momentum for more than a year, though at a high cost in infantry and armor, and are pushing at selected points along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, against Ukraine's understrength and weary army. Ukraine has invested heavily in developing its arms industry, especially high-tech drones that have reached deep into Russia. This is the full text of the joint U.S.-Ukrainian statement that was published after bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia's Jeddah on Tuesday: Today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - under the gracious hospitality of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - the United States and Ukraine took important steps toward restoring durable peace for Ukraine. Representatives of both nations praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people in defense of their nation and agreed that now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated the Ukrainian people's strong gratitude to President Trump, the U.S. Congress, and the people of the United States for making possible meaningful progress toward peace. Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day cease-fire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation. The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace. The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine. The delegations also discussed the importance of humanitarian relief efforts as part of the peace process, particularly during the above-mentioned cease-fire, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. Both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security. The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives from Russia. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process. Lastly, both countries' presidents agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1v3ybrs1g	2025-03-11T11:26:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/24/BkXom0yAA/BkXom0yAA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IMF approves $1.2 billion for Egypt after reform program's fourth...	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved disbursement of $1.2 billion to Egypt after completing the fourth review of the country's $8 billion economic reform program. The IMF's executive board also approved Egypt's request for an arrangement under the resilience and sustainability facility (RSF), with access to about $1.3 billion, the lender's statement added. Cairo has requested financing under the RSF since 2022, with hopes it could unlock up to an additional $1 billion. Egypt on Monday reported headline inflation almost halved in February, helped by financial reforms taken as part of the IMF financial support agreement. Annual urban consumer price inflation decreased to 12.8% in February from 24.0% in January and core inflation also plunged more than expected to 10% on a year-on-year basis in February, from 22.6% in January. Owing to the IMF deal and record UAE investments, analysts and bankers expect foreign investors to largely roll over their holdings of Egyptian treasury bonds. Egypt, which has been grappling with high inflation and shortages of foreign currency, agreed to the expanded IMF programme in March 2024. A sharp decline in Suez Canal revenue caused by regional tensions over the past year compounded its economic woes.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hytb911cj1e	2025-03-11T11:08:22-07:00

Netanyahu denies receiving money from Qatar, files lawsuit against Ya’alon for spreading false claims; Ya’alon responds, accusing Netanyahu of ties to Hamas and Qatar, amid ongoing criminal investigation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday denied any involvement in the 'Qatar-Gate' scandal, responding to accusations from former defense minister Moshe (Bogie) Ya’alon. Netanyahu filed a lawsuit against Ya’alon for spreading what he called the 'despicable lie' that he received money from Qatar. In a video posted on social media, Netanyahu said: 'I’ll tell you, I didn’t receive anything from Qatar, but from Bogie, I will — and this is just the beginning.' He added that nothing would stop him from making decisions in Israel’s best interest, particularly for its security. Netanyahu criticized the 'fake scandals' that have emerged recently, calling them 'hot air balloons' that disappear as quickly as they are created. The prime minister further rejected attempts to intimidate him, saying that 'campaigns of blackmail and threats' would not deter him. 'We all know where this comes from, and it won’t stop me,' Netanyahu said, emphasizing that he would continue prioritizing national security. Ya’alon responded to Netanyahu's video, questioning the prime minister's ties to Hamas and accusing him of involvement in financial dealings with Qatar. 'I hear that the Hamas financier intends to sue me. Let him! Perhaps this will be an opportunity to hear his explanation for the suitcases of cash from Qatar to Hamas,' Ya’alon said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ya’alon also raised concerns about Qatar’s alleged funding of Netanyahu’s close associates and mentioned a recent gag order imposed on details of the investigation by Israel’s Shin Bet security agency. 'The attempt to dismiss the head of Shin Bet and the attorney general is a result of this pressure,' he added. Ya’alon criticized Netanyahu for focusing on maintaining power rather than resolving the ongoing conflict with Hamas. Netanyahu's lawsuit follows an interview Ya’alon gave on Israel Radio, where he alleged that three members of Netanyahu's office were under suspicion of receiving funds from Qatar. Ya’alon also claimed that Netanyahu received $15 million from Qatar in 2012 and $50 million in 2018. 'There are intelligence documents from the UAE proving this,' Ya’alon said. This legal battle comes amid a high-profile investigation into the relationship between Netanyahu’s office and Qatar, a key financial backer of Hamas and mediator in hostage negotiations. The Israeli Attorney General's office confirmed earlier this month that it had opened a criminal investigation into the so-called 'Qatar-Gate' affair, which has led to a rare court-issued gag order on the case details. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjrtakroyg	2025-03-11T10:46:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/H1D811wXnj1g/H1D811wXnj1g_0_6_946_532_0_small.jpg

The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Ukraine's drone attack on Russia overnight had been timed to coincide with the talks between the United States and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine on Tuesday launched its biggest ever drone attack on Moscow and the surrounding region, killing at least three employees of a meat warehouse, injuring 17 others and causing a short shutdown at the capital's four airports, officials said. A total of 343 drones were downed, including 91 over the Moscow region and 126 over the western region of Kursk where Ukrainian forces have been pulling back, as well as near the Kursk nuclear power plant, the defense ministry said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkvqlgrsje	2025-03-11T09:45:13-07:00

Entire families killed during Syria's military crackdown, UN says	Entire families including women and children were killed in Syria's coastal region as part of a series of sectarian killings by rival groups during an insurgency by Bashar Assad loyalists, the U.N human rights office said on Tuesday. Pressure has been growing on Syria's Islamist-led government to investigate after reports by a war monitor of the killing of hundreds of civilians in villages where the majority of the population were members of Assad's minority Alawite sect. 'In a number of extremely disturbing instances, entire families - including women, children and individuals hors de combat - were killed, with predominantly Alawite cities and villages targeted in particular,' U.N. human rights office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said, using a French term for those incapable of fighting. So far, the U.N. human rights office has documented the killing of 111 civilians and expects the real toll to be significantly higher, Al-Kheetan told a Geneva press briefing. Of those, 90 were men; 18 were women; and three were children, he added. 'Many of the cases documented were of summary executions. They appear to have been carried out on a sectarian basis...,' Al-Kheetan told reporters. In some cases, men were shot dead in front of their families, he said, citing testimonies from survivors.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1gfiecikg	2025-03-11T09:43:22-07:00	
The Palestinian-American businessman who serves as secret advisor...	Bashar al-Masri, a Palestinian-American entrepreneur and a Trump confidant, has become a key figure in efforts to address the challenges of rebuilding Gaza; Known for his neutrality and vision, al-Masri combines Western business savvy with deep Palestinian roots, advocating for peace, reconstruction and Palestinian unity Bashar al-Masri, 64, a Palestinian-American businessman, never imagined he might one day be seen as the person who could save the Gaza Strip and stop the war, as some in the U.S. are anticipating. Masri serves as a secret advisor to the Trump administration and is emerging as the 'shadow figure' of Adam Boehler, the U.S. envoy for hostage affairs, whose name garnered attention recently after it was revealed that he was involved in direct talks with senior Hamas officials. A long-time friendship based on business and mutual interests exists between Boehler and Masri, who is currently in Brazil. Although no joint photos of the two have been published, as part of Masri's involvement—which was first reported by journalist Ben Caspit — he has reportedly allowed Boehler to use his private jet for months to facilitate negotiations with Hamas. The al-Masri family: Prominent and neutral players Bashar Masri belongs to a prominent family from Nablus. Two other family members are well-known globally: billionaires Munib and Sabih al-Masri. Munib is his uncle, while Sabih is a distant relative. The al-Masri family is considered neutral, unaffiliated with any Palestinian factions. Over the years, the family has refrained from political involvement to avoid jeopardizing their extensive business ventures. Palestinian leaders, including Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas, have tried to recruit them into politics but failed. Offers for ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority have been declined by both Munib and Sabih, as well as Bashar himself. Masri is married to an American and lives a Western lifestyle, which could appeal to Donald Trump. Despite his luxurious life — he drives grandiose cars and is often accompanied by aides and bodyguards — he remains deeply involved in Palestinian affairs, advocating for the international community, particularly the U.S., to understand the realities in the West Bank and Gaza. He also uses his Instagram account, with tens of thousands of followers, to share his message. Born and raised in Nablus, Masri left for the U.S. at a young age, where he studied chemical engineering at Virginia Tech. He worked for a consulting firm in Washington, where he met his wife, Jane. Around 2005, he returned to Palestine with his wife and two daughters and established his holding company, Massar. In a past interview, he described himself as 'half-Palestinian, half-American.' He said: 'I don't think or act like the average Palestinian, but my heart and soul are Palestinian.' From protests to business success Despite his Palestinian-American identity, Masri has had several encounters with Israeli prisons due to his participation in protests against Israel. He was often held under administrative detention, which has contributed to his stature in Palestinian society. Masri is seen as a role model for many young Palestinians. However, as he has explained in the past, 'People thought I inherited everything — but I didn't. I came with very little money from my work abroad, and I started investing and developing myself.' His flagship project is undoubtedly the city of Rawabi (which translates to 'Hills'), located near Ramallah. It is the only planned Palestinian city and has been dubbed the 'Palestinian Modi'in' (a reference to a modern Israeli city). The city was built at an estimated cost of over $1 billion, with Qatar also contributing to its funding. Rawabi includes a large commercial center, a high-tech hub where even Apple engineers work, and an amphitheater. Interestingly, most of the apartment buyers in Rawabi have been Arab-Israelis rather than Palestinians. Ties to Gaza and Israeli plans Masri's name has been linked to past Israeli plans to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza through Palestinian officials who could also govern the Strip. In March last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected such plans because some of the involved individuals, such as Majed Faraj and Mohammed Dahlan, were associated with Fatah. According to the report, the aid was supposed to enter Gaza via sea and land, be inspected by Israel, and then distributed by Palestinians. After the war, those managing the aid were expected to assume governing roles in Gaza. However, Netanyahu, according to the report, did not rule out Masri's involvement, as he is seen as unaffiliated with any political faction among Palestinians. Masri frequently comments on current events. Regarding the Arab League summit held last week in Cairo, where Egypt presented an alternative plan to Donald Trump's for rebuilding Gaza, Masri said: 'It could become a historic summit if it results in a Palestinian initiative to set a date for general elections, strengthen Palestinian legitimacy and prepare for the next critical phase.' During the hostilities in Gaza, Masri called for a 'cessation of aggression' in the Strip. In one instance, he stated, 'Deal or no deal — the most important thing is to stop the aggression and alleviate the suffering of our people in Gaza.' Following the declaration of the current cease-fire, he said: 'The suffering did not end with the announcement of the cease-fire. It continues to worsen daily. We must do more to support Gaza, advance the Strip hand in hand, and prepare for its reconstruction. This is the test that will ensure success.' Throughout the war, he consistently highlighted Gaza's suffering in his social media posts, and a month into the conflict, he described the situation there as a 'tragedy.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In one Instagram post, Masri emphasized that addressing Gaza's needs is 'primarily a Palestinian responsibility.' He wrote this in the context of an initiative in the West Bank to send honey to Gaza. 'I urge anyone who can and wants to participate not to hesitate. The scale of the disaster is horrifying, and aid is, first and foremost, a Palestinian responsibility,' he stated. Throughout the war, he repeatedly called for advancing the cease-fire. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1vbn9hsjx	2025-03-11T09:25:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/BJeKyWK3i1g/BJeKyWK3i1g_280_131_962_542_0_small.jpg

Israel begins border negotiations with Lebanon, releases prisoner...	Israel and Lebanon began negotiations on land border, with Israel agreeing to release 5 Lebanese prisoners as a goodwill gesture; The talks, mediated by the US, aim to address several disputed points in southern Lebanon and on the border line Israel has released five Lebanese prisoners as part of ongoing negotiations with Lebanon over the land border between the two countries, Israeli officials said Tuesday. The decision, coordinated with the United States, was framed as a goodwill gesture to Lebanon’s newly elected president. Lebanese media reported that Israel had jailed several Lebanese nationals during the war and has transferred them back via the Red Cross. The identities of those who were released, as well as any potential ties to Hezbollah, remain unclear. The negotiations took place in the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura, with delegations from the IDF, Lebanon, the United States and France. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office reported in a statement that the talks resulted in the formation of three joint working groups aimed at stabilizing the region. These groups will focus on five areas in southern Lebanon under Israeli control, disputes over the U.N.-recognized Blue Line border, and the status of Lebanese detainees held by Israel. The negotiations have been ongoing with U.S. mediation since the end of the tenure of former U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein and continued under his successor, Morgan Ortagus, who has recently visited both Lebanon and Israel. Lebanese media also reported that a Lebanese soldier was 'kidnapped' by Israeli forces earlier this week. According to Al-Mayadeen, a Hezbollah-affiliated outlet, the soldier is among those set to be released. The handover is expected to take place at the Rosh Hanikra crossing following a meeting of the committee overseeing the U.N.-brokered cease-fire agreement.

New US envoy to Kuwait who denied Oct. 7 sexual violence, holds a...	President Donald Trump appointed Amer Ghalib, a Michigan mayor, who denied reports of Hamas-led sexual violence on Oct. 7 and initiated a vote calling for an economic boycott of companies working with 'Israeli apartheid' United States President Donald Trump on Monday appointed Hamtramck, Michigan, Mayor Amer Ghalib as the next U.S. ambassador to Kuwait. Ghalib, 45, a Yemeni-born Muslim immigrant, has been outspoken in his criticism of Israel. Just hours before his appointment he liked a comment on Facebook that described Jews as 'monkeys.' Ghalib made history in 2021 when he became the first Muslim mayor of Hamtramck. Since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, he has led several anti-Israel initiatives in the city, including a council vote to boycott companies that do business with what he called 'Israeli apartheid.' Following the decision, he stated that 'Palestine is fighting for a just cause' and claimed that 'the only ethical option for Israel is to admit defeat and leave the land.' Ghalib also supported renaming a city street 'Palestine Street' as an act of solidarity and cast the deciding vote in favor of the measure. He refused to condemn a local council candidate’s social media post comparing Israel’s actions to the Holocaust and dismissed reports of Hamas militants beheading and sexually assaulting victims on Oct. 7 as 'lies spread by the Biden administration to justify its support for Israel’s crimes.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In an open message at the time to then-President Joe Biden, he said :You fueled (these) kind of hate crimes and Islamophobia by spreading false information and lies (e.g. beheaded babies and raped women).' Ghalib continued: 'You make us feel unsafe by trying to justify your support for the criminal and unethical attack on the civilians of Gaza using lies and made up stories. Be a man and apologize for your moral and historic downfall, otherwise the blood of thousands of children and innocent people will be a curse that will follow you to your grave.' Ghalib also has previously referred to Saddam Hussein, who invaded Kuwait in 1990, as a 'martyr.' Ghalib met with Trump in September, praising him as a 'man of principle who opposes wars' and helping mobilize Muslim voters ahead of the U.S. presidential election. However, he later said he disagreed with Trump’s proposal for the U.S. to take control of Gaza. Trump, for his part, lauded Ghalib on Monday, calling him 'the greatest mayor in the world, who won’t let men participate in women’s sports' — a reference to Trump’s opposition to transgender rights. In 2023, Hamtramck’s city council voted to ban pride flags and other social or political flags from government buildings, a move that sparked public backlash. Announcing the appointment, Trump said Ghalib was chosen in part because of his role in helping secure victory in Michigan, a key battleground state with the highest percentage of Arab American residents in the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1mv5ypj1e	2025-03-11T07:48:46-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/B1pJoo2jye/B1pJoo2jye_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced that earlier on Tuesday a '4-way meeting' was held in Naqoura, southern Lebanon, attended by IDF representatives alongside American, French and Lebanese representatives. The office also confirmed the words of Trump's envoy to the region, Morgan Ortagus, stating that during the meeting 'it was agreed to establish three joint working groups' aimed at stabilizing the region. The groups will discuss the following issues: the five points over which Israel controls southern Lebanon, the Blue Line and points that remain in dispute, and the Lebanese detainees held by Israel. 'In coordination with the U.S. and as a gesture to the new Lebanese president, Israel agreed to release five Lebanese detainees,' according to the statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rka00rapi1e	2025-03-11T07:28:44-07:00	
IDF prepares to release 14,000 draft notices for young Haredi men...	Response to call-up of 10,000 Haredim since June has been dismal so far - under 200; the IDF will focus on communities and cities where enlistment rates were higher in earlier draft rounds; Ultra-Orthodox call it a 'war against yeshivot' The Israel Defense Forces are preparing in the coming days to issue 14,000 draft notices to young ultra-Orthodox men. These orders will add to the roughly 10,000 already sent since last June, though the response so far has been extremely limited. The military plans to incorporate lessons learned from earlier draft rounds and focus on communities and cities where enlistment rates were higher. According to data presented Monday at the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, of 3,000 draft orders issued last summer, only 160 ultra-Orthodox men have enlisted to date. In November 2024, an additional 7,000 summonses were approved, resulting in just 17 enlistments so far. Several hundred more are currently undergoing various stages of the enlistment process. Sixty-five individuals are under arrest orders, and more than 2,000 are under Order 12, which requires immediate enlistment. Those who fail to report to the draft office within the number of days specified are subject to a travel ban and may be arrested if they encounter police. The IDF intends to improve the effectiveness of future draft rounds, though no significant changes are expected in the way the notices are delivered or in how officials interact with draft candidates, beyond adjustments made to date. On Tuesday morning, ultra-Orthodox newspapers published notices calling for prayers on Thursday in response to what was described as 'a war against the world of yeshivas.' The announcements, appearing in publications such as Yated Ne’eman and HaMevaser, declared, 'At a time when war has been declared against the world of Torah learning, with schemes to conscript Torah scholars — God forbid — and many other decrees upon the Torah world, the Jewish people have only the power of prayer. It is our duty to plead with the Creator of all worlds and to seek mercy on His people. Therefore, we will all gather for a day of prayer on the Fast of Esther.' The notice went on to call for 'coming before the King, assembling and standing up for our souls in communal prayer throughout the world, asking for the sake of the Torah world and for each and every one of its scholars. ‘Our Father, our King, nullify from upon us all evil and harsh decrees.’' The notice also said that, on the Fast of Esther, 'Men, women and children will gather to recite Psalms and prayers. Yeshiva students will increase their Torah study, crying out on behalf of the Torah world and all Israel who are in distress and captivity, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, will have mercy on us and redeem us from all our troubles. May we merit a great salvation as in the days of Mordechai and Esther.' Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee continued its debates on the proposed legislation that would formalize draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men. Tensions rose when one participant shouted at Knesset lawmaker Yinon Azoulay of the Shas Party, calling him 'insolent' and was subsequently removed from the hearing. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'There’s an agreement from the rabbis that I sit here to ensure that those who are not learning in yeshiva will enlist, but that they stay in a framework appropriate to the ultra-Orthodox community, one that’s good for them,' Azoulay responded. The attendee replied: 'No one asks my children, and no one wraps them in cotton wool like that. Insolent!' Azoulay responded: 'You won’t call me insolent. Shame on you. I have the Torah, and it protects no less. Don’t argue with my faith.' Laly Deri, whose son, Staff Sgt. (res.) Sa’adia Yaakov, who studied at the hesder yeshiva in Jaffa, was killed by a mortar strike in central Gaza on June 20, 2024, also took part in the discussion. 'I prayed this issue of drafting my ultra-Orthodox brothers would come from within, through mutual responsibility. I prayed for it, but sadly, it isn’t happening,' she said. Since her son’s death, Deri has become a prominent advocate for drafting ultra-Orthodox men. 'We’ve been discussing this law for 16 months. In that time, we could have drafted so many people who could have contributed to the war effort, but it’s not happening. I wanted it to come from a place of ‘we will do and we will listen,’ but it turns out it has to be forced like Mount Sinai over our heads. This law is urgent. Not only was my son’s spirituality not harmed in the IDF, he grew there. We have no choice but to demand personal sanctions,' she said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkp4rppi1e	2025-03-11T07:13:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/03/14/8406271/8406271_0_78_1300_790_0_small.jpg

Israeli strikes in Lebanon and Gaza as fighting continues on mult...	Israeli forces kill two terrorists in Jenin and arrested 10, including senior operative; In Lebanon, President Aoun urges UN officials to pressure Israel to withdraw from five strategic points amid cease-fire tensions An Israeli drone strike targeted a vehicle in southern Lebanon on Monday afternoon, according to reports from the country. The strike occurred between Deir al-Zahrani and Roumine, with local reports indicating that one person was killed. Lebanese reports stated that the man was a senior operative in Hezbollah's aerial defense unit. At the same time, five Palestinians were reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike in the Netzarim corridor area in the Gaza Strip. Earlier in the day, following the most extensive wave of Israeli airstrikes in Syria in more than two months, another attack was reported in the country. According to Syrian media, the latest Israeli strike targeted the al-Khalhalah military airport near al-Suwayda in southern Syria. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces continued operations in the northern West Bank. A joint statement from the IDF, the Shin Bet security agency, and the police said that counterterrorism units, including the elite Yamam and Duvdevan forces, carried out raids in Jenin and Qabatiya, killing armed terrorists and arresting a senior member of a terrorist cell in the area. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the operation in Jenin, Israeli forces encountered armed gunmen barricaded inside a building. Two terrorists were killed in the ensuing firefight, while a third was wounded. Security forces also arrested 10 other suspects, including Liwaa Jaaz, a senior operative in the Jenin-based terror network. Separately, Duvdevan forces killed another gunman who had opened fire on them. Israeli troops also located two vehicles in Jenin containing weapons intended for attacks and destroyed them. According to Palestinian reports, a 58-year-old woman was killed by Israeli gunfire in Jenin earlier in the day. Despite a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, the IDF has continued striking targets in Lebanon to prevent violations of the deal and to stop weapons transfers aimed at rebuilding Hezbollah's military capabilities. The Iran-backed group has suffered significant losses in the fighting, weakening its internal standing in Lebanon. Under the ceasefire terms, the Lebanese military is required to take control of areas in southern Lebanon previously under Hezbollah’s authority. While the IDF has withdrawn from most of the territory, it remains stationed at five strategic locations. On Monday, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun urged the head of the UN ceasefire monitoring committee to pressure Israel to withdraw from these positions and release Lebanese prisoners. In Gaza, the temporary cease-fire has officially ended, though both sides have largely refrained from renewed fighting as mediators work to extend the truce. Israel is pushing for further hostage releases as a condition for maintaining the ceasefire. However, the IDF has continued targeting terrorists identified as attempting to plant explosives or approaching Israeli forces operating in the buffer zone and the Philadelphi Corridor. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1leiiasyl	2025-03-11T04:11:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/11/H1r0pqTsye/H1r0pqTsye_0_315_961_541_0_small.jpg

Local sources say pact with community leaders in al-Suwayda will reintegrate the province into state institutions after years of unrest Syria’s government has reportedly reached an agreement with Druze leaders in the southern province of al-Suwayda, marking a significant shift in the region’s relationship with Damascus after years of unrest. However, no official confirmation of the deal has been issued. According to Qatar-based Al-Araby, local sources say the agreement between the Syrian government and community leaders in al-Suwayda will reintegrate the province into state institutions. As part of the deal, 300 security personnel will be deployed to the province. Additionally, 600 local residents whose legal status was settled will be reinstated into the police force. The Syrian government has already appointed a new police commander and a deputy in al-Suwayda, while a second deputy will be selected from the province’s Druze population, according to the report. The agreement comes amid broader efforts by Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to consolidate control over autonomous regions. A separate deal signed Monday with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will see Kurdish forces merge with the Syrian military and place key Kurdish-controlled institutions, including border crossings, prisons, and oil fields, under government authority. Kurdish forces to join Syrian government Under the agreement with the SDF, the Kurdish population will be granted constitutional recognition as an 'indigenous community' in Syria. The deal also requires Kurdish leaders to support efforts to combat remaining Assad loyalists and other security threats while rejecting any aspirations for independence.

Court orders total gag order on explosive ‘Qatar-Gate’ investigat...	Israeli court grants police request to prohibit publication of any details on probe, centering on alleged ties between associates of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar About two weeks after Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara announced the opening of a criminal investigation into the 'Qatar-Gate' affair—centering on ties between associates of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar, Hamas' primary financial backer and a mediator in hostage negotiations—a comprehensive gag order has been issued on the case. The Rishon Lezion Magistrates' Court granted the police's request to prohibit the publication of any details of the investigation, including findings, interrogations of suspects, and evidence gathered. The case is being handled by the National Unit for International Investigations within Lahav 433, Israel's top police anti-corruption and serious crime unit. According to the ruling, the publication ban applies to all forms of media, including social networks, excerpts from foreign news reports, references to them, online platforms, and any other media. The restriction extends to both direct and indirect hints regarding the investigation. Two weeks ago, Baharav-Miara stated that the probe would be conducted by the Israel Police and the Shin Bet security agency. The case focuses on three close associates of Netanyahu: Eli Feldstein, a spokesperson who has already been investigated and indicted in a separate case involving leaked classified documents. Jonathan Urich, an adviser and spokesperson also implicated in the classified documents case, where he allegedly corresponded directly with Feldstein regarding the leaked material. Israel Einhorn, a campaign consultant involved in Likud's election efforts. Allegations and connections to Qatar Before the attorney general's decision to launch a formal investigation, authorities were examining security and counterintelligence breaches. The decision to authorize Shin Bet to interrogate suspects under caution—rather than merely as witnesses—suggests potential criminal elements. According to reports, Feldstein received payments from an international private company to manage a public relations campaign aimed at improving Qatar’s image in Israel. His work focused on hostage negotiations, and he allegedly facilitated interviews between journalists and Qatari officials, relayed official statements on Qatar’s behalf, and promoted messages regarding its regional role. This was happening while he also worked in the Prime Minister's Office—at a time when Netanyahu was publicly criticizing Qatar for 'serving Hamas.' Urich and Einhorn reportedly provided public relations consulting to Qatar in Israel. In 2022, they designed a campaign ahead of the FIFA World Cup, aiming to portray Qatar—a country that finances and supports terrorism—as a legitimate state committed to peace and regional stability. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The campaign was managed by Einhorn’s company, 'Perception,' which collaborated on the Qatari project with another firm, 'Coyos,' co-owned by Brig. Gen. (Res.) Eli Ben-Meir. Ben-Meir, a former head of the IDF Military Intelligence Research Division, currently holds a sensitive position in the army and was responsible for intelligence reviews following the October 7 Hamas attack. Reports indicate Feldstein was also employed by Einhorn’s firm, though it is unclear if he was involved in the Qatari PR campaign. Netanyahu's response and political fallout All individuals mentioned in the investigation have denied any wrongdoing. Netanyahu has dismissed the probe as a 'witch hunt' aimed at undermining him and his associates. Opposition leaders have warned that Netanyahu may attempt to dismiss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar in retaliation for the investigation. Following the attorney general’s announcement, Likud issued a statement saying: 'As the fabricated cases against Prime Minister Netanyahu collapse in court, new and baseless cases are being fabricated against his associates for personal and political reasons. We see right through it.' There is no evidence that payments to Netanyahu’s aides influenced his decision to allow Qatar to transfer cash to Gaza. Netanyahu has maintained that the funds were intended to assist impoverished residents in the enclave, not Hamas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rygvzqpiyx	2025-03-11T02:48:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/r1rAKDiFJe/r1rAKDiFJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Help bring daddy home from Gaza': Hostage’s daughters appeal to ...	Lishi Lavi-Miran shares video of her daughters pleading for help in securing their father Omri's release; she criticizes Netanyahu for not fulfilling promises on hostage negotiations, urges public to join protests for their return Lishi Lavi-Miran, whose husband, Omri Miran, has been held hostage by Hamas for 522 days, posted a video Monday on her X account. The video features her two young daughters, Roni and Alma, addressing former U.S. President Donald Trump: 'Help us bring Daddy back from Gaza. Thank you.' The girls also say in the video that they will give their father 'kisses and lots of hugs' and later draw a large heart for him on paper. Lishi also wrote directly to Trump in a post: 'Dear Donald Trump, my daughters talk about you all the time. They know you are the one who can bring fathers home to their children. Please help us bring Omri and all the other hostages back to their families. We trust you. Thank you.' Speaking to Ynetnews on Tuesday morning, Lishi explained why she decided to post the video. 'It’s always difficult for me to expose my daughters, but we’ve reached this point. We are fighting for Omri’s life, for the life of my daughters’ father, and for them to have a normal reality,' she said. She criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to follow through on his promises regarding the second phase of the hostage deal. 'The prime minister promised me and all of us, a month and a half ago, before the agreement began, that it was a comprehensive deal and that only specific details needed to be finalized for the second phase,' she said. 'We are now entering our second consecutive weekend without our loved ones returning—neither the living nor the remains of the deceased—and he is not keeping his promises.' Lishi stressed that she had never supported a phased deal. 'None of us wanted this deal to be done in stages—except, apparently, for the decision-makers in Israel, who thought it was the right approach. I accepted it. I said that we need to start in order to finish,' she said. 'We started, but then we stopped. For some reason, everything has halted. So I am reaching out to anyone I can—whether at the UN last week, to Trump, to our prime minister, to Hungary because Omri is a Hungarian citizen—whoever I can. I will do everything I can to bring Omri and all 58 hostages still in Gaza home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Lishi also emphasized the need to end the war. 'We know for certain that the fighting is endangering the lives of the hostages. We can no longer avoid this reality. We can’t say, ‘We didn’t know,’' she said. 'This war should have ended long ago, for many reasons. One of them is to bring everyone back—Omri and all 58 hostages still there—and to allow all the reservists who have been carrying this burden for too long to return home. We cannot continue to normalize this situation. We have been at war for a year and a half, and we see no end in sight.' Regarding Omri’s condition, Lishi said: 'We don’t know how he is. We do know that one of the released hostages was with him in July. That was the last time we received any indication that he was alive. People tell me, ‘But that was July!’ And I say, ‘Yes, but that’s better than before, because the last time before that was in late April.’ So at least now we know he was alive as of the end of July.' She also shared that Omri had been kept in the dark about his family’s survival for months. 'We know he had some information in the past, that he knew the girls and I were alive. But we recently discovered that until our press conference following the release of his hostage video, he didn’t know for sure that I had survived. We can only imagine what it’s like to be told that your wife and two daughters were murdered, and then a day later, to be told they weren’t—playing mind games with him. Beyond the physical torture and abuse we know all the hostages are enduring, there is also severe psychological terror. Only in early May did Omri finally know for sure that the girls and I had survived and that we were fighting for him.' With Purim approaching in two days, Lishi noted how difficult it is to face another holiday without her husband. 'I’m about to celebrate Alma’s second birthday. When this hostage deal began, I told myself, ‘It’s happening soon—Omri will be here for Alma’s birthday.’ According to the signed agreement, he was supposed to be home by now. But right now, I am far from certain—if anything, I’m sure he won’t be,' she said. 'Omri turns 48 on April 11, exactly one month from now. Will he mark the day? Will he celebrate? No one is giving us any answers.' She concluded by calling on the public to join the ongoing protest near the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv. 'Come, join us, be with us. Not just in your hearts, not just in your prayers—but through action,' she urged. 'Don’t go out celebrating Purim because we still have nothing to celebrate. The Book of Esther is more relevant than ever this year. The children deserve to celebrate, to breathe, and we must give them as much normalcy as possible. But we adults have nothing to celebrate. Thousands of orphaned children, hundreds of bereaved families, and 59 hostages still in Gaza. Remember that.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjs2nkpoyx	2025-03-11T02:26:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/11/S1B03u6okg/S1B03u6okg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
U.S. shifts stance on hostage deal, from ‘all or nothing’ to phas...	Jerusalem prioritizes release of injured hostages; terror group resists disarmament, while families voice frustration over delays; Witkoff pushes for deal, with negotiations focusing on temporary cease-fire extension in exchange for releases The framework for a hostage release deal remains uncertain, with proposals ranging from freeing half of the 59 living and deceased hostages at once to releasing 10 living captives without mention of the fallen. While U.S. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas demanding the release of all hostages—calling it their 'final warning'—negotiations in Doha suggest discussions are focused on freeing a much smaller number. At the beginning of the month, Israel announced its agreement to the framework proposed by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. According to this plan, which was first revealed in an official statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, the first phase would see the release of half of the living and deceased hostages. If an agreement on a permanent cease-fire were reached, the remaining hostages—both living and deceased—would be freed in a later phase. Initially, this meant the release of approximately 11 living hostages and 19 bodies. Hamas rejects initial proposal, new version on the table Hamas quickly rejected this plan, leading to a revised proposal, also spearheaded by Witkoff. The updated framework calls for the release of 10 living hostages, including American citizen Idan Alexander and nine others reportedly subjected to torture. While this number is similar to the original plan, there has been little mention in negotiations of the earlier demand to release the bodies of hostages. Under the current proposal, the cease-fire would be extended through the end of Ramadan and Passover, and Israel would resume humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that Egyptian diplomatic sources say the most viable deal under discussion involves the release of 10 living hostages in exchange for a 60-day cease-fire. During this period, large quantities of humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza, and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails would be freed. The report also claims that to avoid tensions within Israel, the released hostages would not be publicly celebrated or paraded upon their return. Israel pushes for injured and sick hostages first Israel’s negotiating team, which arrived in Qatar with a mandate to advance the Witkoff framework, is also exploring ways to extend the first phase of the deal to secure additional releases. Israel's position is that priority should be given to releasing hostages who are injured or ill. Previously, there had been discussions about prioritizing the release of four fathers of young children: David Cunio, Omri Miran, Elkana Buhbout, and Maxim Herkin. Israeli officials said, 'If we see that the Witkoff framework is not viable and no agreement is reached, Israel will seek to extend the first phase or create an interim deal as a bridge to the Witkoff plan.' This would mean multiple release phases in exchange for temporary cease-fire extensions, with the exact number of hostages freed, the timeline, and other details still to be determined. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel’s negotiating team, led by a senior Shin Bet official, arrived in Doha on Monday. Other members include hostage and missing persons coordinator Gal Hirsch, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s foreign policy adviser Ophir Falk, and representatives from Mossad, Shin Bet, and the IDF. Talks resumed after the Ramadan fast-breaking meal (Iftar) and are expected to continue for two days. Witkoff is expected to arrive in Doha today to push for progress in negotiations. While he is not currently scheduled to visit Israel, it is possible he could do so unexpectedly if necessary to convince Netanyahu to agree to certain aspects of the deal. U.S. involvement and Hamas’ stance The negotiations are taking place against the backdrop of direct talks between Hamas and Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler. These talks have drawn criticism in both Israel and the United States. Boehler’s discussions primarily focused on securing the release of Alexander, though four other American citizens—Omer Naotrah, Itai Chen, Judy Weinstein Haggai, and her husband Gadi Haggai (who were killed on October 7)—remain in captivity. Israeli officials believe Boehler’s talks with senior Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya have not contributed positively to negotiations, and even White House officials are reportedly dissatisfied with the results. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday that the direct talks with Hamas were a 'one-time event' and admitted they had not yielded results. Meanwhile, the London-based Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper reported that Hamas has made clear it has not committed to disarmament under any deal, calling it an 'internal Palestinian matter.' According to sources, Hamas told Boehler they would only consider disarming if a clear political path to a Palestinian state were established. Families of hostages speak out The slow progress in negotiations has left families of the hostages frustrated. Yael Ader, whose son Tamir Ader was murdered on October 7 while defending Kibbutz Nir Oz, expressed her frustration in an interview with Ynet. His body remains in Gaza. 'They’re talking about a two-month cease-fire for 10 hostages. It feels like they’re telling the families of the fallen: ‘You’re on hold.’ And for the living hostages, they’re playing Solomon’s trial, deciding who is more important or more humanitarian to save,' she said. Ader added, 'I hope someone will stand up and say, ‘We’re bringing all 59 home.’ But I’m also deeply afraid because I see where the government is headed. It doesn’t want to resolve this for reasons tied to other political interests. Right now, it’s the Americans who are the only ones demanding that everyone be released.' 'But they’re promising hell, and we’re the only ones who can deliver it,' she added. 'They expect us to send our forces into battle. It’s a problematic paradox.' Referring to Trump’s ultimatum, she noted: 'Even Trump, at some point, will say, ‘I said my piece—now Netanyahu has to decide.’ The prime minister must decide that ending this crisis is the most important thing, even if it means not passing the March budget or that his coalition collapses. Bringing the hostages home is what matters most to Israeli society right now.' Ader also criticized Israel’s handling of the crisis, pointing out that U.S. officials have been more responsive than the Israeli government. 'I have Israeli citizenship—why should I have to turn to the U.S. for help? My son went to defend Israel’s border, not America’s. I’m grateful to the Americans, but the effort should be coming from Israel’s prime minister,' she said. 'Even Witkoff—when I reach out to him, he responds. Israel’s prime minister? Unreachable. Something here doesn’t make sense.'

White House: 'Shalom, Mahmoud'; judge halts deportation of Columb...	ICE sends Mahmoud Khalil to detention facility in Jena, Louisiana - notorious for reports of mistreatment of detainees, civil rights violations, and unexplained deaths U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the arrest of a Columbia University graduate and a leader of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, promising that 'there is much more to come.' 'Shalom, Mahmoud,' read the official White House post, which went on to proudly detail the Saturday arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a former student and organizer of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia. Hours later, a federal judge in New York ruled that Khalil would not be deported from the U.S. for the time being. Federal Judge Jesse Furman ruled that Khalil should not be deported in order to 'preserve the court’s jurisdiction.' A hearing on petitions for his release from detention was scheduled for Wednesday. Before the court ruling, Trump had already expressed satisfaction with the arrest, calling it 'the first of many to come.' Khalil, who earned a master's degree from Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs in December, was arrested in New York by immigration agents and transported thousands of miles from his home to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana. The facility has been notorious for reports of mistreatment of detainees, civil rights violations, and unexplained deaths. Arrest sparks outrage and political debate Khalil’s arrest has angered his supporters while providing the Trump administration with an opportunity to showcase its hardline stance against pro-Palestinian protesters at elite U.S. universities. Although he completed his studies, a Ynet investigation found that Khalil was seen last week negotiating on behalf of students who had barricaded themselves inside Barnard College, Columbia’s affiliated women’s college. A viral video showed him holding a megaphone and chastising the university’s president. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Public reaction to his arrest was swift. Khalil, a Green Card holder married to an American citizen in the late stages of pregnancy, received widespread support. A petition demanding his release gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures within hours, while politicians and human rights groups condemned the move. His supporters claim the charges against him are politically motivated rather than legitimate immigration violations. 'This is an abuse of immigration law for the sake of political persecution,' said his attorney, Amy Greer, who vowed to appeal the arrest. While some legal experts question the legality of the move and whether it constitutes selective enforcement for political purposes, the Trump administration has made its stance clear: 'We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again.' Khalil’s plea for protection before arrest A day before his arrest, Khalil sent an email to Columbia University President Katrina Armstrong, pleading with her to intervene and offer him protection. Armstrong did not respond to his request. In his letter, Khalil claimed he was the target of a 'coordinated and ruthless smear campaign' by pro-Israel activists, including Israeli professor Shai Davidai and the U.S. branch of the Betar movement, who had called for his deportation and, according to him, 'threatened his life.' 'I can’t sleep at night, fearing that immigration agents or a dangerous individual will come to my home,' Khalil wrote. 'I urgently need legal support, and I am calling on you to intervene and provide the necessary protections to prevent further harm.' His fears intensified after reports surfaced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had been seen on campus in the past week. A university-issued document warned staff that they could not intervene if immigration agents sought access to school grounds without a warrant. 'I have outlined the broader context,' Khalil wrote, 'yet Columbia has failed to provide any meaningful support or resources in response to this escalating threat.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjhquupjkl	2025-03-11T00:56:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/B1AbHtssJe/B1AbHtssJe_1_144_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Taliban lifts TV channel ban, but press freedom in Afghanistan re...	As the Taliban reopens previously shuttered media outlets in Afghanistan, experts warn that the move is more about exerting control than restoring independent journalism The Taliban has granted permission for a private television channel to resume operations after nearly three months of suspension, the Afghanistan Journalists Center (AFJC) said earlier this month. The body welcomed the decision and urged the Taliban to ensure that media outlets in Afghanistan can operate freely, without restrictions or threats. The AFJC, a nongovernmental organization advocating for press freedom, announced in a statement that the Taliban’s Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice had granted permission to the privately owned Arezo TV channel to return to the air. Arezo TV is an Afghan satellite television network primarily broadcasting in the Dari language. Launched in 2007 in northern Afghanistan’s Mazar-e-Sharif, the channel initially catered to a regional audience before expanding its reach nationwide. It also operates a radio station within the country. On December 4, 2024, Arezo TV’s Kabul office was raided by Taliban intelligence and morality police. According to the AFJC, before the office was sealed, staff members were mistreated, electronic devices and computers were confiscated, and seven employees were arrested, in what it called a 'clear violation' of independent media rights. Two weeks later, on December 21, authorities freed the detained employees from the infamous Pul-e-Charkhi prison. The employees had to promise in writing to remain in Kabul and appear in court. Now that the court has ruled not guilty, the workers face no barriers to resuming their jobs. Basir Abid, head of the channel’s Kabul office, told the AFJC that all employees were allowed to return to work without any conditions. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Vice and Virtue, Saif-ul-Islam Khyber, told The Media Line that the station’s closure was necessary to 'preserve Islamic values, prevent media misuse, and maintain social order.' He claimed that an investigation revealed Arezo TV had misused its name and resources, employing 'unofficial individuals' to produce and air content that allegedly violated Islamic principles and Afghan traditions. An official from the Ministry of Information and Culture who asked to remain anonymous told The Media Line that Arezo TV was shut down because of 'dubbing Indian ‘vulgar’ dramas and malicious contents from Iranian media based abroad into local languages.' 'The station’s management has now assured authorities that such contents will not be aired again and that future programming will focus on Afghan culture and Islamic values,' the official said. The AFJC voiced serious concerns over the growing restrictions on media operations, calling on the Taliban to uphold Afghanistan’s Media Law. As recognized by the Ministry of Information and Culture, this law affirms that media outlets have the right to operate freely without undue interference or threats. Arezo TV is far from the only channel to be affected by the Taliban’s censorship. In early February, the Taliban suspended Radio Begum, Afghanistan’s only women-run radio station, accusing it of violating domestic broadcasting regulations and unlawfully distributing content to a foreign TV channel. Later that month, Afghan authorities announced the channel’s reinstatement. Radio Begum began broadcasting on International Women’s Day in March 2021, just five months before the Taliban regained power. The channel’s content is produced entirely by Afghan women. The station’s sister channel, Begum TV, operates from France, airing educational programs for students in grades seven to 12. Since the Taliban banned girls’ education beyond the sixth grade, many Afghan girls are now deprived of schooling. In a conversation with The Media Line, Taliban chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid stated that 'there are no formal restrictions on media in the country.' He emphasized the importance of media outlets adhering to national interests and Islamic values and cautioned against the spread of unverified claims and rumors. Since the Taliban’s return to power, press freedom in Afghanistan has deteriorated significantly. The Taliban’s Ministry of Vice and Virtue enforces rigid content guidelines, banning reports deemed 'against Islamic values' or critical of the regime. Foreign media access has also been restricted, further isolating Afghanistan’s press. Afghanistan plunged to 178th out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders’ 2024 World Press Freedom Index, a stark decline from its 152nd position in 2023. Independent journalism has also become increasingly difficult under Taliban rule, as media outlets face strict censorship, intimidation, and financial hardship. Reporters who cover sensitive topics, including human rights abuses, women’s rights, or security issues, risk harassment, detention, or worse. Many journalists have been arrested, interrogated, or even physically assaulted for their work. Several media companies have been shut down for failing to comply with Taliban-imposed restrictions, while others operate under constant fear, leading to widespread self-censorship. The situation is especially dire for female journalists. The Taliban has barred adult women from education and severely restricted their participation in the workforce and public life. Female journalists have been systematically removed from their positions, with many attempting to flee the country. Gulalai Zarmina, a former news director at a Persian-language channel, is now a refugee in a neighboring country, after being forced to flee with her family. 'Since the fall of Afghanistan, women and girls in the media have been silenced, confined to their homes,' Zarmina told The Media Line. She endured such isolation in Afghanistan for two weeks before realizing that staying silent meant surrendering to censorship. Determined to return to work, she contacted her television station, but she was warned against returning—going back to work was simply too dangerous. Zarmina, a fierce critic of the Taliban who spoke out against the group during Ashraf Ghani’s presidency, found herself a target after the government fell in 2021. When her brother informed her that Taliban intelligence was asking about her, she and her family felt they had no choice but to flee the country. Reflecting on the state of journalism under Taliban rule, Zarmina painted a grim picture of an industry stripped of its independence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Journalistic content, language, and even references to former Afghan officials are all tightly controlled, Zarmina said. 'No one dares to speak against the Taliban,' she explained. 'Guests refuse to appear on television out of fear, and even hosts tread cautiously, knowing a single misstep could have dire consequences.' Arash Yaqin, a former UN adviser for the Afghan Foreign Ministry now based in Washington, told The Media Line that Afghanistan used to have substantial press freedom. 'Before the Taliban’s return, the media fearlessly scrutinized those in power, from the president down to the lowest officials,' he said. 'Now, that era of press freedom has vanished.' While the Taliban’s core policies have remained largely unchanged since the 1990s, the group’s approach to media has shifted, Yaqin said. 'They once enforced a near-total blackout, but now they exploit the media to shape narratives and influence young Afghans through jihadi propaganda,' he said. With that in mind, the return to air of Afghanistan’s women-run radio station should be seen not as a concession but as 'calculated tactic,' Yaqin said. 'While it projects an illusion of media freedom, strict control ensures it serves the Taliban’s agenda,' he explained. 'It wouldn’t be surprising if soon Afghan women are heard praising the Taliban for ‘bringing peace’ and ‘ensuring their rights’—claims far removed from reality.' Turning the women-owned radio station into a mouthpiece for the Taliban would also be financially beneficial to Afghanistan, since such stations are often funded by international donors, he continued. Speaking from an undisclosed location, Afghan media rights activist Elaha Sekandary similarly told The Media Line that the Taliban’s decision to allow media stations to reopen 'comes with conditions attached.' 'These outlets will now operate under the Taliban’s strict guidelines, ensuring their content aligns with the regime’s policies,' she said. By exerting control over media under the pretext of aligning it with Islamic regulations, the Taliban seek to present itself as media-friendly while maintaining strict oversight, she explained. She noted that the Taliban is keenly aware of shifting global politics, particularly with the return of President Donald Trump, whose stance on Afghanistan could pose challenges to the regime’s stability. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ugkwpo1x	2025-03-10T23:31:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/08/22/SknVuDk11F/SknVuDk11F_0_169_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Palestinain car thief breaks into military base, injures soldier	IDF says soldier was injured moderately and taken to nearby hospital; incident under investigation; authorities rule out terror-related motive An undocumented Palestinian from Jenin stole a car Tuesday morning from the Tel Aviv area, broke through a military base checkpoint in Tzrifin, injured a soldier moderately, and was arrested in Ramla after a chase. Authorities said the incident was not terror-related. The Israel Defense Forces said the soldier 'was injured by a vehicle at the entrance gate checkpoint of Tzrifin Base, and the incident is under investigation.' The soldier was taken to a hospital for medical treatment, and his family was notified. After stealing the car, the suspect drove onto Route 44 and turned right toward Tzrifin. He rammed through the checkpoint, drove inside the base for several minutes, then returned to the checkpoint, where he struck a man in his 20s. Despite attempts to stop him, the suspect fled back to Route 44 and continued east toward Ramla, where he was finally apprehended by local police at the Ice Junction in the city. He was taken in for questioning and is expected to appear in court later Tuesday for a remand hearing.

Council members also request discussion on Tehran's obligation to provide nuclear watchdog with information and access to sites The United Nations Security Council will meet behind closed doors on Wednesday over Iran's expansion of its stock of uranium close to weapons grade, diplomats said on Monday. The meeting was requested by six of the council's 15 members - France, Greece, Panama, South Korea, Britain and the U.S. They also want the council to discuss Iran's obligation to provide the U.N. nuclear watchdog - the International Atomic Energy Agency - with 'the information necessary to clarify outstanding issues related to undeclared nuclear material detected at multiple locations in Iran,' diplomats said. Iran's mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned meeting. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it is 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the IAEA has warned. Western states say there is no need to enrich uranium to such a high level under any civilian program and that no other country has done so without producing nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful. Iran reached a deal in 2015 with Britain, Germany, France, the U.S., Russia and China - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - that lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program. Washington quit the agreement in 2018 during Donald Trump's first term as U.S. president, and Iran began moving away from its nuclear-related commitments. Britain, France and Germany have told the U.N. Security Council that they are ready - if needed - to trigger a so-called snap back of all international sanctions on Iran to prevent the country from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They will lose the ability to take such action on October 18 this year when the 2015 U.N. resolution on the deal expires. Trump has directed his U.N. envoy to work with allies to snap back international sanctions and restrictions on Iran. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syq7gvpiyx	2025-03-10T23:11:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/03/04/10575450/10575450_0_68_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Israeli officials view Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s regime as security threat, citing its ties to jihadist groups and potential Turkish military influence; attacks come amid concerns Hamas, Islamic Jihad could use Syria as base for attacks In the most extensive Israeli airstrike in Syria in over two months, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out dozens of attacks from Monday night into early Tuesday, striking military sites affiliated with Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s regime. According to the IDF, the strikes in southern Syria targeted radar installations, aerial detection systems, and military headquarters, as well as weapons depots and other military infrastructure used by the new regime. The IDF stated that 'the presence of these systems in southern Syria poses a threat to Israel and to IDF operations. These targets were struck to eliminate future threats.' The wave of strikes marks the most significant Israeli military action in Syria in recent months, as Israel seeks to counter the growing military presence of the new regime. Syrian reports indicated that the strikes targeted military outposts in the Damascus countryside, including the towns of Sa’sa and Qatana, as well as former military positions in the Daraa region and the Syrian army’s 90th Brigade in the Quneitra countryside. Additional attacks were reported near Homs and along the Lebanese border. In total, at least 41 airstrikes were reported in the Damascus countryside alone. Growing concern over new regime’s military activity Ynet security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that the recent massacre carried out by forces loyal to al-Sharaa in Alawite cities in western Syria has reinforced Israel’s assessment that the new regime poses an emerging threat requiring preemptive action. Israel is concerned not only about jihadist groups within Syria but also about the country becoming a hub of fragile political stability that could allow Turkey to expand its military influence in the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One of the most pressing threats is the potential for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to use Syrian territory as a base for attacks against Israeli communities in the Golan Heights and Upper Galilee. Forces loyal to al-Sharaa have released senior terrorists, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives, whom Bashar Assad had previously imprisoned to prevent them from launching attacks against Israel. There is growing concern that these operatives are already planning terrorist activities. Another major concern is that Turkey may begin supplying and training jihadist forces aligned with the new regime. With these threats in mind, Israel is working to shape the reality in southern Syria to prevent the new regime from consolidating power near its border. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have made it clear that Israel will not allow regime-backed militants to move south, nor will it tolerate armed Sunni jihadists operating near the Syrian Golan. Many abandoned Syrian military outposts in the region remain stocked with weapons, raising fears that they could fall into hostile hands. Al-Sharaa strikes agreement with Kurdish forces At the same time, al-Sharaa has moved to strengthen his rule. On Monday night, he announced an agreement with the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to integrate Kurdish fighters into Syrian state institutions and the military. The agreement followed a meeting between al-Sharaa and SDF leadership, whose forces are backed by the United States. The decision to incorporate Kurdish forces came after they were excluded from last month’s 'National Dialogue Conference,' which aimed to establish a framework for Syria’s future governance. According to al-Sharaa’s office, the agreement reaffirms 'the unity of Syrian territory and the rejection of its division.' As part of the deal, the SDF pledged to support Syria in combating remnants of the Assad regime and other security threats. The agreement effectively ends any Kurdish aspirations for an independent state—at least within Syria—due to their commitment to preserving the country’s territorial integrity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wacu6jjg	2025-03-10T22:55:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/r1rTo6NEyl/r1rTo6NEyl_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Houthis threaten to renew hostilities 'immediately' after Gaza de...	Israeli officials fear Iranian proxy threats could signal broader regional escalation, potentially involving other Iran-backed groups; U.S. is expected to take stronger stance against terror group, with heightened military coordination in Red Sea Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels said Tuesday that their deadline for allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza had expired and warned they could resume attacks on ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi said the group was 'standing by its commitment' to enforce the ultimatum and that its forces were 'prepared for action.' He warned that 'military measures will begin immediately' if aid deliveries to Gaza are not resumed. The deadline, first announced last week, gave four days for humanitarian shipments to reach Gaza. On Monday, senior Houthi official Nasser al-Din Amer reiterated that any renewed attacks would be focused on maritime operations. 'The leader sent a message to mediators and the enemy before the deadline expired, limiting the threat to naval actions,' he said. 'If the Americans decide to support the Israeli enemy, they know what could happen.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The pro-Houthi Yemeni news channel Al-Masirah posted a message in Hebrew on Telegram on Monday warning that 'the promise is approaching.' The message referred to the deadline for humanitarian aid and included a graphic showing that only one day remained. Possible Hamas involvement Hamas may have requested the Houthis resume attacks as a way to pressure Israel into maintaining a cease-fire, according to Israeli assessments. Last month, senior Houthi officials issued a similar threat, warning that if cease-fires in Gaza or Lebanon collapsed, missile attacks from Yemen would resume. Since the start of the war, Hamas has sought to coordinate multiple fronts against Israel. Israel is preparing for the possibility that the Houthis will act on their latest threat, either by attempting to enforce a naval blockade or by resuming missile strikes. Israeli officials say there is close coordination with U.S. Central Command in anticipation of such developments. They expect a stronger U.S. response against the Houthis than in recent months. Former U.S. President Donald Trump designated the Houthis a terrorist organization and imposed sanctions on their leaders within his first month in office. Israel has carried out five airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen during the war. The last strike took place on Jan. 10, just days before the transition of power in Washington. Despite suffering losses to key assets, the Houthis have warned they are preparing for a new round of attacks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1vpx8psyl	2025-03-10T22:17:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/19/H111JJV00dA/H111JJV00dA_0_261_2508_1412_0_small.jpg

Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident who was a graduate student at Columbia until December, was detained Saturday by federal immigration agents in New York and flown to an immigration jail in Louisiana. 'We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity,' Trump wrote in a social media post. 'We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country - never to return again.'

Iran's mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned meeting. Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it is 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the IAEA has warned. Western states say there is no need to enrich uranium to such a high level under any civilian program and that no other country has done so without producing nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful. Iran reached a deal in 2015 with Britain, Germany, France, the U.S., Russia and China - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - that lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program. Washington quit the agreement in 2018 during Donald Trump's first term as U.S. president, and Iran began moving away from its nuclear-related commitments. Britain, France and Germany have told the U.N. Security Council that they are ready - if needed - to trigger a so-called snap back of all international sanctions on Iran to prevent the country from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They will lose the ability to take such action on October 18 next year when the 2015 U.N. resolution on the deal expires. Trump has directed his U.N. envoy to work with allies to snap back international sanctions and restrictions on Iran.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjy1t1as1x	2025-03-10T14:34:31-07:00

Francis has been in Rome's Gemelli hospital for more than three weeks. He was admitted on February 14 with a severe respiratory infection that has required evolving treatment. 'The clinical conditions of the Holy Father continue to be stable,' said the latest detailed medical update. 'The improvements recorded in previous days have further consolidated, as confirmed by both blood tests and clinical assessments, as well as a good response to his drug treatments,' it said. As a result, the pope's doctors, have decided to lift their earlier 'guarded' prognosis the Vatican said, but they expect Francis 'to continue medical drug treatment in a hospital setting for further days.' No exact time frame was given for his discharge.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkycv62j1g	2025-03-10T12:13:43-07:00	
Egypt’s $53 billion Gaza reconstruction plan may ‘face major obst...	Egypt’s plan to rebuild Gaza has been endorsed by the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and several European states, but a lack of funding and opposition from the US and Israel might stop the plan in its tracks Despite the approval by officials from Arab nations of Egypt’s $53 billion plan to rebuild Gaza, the plan may 'face major obstacles before its implementation,' according to Abdullah Ghanem, a Saudi political analyst. He noted that the plan makes no mention of Hamas, the group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 and that was responsible for the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, alongside numerous other terror attacks. 'This will lead to the U.S. administration rejecting the plan, and Israel rejecting it as well,' Ghanem said. 'Perhaps the Islamic countries will support this plan, but it is also important for America, Europe, and Israel to support it,' he continued. The plan, which Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi presented at the emergency Arab League summit in Cairo last week, aims to provide an alternative to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and take U.S. control over the enclave. The Arab League statement released after the summit warned against 'any sinful attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land,' saying that such attempts constitute a 'threat to peace in the Middle East.' The strategic choice of the Arab League remains the achievement of peace and stability through a two-state solution, the statement read. On Thursday evening, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said that the plan 'will include the removal of 50 million tons of rubble, the removal of unexploded ordnance, the provision of temporary housing units, the construction of a total of 460,000 permanent housing units and the restoration of basic services, networks and facilities' in Gaza. Representatives at last week’s summit included Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid and interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also spoke at the summit, calling attention to the immense suffering experienced by the Palestinians over the course of the war in Gaza. 'The situation may worsen if the international community does not assume its responsibility to end the war, alleviate the suffering, and ensure the achievement of lasting peace,' he said. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said in a statement following the summit that he would ask the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to adopt the plan. On Friday, that group voted to endorse the plan, according to media reports. On Saturday, the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the UK released a joint statement expressing their support for the proposal, describing it as a 'realistic path to the reconstruction of Gaza.' The U.S. has sent mixed signals about its support for the plan. U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff described the proposal as a 'good faith first step' with positive features on Thursday, but later that day, a spokesperson for the State Department called it ' inadequate.' Israel swiftly rejected the plan, with Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Oren Marmorstein posting on X that the proposal was stuck in an old paradigm intent on keeping Palestinian refugees. 'Now, with President Trump’s idea, there is an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will. This should be encouraged! Instead, Arab states have rejected this opportunity, without giving it a fair chance, and continue to level baseless accusations against Israel,' he wrote. A draft of the Egyptian plan includes the formation of a committee to manage affairs in the Gaza Strip during a six-month transitional phase. The committee would consist of independent Palestinian technocrats not associated with any of the political factions and would work under the umbrella of the Palestinian government. Egypt would also train Palestinian security cadres to ensure stability throughout the next phase, during which the Palestinian Authority would be put in control over Gaza. The plan extensively addresses rebuilding Gaza, which it estimates will cost $53 billion over five years. According to the Egyptian draft, the total material damage to the Gaza Strip since the war began amounts to $29.9 billion, along with economic and social losses amounting to $19.1 billion. The first stage of rebuilding, set to extend until 2027, would focus on reestablishing utilities, building and restoring permanent housing units, and reclaiming about 20,000 acres of agricultural land. The $30 billion second stage includes establishing industrial zones, a fishing port, a seaport, and an airport. According to the plan, temporary housing will be provided in seven locations throughout the strip for those displaced during the reconstruction process. The planned temporary housing is meant to accommodate more than 1.5 million residents. The summit’s final statement noted that a trust fund would be established to collect financial pledges toward the project. Mohamed El Azhar, an Egyptian political analyst, said that the plan has received 'great support from Arab and Islamic countries.' 'There are more than 50 countries that agree with it, and Egypt and the rest of the Arab countries will certainly seek to attract more support from countries around the world. We are very optimistic,' he said. He said that Egypt is singularly capable of managing Gaza’s reconstruction. 'It is the closest country to it, and all aid enters through it,' El Azhar said. 'Gaza has no borders other than with Israel and Egypt, so Egypt knows everything the strip needs, and it also knows how to manage things realistically.' Iraqi political analyst Abdul Redha Al-Saffar said that the Arab summit came too late, more than a month after Trump announced his plan for Gaza on February 4. 'There are moves by Israel to restart the war in Gaza, which means we are back to square one,' Al-Saffar said. 'So this plan is up in the air and will not succeed.' He said that Israel had successfully weakened many of its rivals, including Hezbollah and groups based in Gaza and Iraq, making the country less susceptible to pressure. Abdullah Ghanem, a Saudi political analyst, told The Media Line that the plan may 'face major obstacles before its implementation.'

'Perhaps the Islamic countries will support this plan, but it is also important for America, Europe and Israel to support it,' he continued. Abdul Latif Assaf, a Palestinian journalist living abroad, similarly described the U.S. and Israeli reluctance to support the plan as 'the biggest challenge' regarding its implementation. 'The other challenge is who will bear the cost,' he said. 'The Arab countries will not be able to provide $53 billion, the U.S. administration will not pay, and the countries of the world are all suffering from a weak economy, so who will bear the cost?' He said that Gazans themselves will get behind any proposal that allows them to return to normalcy and remain in Gaza. 'The people of Gaza just want to return to their homes and live in peace and quiet, away from Israeli or Hamas threats,' he said.

IDF chief cancels all holiday leaves for soldiers, citing October...	Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir changes the long-standing military protocol that grants large-scale leave during holidays — one of the lessons learned from October 7, saying the dramatic move aims to ensure there is no day in the year when a significant portion of the IDF is on standby IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir has canceled all routine holiday leaves for soldiers, saying the army must remain on alert year-round in the wake of the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas. Speaking to senior military commanders, Zamir said mandatory service members and career officers would still be entitled to vacations, but the longstanding practice of scheduled unit-wide leaves during holidays would be canceled. The decision follows military investigations into the failures of October 7, when Hamas exploited the reduced troop presence along the Gaza border during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah to launch its unprecedented terror attack. The findings showed that Hamas was aware of the Israeli military’s predictable holiday schedules, with its leader, Yahya Sinwar, reportedly noting that, during holidays and on Fridays, 'they don’t leave many people.' As part of the response to these findings, Zamir ordered a surprise drill to test the military’s readiness for base infiltrations, and Israel’s military inspector launched an unannounced review of Northern Command operations. Preliminary reports highlighted failures in intelligence processing and warning systems, with some analysts suggesting that the absence of key officers during pre-scheduled holiday leaves may have impacted real-time information flow and coordination. While military analysts say the Oct. 7 failures were due to multiple factors — including intelligence shortcomings and Hamas' strategic planning — reducing troop presence on holidays has been identified as a vulnerability. Zamir’s order ensures that, going forward, key units, including intelligence, Air Force, and operations divisions, remain fully staffed year-round. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Military officials say holiday leave suspension is particularly significant for combat units and command centers that manage border security. The military has already increased its permanent force deployment along Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank during holidays as a result of the war. During the October 7 terror attack, reduced troop presence left many bases undermanned, and the scale of Hamas’ assault overwhelmed the defenses. Intelligence gathered from Gaza after the war began included Hamas’ operational orders for attacking the Nahal Oz base, which detailed Israeli troop weaknesses, including the routine reduction of forces on weekends. A previous decision by Israel’s military high command to cut weekend troop presence in combat zones by half, intended to boost motivation for enlistment in combat roles, was recently reassessed. Military officials have since labeled it a 'mistake,' with Nahal Oz base — where 53 Israeli soldiers were killed —identified as one of the most vulnerable sites on Oct. 7 due to understaffing. Despite the cancellation of scheduled leaves, individual soldiers will still be granted time off, but Israel’s military will remain on full operational footing year-round to prevent future lapses in readiness. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ccdq3skl	2025-03-10T11:09:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/rJ7hPDPikg/rJ7hPDPikg_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

The US president says it is 'the first arrest of many to come' after vowing to deport foreign students and imprison 'agitators' involved in protests against Israel's actions in Gaza U.S. President Donald Trump boasted about the arrest by federal immigration authorities of a prominent Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia University’s student encampment movement. Trump posted a message on Monday on his Truth Social media platform about the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, and said that it is 'the first arrest of many to come.' 'Following my previously signed Executive Orders, ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University,' Trump wrote in his post. 'This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it. Many are not students, they are paid agitators. We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again. If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America’s Colleges and Universities to comply. Thank you!' Khalil was at his university-owned apartment blocks from Columbia’s Manhattan campus when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered the building and took him into custody on Saturday night, according to his attorney, Amy Greer. Trump has vowed to deport foreign students and imprison 'agitators' involved in protests against Israel's actions in Gaza since the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023. The administration has placed particular scrutiny on Columbia, announcing Friday that it would be cutting $400 million in grants and contracts because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. The New York Civil Liberties Union calls Khalil's detention unlawful, retaliatory and an attack on free speech rights. Khalil grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in his native Syria and has worked for the British embassy in Beirut. He holds a U.S. permanent residency green card. His wife is a U.S. citizen and is eight months pregnant, according to reports.

Israeli court rules in favor of parents who gave birth to baby in...	Family Court initially ruled to transfer the baby to her biological parents, but after an appeal by the birth mother and her partner they were granted custody: 'She gave birth to her and risked her life, parents should not be separated from their daughter'; 'We are shocked and heartbroken — our daughter will continue to grow up in a mistake' biological parents say An Israeli court on Monday ruled in favor of the couple who gave birth to a baby girl following an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) mix-up, determining that they will remain her legal parents despite a lack of genetic connection. The decision upheld the couple’s parental rights while recognizing the importance of maintaining a connection between the child and her biological parents. The ruling by the Central District Court overturned a lower court’s decision and concluded that the woman who carried and gave birth to the baby, named Sophia, should be recognized as her legal mother. The case arose from an IVF error at Assuta Medical Center in Rishon Lezion, where an embryo belonging to another couple was mistakenly implanted in the mother’s womb. The mistake was discovered through genetic testing after the child’s birth. The couple raising Sophia expressed relief and joy following the court’s decision. 'We are thrilled and emotional over the ruling that corrected the injustice done to us in the lower court,' they said in a statement. 'We pray this decision will give our daughter and us the peace we need to continue her development. We are focused solely on our child and want to raise her in security and quiet, as any parent would.' They also expressed hope that, with time, both sides would have space to process the ruling, potentially opening the door for some level of future communication. Attorney Galit Kerner, who represented the couple raising Sophia, welcomed the court’s decision. 'This is a sensitive and humane ruling that affirms a mother and father cannot and should not be separated from the child they carried and have lovingly raised,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The biological parents of the child, however, reacted with dismay. 'We are shocked and heartbroken by this decision, which reverses the ruling of the Family Court,' they said in a statement. 'This ruling sends the painful message that even the most serious mistakes and injustices are not only left uncorrected but legitimized and perpetuated by the state. We are solely focused on Sophia’s well-being, her future, her identity and her life story. The idea that our daughter will grow up in the result of a mistake that could have been corrected early on is unbearable. Her whole life is ahead of her, and we firmly believe that her long-term best interest is to grow up with her biological family, to whom she belongs and resembles.' Attorneys Shmuel Moran and Noa Gelerman Liel, who represent the biological parents, criticized the ruling, calling it a dangerous precedent. 'This effectively amounts to a redistribution of children in society. It sends a perilous message, particularly in the realm of fertility treatments and birth,' they said. The court cited several factors in its ruling, emphasizing that the woman who gave birth to Sophia had carried the pregnancy without knowing of the error. The judges highlighted that she risked her own life to save the baby, undergoing an in utero surgery despite medical advice to terminate the pregnancy due to detected heart defects. The court noted that both she and her partner had devoted themselves to the child’s care and well-being since birth. Given the complexities of artificial reproduction and the potential for human error, the court stated that prioritizing the 'principle of certainty' is crucial — affirming that the birth mother should be recognized as the child’s legal parent. This principle, the ruling argued, prevents the need for retroactive genetic testing to determine legal parentage in future fertility errors. Instead, genetic testing should only serve to inform the child about their full life story, rather than dictate legal custody. The judges referenced Israeli law, including surrogacy regulations, egg donation laws, and civil registry statutes, as well as Jewish legal interpretations, to support their decision. 'Just as a fetus is not removed from the womb of a gestational mother, so too should a newborn not be taken from her hands. The nurturing womb and the embracing arms of the birth mother are one and the same,' the ruling stated. The court also determined that the woman’s partner should be recognized as Sophia’s legal father, based on his parental connection to the birth mother. The judges further ruled that it was in Sophia’s best interest to remain with the only parents she has ever known, citing her medical and developmental challenges and the potential irreversible harm that could result from severing that bond. At the same time, the court emphasized the importance of ensuring Sophia learns about her origins in an age-appropriate manner, as recommended by professional experts. The welfare authorities will oversee a structured plan to facilitate ongoing contact between the child and her biological parents while maintaining legal parental rights solely with the couple raising her. The case stems from an IVF embryo mix-up at Assuta Medical Center, which came to light in September 2022 when genetic testing revealed no biological connection between the couple and the fetus the woman was carrying. The revelation exposed significant procedural failures at the fertility clinic, ultimately leading to a legal battle over parental rights after Sophia’s birth and the subsequent identification of her biological parents. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkh900fnske	2025-03-10T08:41:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/10/26/SJlA9vCU4j/SJlA9vCU4j_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Man who scaled London's 'Big Ben' clock tower appears in court	A man who climbed part way up the 'Big Ben' clock tower at London's Palace of Westminster early on Saturday and stayed there all day as part of a pro-Palestinian protest, appeared in court on Monday. Daniel Day, 29, was charged by police with climbing and remaining on the tower which created 'a risk or caused serious harm to the public', and also trespassing on a protected site. Prosecutors said Day's actions had led to serious disruption in that area of central London with roads closed and buses diverted, and the cancellation of parliamentary tours had cost 25,000 pounds ($32,300). Day's lawyer said he would plead not guilty to the first charge, saying his action was designed to spread awareness regarding the situation in Gaza and Britain's response to it. The second charge of trespass requires the authorization of the attorney general, and so the case was adjourned until March 17 for a decision to be made. Day, from a seaside town in eastern England, was remanded in custody, with his supporters clapping and shouting 'Hero' and 'Free Palestine' as he was led away.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjytz5nijl	2025-03-10T08:23:36-07:00	
Israeli negotiators head to Doha and will be joined by Witkoff, w...	Israeli delegation will arrive in Doha, where it will discuss with the mediators the framework proposed by Trump's envoy- who claims that an approach needs to be changed in order to release the hostages; Hamas has been adamant in its refusal and is making it clear now that it is interested in moving to Phase II, which includes ending the war: 'threats of war will not work' A delegation of Israeli negotiators departed for Doha on Monday afternoon and is expected to begin indirect talks with Hamas later in the day through mediators, based on a framework proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s special Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff. The initial discussions will focus on the structure of the negotiations and the issues to be addressed. Witkoff himself is expected to join the talks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In an interview with Fox News earlier in the day, Witkoff said, 'We need deadlines' for the next stage of the cease-fire deal, reiterating his claim that this is the only way to advance the stalled negotiations. Last week he stressed that 'Trump has had enough.' According to Witkoff, 'This has to happen. The way these hostages are being held is unacceptable.' Witkoff emphasized the urgency of securing the hostages’ release, describing the condition of those already freed as 'simply unacceptable' and 'deplorable.' He added: 'Many of them came out sick, they hadn’t eaten, they didn’t receive medical care. It’s a terrible situation for them. It’s just unacceptable.' Meanwhile, Hamas continued to reject Witkoff’s proposal, reiterating Monday afternoon its demand to move to the second phase of negotiations, which includes a permanent cease-fire. 'We reaffirm our full commitment to the cease-fire agreement and its implementation, and we are ready to immediately begin negotiations for the second phase,' the terror group said. Hamas accused Israel of 'undermining the agreement and refusing to proceed to the second phase, exposing its intention to evade and delay. Netanyahu is obstructing the agreement’s implementation for personal and political reasons, and the last thing he cares about is releasing the Zionist prisoners or the feelings of their families.' In another statement, Hamas said: 'The agreement was brokered by the mediators and witnessed by the world. Its implementation is mandatory as it is the only way to return the enemy’s prisoners. We reject attempts to pressure Hamas, while the occupation evades its commitments without accountability. The language of extortion and threats of war will not work. There is no way forward except negotiations and adherence to the agreement. Anything else jeopardizes the fate of the prisoners. The occupation’s continued stalling and deception will not provide it cover, but rather increase its isolation and expose the falsehood of its narrative to the world.' Hamas stated earlier Monday that it has shown flexibility in talks with the United States, Qatar and Egypt regarding the hostage deal and cease-fire with Israel. It said it is now waiting to see whether negotiations with Israel will yield results and allow the second phase of the agreement to proceed. 'The talks focused on ending the war, Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and its reconstruction,' Hamas said. 'We fulfilled our commitments in the first phase. Our priority now is to provide aid to our people and ensure a permanent cease-fire,' Hamas spokesperson Abd al-Latif al-Qanou said. He added that Hamas agreed to Egypt’s proposal to establish a committee to govern Gaza, but claimed Israel’s goal is to tighten the blockade, close the crossings, prevent relief for Palestinians, and push them to emigrate. 'Israel’s talk of military plans to resume fighting, along with cutting off electricity, threatens the hostages, who will only be freed through negotiations,' he said. A Palestinian official told Sky News Arabia on Monday that Egypt insisted on discussing the disarmament of Hamas as a condition for establishing the proposed governing committee in Gaza. This, the official said, is intended to prevent Israeli objections that could hinder reconstruction efforts. Ahead of the Israeli delegation’s departure for Qatar, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to give the team 'full authority to bring home all 59 hostages at once.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier Monday, diplomatic sources told the Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the future of Hamas’ weapons in Gaza was a key issue in talks between Trump’s envoy, Adam Boehler, and the terror group. According to the report, Hamas’ proposed 'package,' supported by other armed factions in Gaza, also covers the West Bank and Jerusalem. It includes a cease-fire lasting at least 10 years. 'The situation in Jerusalem, according to the proposal, would remain unchanged,' the report said, referring to the status quo. The Qatari report stated that Hamas expressed a willingness to discuss its offensive weapons and rockets in exchange for the long-term truce, which would include an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, the end of the war and the release of all Israeli hostages, beginning with those holding American citizenship. Hamas reportedly offered to release American hostage Edan Alexander as a 'gesture of goodwill' to keep negotiations open with Washington. However, the group emphasized it would not relinquish its weapons in the event a Palestinian state is established. Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, told Al-Raed TV Monday night that the talks between the United States and Egypt indicate that 'there is no winner in the war.' According to Rashwan, 'Netanyahu will not resume the war without Trump. The meetings between Washington and Hamas reveal secrets about Gaza’s future after the war — because their communication means that the day after belongs to Hamas.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syalu003ojx	2025-03-10T07:27:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/rk11B4tooyl/rk11B4tooyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

West Bank security on edge amid fragile Gaza cease-fire, released...	Security officials warn that approximately 80% of recently released Palestinian prisoners may return to terrorism, with some rebuilding networks; Meanwhile, declining economic conditions and rise in illegal crossings into Israel add further instability After months of conflict and heightened tensions, the West Bank is entering a critical period. While the frequency of terrorist attacks has decreased, the coming weeks are expected to bring a series of developments that could inflame the already fragile security situation. The recent release of Palestinian prisoners, ongoing Israeli military operations, growing economic distress, and the volatile atmosphere surrounding Ramadan all contribute to a complex and unpredictable reality. Israeli security officials are closely monitoring these converging factors, which could lead to further escalation both in the West Bank and inside Israel. While the IDF and Shin Bet are working to prevent a deterioration, a combination of internal and external pressures may test their ability to maintain stability. Ramadan tensions and the threat of escalation With Ramadan already underway, Israeli security officials are bracing for the possibility of violence centered around Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint during the holy month. Religious tensions have historically been exploited by terrorist groups to incite violence, and this year is no exception. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar named the October 7 attack 'Al-Aqsa Flood,' framing it as a response to Israeli actions at the site. The Israeli security cabinet has yet to decide whether to approve a defense establishment recommendation to allow 10,000 Muslim worshippers onto the Temple Mount, as was permitted last year. Any restrictions, confrontations, or incidents at the site could further inflame tensions, particularly against the backdrop of ongoing IDF operations in the West Bank. The return of freed terrorists to the West Bank One of the most immediate security concerns is the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners into the West Bank as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. While Israeli officials have acknowledged the necessity of these releases, they have also warned of the consequences. A senior security official recently estimated that about 80% of those freed are expected to return to terrorism in some form. This is not merely a question of individuals carrying out attacks. Many of the released prisoners are experienced operatives with the knowledge and networks to reestablish terrorist cells, secure funding and weapons, and recruit new militants. Compounding the risk, security officials have noted a significant increase in the flow of weapons and funds into the West Bank, making it easier for these individuals to reengage in terror activity. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli security forces, in close coordination with the Palestinian Authority, are monitoring these former prisoners. However, Hamas and other groups continue to receive external support, making it difficult to contain the growing threat. The Palestinian Authority itself has an interest in preventing Hamas from strengthening its presence in the West Bank, but its ability to act remains limited. Economic instability fueling unrest The Palestinian Authority is facing severe financial difficulties, adding another layer of instability. At the same time, terrorist organizations are injecting funds into the West Bank, using financial incentives to recruit new operatives. Ramadan typically brings an economic boost, as many Israeli Arabs visit Palestinian cities to shop and dine. However, security officials report a decline in both visitors and spending, indicating growing financial distress. The worsening economy is a concern not just for the Palestinian leadership but also for Israeli security officials, who fear that economic frustration could further destabilize the situation. The issue of Palestinian laborers in Israel also remains unresolved. The security cabinet has yet to formulate a clear policy on work permits, and in the meantime, the number of Palestinians entering Israel illegally is on the rise. Israeli security forces are struggling to monitor and regulate these movements, raising concerns that terrorist groups could exploit the situation to smuggle operatives into Israeli cities. IDF operations shifting the battlefield The IDF continues to conduct military operations across the West Bank, particularly in the northern region, where armed groups have gained strength in recent years. While these operations have led to the arrest or killing of key terrorist figures, they have also had unintended consequences. Many operatives are now relocating to other areas, potentially spreading the threat rather than eliminating it. Security officials believe that maintaining a strong military presence in the West Bank is essential for reducing attacks and enabling rapid responses to intelligence threats. However, the extended nature of IDF operations inside refugee camps has driven some terrorist operatives to reposition themselves, with the potential to launch attacks from different locations. Terrorist organizations see this period as an opportunity to provoke wider unrest, particularly by encouraging lone-wolf attacks inside Israeli cities. Leaders of these groups are hoping that a series of high-profile incidents will trigger broader protests and inspire additional attackers. Terror groups targeting upcoming Jewish holidays Beyond the immediate security concerns, Israeli officials are also looking ahead to key dates on the Israeli calendar that have historically been targeted by terrorist organizations. Jewish holidays and national commemorations, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Passover, are often seen as strategic moments to carry out attacks. Adding to the uncertainty is the possibility of a U.S. policy announcement regarding Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, as well as the potential for renewed fighting in Gaza or even along the Lebanese border. With so many volatile factors converging, Israeli security forces face one of their toughest tests in recent months. The coming weeks will likely determine whether the relative calm in the West Bank holds or if a new wave of violence emerges. The IDF and Shin Bet remain on high alert, knowing that even a single incident could set off a wider escalation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjhenwno1e	2025-03-10T05:51:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/SylgPo391l/SylgPo391l_1_103_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Trump administration warns Iraq: Free Israeli researcher or 'face...	Officials say US envoy conveyed direct messages to Iraqi PM, making it clear Baghdad bears full responsibility for securing Elizabeth Tsurkov’s release The Trump administration has issued a formal warning to Iraq, demanding the swift release of Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov or face political and economic consequences, two senior Iraqi officials told the Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed on Monday. According to the officials, Adam Boehler, the Trump administration’s envoy for hostage affairs, recently conveyed direct messages to Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, making it clear that Baghdad bears full responsibility for securing Tsurkov’s release. One of the officials stated that Boehler 'threatened a package of punitive U.S. measures against Iraq if Tsurkov is not freed soon.' Tsurkov, an Israeli academic and journalist, was abducted in Iraq seven months ago by the Iran-backed Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah, which has refused to engage in negotiations. Iraqi officials say the government, with support from Shiite political leaders, has renewed efforts to resolve the crisis, aiming to avoid U.S. sanctions. A second Iraqi official confirmed that authorities are focusing their efforts on mediating with Kataib Hezbollah and other armed groups. 'The government has been working on this issue for months, but the captors have not responded at all — and ransom is not their objective,' the official said. 'This makes resolving the situation significantly more difficult.'

Boehler also recently visited Baghdad, where he was seen near the site of the 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. Amid growing U.S. pressure, Iraq’s National Security Advisor Qasim al-Araji stated last week that authorities were working to locate Tsurkov, who was kidnapped in March 2023. The only known footage of her captivity surfaced in November of that year. 'We must work discreetly, through intermediaries,' al-Araji said, while Iraqi officials expressed concerns that Washington could impose sanctions regardless of the case’s outcome. On Saturday, two U.S. diplomats told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that the Biden administration is preparing phased, wide-ranging sanctions against Iraqi government and political figures, as well as militia groups. Iraq, governed by the pro-Iranian Coordination Framework coalition, remains divided over its stance on U.S. policy toward Tehran. The reported sanctions are part of Washington’s broader strategy to 'apply maximum pressure on Iran and counter its influence' in Iraq. According to a U.S. diplomat, the sanctions are 'not intended to destabilize Iraq’s political system, but rather to dismantle Iran’s network of interests within the country.' He added that the measures could 'help Iraqis demonstrate their ability to govern more independently.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkkqi8nojg	2025-03-10T04:23:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/13/BJz8V11gVp/BJz8V11gVp_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

Syrian defense ministry says operation against Assad loyalists is...	New regime's crackdown in the province of Latakia - former president's coastal heartland - has killed more than 1,000 people, mostly civilians A Syrian military operation against loyalists of ousted former President Bashar al-Assad has been completed, the defence ministry said on Monday. Clashes between Assad loyalists and the country's new Islamist rulers in the former president's coastal heartland have killed more than 1,000 people, mostly civilians, according to a war monitoring group. Hassan Abdul Ghany, the defence ministry spokesperson, said in a statement on X that public institutions were now able to resume their work and provide essential services. 'We are paving the way for life to return to normal and for the consolidation of security and stability,' Abdul Ghany said. He added that plans were in place to continue combating the remnants of the former government and eliminate any future threats. Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa vowed on Sunday to hunt down the perpetrators of the violent clashes and said he would hold to account anyone who overstepped the new rulers' authority. Al-Sharaa's office also said it was forming an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings carried out by both sides. Abdul Ghany added that the security forces would cooperate with the investigation committee, offering full access to uncover the circumstances of the events, verify the facts and ensure justice for the wronged. 'We were able to absorb the attacks from the remnants of the former regime and its officers. We shattered their element of surprise and managed to push them away from vital centers, securing most of the main roads,' he said.

The fighting spiralled into revenge killings against Alawites, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam that is the faith of some of Assad's most ardent supporters and became associated with Assad's wartime atrocities against Syria's mostly Sunni Muslim population. The British-based Syrian Observatory reported that more than 1,000 people were killed during two days of fighting, including 745 civilians, 125 members of the Syrian security forces and 148 fighters loyal to Assad. Assad fled to Russia last year after rebels led by Sharaa's Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group toppled his government, ending decades of severe repression and a devastating civil war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjezkrnjye	2025-03-10T02:38:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/HJ2TQ69oyg/HJ2TQ69oyg_1_197_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
UN recognition of hostage families as torture victims 'milestone ...	Speaking with Ynetnews, Advocate Hila Kugler-Ramot says decision could bolster legal and diplomatic pressure on terror group; 'We'll continue working to ensure justice is served' In an interview with Ynet, Advocate Hila Kugler-Ramot, CEO of the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, discussed the significance of a newly published UN report on hostage-taking, which recognizes both Israeli hostages held by Hamas and their families as victims of torture. Speaking about the report’s findings, Kugler-Ramot emphasized its groundbreaking approach. 'Dr. Alice Jill Edwards, the UN’s special rapporteur on torture, addressed hostage-taking comprehensively, covering both state and non-state actors. Her report made two major contributions: first, recognizing hostages as victims of torture, and second—and perhaps even more significantly—acknowledging that their families also endure torture due to the psychological abuse inflicted by Hamas.' The findings were presented at a special event at the UN in Geneva on March 5, led by the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, in partnership with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum and with support from the German embassy in Geneva. The voice of the families Among those attending the UN discussion were Lishai Miran-Levi, the wife of hostage Omri Miran, and Rivka Bukhbut, the wife of hostage Elkana Bukhbut. Kugler-Ramot stressed the significance of their testimonies. 'Their presence was essential,' she said. 'They gave the world an unfiltered look at the horrifying reality their husbands are experiencing in captivity. But beyond that, they shed light on their own suffering and the toll this has taken on their children.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Dr. Edwards, the special rapporteur, visited Israel and met with the families of hostages. According to Kugler-Ramot, this direct engagement had a profound impact on shaping the report’s conclusions. When asked about the practical impact of the UN’s findings, Kugler-Ramot highlighted how the report could serve as a powerful tool for legal action and advocacy. 'With Dr. Edwards’ status as a leading global expert, this report can help push for accountability and justice,' she explained. 'It also makes an important clarification—that soldiers taken captive are also considered victims of hostage-taking, reinforcing international legal protections.' Challenges and next steps Despite the report’s significance, Kugler-Ramot acknowledged that challenges remain in implementing its recommendations. 'This is a milestone in international law, but it’s only the first step,' she noted. 'Now, we need UN member states to adopt these conclusions and act on them. That will be the real test.' As efforts continue to secure the release of the hostages, Kugler-Ramot remains hopeful that this recognition will strengthen legal and diplomatic pressure on Hamas. 'This is just the beginning,' she concluded. 'We will continue working to ensure that justice is served.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skjz0z2sjg	2025-03-10T02:27:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/Syv007E5o1e/Syv007E5o1e_0_198_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

‘Living in fear’: Alawite civilians tell of massacres by Syrian s...	Fighting between pro-Assad rebels and security forces escalates in Syria’s Latakia province, raising fears of further sectarian conflict and regional destabilization Syria, a nation exhausted by more than a decade of civil war, has once again plunged into chaos as violent clashes erupted between armed rebels and government security forces in the coastal province of Latakia. The latest violence highlights the deep divisions in Syrian society following the ousting of President Bashar Assad in December 2024—a turning point that many hoped would lead to peace but has instead reignited old rivalries. According to an official security source speaking anonymously, pro-Assad fighters launched a series of coordinated attacks on security checkpoints and outposts in the region, resulting in the deaths of 121 security personnel and the injury of dozens more. The violence quickly escalated beyond military targets, with reports of horrific massacres against Alawite civilians—the religious minority to which Assad belonged—allegedly carried out by forces linked to the new government. The recent surge in violence reflects the power vacuum left in the wake of Assad’s downfall. Remnants of Assad’s loyalist forces are refusing to surrender while the new government struggles to consolidate control. Localized skirmishes have quickly spiraled into a full-scale conflict, with both sides accusing the other of war crimes. Clashes erupted in the city of Jableh and its surrounding rural areas, where intense firefights broke out between security forces and pro-Assad fighters. Latakia, a predominantly Alawite stronghold, had been a pillar of regime support throughout Syria’s brutal civil war, making it a symbolic and strategic target for both sides. The Syrian Ministry of Defense deployed military reinforcements to the region, sending convoys of heavy artillery and armored vehicles to support security forces. The government framed the operation as a necessary step to crush the insurgency and protect civilians, but eyewitness reports painted a far darker picture. As government forces pushed back against the rebels, local sources reported that at least 150 Alawite civilians—including women and children—were executed by members of the security forces. The killings took place in villages across Latakia and Tartous, triggering widespread condemnation and calls for accountability. A leaked video showed a soldier, allegedly from the Ministry of Defense, executing an elderly man in one of the coastal villages. The footage, which spread rapidly online, intensified public outrage and drew comparisons to the brutal tactics used by Assad’s regime in the early years of the war. Since the collapse of Assad’s rule, a large number of military and security personnel have gone into hiding in the Latakia mountains. Many of these individuals are high-ranking figures accused of committing war crimes on behalf of Assad, and they are believed to be behind the recent violent uprisings in the coastal region. Rabee, an Alawite resident of Latakia, confirmed that extrajudicial killings had taken place in his village, targeting his relatives. He described the situation as 'deeply distressing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'My relatives and friends are living in fear,' Rabee said. 'Many innocent people in my village have been killed without any reason—they were civilians, and they were murdered by Syrian security forces.' Alaa Al-Khair, a resident of Qardaha—Bashar Assad’s hometown—emphasized the importance of distinguishing between Assad loyalists and members of the Alawite religion. 'Not everyone in the coastal region supports Assad,' Al-Khair said. 'Hundreds of thousands of Alawite civilians themselves do not support him.' He said that while the situation in Qardaha itself was relatively stable, surrounding villages had witnessed executions of civilians, which could further inflame tensions between the government and the coastal population. 'The unraveling of Syrian society' The brutality has sent shockwaves throughout Syria, raising fears of renewed sectarian conflict and further destabilization of an already fragile region. A government security official attempted to downplay the atrocities, claiming they were 'isolated incidents' carried out by 'unorganized crowds' seeking revenge for the assassination of security personnel. However, human rights groups and local activists rejected this explanation, warning that unchecked retaliation could ignite sectarian violence on a massive scale. Amira Haddad, a political analyst based in Damascus, said: 'What we are witnessing is not just a military conflict, but the unraveling of Syrian society. The massacres are a grim reminder that the wounds of the civil war have not healed, and without accountability, history will repeat itself.' Determined to reassert control, the Syrian Ministry of Defense announced the launch of coordinated military operations to reclaim rebel-held areas. Special forces units and night combat brigades were deployed to conduct precision strikes on militant strongholds, while warplanes carried out airstrikes in rural Jableh. Ministry of Defense spokesperson Col. Hassan Abdel Ghani issued a stark warning on the X social media platform to the Assad loyalist fighters. 'To the remaining fighters: Don’t be fuel for a lost cause,' he wrote. 'Bashar Assad fled and abandoned you to your fate. Don’t repeat the mistake—or it will be your last.' Despite these threats, fighting continued to rage across the region, with neither side willing to back down. Civilian casualties mounted, and humanitarian organizations reported a sharp increase in displacement figures, as families fled their homes in search of safety. As the violence escalated, public demonstrations erupted across Syria. In cities like Damascus, Idlib, Homs, and Daraa, thousands took to the streets—some rallying in support of the military’s campaign, others demanding an end to the bloodshed and calling for justice for the victims of the massacres. In Latakia’s Saliba neighborhood, mourners carried Syrian flags and photographs of the slain civilians, chanting for unity and an end to sectarian killings. Protesters called on the international community to intervene and investigate the civilian massacres, fearing the country’s descent back into full-scale war. The resurgence of violence sent ripples across the Middle East, raising concerns that the conflict could once again draw in regional powers like Iran, Russia, and Turkey. Analysts warn that Iran-backed militias might attempt to rearm pro-Assad fighters, while opposition factions could seek support from neighboring countries, turning Syria into a proxy battleground for external actors. While the coastal Latakia region remains at the center of the current conflict, other areas of Syria—inhabited by different sectarian groups—remain tense but relatively calm. However, fears persist that the violence could spread to the Kurdish regions in the east or the Druze areas in the south. For now, the coastal front remains the epicenter of Syria’s struggle for a post-Assad future. As military operations continue and the humanitarian crisis deepens, Syria stands at a dangerous crossroads. The country’s future remains uncertain—caught between the hope for peace and the looming threat of greater chaos. > The story is written by Rizik Alabi and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqyy73s1l	2025-03-10T01:20:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/Sk3lbyoo1e/Sk3lbyoo1e_0_62_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Hamas: 'We offered to release 10 hostages, Netanyahu refused'	Palestinian sources say Egypt insisting on terror group’s disarmament as condition to reconstruction efforts in the enclave in an effort to address Israeli concerns Hamas has proposed releasing 10 hostages in exchange for a two-month ceasefire, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the offer, according to a Palestinian source who spoke to Sky News Arabia. The source also said Egypt has insisted on discussing Hamas’s disarmament as a condition for allowing the Gaza Administration Committee to begin its work, in an effort to address Israeli concerns and facilitate reconstruction in the enclave. Hamas has reportedly informed Egyptian leadership that it would not oppose the committee’s operations in Gaza and would ensure its security. However, the group has not offered to disarm or withdraw from political activity in exchange for a long-term ceasefire. The source also said Hamas has proposed the release of American hostage Edan Alexander as a goodwill gesture to keep diplomatic channels open with Washington, without an official handover ceremony. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Hamas spokesperson Abd al-Latif al-Qanou said the group is awaiting the outcome of negotiations in Qatar, claiming: 'We have shown flexibility in response to the efforts of the mediators and Trump’s envoy.' As negotiations continue, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged Netanyahu to grant full authority to the Israeli delegation expected to depart for Qatar on Monday. The group called for a mandate to secure the immediate return of all 59 remaining hostages in a single agreement. 'A comprehensive deal to bring back all the hostages is possible, and it is the Israeli government’s duty to its citizens who remain in Hamas tunnels,' the group said in a statement. It cited comments by Trump envoy Adam Boehler, who claimed, 'Hamas has proposed a broad hostage deal and a ceasefire lasting five to ten years, under which it would disarm.' The group warned that time is running out for the hostages. 'Testimonies from those who have returned leave no doubt—hostages are out of time,' the statement read. 'In the last exchange, hostages who were still alive could have been saved but were returned as corpses. Delays in negotiations will cost more lives and the chance to recover bodies for burial, denying families closure.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkomixhokg	2025-03-10T01:19:45-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/rkewOmE9oyg/rkewOmE9oyg_0_140_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
After two years of deadlock, Lebanon turns to Hezbollah’s disarma...	Lebanon faces the delicate challenge of disarming a weakened Hezbollah, risking instability amid fears of renewed civil conflict after devastating losses in the recent conflict with Israel After electing a president and forming a government following two years of political deadlock, Lebanon’s political class faces its biggest challenge yet: disarming Hezbollah. The Shiite terror militia has been severely decimated during the 14-month conflict with Israel. The brutality of last fall’s bombings wiped out much of the group’s political and military leadership, killing its leader of the past 32 years, Hassan Nasrallah, and his intended successor in the same week. However, the political party continues to mobilize much of the Shiite community and is a prominent political force that refuses to give up the hegemony that its weapons give it. 'Hezbollah has lost the war, and the so-called ceasefire agreement imposed on Lebanon was really a surrender agreement, which we see every day,' said Abdallah Khoury, a Lebanese political expert. Since the truce came into effect at the end of November, Israeli forces have continued to attack Lebanon with hardly a rebuke from the U.S.-chaired ceasefire monitoring committee. 'In every sense, it is a defeat for Hezbollah and, of course, it is also a defeat in terms of Lebanese sovereignty,' he said. Despite this tragic reality, not everyone sees it the same way. 'The different political camps in Lebanon try to explain the war in the way that best suits their political position: it is not surprising that Hezbollah has pointed to achievements that show its victory in its war against Israel, and it is also not surprising that its opponents point to its defeats to show that Hezbollah has lost the war,' Noah Johnson, senior analyst for Lebanon said. More than three months after the last war, Israeli forces are still present at five strategic points on the border between the two countries, in clear violation of the cease-fire. The Lebanese militia, the only one that did not lay down its arms at the end of the civil war (1975-1990), is closer than ever to doing so. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Anything is possible,' Johnson said. 'It was certainly difficult to even imagine having a conversation about the disarmament of Hezbollah even six months ago, which shows how significant these changes have been throughout the war,' he added. The militia is in a weakened position after Israel destroyed much of its military arsenal, killed thousands of fighters, and seriously wounded many others. That is why many in Lebanon, especially its detractors, believe that it is now time to seize the momentum and start disarmament. However, they have little time to achieve this because the country will hold elections again in 14 months. A political source close to Najib Mikati, the outgoing prime minister who took a moderate stance toward Hezbollah, said that 'none of the political parties will accept the return of the group’s military capacity [after the war].' However, the delicate sectarian balance underpinning Lebanon’s fragile political system demands caution. 'While Hezbollah should eventually disarm, it should do so gradually because otherwise there could be a high risk of a violent response from it or a state-led political paralysis in which Hezbollah and its allies find ways to block political activity,' Johnson warned. 'If the government does not move quickly to disarm, this momentum could slip away, regional balances could shift [the fall of Bashar Assad, its main ally in Syria, has severely affected the group] and Hezbollah could become stronger on the domestic scene,' he added. One way the militia could hand over its weapons is through the weak and underfunded Lebanese army. National troops are supposed to take up positions in the south of the country, where Hezbollah reigned supreme until just a few months ago. However, among the soldiers are many Shiite citizens, the community that Hezbollah represents. The possibility of a direct confrontation with the group would motivate many of them to defect, paving the way for civil conflict. For Khoury, that scenario is not very probable. 'I don’t see it very likely that we will get involved in military action by the army against Hezbollah,' he said. 'We will try to move forward in a consensual way towards a solution; Lebanon is not going to get involved in a civil war just because the international community, the Americans or the Israelis want to see Hezbollah weakened,' he added, calling for 'patience.' 'The international community should avoid getting involved or interfering in the way the Lebanese should deal with the disarmament of Hezbollah and its political role,' Johnson agreed. 'These are issues that affect the daily lives of the Lebanese; therefore, only the Lebanese should decide the future of Lebanon.' > The story is written by Taylor Thomas and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjky17noyx	2025-03-10T01:09:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/rJGq007smY1g/rJGq007smY1g_668_518_1665_937_0_small.jpg

Israeli tourist to return home after brutal gang rape in India	Indian authorities arrest third suspects and pledge enhanced safety measures for tourists four days after a horrific gang rape near Sanapur Lake; Israeli victim to leave the country Monday Four days after the rape of a 27-year-old Israeli woman and a guesthouse owner in Karnataka, India, the victim is expected to board a flight to Israel on Monday. Meanwhile, Indian police named the third suspect in the gang rape and murder case as Kasiram. The suspect was arrested after fleeing to Tamil Nadu. Two other suspects, Mallesh and Chetan Sai Sillekyatar, were arrested the previous day and their photos were published by the local police. The Karnataka’s interior minister vowed to significantly increase security measures at the tourist destination following the attack. He also said that tourists arriving in the state would receive safety briefings to ensure their well-being. The brutal incident took place last Thursday when the Israeli woman and the guesthouse owner were traveling with two Americans and an Indian tourist near the village of Sanapur in Karnataka. According to the guesthouse owner’s testimony, as they were stargazing and playing the guitar, three suspects approached and demanded money. When they refused, the attackers assaulted the three men accompanying the women and threw them into a canal. One of the men drowned. According to the police complaint filed after the rape and murder, the assailants threatened to crush the men's heads with stones before throwing them into the canal and then raped the two women. In the water, American tourist Daniel Pittas managed to grab the hand of Pankaj Amrit Rao Patil and swam with him to the canal’s edge despite the strong current. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The third man, identified as a traveler named Bibash, was swept downstream. The survivors only saw his broken watch floating on the water. They returned to the spot where they had been attacked and found the two women. 'They were devastated, crying, with terror on their faces,' one of the survivors recalled. The group then made their way back to the guesthouse and later filed a complaint with the police. The guesthouse owner, who also reported the attack to police, described the events leading up to the assault. 'After dinner, we decided to go stargazing. We rode our scooters to the banks of the Tungabhadra Canal, near Sanapur Lake. As we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, around 10:30 p.m., three men on a motorcycle approached us and asked for fuel,' she said. She told them that there was no gas station nearby and suggested they find fuel in Sanapur. According to her testimony, one of the men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. 'They didn’t know us, so I told them I had no money. But they kept demanding, until one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.' When the travelers refused to give them more money, the suspects began arguing and threatening them with stones. Two of them then attacked and raped the women, while the third pushed the men into the canal and assaulted the guesthouse owner with stones. 'I was bleeding heavily. Two of the suspects dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them choked me and removed my clothes. One after the other, they beat me and raped me,' she said. The attackers stole her bag and fled with two mobile phones and 9,500 rupees. One of the men dragged the Israeli tourist away and raped her as well. 'When we screamed and cried, they fled on their motorcycle,' she recounted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkrlbghije	2025-03-09T23:58:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/Bk00XNhKsJl/Bk00XNhKsJl_1_0_1200_675_0_small.jpg

Beyond the Product: How Strategic Branding Transforms Startups	How does branding shape the future of tech companies—and why is it vital for startups? From Google to TikTok, strategic name and identity shifts have driven global success. At SHOW 2025, experts will reveal how companies can stand out in a competitive market and what makes a brand memorable, trustworthy, and industry-leading In the competitive world of technology startups, branding has become just as important as the product itself. Ahead of SHOW 2025.THE BRAND TECH SUMMIT, set to take place in Israel on May 8, industry experts are emphasizing the role of strategic branding—sometimes beginning with a well-timed name change—in shaping a company’s trajectory. The Power of a Name: How Rebranding Shapes Companies The history of the tech industry includes numerous examples of companies that have reshaped their trajectory through carefully planned rebranding. One of the most well-known cases is Google, which started in 1996 as 'BackRub', a name reflecting its ability to analyze backlinks. Two years later, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin rebranded it as 'Google', a play on the mathematical term 'googol' (10¹⁰⁰), creating a simpler and more memorable identity that became synonymous with internet searching worldwide. Similarly, the project management platform Monday.com was originally launched as 'dapulse' in 2012. By 2017, the founders recognized that the original name caused confusion and limited the company’s growth potential. The decision to rebrand as Monday.com provided a clearer representation of its purpose while naturally linking the product to the beginning of the workweek—a key moment when people organize their priorities. Before becoming a global social media phenomenon, TikTok was known as 'Musical.ly' in markets outside China. When ByteDance acquired Musical.ly in 2018, they merged it with their existing app Douyin and introduced the rebranded version internationally as TikTok. The new name, which is catchy and onomatopoeic, contributed to the app’s rapid rise by making it instantly recognizable and reinforcing its focus on short, time-based content. More recent examples illustrate that rebranding continues to be a significant tool for companies adapting to evolving markets. One of the most high-profile corporate rebrands in recent years was Facebook’s transition to Meta in 2021. This move allowed the company to differentiate its parent entity from its flagship platform while signaling a strategic shift toward building the metaverse. That same year, financial services company Square rebranded as Block, reflecting a shift toward blockchain technology and a broader financial strategy beyond payment processing. The rebrand marked an expansion into various ventures, including Cash App, the music streaming service Tidal, and cryptocurrency-related initiatives. Other companies have also undergone rebrands to clarify their market positioning. In 2022, Indian quick-commerce startup Dunzo adopted the name Dunzo Daily to highlight its focus on everyday essentials and grocery deliveries. Similarly, project management software Clubhouse rebranded as Shortcut in 2021 to distinguish itself from the social audio platform that had gained widespread recognition. SHOW 2025: Exploring the Role of Branding in Tech The SHOW 2025 Brand Tech Summit, set to take place on May 8, 2025, at Cinema City, Israel, will bring together experts in technology branding and marketing. The one-day event will examine the relationship between branding and technological innovation, featuring discussions on how strategic brand positioning influences business growth. In today’s highly competitive market, branding plays a crucial role in determining whether a startup scales into a major player or struggles to gain traction,' said Yariv Amit, the event organizer. 'With thousands of companies offering innovative products, differentiation is essential.' The summit will host a diverse lineup of speakers, including Udi Ledergor, a seasoned B2B marketing leader and former CMO at Gong. Now serving as Chief Evangelist at Gong, Ledergor will deliver the keynote address and present his latest book, 'Courageous Marketing: The B2B Marketer's Playbook for Career Success.' The summit will feature insights from industry experts, including Gary Survis, Operating Partner at Insight Partners, who will discuss 'Branding in the Age of AI,' and Regev Gur, Founder and CEO of Narrative Group, who will examine 'Why Every Tech Company Should Work with Influencers.' Executives from companies such as Wix, Wiz, AppsFlyer, Aleph, Melio, and Overwolf will also share their perspectives on branding strategies and industry trends. The Growing Importance of Branding For early-stage companies operating with limited resources, branding can serve as a powerful tool to compete with more established players and gain visibility in saturated markets. A startup’s brand reflects its identity, values, and the commitment it makes to its customers. In the early stages of a business, a well-defined brand can help build credibility and foster trust—two critical factors in attracting initial users and standing out in a competitive landscape. Strong branding helps businesses establish emotional connections with customers, distinguish themselves from competitors, and maintain a consistent message across different channels. For startups operating on tight budgets, a strategic approach to branding can be especially valuable, as it can drive organic growth and word-of-mouth marketing without requiring significant advertising investments. A well-defined brand identity can also encourage early adopters to become advocates, helping to expand awareness through their networks. Many companies that have undergone successful rebrands demonstrate that adaptation is often essential for growth. As businesses evolve and shift focus, their branding may need to change accordingly. A strong brand identity should also align with the company’s purpose, clearly conveying what it does and the problem it aims to solve. Timing plays a critical role as well—when done at the right moment, rebranding can reinforce new directions and attract media attention, helping companies reposition themselves in competitive markets. Global Participation with Israeli Expertise The event is expected to welcome 600 in-person attendees, including CMOs, brand managers, founders, and technology leaders, with thousands more joining virtually from around the world.

Two Palestinians from Nablus suspected of receiving tens of thous...	Israeli police and the Shin Bet arrested two Palestinian residents of Nablus on suspicion of contacting Hamas operatives abroad to secure funding for terrorist activities in the West Bank, police said on Monday. During the investigation, authorities seized $35,200 and 33,000 shekels. The two suspects, accused of receiving Hamas funds via bank transfers, were arrested and interrogated over the past month. On Sunday, prosecutors filed a statement of intent to indict them on charges including contact with a foreign agent, receiving enemy funds, membership in and activity for a hostile organization, and providing services to such a group.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gewz3sje	2025-03-09T23:14:29-07:00

‘I don't know if they will ever find her’: Murdered female hostag...	Families of Inbar Haiman, Judy Weinstein-Haggai, and Ofra Keidar — murdered on October 7 and still held by Hamas — demand justice and closure as Israel grapples with the ethical and emotional toll of unresolved grief After the conclusion of the first phase of the hostage deal with Hamas, the bodies of three women — Inbar Haiman, Judy Weinstein-Haggai, and Ofra Keidar — are still being held by Hamas in Gaza. The three were murdered by terrorists on October 7 and their bodies were abducted. 'If the situation were different, Inbar would probably be at the forefront of every protest, not resting until all the hostages were returned. She was highly principled, opinionated and deeply compassionate. Her life was filled with action and giving,' said her father, Haim Haiman. ‘Art was her life’ Inbar, who studied visual communication in Haifa, was supposed to complete her studies last year. 'We were invited to the graduate exhibition. There were works by all the graduates, including Inbar, but they left a blank wall for her. Art was her life. She was a nature-loving girl who hiked the Israel National Trail. She must be brought to rest in the land she loved so much,' her father added. The families of Inbar, Judy and Ofra received word that their loved ones had been murdered on October 7, 2023, but Hamas took their bodies to Gaza. 'We are in a sort of limbo,' said Iris Weinstein-Haggai, Judy’s daughter. 'There is no forensic confirmation and the psychological terror in my mind tells me that I can’t be certain of it until she is home. Maybe she is still there, waiting for us to save her? We are stuck between worlds, relying on intelligence reports while envying those who have been able to bury their loved ones.' ‘She was the softest, happiest person’ Judy was murdered after witnessing the murder of her husband, Gadi Haggai. 'It’s hard to separate my mother from my father. She made aliyah to Israel from Canada and fell in love with kibbutz life. She was the softest, happiest person I knew and my moral compass,' Iris said. Judy was a teacher in the Kibbutz Nirim schools and introduced mindfulness techniques into classrooms to help children develop resilience. She had retired and was set to begin her dream job — teaching mindfulness through puppetry — after the Jewish high holidays. 'Every morning, she wrote a haiku poem and posted it on Facebook. Then she and my father would go for a walk in the fields — that’s when they were taken.' ‘The first victim of Kibbutz Be’eri’ Ofra Keidar was also murdered while on her morning walk and is believed to have been the first victim of Kibbutz Be’eri. 'She was just two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the kibbutz,' said her son, Oren. 'The terrorists on motorcycles murdered her even before they reached Be’eri. They likely took her body only on their way back.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I have come to a certain acceptance. I don't know if they will ever find her,' he continued. 'I imagine the moment when the liaison officer will call me and say, ‘Come to the forensic institute, we found your mother.’ But I know there’s a chance we will never recover her body.' Oren believes his mother would have told him to stop dwelling on the past. 'She was a pragmatic woman who didn’t care for sentimentality. She was a dairy farmer for 40 years, working with calves. She wasn’t the type to show affection with hugs and kisses but she did everything for us. 'My sister, Yael, has special needs. Despite doctors saying she would never communicate, my parents refused to accept that. Every week, they took her from Be’eri to Jerusalem for therapy. Now Yael reads, writes and speaks — all because of my mother’s determination.' Even in her final moments, Ofra remained true to herself. 'My brother managed to record her last conversation. She was naïve — she thought they were Bedouins trying to steal. She yelled at them, ‘Enough already, stop it.’ She was in her own world,' Oren said. 'We need to focus on the living before the dead but I fear she will end up like Ron Arad — her burial place unknown.' ‘Holding women’s bodies hostage is inhumane’ Haim Haiman, Inbar’s father, expressed his frustration: 'The fact that Hamas is still holding the bodies of these women is a failure. The fact that there are hostages at all is a failure and after a year and a half, it’s even more so. There are difficulties in implementing the next phase of the deal and I don’t have the answers. 'But my real fear is that Inbar will disappear as time goes on. We will never be able to hold her, to kiss her, to help her heal. All we can hope for is to bring back her body so we can begin our own healing. The sorrow and heartbreak deepen every day. Losing a child is the most painful thing imaginable and it is beyond inhumane when you can’t even bury them.' Iris Weinstein-Haggai shared her anger: 'I’m from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Shiri Bibas (who was murdered in captivity) was my neighbor. It pains me that not all the women were included in the hostage deal. What kind of world are we living in where they keep women’s bodies as bargaining chips? 'I want to be able to visit my mother’s grave on Memorial Day — assuming she really was murdered. My daughter recently asked me, ‘How do you know they’re dead if there’s no grave?’ My mother was a 70-year-old woman who weighed 45 kilograms (99 pounds), the smallest person in the world — and they are keeping her as leverage?' she added. 'The government doesn’t understand how crucial it is to bring back the deceased. It’s convenient for them to ignore 35 missing people that are an entire world in their own right.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjcmtw3j1e	2025-03-09T23:08:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/Sy6MIl2jyx/Sy6MIl2jyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Syria’s Druze seek a place in a changing nation, navigating press...	Members of small religious sect find themselves caught between two forces that many of them distrust: new, Islamist-led government in Damascus and Israel, which used plight of Druze as pretext to intervene in the country Syria’s Druze minority has a long history of cutting their own path to survive among the country’s powerhouses. They are now trying again to navigate a new, uncertain Syria since the fall of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad. Members of the small religious sect find themselves caught between two forces that many of them distrust: the new, Islamist-led government in Damascus and Syria’s hostile neighbor, Israel, which has used the plight of the Druze as a pretext to intervene in the country. Syria’s many religious and ethnic communities are worried over their place in the new system. The transitional government has promised to include them, but has so far kept authority in the hands of the Islamist former insurgents who toppled Assad in December -- Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. That and HTS’s past affiliation with Sunni Muslim extremist al-Qaida, has minorities suspicious. The most explosive hostilities have been with the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad’s family belongs. Heavy clashes erupted this week between armed Assad loyalists and government forces, killing at least 70, in the coastal regions that are the Alawites’ heartland. In contrast, the Druze -- largely centered in southern Syria -- have kept up quiet contacts with the government. Still, tensions have broken out. Last week in Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus with a large Druze population, unknown gunmen killed a member of the government’s security forces, which responded with a wave of arrests in the district. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and military officials weighed in by threatening to send forces to Jaramana to protect the Druze. Druze leaders quickly disavowed the offer. But soon after, someone hung an Israeli flag in Sweida, an overwhelmingly Druze region in southern Syria, prompting residents to quickly tear it down and burn it. Many fear another flare-up is only a matter of time. Multiple Druze armed militias have existed for years, originally set up to protect their communities against Islamic State group fighters and drug smugglers coming in from the eastern desert. They have been reluctant to set down their arms. Recently a new faction, the Sweida Military Council, proclaimed itself, grouping several smaller Druze militias. The result is a cycle of mistrust, where government supporters paint Druze factions as potential separatists or tools of Israel, while government hostility only deepens Druze worries. A struggle to unite a divided country On the outskirts of Sweida, a commander in Liwa al-Jabal, a Druze militia, stood on a rooftop and scanned the hills with binoculars. He spoke by walkie-talkie with a militiaman with an assault rifle below. They were watching for any movement by militants or gangs. 'Our arms are not for expansionist purposes. They’re for self-defense and protection,' said the commander, who asked to be identified only by his nickname Abu Ali for security reasons. 'We have no enemies except those who attack us.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Abu Ali, who is a metal worker as his day job, said most Druze militiamen would merge with a new Syrian army if it’s one that 'protects all Syrians rather than crushes them like the previous regime.' The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981. In Syria, the Druze take pride in their fierce independence. They were heavily involved in revolts against Ottoman and French colonial rule to establish the modern Syrian state. During Syria’s civil war that began in 2011, the Druze were split between supporters of Assad and the opposition. The Sweida region stayed quiet for much of the war, though it erupted with anti-government protests in 2023. Assad reluctantly gave Druze a degree of autonomy, as they wanted to avoid being involved on the frontlines. The Druze were exempted from conscription into the Syrian army and instead set up local armed factions made of workers and farmers to patrol their areas. Druze say they want Syria’s new authorities to include them in a political process to create a secular and democratic state. 'Religion is for God and the state is for all' proclaimed a slogan written on the hood of a vehicle belonging to the Men of Dignity, another Druze militia patrolling the outskirts of Sweida. ‘Being inclusive will not hurt him’ Many Druze quickly rejected Israel’s claims to protect the minority. Hundreds took to the streets in Sweida to protest Netanyahu’s comments. 'We are Arabs, whether he or whether the Lord that created him likes it or not. Syria is free,' said Nabih al-Halabi, a 60-year-old resident of Jaramana. He and others reject accusations that the Druze want partition from Syria. But patience is wearing thin over what many see as arbitrary layoffs of public sector workers, shortage of economic opportunities, and the new authorities’ lack of more than token inclusion of Syrians from minority communities. For the first time, a protest took place in Sweida on Thursday against Damascus’ new authorities. Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive system, but the government is made up mostly of his confidantes. The authorities convened a national dialogue conference last week, inviting Syrians from different communities, but many criticized it as rushed and not really inclusive. 'What we are seeing from the state today, in our opinion, does not achieve the interests of all Syrians,' said retired nurse Nasser Abou-Halam, discussing local politics with other residents in Sweida’s public square where near-daily protests took place. 'It’s a one-color government, with leadership appointed through factions rather than through elections.' Al-Sharaa 'has a big opportunity to be accepted just to be Syrian first and not Islamist first. Being inclusive will not hurt him,' said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat currently based in Washington. 'On the contrary, it will give him more power.' Economic woes shorten the honeymoon Syria’s new leaders have struggled to convince the United States and its allies to lift Assad-era sanctions. Without the lifting of sanctions, it will be impossible for the government to rebuild Syria’s battered infrastructure or win over minority communities, analysts say. 'I’m scared sanctions won’t be lifted and Syria won’t be given the chance,' said Rayyan Maarouf, who heads the activist media collective Suwayda 24. He has just returned to Sweida after fleeing to Europe over a year ago because of his activism. 'Syria could go back to a civil war, and it would be worse than before,' he said. Outside Sweida, Abu Ali was helping train new volunteers for the militia. Still, he said he hopes to be able to lay down his weapons. 'There is no difference between the son of Sweida or Jaramana and those of Homs and Lattakia,' he said. 'People are tired of war and bloodshed … weapons don’t bring modernism.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1bei112sjl	2025-03-09T23:05:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/Hk11656bnikx/Hk11656bnikx_0_185_2880_1622_0_small.jpg
Where Tradition Meets Technology: The Digital Revolution of Synag...	Easyshul is modernizing synagogue management with a comprehensive digital platform, bridging the gap between outdated systems and a modern, intuitive experience that enhances community engagement In collaboration with Easyshul For decades, synagogue administration has relied on outdated software, cumbersome manual tracking, and aging management systems that struggle to keep up with modern demands. Many communities still juggle spreadsheets for membership tracking, event coordination, and donation management—while others rely on legacy platforms that were cutting-edge a decade ago but now feel outdated and inefficient. The need for a more seamless and intuitive solution has been apparent for years, yet few platforms have truly addressed these challenges—until now. What happens when an Israeli startup decides to bring synagogue management into the 21st century? Easyshul is more than just another tech tool—it serves as a bridge between tradition and modernization, proving that even deeply rooted communities can embrace innovation in a natural way. Instead of complex systems requiring extensive training, poor customer service, and exhorbant processing costs, the platform offers an intuitive interface that allows members to pay dues, register for events, and contribute to causes—all without calling the synagogue office. Beyond simplifying administration, Easyshul is reshaping how synagogue communities engage, making participation easier and more accessible for all generations. This shift toward modernization is gaining traction among communities looking for efficient and accessible ways to manage their affairs. More Than Management: Strengthening Community Connections Easyshul, founded in 2022, is an all-in-one platform designed specifically for synagogue management, offering a streamlined approach to membership administration, event coordination, and fundraising. With an intuitive design, Easyshul provides synagogue administrators with tools to manage all these aspects in one centralized system, reducing operational disruptions and minimizing the transition effort for staff. Lior Shabat, co-founder and CEO of Easyshul, leveraged his decade of experience in Israel’s high-tech industry to develop a solution tailored to the specific needs of synagogue administrators. 'We created Easyshul with the goal of making synagogue management more efficient and user-friendly. Conversations with synagogue leaders highlighted the challenges of outdated systems, and we saw an opportunity to provide a more practical and responsive alternative,' said Shabat. 'The platform has helped numerous communities transition seamlessly, whether from legacy software or from managing synagogue affairs manually.' The Changing Face of Synagogue Management Easyshul allows members to manage their personal accounts independently, handling tasks such as paying dues, making donations, registering for events, and enrolling in educational programs. Administrators can efficiently set up and manage events, track attendance, and facilitate contributions toward specific causes or in memory of loved ones. The platform also includes advanced reporting tools and an integrated email and newsletter system, reducing the need for third-party service. Regina Melnik, Synagogue Administrator for Congregation Emanuel of the Hudson Valley, noted, 'Easyshul has been a reliable partner in streamlining our synagogue’s operations. Their team is proactive in addressing our needs and ensuring a smooth user experience. Managing a synagogue requires adaptability, and this platform has provided tools that support our growth and engagement.' With partners across the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand, Easyshul brings modern technology to synagogue communities, combining innovative solutions with a focus on ease of use and responsive support. Easyshul is a cloud-based platform designed to simplify synagogue management through technology-driven solutions.

IDF warns of soldier shortage and extreme burden on troops in com...	With increased deployments, longer rotations, and fewer home leaves, IDF soldiers are expected to endure unprecedented strain as the military struggles to meet growing security demands More strain, more missions, and almost no time off—one of the most alarming failures revealed in investigations of the Oct. 7 terror attack was the IDF General Staff’s decision five years ago to reduce the number of combat troops stationed in security outposts on weekends by half. This move was primarily intended to boost motivation for enlisting in combat units. That decision—recently described by the IDF’s Southern Command as a 'mistake'—came at a heavy price on that tragic Saturday, particularly at sparsely defended outposts like Nahal Oz, where 53 soldiers lost their lives. The reversal of this policy is just the beginning of the military’s desperate effort to cope with an extreme, multi-front burden that is only expected to grow in the coming years—not just for reservists but for regular soldiers as well. The IDF’s Operations Directorate, responsible for force deployment across Israel’s borders and in the West Bank, estimates that Israel is entering a period of manpower shortages not seen since the days of the Security Zone in southern Lebanon, followed shortly by the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. The reason: Israeli policy, shaped by years of deceptive calm, now aims to prevent Hezbollah and Hamas from re-emerging as full-fledged military forces—like they were before the current war. The cost of that effort will be borne by Israeli society. Concern in the IDF General Staff Regular soldiers are already feeling the strain. According to senior officers, the grueling deployment schedule is unlikely to change in the coming years: 17 days on duty, followed by a short three- to four-day leave. That means a brief break for combat troops once every two and a half weeks—at best, once a month if there are no escalations, security alerts, or lockdowns. For the past 15 years, combat troops were able to go home once every two weeks. 'The Israeli public, new recruits, active soldiers, and especially their parents should adjust their expectations—they will see much less of their sons and daughters in the coming years,' the IDF warns. 'Even if prolonged combat in Gaza does not resume and even if fronts like southern Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank remain ‘calm’ as they are now.' Military officials add, 'We are doing everything we can to ease the burden on reservists, who are completely exhausted. But regular combat troops will bear the brunt. We need thousands of soldiers to man the new outposts established inside Lebanese territory, in the Syrian Golan Heights, and along the Gaza Strip’s buffer zone. On top of that, we have doubled the number of regional battalions stationed around Gaza and the Galilee compared to the pre-war period. This new reality will not change in the coming years, even under the most optimistic scenarios.' The IDF General Staff—including newly appointed Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir—is deeply concerned about the severe manpower shortage, while political leaders remain indifferent. More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from IDF service since the war began. According to IDF data, approximately 12,000 soldiers—most of them combat troops—have been killed or wounded since Oct. 7. Additionally, the need for increased border defense and the rapid expansion of armored and engineering brigades have left the IDF with a growing manpower deficit, the burden of which will be felt by both current and future servicemembers through extreme workloads not seen in two decades. Another factor in the manpower shortage is one of Lt. Gen. Zamir’s first decisions: the creation of a new infantry brigade—the first since the 900th battalions were merged into the Kfir Brigade 20 years ago. The IDF currently has five active-duty infantry brigades in addition to Kfir: Nahal, Paratroopers, Golani, and Givati. At least one new engineering battalion will also be established, and tank brigade reconnaissance companies—shut down in the past decade—will be reinstated. These changes will require thousands of additional combat soldiers that the IDF currently lacks, meaning the burden will only increase for existing troops. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: To fill these ranks, the IDF is reaching out to older former combat soldiers in the civilian population, attempting to form new reserve brigades with volunteers aged 40 to 60. Despite high motivation, these units remain understaffed and rely on volunteers with varying levels of fitness and other personal constraints. 'We are stretched to the limit, and every IDF combat soldier feels it already,' officials say. 'Even in basic training, new recruits are affected by the burden. After just two months of infantry training, some platoons are sent to reinforce active units for a week or two, cutting into their own training. The only way to break this cycle is to add forces at an unprecedented scale. The number of rapid-response units—the forces that must be on standby for major incidents—has tripled or quadrupled, and this will not change.' Military sources dismissed claims that the newly formed 'Hasmonean Brigade' is a meaningful solution. 'It’s misleading to present it as a full-fledged ultra-Orthodox combat brigade when, in reality, only one company has been recruited so far. It’s not even a band-aid for the IDF’s combat manpower crisis.' Holding ground instead of raids The challenges are not limited to Gaza, the West Bank, or the northern border. Even soldiers stationed along Israel’s traditionally quieter Arava border, primarily tasked with stopping drug and weapons smuggling from Sinai, describe the hardship of going home just once every two and a half weeks. 'Of our four days off, we lose an entire day traveling home. When we ask to swap leave schedules, commanders agree only if the adjustment results in an even longer stretch of service, sometimes requiring us to serve 21 consecutive days before a break.' However, these extreme conditions might be the best-case scenario. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, a key component of the IDF’s new war plan, developed under Lt. Gen. Zamir, includes permanently holding parts of Gaza—rather than conducting repeated raids, a strategy that has drawn criticism from right-wing circles. A scaled-down version of this 'hold-and-secure' approach is already in place. IDF troops remain stationed along the Philadelphi Corridor near Egypt, and forces have yet to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor in northern Gaza. If the new offensive strategy leads to a permanent military presence in Khan Younis or the outskirts of Gaza City’s Shati and Rimal neighborhoods, the burden on IDF combat personnel will only grow at the expense of essential training for other fronts. One of the IDF Operations Directorate’s strategies for managing the strain is to send entire units on short leave periods of five to seven days, as was done with Givati and Nahal battalions after a month or two of continuous combat in Gaza. While this offers a brief reprieve, it comes only after 50 to 60 days without seeing home, depending on mission intensity. 'Reservists are the first to receive any relief. We’re trying to ensure they don’t serve more than two and a half months in 2025, but many will still be called up for two extended deployments within a year,' IDF sources said. Uncertainty remains over the IDF’s broader plans for Gaza. The political leadership recently authorized another mass call-up of hundreds of thousands of reservists under the open-ended emergency mobilization order. But many reserve commanders have warned officials about the toll this has taken. 'Even with staggered rotations, only 50% to 70% of reservists currently respond to call-ups due to prolonged absences from work, studies, and family life. The strain cannot be eased with money alone. 'For large-scale operations in Gaza, more people might answer the call. But they have already fought there and in Lebanon for months. Family pressures are mounting—everyone is asking, ‘Why can’t someone else do their part?’ This must be factored into future planning, as it will impact force availability for future missions.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvq00uiikg	2025-03-09T22:25:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/yk14287447/yk14287447_0_0_1976_1214_0_small.jpg

Columbia’s antisemitism problem: It’s time to hold universities a...	Comment: Academic freedom cannot thrive where Jewish students’ civil rights are repeatedly violated by anti-American, jihad-supporting radicals Columbia University is once again making headlines for anti-Israel protests, but this time, action is finally being taken. Since October 7, dozens of American campuses have been overrun by Hamas-supporting mobs harassing and even physically assaulting Jewish students. According to U.S. intelligence, many of these campus protests received foreign funding from regimes such as Iran. Hamas itself has praised students engaging in domestic terrorism and displays of anti-American hate, including burning the American flag. This week, students at Columbia not only protested against Israel but also hung flyers stating 'Death to America' and displayed photos of Yahya Sinwar. They blocked campus entrances, prevented students and faculty from attending classes, and barricaded themselves inside a Barnard College building, injuring a staff member. Instead of immediately allowing the NYPD to arrest the protesters, the university delayed action to negotiate—a tactic it has repeatedly used, even as mobs continue to harass Jewish students and make campuses unsafe. Now, the Trump administration is stepping in to hold universities accountable. The U.S. Department of Justice has launched investigations into 10 universities, including Columbia, for failing to protect Jewish students’ rights. Additionally, the administration announced a $400 million cut in contracts and grants to Columbia over its handling of antisemitism. This announcement came just days after the U.S. State Department revoked the first student visa of a foreign pro-Hamas protester. While eliminating foreign subversion on campuses is a challenge, these first steps should be a relief to all students, regardless of political stance. Academic freedom cannot thrive where Jewish students’ civil rights are repeatedly violated by anti-American, jihad-supporting radicals. Those seeking to destroy Israel, the U.S., and American values should not be welcomed on campus, and universities that allow this behavior must be held accountable.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2jbl2syx	2025-03-09T21:03:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/BkRtE600iyl/BkRtE600iyl_0_0_853_481_0_small.jpg
Trump envoy sparks criticism over Hamas talks - and US's new outl...	Following backlash, Adam Boehler posts clarification on social media: 'Hamas is a terrorist organization; No Hamas member will be safe unless it releases all hostages immediately' The U.S. envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, confirmed he had held direct negotiations with senior Hamas officials, sparking criticism from both Israeli officials and former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Israeli cabinet ministers called Boehler’s statements in a series of interviews on Sunday 'unnecessary,' while Friedman sharply condemned the Trump administration official’s actions. Following the backlash, and possibly other reprimands, Boehler posted a clarification on social media: 'I want to be clear because some misunderstood—Hamas is a terrorist organization that has murdered thousands of innocent people. By definition, they are bad actors. As President Trump said, no Hamas member will be safe unless Hamas releases all the hostages immediately.' Friedman, in a separate post, criticized Boehler’s diplomatic approach. 'Over the past week, President Trump brilliantly presented Hamas with a binary choice—release all the hostages and surrender, or be destroyed. That is the only way to end the war,' Friedman wrote. 'If I understood Boehler’s comments today correctly, he took the unprecedented step of meeting with Hamas to explore a third option—whether Hamas could be 'involved' in governing Gaza.' Friedman dismissed any negotiations with Hamas as futile, writing, 'A deal with Hamas is a waste of time and will never hold. Attempting one is beneath the dignity of the United States. Adam, I know you mean well—but listen to your boss. The choice must remain binary.' Meanwhile, the Israeli cabinet convened ahead of a planned delegation trip to Qatar for hostage negotiations. Ministers were briefed on the mission but were not asked to formally approve a mandate. The delegation is expected to explore a framework proposed by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, which includes the release of 10 hostages, including U.S. citizen Idan Alexander, in exchange for a 60-day cease-fire and renewed humanitarian aid to Gaza. Those hostages are reported to be suffering from torture in Hamas captivity. Boehler revealed details of Hamas' proposals during his direct talks, hinting that the U.S. is not ruling out a long-term truce between Hamas and Israel. His statements appeared to partially confirm reports from Israeli sources that negotiations to free American hostages had failed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In an interview with Israel’s Kan News, Boehler said Hamas had offered a deal involving 'the release of all hostages and prisoners, along with a five- to ten-year cease-fire, during which Hamas would disarm, and the U.S., along with other countries, would ensure there are no more tunnels or military activity, and that Hamas would no longer be involved in politics.' He did not rule out the possibility of a hostage release in the near future, saying, 'If I’m optimistic, I’d say weeks.' Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Boehler left open the possibility of further meetings with Hamas, stating that 'something could happen regarding Gaza and the hostages within weeks,' without elaborating. His remarks followed an Israeli official’s assertion that the talks had not yielded progress. Boehler also acknowledged Israel’s frustration over Washington’s contacts with Hamas. 'I understand why the Israelis are upset, but we are the United States—we are not Israel’s agents, and we have our own interests,' he said. He added that his meetings with Hamas representatives had been authorized by President Trump and were 'very useful in advancing the release of the hostages.' During Sunday’s cabinet meeting, several ministers reiterated their criticism of Boehler, arguing that such diplomatic efforts should be coordinated with Israel. However, others downplayed the controversy, saying the focus should be on the upcoming Doha talks based on Witkoff’s framework. The cabinet did not discuss Defense Minister Israel Katz’s proposal to prepare for the relocation of Gaza’s population to a third country. The meeting was also the first attended by new IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir, who was welcomed by ministers and appeared to have good rapport with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, recently removed by Netanyahu as head of Israel’s negotiating team, was absent from the session. During the meeting, Minister for Settlements and National Missions Orit Strock urged Zamir to halt the deployment of female soldiers to guard Hamas prisoners. 'We worked hard to end the practice of female conscripts guarding security prisoners in Israeli prisons,' she told Zamir. 'Now I am asking you personally to stop this intolerable situation.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bksqpfssjl	2025-03-09T14:00:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/rk11B4tooyl/rk11B4tooyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah chief: Reaching Netanyahu's home proves our capabilitie...	In first interview since assuming leadership, Naim Qassem acknowledged security 'flaws' and 'breaches' within the terror group but denied it had been defeated Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem acknowledged security 'flaws' and 'breaches' within the militant group but denied it had been defeated in recent conflicts, saying, 'We reached an agreement, we stopped the fire, and our capabilities remain intact.' In his first interview since assuming leadership in late October following the assassination of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, Qassem spoke to Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar TV on Sunday. Addressing the group's fighters, he urged them to stand firm: 'Just as you have always held your heads high, remain that way. You are Nasrallah’s sons. His funeral was a ‘victory declaration’ in the way we believe. We persisted until the very last moment of securing the agreement.' Qassem expressed gratitude to Iranian, Iraqi, Palestinian, and Yemeni representatives who attended Nasrallah's funeral despite travel restrictions. He also revealed that following Nasrallah’s killing, he had initially asked Hashem Safi al-Din, then head of Hezbollah’s Executive Council, to take over as leader. However, days later, the Israeli military carried out an airstrike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district, killing Safi al-Din as well. 'We are conducting investigations to learn lessons and hold people accountable,' Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah had made 'battlefield adjustments.' He also referenced the drone attack that struck Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea, stating, 'Hezbollah reaching Netanyahu’s home proves our capabilities remain.' Qassem insisted that while Hezbollah had paid a high price, its 'resistance' against Israel would continue. 'We are in a new phase where the fundamental principles remain unchanged, but the methods, tactics, and timing have evolved,' he said. 'We face new equations that will not be dictated by Israel. Let the state seize this opportunity through political action and demonstrate to the world that Israel does not retreat through diplomacy—it retreats through war and resistance. Israel understands only the language of weapons.' Discussing the conflict with Israel, Qassem claimed Hezbollah had the ability to strike 'any target we chose' but had limited its attacks to military objectives 'to deny the enemy an excuse.' He dismissed speculation about secret clauses in the cease-fire agreement, saying, 'The agreement is what was declared and published—there are no hidden terms.' Hezbollah's leader also warned Israel about maintaining a military presence at five strategic locations inside Lebanese territory. 'I say to the Israelis—if you stay in these positions, how long do you think it will last? The resistance will not allow you to remain there,' he said. 'If the occupation persists, the army, the people, and the resistance will confront it. We have no ties to any agreement between the U.S. and Israel.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Qassem described Iran as a 'friendly country' and called for the resumption of flights between Lebanon and Iran, which Israel has sought to limit over concerns about arms and financial transfers to Hezbollah. He also accused the U.S. of interfering in Lebanon’s government appointments, saying, 'We are evaluating how to deal with this intervention.' Addressing the possibility of a regional war involving the U.S. and Iran, Qassem asserted that Iran had the strength, leadership, and decision-making ability to defend itself. 'If the Americans launch a war against Iran, their losses will be significant, and the global consequences will be extraordinary,' he warned. At the end of the interview, Qassem grew emotional as he addressed Hezbollah terrorists and those wounded in recent operations, referring to them as 'our living martyrs.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrd8tjsyg	2025-03-09T13:31:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/02/rJ11ANDsbw0/rJ11ANDsbw0_0_182_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israeli student arrested in Poland for Nazi salute at Auschwitz	High schooler made gesture beneath 'Arbeit Macht Frei' ('Work Sets You Free') sign at entrance to former Nazi camp; he was detained and later released after being fined 1,500 zloty (about $370) A 12th-grade Israeli student was arrested Sunday after performing a Nazi salute at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp during a school trip to Poland. The student, who was visiting the site with his high school delegation from northern Israel, made the gesture beneath the 'Arbeit Macht Frei' ('Work Sets You Free') sign at the entrance to the former Nazi camp. He was detained and later released after being fined 1,500 zloty (about $370). Israel’s Education Ministry said it was treating the incident with 'the utmost severity' and that the student would face disciplinary measures upon returning home. 'This behavior is entirely unacceptable, contradicts the values of Israeli education, and undermines the significance of the trip to Poland,' the ministry said in a statement. The Auschwitz-Birkenau museum condemned the act, calling the Nazi salute a symbol of the antisemitic ideology responsible for the suffering and murder of millions during World War II. 'Committing such an act at the historical site, where Nazi Germany murdered approximately one million Jews, along with tens of thousands of Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war and others, is not only deeply offensive and morally reprehensible but also a violation of the law,' the museum said. Security personnel reported the incident to police, who launched an investigation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The student’s high school said it was addressing the matter internally and that the act did not reflect the values of the institution. The municipality where the school is located said it was also investigating. The student told authorities he had been waving rather than making a Nazi salute. Polish law prohibits the public promotion of Nazi symbols, with violations punishable by up to two years in prison. In January, a Dutch tourist was arrested and fined for performing a Nazi salute at Auschwitz, which she later described as a 'bad joke.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ze4usi1x	2025-03-09T12:13:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/SJqul5MBuJg/SJqul5MBuJg_0_313_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Syria death toll surpasses 1,000 as Alawites bear brunt of regime...	Al-Sharaa's government faces mounting chaos as clashes with Assad loyalists leave over 1,000 dead, including hundreds of Alawite civilians massacred in retaliatory attacks, sparking humanitarian and political crises Syria’s new Islamist-led government, under interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, announced Sunday the formation of what it called an independent investigative committee to examine the recent wave of violence in Alawite-majority coastal regions. Since Thursday, more than 1,300 people have been killed, including at least 830 Alawite civilians who were reportedly executed, according to emerging reports. The remaining fatalities include 481 fighters, both members of al-Sharaa’s security forces and loyalists of the ousted Assad regime. The violence erupted Thursday when Assad loyalists ambushed security forces in Latakia province, prompting fierce retaliation. Eyewitness accounts from the region describe Alawite civilians being rounded up and executed, with gunmen linked to the current government allegedly carrying out summary killings. Arabic media outlets aligned with the former government have reported additional massacres in Alawite villages over the past 24 hours. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that numerous communities near Latakia have lost access to water and electricity due to the ongoing conflict. Clashes have also spread to neighboring Tartus province. A Syrian security official told Reuters that Assad loyalists have targeted infrastructure, including power stations, in an effort to disrupt the government’s hold on the region. Meanwhile, government forces continue searching mountainous areas where an estimated 5,000 Assad loyalists are believed to be hiding. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As the violence escalated, President al-Sharaa sought to distance his administration from the reported massacres, asserting that rogue elements were responsible for civilian deaths. The government acknowledged that the influx of fighters into the region had resulted in human rights violations but insisted it remained committed to protecting all religious and ethnic communities. During dawn prayers at a Damascus mosque on Sunday, al-Sharaa addressed the situation, saying, 'What’s happening in Syria now is part of the expected challenges. We must maintain national unity and civil peace. There’s no threat to the country. We urge Syrians to remain confident that the state has the means to endure. We can live together in this country.' International reactions have been swift. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio strongly condemned the violence, calling on Syrian authorities to prosecute what he termed 'radical Islamist terrorists' responsible for the executions. He reaffirmed Washington’s support for Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy echoed those concerns, calling the reports from Syria’s coastal regions 'horrifying.' The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, urged an immediate end to the killings, warning of ethnic-based executions carried out by multiple actors, including members of both the current and former regimes. Meanwhile, protests erupted in Damascus on Sunday, with demonstrators calling for justice for the Alawite victims. Security forces dispersed the gathering after clashes broke out between protesters and counter-protesters. Some participants demanded accountability for the massacres, while others, aligned with the Islamist-led government, chanted in favor of establishing a Sunni state. Eyewitness accounts from the affected areas describe entire families being executed, homes burned, and bodies left in the streets. A resident of Baniyas told Ynet on Sunday morning that gunmen from the Shaheen Brigades, a drone unit previously used by Syrian rebels, had attacked Alawite villages. 'They’re targeting the villages, burning homes, and killing civilians,' he said. Many Alawites have fled their homes, some seeking refuge at the Russian military base in Hmeimim. Others have attempted to escape to Lebanon, with displaced individuals calling for international intervention. 'We are refugees without a homeland,' said Jafar Ali, a 32-year-old Alawite who fled the violence. 'We need countries to open humanitarian migration channels for Alawites.' The Syrian government has vowed to investigate the massacres and bring those responsible to justice. However, human rights groups have raised concerns about ongoing reprisals, warning that the conflict risks further spiraling into sectarian violence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syb9ugsokx	2025-03-09T11:17:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/HJ2TQ69oyg/HJ2TQ69oyg_1_194_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF appoints new military spokesperson as Hagari closes tenure	Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin is a veteran tank commander who was severely wounded in 2006 Lebanon War; most recently, he served as head of military’s international cooperation unit Two days after effectively dismissing Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari, newly appointed IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir on Sunday named Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin as the next IDF spokesperson. The appointment was approved by Defense Minister Israel Katz. Defrin, a veteran officer, was severely wounded while fighting in the Second Lebanon War’s Battle of Wadi Saluki as a tank battalion commander. Most recently, he served as head of the IDF’s international cooperation unit. He will replace Hagari following a transition period. In a statement, the IDF said Zamir thanked Hagari for his service 'as a combat soldier, commander of the Shayetet 13 naval commando unit, and as IDF spokesperson during the war,' and wished him success in the future. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zamir decided earlier this week that Hagari would not be promoted to major general and would leave the military.

The chief of staff also expressed 'great appreciation' for Hagari’s years of combat service on behalf of Israel. The statement further noted that Hagari 'performed his duties as IDF spokesperson during one of the most complex wars in Israel’s history with professionalism and dedication.'

Mahmoud Khali's lawyer says Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who took him into custody were executing State Department order to revoke his student visa A prominent Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia University’s student encampment movement was arrested Saturday night by federal immigration authorities who claimed they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his green card, according to his attorney. Mahmoud Khalil was at his university-owned apartment blocks from Columbia’s Manhattan campus when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered the building and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told The Associated Press. One of the agents told Greer by phone that they were executing a State Department order to revoke Khalil’s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil, who graduated in December, was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The arrest comes as President Donald Trump vows to deport foreign students and imprison 'agitators' involved in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. The administration has placed particular scrutiny on Columbia, announcing Friday that it would be cutting $400 million in grants and contracts because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. The authorities declined to tell Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, why he was being detained, Greer said. Khalil has since been transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. 'We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,' Greer told The AP. 'This is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.' A spokesperson for Columbia said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property. The spokesperson declined to say if the school had received a warrant for Khalil’s arrest. Messages seeking comment were left with the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Khalil had become one of the most visible faces of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia. As Columbia students erected tents on campus last spring, Khalil was picked to serve as a negotiator on behalf of students and met frequently with university administrators. When classes resumed in September, he told The Associated Press that the protests would continue: 'As long as Columbia continues to invest and to benefit from Israeli apartheid, the students will continue to resist.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxwpssskl	2025-03-09T08:59:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/30/Bk11S11ml8ke/Bk11S11ml8ke_0_95_1417_798_0_small.jpg

They were shattered, terrorized' | New details on gang rape of I...	In brutal attack near Sanapur, Israeli tourist was raped, man was killed, and others were assaulted; survivors describe night of terror, recalling threats, violence, and desperate escape Indian media released additional details Sunday about the gang rape of an Israeli tourist and the deadly assault near the village of Sanapur in Karnataka state. Among the victims were the Israeli woman who was raped, a local guesthouse owner, an American tourist, and a local traveler. A third man who was with the group drowned after the attackers threw him and his companions into a canal. According to the police complaint, the assailants threatened to crush the heads of the three men with stones before throwing them into the water and raping the two women. In the canal, American tourist Daniel Pittas managed to grab the hand of Pankaj Amrit Rao Patil, and despite the strong current, he swam with him to the shore. The third man, identified as a traveler named Bibash, was swept downstream. The survivors only saw his broken watch floating on the water. They returned to the spot where they had been attacked and found the two women. 'They were devastated, crying, with terror on their faces,' one of the survivors recalled. The group then made their way back to the guesthouse and later filed a complaint with the police. Attack began with a request for fuel The guesthouse owner, who also reported the attack to police, described the events leading up to the assault. 'After dinner, we decided to go stargazing. We rode our scooters to the banks of the Tungabhadra Canal, near Sanapur Lake. As we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, around 10:30 p.m., three men on a motorcycle approached us and asked for fuel,' she said. She told them that there was no gas station nearby and suggested they find fuel in Sanapur. According to her testimony, one of the men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. 'They didn’t know us, so I told them I had no money. But they kept demanding, until one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.' When the travelers refused to give them more money, the suspects began arguing and threatening them with stones. Two of them then attacked and raped the women, while the third pushed the men into the canal and assaulted the guesthouse owner with stones. 'I was bleeding heavily. Two of the suspects dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them choked me and removed my clothes. One after the other, they beat me and raped me,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The attackers stole her bag and fled with two mobile phones and 9,500 rupees. One of the men dragged the Israeli tourist away and raped her as well. 'When we screamed and cried, they fled on their motorcycle,' she recounted. Survivors recovering in hospital Ruth Korczak, an Israeli traveler in southern India, visited the hospital where the four survivors were treated. Speaking to ynet, she said she knows one of the surviving men. 'I got a call from him and went to visit him at the hospital. The two men who survived are doing okay—I saw them myself. I can’t share their personal experiences because they specifically asked me not to, but as has been reported, they were hit with stones, pushed into the canal, and that was it. They still haven’t fully processed what happened.' Regarding the Israeli woman’s condition, Korczak said: 'I can’t say anything about her. She’s okay. She’s in contact with the consulate, and they’re taking care of her.' Asked if arrangements were being made to return her to Israel, she replied: 'I can’t say.' Korczak added that despite the attack, she and other travelers still feel safe in the area. 'We had a tough day, but the sense of security returned quickly. We’ve heard a lot about what happened, including a lot of nonsense on social media about women traveling in India. The reactions have gotten out of control. That’s why it’s important for us to say that we feel safe here. Bad things can happen anywhere.' Another traveler, Hannah Bella, addressed suggestions that women in India should always be accompanied by men. 'They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We have amazing Indian friends here,' she said. Korczak agreed, adding: 'This is a very safe place. The only takeaway is not to wander around late at night, just like I wouldn’t do in certain places back home. This was an area with no cell reception.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryoekrijyg	2025-03-09T08:47:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/Syl9CzSqsJg/Syl9CzSqsJg_1_89_800_451_0_small.jpg
Turkey blocks Israel from NATO execise: 'Wielding veto as politic...	Decision follows meeting between Israeli diplomats and defense alliance representatives, during which to there was strong enthusiasm for Jerusalem's participation Turkey has blocked Israel from taking part in NATO’s annual exercise on 'resilience and emergency preparedness,' according to reports received by Israel’s Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem on Sunday. The decision follows a meeting about two weeks ago between Israeli diplomats, NATO’s coordinating team for the drill, and Bulgaria’s delegation to the alliance. During the meeting, there was reportedly strong enthusiasm for Israel’s participation. Turkey’s move could derail Israel’s involvement in the exercise. NATO decisions require consensus, and without an active partnership agreement, there is no bureaucratic mechanism to compel Turkey to allow Israel to participate in the alliance’s official activities. NATO currently has 32 member states from North America and Europe. An Israeli official accused Turkey of using its veto power as a political tool. 'Turkey’s position undermines regional cooperation and NATO’s ability to address global challenges,' the official said. 'Instead of promoting unity and collective security, Turkey is wielding its veto in a way that harms strategic partnerships. Blocking Israel’s cooperation with NATO does not contribute to stability; rather, it undermines the alliance’s core values.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Turkey has consistently blocked NATO-Israel cooperation, arguing that the alliance should not engage with Israel until the conflict ends. In the past, Ankara unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Israel from obtaining observer status in NATO but withdrew its opposition following a brief diplomatic reconciliation between the two countries. Turkey has since vetoed all NATO interactions with Israel, including meetings and joint exercises. At NATO’s summit in July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the alliance 'cannot continue its partnership with the Israeli government.' In response, then-Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on NATO to expel Turkey after Erdoğan hinted at possible military action against Israel. Turkish officials have argued that Israel’s actions in Gaza violate NATO’s fundamental principles, international law, and universal human rights. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj6nseisyg	2025-03-09T08:14:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/HJ4i3XEQ1l/HJ4i3XEQ1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

During the meeting, there was significant enthusiasm for Israel’s participation, the reports said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkm654ii1x	2025-03-09T08:01:27-07:00

Israel orders immediate cutoff of electricity to Gaza amid stalle...	Senior official says that cutting off water supply to is also under consideration as part of 'tool kit' to push Hamas into agreement Energy Minister and Cabinet member Eli Cohen has signed an order to immediately halt the supply of electricity to the Gaza Strip. 'In accordance with my authority, I am instructing the Israel Electric Corporation to stop the transfer of electricity to Gaza,' Cohen wrote in his directive. His decision was made independently and was not based on a government or cabinet resolution. A senior Israeli official said that cutting off water supply to Gaza is also under consideration. 'As part of Israel’s toolbox, severing water pipelines to Gaza is on the table. The first pipeline to be cut would be the one supplying northern Gaza, but no decision has been made yet,' the official said. At the outset of the war, Israel announced it would cease supplying electricity to Gaza. However, under pressure from the United States and European countries, the supply initially continued. The Gaza Electricity Company had previously extended cables along Salah al-Din Street to directly power a desalination and wastewater treatment facility west of Deir al-Balah using electricity from Israel. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7, Israel has not supplied electricity to Gaza, except for one line—known as the Qalaa line—which directly powers desalination facilities. At the beginning of the war, approximately 10 power lines from Israel supplied Gaza, but most were subsequently disabled. Aside from the single remaining Israeli power line, Hamas has relied on generators to provide electricity to residents. Gaza’s power plant ceased operations early in the war. If Hamas runs out of fuel—following Israel’s recent decision to halt humanitarian aid deliveries and close border crossings—it will no longer be able to operate the generators. International aid organizations estimate that Hamas has enough fuel to run generators for approximately 45 more days. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Israeli military has recently stated that maintaining the Qalaa power line was necessary to prevent the spread of disease, which could endanger both hostages and soldiers operating in the area. However, Cohen has now ordered a complete halt to the transfer of electricity. Last week, the municipality of Deir al-Balah announced that Israel had cut off electricity to two desalination plants that supply 70% of the city’s water needs. Israeli officials, however, stated that there had been no deliberate cutoff and that a local malfunction had disrupted supply. They said repairs had not yet been approved due to ongoing military operations in the area. The Israel Defense Forces previously justified supplying electricity to the desalination plant last summer, explaining that it provided drinking water to displaced residents in Mawasi, Khan Younis, and Deir al-Balah before the withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor as part of a cease-fire arrangement. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had opposed the electricity supply to Gaza, criticizing infrastructure repairs six months ago. 'We have completely lost our minds. We are rehabilitating Gaza with our own hands before its demilitarization—especially its hospitals, which serve as terror hubs,' he said at the time. 'Prime Minister, stop this folly. This time, no one will be able to say we didn’t know.' Last week, following Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid to Gaza, Smotrich welcomed the move. 'This is a step in the right direction, and I can assure you it is only the beginning,' he said. 'We are closing the gates of paradise and preparing to open the gates of hell. The next step will be cutting off electricity and water, followed by an intense, deadly, and rapid attack that will lead to the conquest of the territory and the implementation of the Trump plan to encourage emigration from Gaza.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hychq4js1g	2025-03-09T07:34:57-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/Bk27frvqJx/Bk27frvqJx_0_223_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Trump envoy says hostage talks with Hamas were 'very helpful'	POTUS' special hostage envoy says that he believes something could come together on Gaza within weeks; 'probably all the hostages are going to be released, not only Americans' U.S. President Donald Trump's hostage envoy Adam Boehler said on Sunday that American meetings with Hamas on the release of hostages held in Gaza were 'very helpful' and he did not rule out additional encounters with the Palestinian terror group. Boehler said in an interview on NBC's 'Meet the Press' that he believed something could come together on Gaza within weeks, but did not elaborate. However, he did note that 'probably all the hostages are going to be released, not only Americans.' His remarks came after an unnamed senior Israeli official claimed earlier in the day that no progress had been made in the negotiations. Boehler, who has been leading direct U.S. engagement with Hamas, also addressed Israeli frustration over Washington’s decision to hold these talks. While acknowledging Israeli concerns, he stressed that the United States was acting in its own interests and was not an agent of Israel. He said the meetings had been authorized by President Donald Trump and were focused on advancing the release of hostages. Israeli officials who spoke with American counterparts said Washington was 'shocked' by Israel’s opposition to the discussions with Hamas, particularly by alleged attempts to create tensions between Boehler and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. According to American sources, Boehler was working under Witkoff’s direction, with all actions taken in coordination with him and with the approval of President Trump. They rejected claims of a 'good cop, bad cop' approach, insisting that U.S. efforts were fully coordinated. Israel’s Security Cabinet was set to meet later Sunday to finalize the mandate for a delegation traveling to Doha, Qatar, on Monday to engage in hostage negotiations. The delegation will be led by a senior Shin Bet official, along with Israel’s Coordinator for Hostages and Missing Persons Gal Hirsch, Dr. Ofir Falk, and representatives from the Mossad and Shin Bet. U.S. envoy Witkoff is also scheduled to arrive in Doha on Tuesday to assist in the discussions. Israeli officials said the delegation would remain in Qatar for two days, where it would discuss the 'Witkoff framework.' Officials suggested that flexibility could be possible if the talks showed signs of progress. The U.S. is focused on securing the release of 10 living hostages in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire and renewed humanitarian aid, according to a source familiar with the discussions. One proposal under consideration is prioritizing the release of hostages suffering from torture or those in urgent medical need. Meanwhile, Hamas official Taher al-Nunu confirmed to Reuters that the group’s leaders had held multiple meetings with Boehler as part of direct U.S.-Hamas contacts. However, prior to Boehler’s remarks, an Israeli official had stated that no progress had been made in the discussions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas also announced that a delegation led by senior official Mohammad Darwish met in Cairo with Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad to discuss key issues. An internal Israeli government memo sent to ministers reiterated that Israel would not accept any arrangement for Gaza that did not align with the war’s objectives: the return of all hostages, the dismantling of Hamas' military and governing capabilities, and the removal of the terrorist threat to Israeli citizens. The memo also stated that Israel retained the option to resume intense military operations if negotiations proved ineffective, noting that this position had been supported by both the previous and current U.S. administrations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ouiqjojl	2025-03-09T06:48:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/H1qEPMdiJl/H1qEPMdiJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

I don't need the publicity': The Haredi businessman who gave Emi...	Shai Graucher, inspired by his late father’s charity work, unites wealthy US donors and Israeli war victims through lavish gifts, viral acts of kindness and a mission to showcase Jewish unity amid tragedy 'We came to offer support, but I feel like they’re the ones giving us strength,' a young ultra-Orthodox man told former hostages Keith and Aviva Siegel. The couple described the harsh reality of captivity in Gaza and their growing connection to religion. In another video, the same man is seen with IDF lookout Liri Albag, who teaches him how to make a precise heart shape with his hands. In another clip, he presents Emily Damari with a new luxury BMW, donated by a U.S. Jewish community. His name is Shai Graucher, an Israeli businessman whose phone number has been in high demand among soldiers, commanders and evacuees since the war began, as they seek assistance in securing supplies such as coats, generators, phones and chargers. Now, Graucher is visiting former hostages and their families, offering them encouragement and gifts — laptops, smartwatches, high-end headphones and approximately $10,000 in cash. Some of these meetings were documented and went viral online, even making it to news broadcasts. Others were kept private at the request of the hostages or bereaved families. Graucher sees his work not only as charity but as a mission — to show 'the beautiful face of the Jewish people.' 'At my father’s funeral, I made a commitment without realizing what I was predicting,' said Graucher, who leads a charity movement under the Klal Yisrael – Chesed v’Rachamim organization. 'I promised to continue my father’s path of giving. I knew I wanted to carry on his work, to care for widows and orphans. I was in a deep depression and this is what brought me back to life —continuing his legacy. 'After he passed, we learned how much he did for families, things that no words can describe. I didn’t leave the house after he died, but when the war started, I realized I needed to act and do good again.' Graucher’s father, David 'Dedi' Graucher, was a well-known singer in the ultra-Orthodox community, famous for his religious music hits and his ability to connect donors with major charitable initiatives. He was deeply involved in helping orphans and widows. He died three weeks before the October 7 massacre, and his son, who had considered following in his footsteps, suddenly saw the need for this work at an unprecedented level. Inspiring others to give Graucher, 35, lives in Jerusalem with his wife and five children. He studied at the Nehora and Derech Chochma yeshivas. He runs a VIP travel agency catering to wealthy Jewish clients in the U.S., through which he has built relationships with the upper echelons of American Jewish communities. Beyond business, he connects them to social, Zionist and volunteer initiatives in Israel. 'I have a VIP travel agency. My clients are extremely wealthy U.S. Jews traveling to Israel for vacations, family visits or events. They usually send me a WhatsApp message with their needs, and then don’t have to worry about a thing,' he explained. 'I arrange their first-class flights, transportation, hotels, attractions, private chefs, babysitters — everything they need.' Six years in the industry allowed him to form deep connections. He frequently travels to clients’ celebrations and meetings in the U.S. and hosts them when they visit Israel. 'On October 7, it was Simchat Torah. Many of my clients and acquaintances were in Israel for the holidays. After experiencing the massacre firsthand, they felt uncomfortable returning home without contributing. 'Some left me checks for $50,000 or $100,000, asking me to put the funds toward the war effort. That’s how we started — by providing equipment for soldiers, helping evacuees and addressing urgent needs.' Did this effort begin on October 7? 'No. People don’t realize that Klal Yisrael — the organization that scaled up our wartime efforts — started back in 2017. A few families banded together to support terror victims, civilians and soldiers, giving each family $10,000 and essential supplies. We also provided food baskets to the needy, medical treatments — whatever we could to help. 'Everything was done quietly, away from the cameras. Since the war started, our efforts have expanded dramatically. We’ve visited 970 bereaved families since October 7, going door to door, offering financial support and gifts to those who lost loved ones to terror and war.' Some critics on social media question why you document and publicize donations instead of keeping them private. Does this concern you? 'First, we never make donations conditional on filming or publicity. But we realized that when families agree, documenting these moments has value. 'The main goal is to show national unity. As a Haredi man visiting families from all sectors of Israeli society — especially after the divisiveness before October 7 — I wanted to demonstrate that we can put our differences aside and support one another. We must unite as one people. That’s why we started this movement on October 8.' He added, 'There’s another important aspect. Before the war, donors would sometimes contribute large sums and later say, ‘We never saw where the money went.’ By documenting and sharing, they see their contributions making an impact — bringing joy to someone, helping someone in need. That motivates them to keep donating and inspires others to give as well.' Closing the circle Inspiration can come from unexpected places. 'A few months ago, a girl preparing for her bat mitzvah saw our videos online and got an idea,' he recalled. 'She told her father she didn’t want a big party with friends and family in a hall. Instead, she wanted to donate the money and buy iPhones for soldiers.' 'A year ago, she reached out and said, ‘I want to distribute iPhones with Shai.’ We went together, handed them out and she was thrilled. Believe me, I don’t need fame. I was close to Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, my father was famous — I don’t need the publicity.' Graucher often finds himself finding closures. 'Yonatan Azulay, the best friend of Eliya Cohen — who was recently freed from captivity — was murdered at the Nova music festival massacre. We visited his family to see if they needed anything. We were at their shiva and his mother, Linda, told an incredible story,' he recounted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'She was widowed 18 years ago when her husband died of illness. Her brother was [Benjamin] Netanyahu’s driver and my father sent money through him to help her after she became a widow. My father was even investigated over this, which pained him deeply because he was just trying to do good. But we never knew the full story.' The bereaved mother shared that her son, Yonatan, had always wanted to donate a Torah scroll in memory of his late father. 'She told me this on the 30th day after his passing and they had a Torah scroll in their name within 48 hours,' Graucher said. 'We offered them gifts — AirPods, a laptop — but they wanted only one thing: a Torah scroll.' He recounted other emotional moments: 'We took freed hostages and their families to Ramat Aviv Mall for a private shopping experience. We closed down the stores after hours, so they had it to themselves, letting them pick out clothes and shoes.' 'We covered half a million shekels’ worth of purchases ($137,784). Our goal is to spread joy, to connect these generous American donors with Israeli society and to show how much kindness and unity exist within our people.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bjgvnyjjjg	2025-03-09T05:25:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/ryz2iI9cke/ryz2iI9cke_0_330_961_540_0_small.jpg

Settler leader meets Trump’s senior Arab and Middle Eastern affai...	Samaria Council head Yossi Dagan met Massad Boulos, Trump’s senior Middle East advisor, in Washington; Dagan presented Boulos with symbolic gifts, including wine honoring Trump’s inauguration As leaders of the settler movement await statements from the Trump administration regarding the West Bank, they have intensified efforts to promote their agenda and strengthen ties with the administration. Massad Boulos, the Lebanese-American father-in-law of President Donald Trump's daughter and one of his closest advisers, held an extended meeting with Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council, at Boulos’ home in Washington. Details of the meeting were first posted on Dagan’s Facebook page. The meeting was part of a series of discussions Dagan and his team are currently conducting in Washington. Their goal is to build coalitions in support of settlement activity in the West Bank and to educate and promote understanding within the Trump administration, Congress and the Senate about the importance of applying sovereignty to the West Bank now. Boulos, an American businessman of Lebanese descent, is considered one of Trump’s closest allies and serves as his senior adviser on Middle East affairs. During the meeting, Dagan presented Boulos with the official Samaria medal and a bottle of Trump Victory wine, a special edition produced by the Kabir Winery in the West Bank town of Elon Moreh to commemorate Trump’s inauguration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Boulos expressed his gratitude, saying: 'It is a pleasure to convey my appreciation to the people of the West Bank through you. To my brothers and sisters in Israel and Lebanon, we look forward to peace and yearn for it, and with God’s help, we hope it will come soon. I deeply appreciate this gesture.' Dagan responded: 'I believe and know that the Creator has sent us to work together for the future of the Middle East and the world. Especially after October 7, we are united and will continue to work together.' Dagan also conveyed a message of appreciation to Trump. 'For everything you and your team are doing together — your policies for the security of Israel and the United States and for restoring justice in the world. In Israel, we feel toward you, and especially toward President Trump, like family. May God bless you,' Dagan said. Massad Boulos’ son, Michael, married Trump's daughter Tiffany in November 2022. During Trump’s 2024 election campaign, Michael Boulos led outreach efforts to the Arab-American community in key states such as Michigan, significantly contributing to garnering support among Arab-Americans. Following Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Trump announced Massad Boulos’ appointment as his senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Following Trump’s inauguration, Dagan established a Congressional caucus in Washington to promote the West Bank. The caucus, which includes over 20 members of Congress, aims to advance Israeli sovereignty in the area. The caucus’s first initiative was a bill, introduced by Congresswoman Claudia Tenney, its chair, declaring that official U.S. documents should no longer refer to the area as the 'West Bank' but instead call it by its biblical names. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjw6q05okg	2025-03-09T01:34:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/ryenQ2cokg/ryenQ2cokg_0_103_1230_693_0_small.jpg

As Israel imposes blockade on Gaza, Houthis threaten another agai...	Gaza remains under Israeli blockade, prompting the Houthis to escalate threats in the Red Sea; Responding to Hamas’ request, Yemeni rebels warn of renewed naval blockades and missile fire, testing Israel and US coordination as regional tensions mount Over the past week, Houthis have shifted gears when it comes to threats against Israel, both by renewing missile fire toward Israeli territory and by resuming naval actions against both Israel and the United States. According to information received by officials in Jerusalem, Hamas asked the Houthis in Yemen to renew the maritime blockade on Israel 'as a means of applying pressure to prevent a return to fighting.' In his latest weekly speech, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi declared the 'resumption of naval actions against Israeli vessels' unless humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza are restored within four days. Similar threats were made by senior Houthi officials last month, stating that if cease-fires in Gaza or Lebanon collapse, missile fire from Yemen would resume. This is likely a request from the terror organization, which from the start of the war aimed to unite the various fronts so that Israel's enemies in the region would act against it simultaneously. In response, Israel is preparing for the possibility that the ultimatum will indeed be carried out, implying the renewal of the Houthis’ naval blockade. The possibility of resuming missile fire from Yemen is also being considered. Israel has emphasized that there is close coordination with U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in anticipation of such scenarios, and Israeli officials are counting on a 'harsher response' from the United States against the Houthis than what was seen during Biden's administration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During his first month in office, President Donald Trump designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization and imposed sanctions on senior Houthi officials. Israel, for its part, has attacked the Houthis in Yemen five times during the ongoing war. Despite the significant destruction inflicted on several of their key assets, the Houthis are now threatening a 'second round' of confrontation. The last Israeli attack in Yemen occurred on January 10, 10 days before the second Trump presidency was ushered in. The first attack, carried out in Operation Long Arm, occurred on July 20 of the previous year, followed by attacks on September 29, during Operation White City on December 19, and during Operation 'Sounds of the Vineyard' on December 26.

The presidents of Israel’s eight research universities issued a stark warning against the potential dismissal of Attorney Genera Gali Baharav-Miara on Sunday, calling it an 'unprecedented threat to the rule of law.' In a joint statement, they declared they would resign and organize public demonstrations if Baharav-Miara is removed from her post. 'The Attorney General serves as the most critical safeguard in Israel’s democratic system, protecting citizens’ rights and individual freedoms from potential government overreach,' the statement read. 'Her dismissal would erode this vital barrier.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byg69a9ije	2025-03-09T00:10:53-08:00

Trump fully supports Israel in doing whatever necessary to elimi...	Trump’s ultimatum to Hamas sparks fears of renewed war while Israel mobilizes troops and Hamas refuses to disarm amid stalled hostage negotiations; Israel increases pressure on Hamas potentially leading to a full resumption of hostilities After U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to Hamas if the terror group does not release Israeli hostages, a senior American official said Sunday, 'He [Trump] wants all the hostages released immediately. If that doesn't happen, President Trump fully supports Israel in doing whatever is necessary to eliminate Hamas and bring the hostages home.' Meanwhile, Hamas announced that a delegation led by its senior official Muhammad Darwish met Egyptian General Intelligence Service chief Hassan Rashad in Cairo to discuss the cease-fire agreement, hostage releases and displacement plans. According to Hamas, the delegation stressed the need to adhere to the agreement’s terms and called for 'immediate negotiations on the deal’s second phase, the reopening of border crossings and the unrestricted entry of aid into Gaza.' The Prime Minister’s Office announced that an Israeli delegation will travel to Doha on Monday to advance hostage negotiations, responding to an invitation from mediators Egypt and Qatar, with U.S. backing. The delegation will include senior Shin Bet official 'M.,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s political advisor Ophir Falk, hostage coordinator Gal Hirsch and officials from the IDF and Mossad. The announcement followed a security assessment led by Netanyahu amid concerns over the direct U.S.-Hamas negotiations. On Saturday, Al-Arabiya reported an agreement to extend the temporary cease-fire throughout Ramadan, but both Israel and Hamas denied the claim. Later, Saudi network Al-Hadath reported, 'Hamas has agreed in principle to extend the first phase (cease-fire and gradual hostage releases) by two months and to release live soldiers.' The report has not been officially confirmed. Israel has devised a series of escalating measures to increase pressure on Hamas, potentially leading to a full resumption of hostilities if the terror group does not return the remaining 59 hostages. The Wall Street Journal reported the measures began last week with a halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza. A source familiar with the plan said that if Hamas fails to release more hostages, Israel may escalate to renewed airstrikes and tactical raids, followed by the potential evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Gazans who returned to northern Gaza during the cease-fire. According to sources familiar with the military plan, 'Israel may ultimately re-enter Gaza with a larger force than before, aiming to seize and hold territory while eliminating Hamas remnants.' U.S. officials have similarly assessed that if Israel resumes combat operations, it will do so 'more forcefully and decisively,' aligning with Trump’s warnings. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At present, renewed fighting appears almost inevitable — Hamas has conditioned the return of all 59 hostages on a permanent end to the war, while Israel insists that Hamas must disarm and relinquish control of Gaza, which the terror group has so far refused to do. The government maintains that there will be no commitment to ending the war as long as Hamas remains in control. On his first day as IDF chief of staff last week, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir approved offensive plans for the IDF Southern Command in preparation for a potential resumption of fighting. Hamas, meanwhile, has been preparing for renewed conflict during the cease-fire. The IDF has warned decisionmakers that any new offensive in Gaza will face constraints — not just in troop numbers but also in areas where operations could be hindered by the presence of hostages. Several IDF divisions, including reserve brigades, have been preparing for a ground assault in Gaza, supported by intensive aerial bombardments. Reports indicate that Hamas has strengthened its military readiness in recent weeks, fortifying explosive-rigged zones, redeploying thousands of terrorists in Gaza City, repositioning rocket launchers and reorganizing combat units into platoons and battalions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjioa35jjx	2025-03-08T23:05:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/SkOwYVqoJe/SkOwYVqoJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

According to authorities, the lion cub was discovered in the village of Bir Haddaj, while one monkey was found inside a school in Tel Sheva and the second in a scattered settlement near Be'er Sheva.

While negotiating cease-fire: Qatar demands IAEA oversight of Isr...	Doha pressures international bodies during IAEA governors meeting to enforce nuclear transparency on Israel and for Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons amid escalating Middle East tensions Qatar issued an unusual statement calling for all of Israel’s nuclear facilities to be placed under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supervision. Qatar’s Foreign Ministry on Saturday night urged for 'greater international efforts to bring all Israeli nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards,' and for Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). According to the statement, Qatar’s ambassador to Austria, Jassim Yacoub Al-Hammadi — who also serves as the country's permanent representative to UN offices in Vienna — made the remarks during an IAEA Board of Governors meeting in the Austrian capital. The meeting addressed 'the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel’s nuclear capabilities.' 'The ambassador stressed the need for the international community and its institutions to uphold their obligations under UN Security Council resolutions, the UN General Assembly, the IAEA and the 1995 NPT Review Conference, which called on Israel to place all its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards,' Qatar’s foreign ministry said. 'He noted that some of these resolutions explicitly urged Israel to join the NPT as a non-nuclear state.' Al-Hammadi also said that 'every Middle Eastern country except Israel' is a party to the NPT and has effective safeguard agreements with the IAEA. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He accused Israel of maintaining 'an aggressive policy,' citing 'growing calls for the forced displacement of the Palestinian people, increased military operations against cities and refugee camps in the West Bank, obstruction of humanitarian aid to Gaza and continued restrictions on UNRWA’s operations.' Doha also announced last week that it submitted a written memorandum to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding a request for an advisory opinion based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 19, 2024. 'The request seeks clarification on Israel’s obligations regarding UN activities, international organizations, and third-party entities,' the statement read. The memorandum affirmed Israel’s duty to allow UN and international organizations —especially UNRWA and humanitarian agencies — to operate in Israel and the 'occupied Palestinian territories.' It also called on Israel to respect and protect UN and international property, including schools, medical facilities, transportation infrastructure and water resources, as well as the personnel working in them. 'Al-Hammadi stressed the urgency for the international community and its institutions to take decisive action to compel Israel to implement international resolutions, recognize the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and statehood, restore security and stability in the Middle East and prevent further global risks,' the Qatari statement concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1jym39sjx	2025-03-08T21:58:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/29/Sykhaa4Sa/Sykhaa4Sa_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The gang rape of an Israeli woman and India's fight against sexua...	Indian authorities confirm new details in the gang rape of an Israeli woman and a guesthouse owner in Karnataka region; Two suspects confessed, saying they were drunk during the attack, while a third suspect remains at large as investigations continue; State official: 'The horrific attack and rape of an Israeli citizen and a guesthouse owner are heinous crimes' On Saturday, Indian media widely covered the report of the gang rape of an Israeli woman and a local guesthouse owner, noting the date of the incident — International Women’s Day. The gang rape was also reported by leading global news agencies, including AP and Reuters, as well as major British outlets such as BBC, Sky News, and The Guardian. The incident occurred near the village of Sanapur in the Karnataka state. The two women were traveling with three tourists — two Americans and one Indian — who were thrown into a canal by the attackers before the women were assaulted. Two of the men were injured but managed to swim out, while the third drowned, and his body was found Saturday morning. Two suspects, aged 21 and 22, have been arrested, and a manhunt for the third suspect is ongoing. Indian media reported that two of the suspects raped the guesthouse owner, while the third raped the Israeli tourist. According to the reports, the victims — who had gone stargazing near the canal in the Hampi area — did not know each other beforehand and had met at the guesthouse. Hampi is a town in Karnataka, and some of its areas, including ancient temples, are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Many Israelis visit the area. Crimes against women in India garnered worldwide headlines last year after a junior doctor in a public hospital was raped and murdered. That case led to massive protests by doctors and strikes in protest of inadequate security measures, but gang rape incidents have been happening in India for quite a while. In 2016, a 25-yea-old Israeli woman travelling in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, was gang raped after a car with six men in it offered her a ride. According to official Indian data, in 2022, 31,516 rape complaints were filed with the police, a 20% increase compared to 2021. However, it is estimated that the actual numbers are much higher because many rapes and other acts of violence go unreported due to a lack of trust in the police and the social stigma still often attached to sexually assaulted women. Siddaramaiah, the chief minister of Karnataka, who effectively leads the state, addressed the rape in Hampi, saying: 'The horrific attack and rape of an Israeli citizen and a guesthouse owner are heinous crimes. As soon as the incident was reported, I instructed the police to take immediate action, conduct a thorough investigation, and quickly apprehend the culprits. The police have already arrested two suspects and are continuing the investigation. Our government is committed to ensuring the safety of every individual, including tourists. We will take all necessary measures to prevent such incidents from recurring.' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not refer to the case directly, but in his speech yesterday on International Women’s Day, he emphasized the importance his government places on protecting women. 'When a daughter comes home late, her parents ask questions. But they do not ask similar questions when a son comes home late. Over the past decade, we have prioritized women's safety and security. To stop crimes against women, we have changed laws and established the death penalty for heinous acts like rape,' he said. The full and disturbing testimony of the guesthouse owner, who was raped and filed a complaint with the police, was revealed Saturday. This is how she described the incident: 'After dinner, we decided to go stargazing. We rode scooters to the banks of the Tungabhadra canal near Sanapur Lake. While we were stargazing and playing the guitar, around 10:30 p.m., three men on a motorcycle approached us and asked for fuel.' She told them there was no nearby gas station and that they could find fuel in Sanapur. According to her testimony, one of the men suddenly demanded 100 rupees (less than $2): 'They didn’t know us, so I told them I didn’t have any money. But they kept demanding and demanding until one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to her, when the tourists refused to give them more money, the suspects began arguing with them and threatening them with stones. Two of the men attacked and raped the women, while the third pushed the male tourists into the canal and hit them with stones. 'I was bleeding heavily. Two of the attackers joined forces and dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them strangled me and removed my clothes. One after another, they beat me and raped me.' She recounted that the attackers stole her bag and fled with two mobile phones and 9,500 rupees. One of the suspects dragged the Israeli tourist and raped her. 'When we screamed and cried, the three fled on their motorcycle,' said the guesthouse owner. Two of the suspects have been arrested and are charged with gang rape, extortion, and attempted murder. According to the police, the two detainees confessed to the rape and said they had consumed alcohol at a bar before the incident. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk00fas9oyg	2025-03-08T21:42:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/Syl9CzSqsJg/Syl9CzSqsJg_147_91_654_368_0_small.jpg

Man who climbed London's Big Ben to support Palestinians comes do...	He climbed barefoot carrying a Palestinian flag and refused to come down, even after rescuers went up with a crane and tried to convince him; He filmed himself and posted a video on Instagram: 'stop weapons from being sent to the terrorist state of Israel'; Eyewitnesses were amazed, saying he looked 'like Spiderman' A man who scaled the lower sections of Big Ben's Elizabeth Tower at London's Palace of Westminster early on Saturday has came down after 16 hours and was subsequently arrested, the British police said on Sunday. He was waving a Palestinian flag and shouted 'free Palestine,' according to British media. 'We worked with other agencies including the London Fire Brigade and deployed specialist officers to bring this incident to a close as quickly as possible while minimizing risk to life,' a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said. Emergency crews had gone up in a crane to negotiate with the man, and he came down after earlier telling negotiators he would come down 'on his own terms', according to a Sky News report. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police earlier said they were alerted to the incident at Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) at 7:24 local time. Emergency services closed Westminster Bridge on Saturday morning in response to the incident, and parliamentary tours were also cancelled, Sky News had reported. All roads have been reopened following the man's arrest, the police added. According to the Daily Mail, the protest triggered a 'massive emergency response,' with rescue teams deploying a crane to bring the man down safely. Videos filmed by onlookers captured the protester shouting, 'I’m not going anywhere' and calling to 'free Palestine.' Witness Luke Whelan told the Daily Mail, 'I was cycling to work when I saw him climbing up Big Ben. It looked like he was on a video call or livestreaming. He seemed pretty calm up there, like Spider-Man.' The protester shared videos on Instagram from his perspective on the tower, in one of which he also documented the moments when he climbed the fence outside the tower and then onto the tower itself. In another video, he documented the rescuers who were hoisted up to him in a crane in an attempt to convince him to come down. 'At some point you're going to have to come down, how long do you think you're going to be up there?' one of them is heard telling him, but he refused to come down. In the videos, he is also seen bleeding from his feet. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In another video posted by the man, he is heard saying: 'Democracy is dead, when people are sent to prison for nonviolent civil disobedience protests, when climate activists get three to four years in prison, when activists for Palestine are imprisoned for doing what the government should do, stop weapons from being sent to the terrorist state of Israel.' From one of the videos he uploaded, it is clear that he had intended to remain on the tower for three and a half days. Sky News reported that dozens of protesters gathered in the area to demonstrate in support of the man who climbed the tower, and one of them waved a sign against the BBC, to protest that a documentary about Gaza which was removed from the British Broadcasting Corporation's website for not following standard journalistic practice: 'Labor, Conservatives, BBC, you present Russia's crimes but hide Israel's...

Millions in USAID funds sent to Hamas and terror groups, U.S. con...	Middle East Forum head Gregg Ramon reveals in interview with Ynetnews that U.S. taxpayer money was being funneled to organizations with ties to Hamas, Al-Qaida and other terror groups; following his testimony, testimony, congressional lawmakers have begun pushing for immediate action A U.S. congressional hearing last week revealed that U.S. government aid funds had been directed to organizations with ties to Hamas and other designated terrorist groups, according to testimony presented by Gregg Raman, executive director of the Middle East Forum who recently talked with Ynet. 'The DOGE Committee is delivering on government efficiency and has been peeling back the onion when it comes to many instances of fraud, waste and abuse in U.S. budgetary spending,' Roman said. 'Last week's hearing specifically focused on how that fraud led to national security implications for the U.S. government and its allies, like Israel.' According to Roman, the issue involves two key areas. 'There's money that went to Hamas-affiliated organizations and areas under Hamas control after October 7,' he said. 'But the second set of data goes back 15 years to the Obama administration. 'USAID, along with other elements of the State Department and the U.S. government, funded radical organizations with over $122 million going to groups that have direct ties to Al-Qaida and other organizations that are on the U.S. list of designated terrorist groups.' The findings suggest U.S. taxpayer money has been funneled to terrorist groups in Somalia and Gaza as well. 'It would be like the U.S. government subsidizing Nazi Germany with the Marshall Plan before Hitler fell during World War II,' Roman said. 'It's unconscionable and must be dealt with immediately, which is why the hearing was held.' Roman described to Ynetnews years of attempts to obtain information through legal channels, facing resistance from multiple administrations. 'We filed Freedom of Information Act requests with the U.S. government, but in some instances, we're still facing delays — even though the Trump administration promised to release the information as soon as possible.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We've also filed six lawsuits against the U.S. government to obtain this data. Gradually, month by month, year by year, we managed to uncover it,' he added. He also recalled similar challenges during his time as a noncommissioned officer in Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). 'We sought answers about U.S. administrations subsidizing terror-linked groups but they refused to explain and even applied political pressure to force allies to allow the funds to go through,' he said. Following Roman’s testimony, congressional lawmakers have begun pushing for immediate action. 'It’s prompted members of the executive branch and Congress to seek immediate action — not just to stop this kind of funding, but also to hold those responsible accountable, potentially through civil actions and even criminal indictments,' he said. He added that discussions are underway to place organizations that received the funds on a 'do-not-support' list. 'This would be enforced through secondary sanctions under U.S. law,' he said. Roman also noted that efforts are being made to prevent future funding of terror-linked organizations. 'I think lawmakers are working to codify it into U.S. law so that it’s not just an administrative action, but something permanent,' he said. The U.S. government has yet to respond publicly to the findings presented at the hearing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1yecbioke	2025-03-08T14:04:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ByfsX3R001x/ByfsX3R001x_0_88_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israeli delegation to leave for cease-fire talks in Qatar as Hama...	Israel will send a delegation to Doha on Monday to advance hostage release talks, following an invitation from Egypt and Qatar, with U.S. support; This follows rising tensions over U.S.-Hamas talks, which Israel fears are bypassing it; Hamas, meanwhile, demands new terms for any cease-fire extension, including the release of hundreds of prisoners, including lifers; U.S. talks with Hamas have further strained relations, with Israel seeking veto rights over prisoner releases. Israel announced Saturday that it will dispatch a delegation to Doha on Monday to advance negotiations for the release of hostages held in Gaza. The Prime Minister’s Office stated that the decision follows an invitation from mediators Egypt and Qatar, with U.S. backing. The announcement came after a security consultation led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and amid growing concerns in Israel over direct U.S.-Hamas talks. The Israeli delegation will include a senior Shin Bet official, Netanyahu’s political advisor Ophir Falk, hostage and missing persons coordinator Gal Hirsch, and representatives from the IDF and Mossad. A political source said the delegation would push forward the framework proposed by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. Earlier Saturday, Al-Arabiya reported that Israel and Hamas had agreed to extend the temporary cease-fire throughout Ramadan — claims denied by both parties. Meanwhile, Saudi network Al-Hadath reported that Hamas had agreed in principle to extend the first phase of the cease-fire by two months, with a phased release of hostages, including Israeli soldiers. Unnamed sources told Al-Hadath that Hamas had shown flexibility in negotiations with its expanded delegation in Cairo. 'The progress in talks with Hamas led Israel to send its own delegation on Monday,' a source said, though no official confirmation has been issued. Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump’s hostages envoy, has continued discussions with Hamas over the weekend, exploring modifications to Witkoff’s proposed framework. Instead of releasing all hostages in two phases, current talks reportedly focus on freeing a smaller number while extending the cease-fire until the end of Ramadan and Passover. According to Gaza-based journalist Tamer Almisshal, considered a Hamas mouthpiece, four direct meetings took place this week between the U.S. and Hamas. He claimed that U.S. officials sought a partial deal for the release of one Israeli American soldier and the bodies of four other Israelis with U.S. citizenship. Hamas allegedly agreed to the release in exchange for freeing of hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli prisons. The U.S. reportedly offered to release 250 prisoners, including 100 serving life sentences. Israel sought veto rights over 50 names, while Hamas insisted on limiting it to 10. However, after the fourth meeting, the U.S. withdrew from talks, with Trump reportedly demanding hostage releases without concessions. One report suggests the U.S. is now negotiating a deal to secure the release of 10 hostages in exchange for a 60-day cease-fire. The Trump administration is prioritizing the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, as well as American citizens confirmed dead, as part of a broader deal. Officials say Trump was deeply shaken by his recent meeting with freed hostages and has ordered his team to secure their release. Israel fears U.S.-Hamas talks are happening behind Its back While Israel is receiving updates from Washington, officials worry that the direct U.S.-Hamas negotiations are sidelining Jerusalem. Israeli sources told Al-Hadath that these talks have not yet produced results, but officials close to the Trump administration believe otherwise. Israeli officials who recently spoke with White House advisors were struck by their confidence that direct talks with Hamas could yield progress. They noted that Hamas’ statement about 'positive indications for advancing Phase II' of a deal aligns with U.S. assessments, contradicting Israeli claims that no significant progress has been made. A diplomatic rift deepened following reports that Israeli Minister Ron Dermer 'erupted in fury' at Boehler during a tense phone call after Boehler met Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya in Qatar. While Boehler assured him that discussions were preliminary and that no deal would be signed without Israeli approval, the conversation heightened tensions between Washington and Jerusalem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A leak revealing Boehler’s meeting led to speculation that Israel was behind it, further straining trust between the two governments. A senior U.S. official acknowledged that 'Israel doesn’t like that we’re speaking directly with Hamas,' but stressed that Israel was informed. The talks have been ongoing for over three weeks. Israeli sources who spoke with senior White House officials believe that resolving the hostage crisis is key to Trump’s broader plan to expand the Abraham Accords. 'They won’t let Netanyahu derail their agenda,' one official said. 'This is an administration that steamrolls obstacles to get what it wants. If they see Bibi as a roadblock, they’ll go after him. Trump is planning a trip to Saudi Arabia in the next six weeks — he won’t go if the hostage issue isn’t resolved. The White House’s mindset is that Trump simply doesn’t lose, and he won’t let anyone put him in that position.' Hamas statement: No cease-fire extension without new terms A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo this weekend following U.S. negotiations and an American proposal reportedly submitted to the group. Washington has kept Israel informed of these developments. However, a senior Israeli source said U.S. envoy Witkoff is unlikely to travel to the region unless negotiations reach a more advanced stage. Meanwhile, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told Al Jazeera that discussions with mediators continue regarding Phase II of the negotiations. 'We have set three conditions: prisoner exchanges, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a commitment not to resume the war,' he stated. Qassem urged Israel to 'demonstrate seriousness' to mediators, emphasizing that Hamas rejects extending the current cease-fire and seeks a new framework for further hostage exchanges. 'We have no issue engaging with U.S. representatives because we understand the pressure they exert on Israel,' he said.

We came to stargaze - then they came, beat us, and raped me one ...	Guesthouse owner recounts night out with an Israeli tourist and three men near a canal: 'As we played guitar, three men arrived, demanded money, and pushed the men into the water. Then one dragged me, choked me, and tore off my clothes.' One man drowned, two suspects were arrested, and a third remains at large. Following reports on Saturday that an Israeli tourist and a local guesthouse owner were raped by three men in India, the full harrowing testimony of the guesthouse owner has now been revealed. The attack occurred on Friday night near the village of Sanapur in Karnataka. The two women were with three tourists —two Americans and an Indian — when the assailants threw the men into a canal before assaulting them. Two of the men managed to swim to safety with injuries, while the third drowned. His body was recovered Saturday morning. The guesthouse owner, who filed a police complaint, described the ordeal. 'After dinner, we decided to go stargazing. We rode scooters to the banks of the Tungabhadra canal near Sanapur Lake. Around 10:30 p.m., while we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, three men on a motorcycle approached us and asked for fuel,' she described. She told them there was no gas station nearby and suggested they find fuel in Sanapur. According to her, one of the men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. 'They didn’t know us, so I told them I had no money. But they kept insisting, until one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.' When the tourists refused to give more, the suspects became aggressive, arguing and threatening them with stones. 'Two of them attacked and raped us, while the third pushed the men into the canal and hit me with stones,' she testified. 'I was bleeding heavily. Two of the attackers dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them choked me and tore off my clothes. One after another, they beat and raped me.' She said the assailants stole her bag, two mobile phones, and 9,500 rupees before fleeing. One of the suspects also dragged the Israeli tourist and raped her. 'When we screamed and cried, the three fled on their motorcycle,' she added. Local police reported that two suspects, both 22, have been arrested, while a third is still being hunted. 'He will be caught soon,' a police representative stated. The suspects face charges of gang rape, extortion, and attempted murder. According to police, the two arrested men admitted to the rape and said they had been drinking at a bar before the attack. Both women were hospitalized for medical examinations. Israel’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that 'The Israeli consulate in Bangalore and the Department for Israelis Abroad are aware of the case and are handling it.' Karnataka’s Chief Minister Siddaramaiah condemned the attack. 'The horrific assault and rape of an Israeli citizen and a guesthouse owner is a despicable crime. As soon as the incident was reported, I instructed the police to take immediate action, conduct a thorough investigation, and swiftly apprehend the culprits. Two have already been arrested, and the investigation continues. Our government is committed to ensuring the safety of all individuals, including tourists. We will take every necessary measure to prevent such incidents from happening again,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybyigqjyg	2025-03-08T10:37:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/Bk00XNhKsJl/Bk00XNhKsJl_1_0_1200_675_0_small.jpg

Massacre of Alawites continues in Syria with hundreds more killed...	More than 500 minority Alawite civilians have been killed in clashes between Syria’s new regime and Assad loyalists in Latakia and Tartus; Fighting continues as Hezbollah denies aiding 'remnants of Assad’s forces'; . President al-Julani accused Assad loyalists of trying to destabilize and 'test the new Syria' Fighting continues in Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus following massacres in which hundreds of Alawite civilians were killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Saturday evening that, since Thursday, more than 500 Alawites have been slaughtered amid clashes between security forces aligned with the new regime and loyalists of ousted dictator Bashar Assad. The organization estimates that at least 745 people have been killed so far, including 523 Alawite civilians, while the rest were combatants from both sides. Since Saturday morning, Syrian social media has been flooded with images of intense battles between regime-aligned security forces and armed groups referred to by Syrian media as 'remnants of the Assad regime.' Some reports suggest that supporters of the deposed Alawite leader have been receiving external assistance, possibly from exiled elements who fled Syria. Speculation about external support prompted Hezbollah, a longtime ally of Assad, to issue a statement denying any involvement in the events. 'Certain parties are attempting to link Hezbollah to the developments in Syria and accuse it of taking sides in the ongoing conflict. Hezbollah categorically denies these baseless allegations and calls on the media to report accurately and avoid misleading campaigns serving political agendas,' the terror organization said in a statement. Meanwhile, opposition-affiliated Arab media outlets report additional massacres allegedly carried out by the current regime. The Hezbollah-linked Al-Mayadeen network reported on two massacres in the villages of Al-Qabu and Ain al-Arus in Latakia’s countryside. The director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described the situation as a 'disaster,' stating that the killings of Alawites involve foreign elements. Syria’s state-run news agency reported that internal security forces in Latakia had seized large stockpiles of ammunition belonging to 'remnants of the old regime.' Syrian TV network SyriaTV reported that pro-Assad militants surrendered to security forces following clashes in the city of Jableh. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Images of security forces deploying across various areas were widely circulated, with official sources claiming their mission was to 'restore security and stability and protect civilians.' Other reports suggested that 'remnants of the Assad regime' and their families had fled to the Russian-run Hmeimim Air Base. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Muhammad al-Julani, vowed Friday that security forces would continue pursuing 'remnants of the previous regime' to bring them to justice, accusing them of trying to destabilize the country. 'They sought to test the new Syria — a country they no longer recognize,' he declared. However, an Alawite source told Ynet that the community has no ties to Assad’s former regime. 'This is not some organized rebellion, as regime-affiliated media claim. There is no Iranian or Russian backing, and these are not Assad loyalists,' he said. 'People simply can’t endure the daily humiliation and terror any longer, and they rose up to defend their dignity.' Arab nations have condemned the ongoing unrest in Syria while expressing support for the new government’s efforts to restore order. The United Arab Emirates joined in the condemnations Saturday, with its Foreign Ministry denouncing 'attacks against Syrian security forces' and affirming 'support for Syria’s stability, sovereignty over all its territories, and efforts to achieve security, peace, and stability.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqwf119syg	2025-03-08T09:15:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/H1fbm8vYjJx/H1fbm8vYjJx_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Gaza Not for Sale': Pro-Palestinian graffiti spray-painted at Tr...	A pro-Palestinian group spray-painted graffiti on one of Trump's golf courses in Scotland, including on the putting green, and the clubhouse walls were covered in slogans against the US president; The group objects to Trump treating Gaza like his personal property and says: 'we have shown him that his own property is not safe from acts of resistance' Pro-Palestinian activists vandalized one of U.S. President Donald Trump’s golf resorts in Scotland in response to his proposal to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population. The group Palestine Action targeted Trump’s Turnberry golf course and hotel in southwest Scotland overnight, painting 'Gaza Is Not For Sale' in giant letters on the lawn and using red spray paint on the club house’s exterior wall. Palestine Action said it 'rejects Donald Trump’s treatment of Gaza as though it were his property to dispose of as he likes.' 'To make that clear, we have shown him that his own property is not safe from acts of resistance,' it said in a statement. Police Scotland said it received a report of damage to the golf course in the early hours of Saturday, and that inquiries are ongoing. Trump Turnberry called the activism a 'childish, criminal act' and said it will ensure it does not affect its business. The future of Gaza is uncertain as the first phase of a cease-fire that paused the 15-month war between Israel and Hamas ended with no clarity on what would come next because the agreement’s second phase has not yet been hammered out. Trump has called for Gaza’s population to be resettled elsewhere permanently so that the United States can take over the territory and develop it for others. Palestinians have roundly rejected calls to leave.

Are Trump’s policies a sign of the Messiah? Some religious leader...	During a visit to the White House last week, former hostage Omer Shem Tov told Trump that he was 'sent by God' to save them Some religious Jewish and Christian groups believe the Messiah's arrival—whether for the first or second time—could be imminent. In their view, God has set the stage by returning Donald Trump to the White House. The president's recent actions—whether appointing Pastor Paula White, a staunchly pro-Israel Christian, to lead his new faith office in the West Wing, telling Israel to 'let hell break loose' on Hamas and destroy the enemy, or likely preparing to announce that Israel can enact sovereignty over Judea and Samaria (also known as the West Bank)—have convinced some that their beliefs are correct. During a visit to the White House last week, former hostage Omer Shem Tov told Trump that he was 'sent by God' to save them. 'Purim is where God orchestrates all these natural and political events in order to save Israel,' explained Rabbi Tuly Weisz, founder and CEO of Israel365. 'And God places Esther in the palace 'for such a time as this.'' Speaking on the ILTV News Podcast, Weisz said, 'A lot of people said that God placed Trump in the White House,' but now they are starting to believe it. He pointed to Maimonides' teachings, which outlined three key events that would signal the coming of the Messiah. The first, he explained, is the destruction of Amalek, which many—including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after October 7—equate with modern-day Hamas. The second is a religious revival among the Jewish people. Some American Jews believe they see this happening in a growing 'surge' of interest in religious involvement, while in Israel, it is reflected in the rise of the religious right. According to Weisz, the final stage is the rebuilding of the Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. 'Building the Temple would be total victory in this war,' he said, noting that Hamas called the October 7 attack the 'Al-Aqsa Flood,' a direct reference to the Temple Mount. 'God willing, we will celebrate a joyous Purim with the release of all our hostages,' Weisz continued. 'And we will have that Third Temple we have prayed for 1,000 years. It will be thanks to Donald Trump and to all the Jews who are finally saying, 'Enough of this nonsense—we are going to take action.'' Watch these previous podcasts: Jewish Power at the Polls: Inside the Zionist Election Iran’s Weakness Won’t Last—Should Israel Act Now? The Secret Behind Israel’s Dominance in AI Innovation Through his organization Israel365—and a new initiative called Israel365 Action—Weisz has been at the forefront of efforts to promote Israeli sovereignty among Jewish and Christian supporters. Last year, in partnership with several other organizations, Israel365 pushed for a resolution at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) convention, urging Christian media to stop referring to Judea and Samaria as the 'West Bank' and instead use its biblical name. This year, NRB took it a step further. With backing from Israel365 and similar groups, it signed a resolution supporting Israeli sovereignty in these areas. The movement has also gained traction beyond NRB. At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), similar pro-sovereignty statements were embraced. And just last week in Jerusalem, a group calling itself the Christian Conference of Presidents promoted the same agenda. However, Israel365 and its advocacy arm, Israel365 Action, have not been without controversy. Last week, the group honored MAGA (Make America Great Again) leader Steve Bannon at an event in Texas. Bannon has been accused of antisemitism, and most recently, he was criticized for making a gesture that resembled a Nazi salute. Despite this, Israel365 Executive Director Pesach Wolicki, who joined Weisz on the ILTV News Podcast, defended Bannon, calling him 'unapologetically pro-Israel.' He argued that Bannon plays a key role in convincing members of the MAGA movement—some of whom are skeptical of Israel—that the Jewish state is a crucial ally. 'Bannon said that attacks against Israel are an attack on Judeo-Christian Western civilization,' Wolicki told ILTV. He noted that Bannon broadcasts four hours daily and listens to much of his content. 'I've never heard him say anything antisemitic,' Wolicki claimed. 'He actually gets attacked by the anti-Israel wing of the MAGA movement for being too pro-Israel.' According to Wolicki, Bannon is working to reframe the way MAGA supporters view Israel. Rather than seeing it purely as a geopolitical issue tied to military aid, Bannon wants them to recognize it as part of a more significant ideological and global conflict. Weisz echoed this perspective. He attended the Texas event and said Bannon received a standing ovation for his pro-Israel remarks. Wolicki has fully embedded himself in the MAGA movement. In December, he attended AmericaFest, the largest MAGA event of the year. He said he was likely the only person there wearing a yarmulke. He also remains in regular conversation with Bannon. His reason? Wolicki believes the movement could quickly turn against Israel, influenced by rising voices like Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson, both of whom have made antisemitic and anti-Israel statements and have Trump's ear. 'If the movement were a fully pro-Israel movement and didn't have any problematic voices in it, then there wouldn't be such a sense of urgency to get involved with them,' Wolicki said on the podcast. Israel365 Action is running a slate in the upcoming World Zionist Congress elections. Weisz said one of the platform's main goals is to push for sovereignty among Jewish community members. The election is only open to Jewish voters. Established by Theodor Herzl in 1897, the World Zionist Congress and its representatives from Jewish communities worldwide allocate $1 billion annually to Jewish causes. They also oversee Israel's key national institutions, including the World Zionist Organization, which carries out the Congress's vision; the Jewish Agency, which plays a central role in Jewish immigration to Israel; and the Jewish National Fund, which owns 13% of Israel's land. 'We unapologetically stand for Judea and Samaria. We want stronger relationships between Jews and Christians, and we want new leadership,' Weisz said. He believes there must be 'new leadership' in the Jewish world because, in his view, a Palestinian state would pose an existential threat to Israel. He argued that too many Jewish leaders, especially on the liberal left, fail to understand this. Israel365 Action has faced criticism, with some accusing it of being a covert Christian organization or of recruiting Christians to vote in the election. In December, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman distanced himself from the slate amid allegations that Israel365 Action had a hidden Christian agenda. At the time, the group was known as the One Jewish State slate—named after Friedman's book advocating sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The organization denied the accusations and later changed its name to Israel365 Action. But Weisz pushed back against the claims. 'There is nothing secret about our work in the Christian community. We're very proud to have taken that leadership position,' he said. He emphasized that the slate's website clearly states—'many times in bold letters'—that only Jews can vote and that the movement is for Jews. Separate efforts, he added, exist for Christians. Wolicki echoed this point. 'We're not trying to slip some Christians in the back door,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1esnx5okx	2025-03-08T08:01:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/Hkbce035Jl/Hkbce035Jl_0_76_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Hamas cites ‘positive indicators’ in cease-fire talks	Terror group spokesman says mediation efforts by Egypt and Qatar were ongoing, aimed at completing implementation of agreement and initiating talks on next phase A day after releasing a video of Israeli hostage Matan Angrest, who has been held in Gaza for 519 days, Hamas said on Saturday there were 'positive indications' regarding negotiations for the second phase of a potential deal. Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanoua stated that mediation efforts by Egypt and Qatar were continuing in an attempt to finalize the implementation of a ceasefire agreement and initiate talks on the next phase. 'The signs are positive,' he said. Al-Qanoua added that Hamas was prepared to engage in negotiations to advance the second phase of the deal 'to achieve the demands of our people' and called for increased efforts to deliver aid to Gaza and lift what he referred to as the blockade on the enclave. According to his statement, a Hamas delegation currently in Cairo has been discussing ways to push forward negotiations, pressure Israel to engage in talks, and establish mechanisms for implementing decisions from the recent Arab summit. The delegation’s visit to Cairo follows discussions with the Trump administration and reports of a U.S. proposal being presented to the terror group. The United States has reportedly updated Israel on its contacts with Hamas. On Friday, an Israeli official downplayed expectations of an imminent breakthrough, saying that U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, was unlikely to visit the region soon. 'He will only come if there are loose ends to finalize. No progress is known at this stage,' the official said. The source added that direct U.S.-Hamas communication was 'a bonus without a deal,' emphasizing that Washington’s priority was securing the release of American citizens held in Gaza. 'If they succeed—great, let them be freed,' the official said. Israeli officials hope that beyond Trump’s threats against Hamas, the delay in humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza will also pressure the group into releasing hostages. 'As long as Hamas refuses, we will continue imposing sanctions and restrictions,' the official said. 'We want to exhaust every possibility of bringing back as many hostages as possible before resuming combat—because once the fighting resumes, things will spiral out of control.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byloorko1g	2025-03-08T05:59:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/HJPtKnEYye/HJPtKnEYye_0_255_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

European ministers' endorsment follows emergency meeting of Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, where 57-member body formally endorsed proposal and urged international donors to provide financial support The foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy, and Britain have thrown their support behind an Arab-backed $53 billion plan to rebuild Gaza, emphasizing that the initiative would improve living conditions for Palestinians while ensuring they remain in their homeland. The plan, drafted by Egypt and approved by Arab leaders earlier this month, envisions Gaza’s reconstruction under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. It stands in direct opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to take over the coastal territory and relocate its residents to Egypt or Jordan—an idea that has drawn widespread condemnation. In a joint statement issued Saturday, the European ministers called the Arab-backed initiative 'a realistic path' to rebuilding Gaza, saying it could bring 'swift and sustainable improvement' to the enclave.

Friendly neighborhood protestor? Man scales Big Ben with a Palest...	The barefoot protester prompts witnesses to call local authorities, leading to a major police response A pro-Palestinian protestor climbed Elizabeth Tower, home to London’s iconic Big Ben clock, on Saturday, gripping a Palestinian flag as stunned passersby looked on. The barefoot protester prompted witnesses to call local authorities, leading to a major police response. Multiple police units arrived at the scene, blocking off the area as crowds gathered to watch the unusual incident. According to the Daily Mail, the protest triggered a 'massive emergency response,' with rescue teams deploying a crane to bring the man down safely. A police spokesperson said authorities received the first report at 7:24 am local time and were working to bring the situation to a 'safe conclusion' with assistance from London’s fire and rescue services. As part of the response, Bridge Street, located at the northern end of Westminster Bridge, was closed to traffic.

Israeli professor resigns from Columbia: 'It was bullsh*t; red li...	Prof. Avi Friedman endured much at Columbia—engaging with anti-Israel protesters, defending free speech, and insisting on need for pro-Zionist voice on campus; but appointment of pro-Hamas professor to teach Zionism course was breaking point Shortly before former President Donald Trump revoked $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, Israeli-American professor Avi Friedman had already made his decision to leave. His departure, however, was not due to the pro-Palestinian protests that have engulfed the campus since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, nor was it a response to student-led building takeovers or even the removal of Israeli professor Shai Davidai from campus. For Friedman, a professor of financial economics at Columbia Business School, the breaking point came when the university appointed Professor Joseph Massad—who has described Zionism as a 'colonialist movement' and Israel as an 'apartheid state'—to teach a new course on Zionism. 'A lost generation' on campus Friedman, 61, did not shy away from engaging with student demonstrators. He recalled visiting their encampment on campus last April—an early catalyst for the wave of anti-Israel protests that has since spread to universities across the United States. 'I saw a group of lost kids,' he said. Hoping to better understand their perspective, Friedman removed his kippah and approached them. 'I asked one of them why she was there, and she told me something I’ll never forget: ‘We are holding space for Gaza.’ What does that even mean? You're not a physics student—what does ‘holding space’ mean?' While Friedman described the student protests as 'orderly and peaceful,' he noted that the real hostility came from outside agitators. 'On Broadway, it was a different story. That was a real protest—aggressive, militant. That’s where you heard ‘From the river to the sea’ and ‘Global Intifada.’' Despite the rising tensions, Friedman said he believed in upholding free speech. 'This is America. I hate what they’re saying, but they have the right to say it—as long as it doesn’t turn into violence.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, he was critical of Columbia’s administration for what he viewed as weak leadership. 'They set deadlines for clearing the encampments and then did nothing when those deadlines passed. That sent a clear message that there are no consequences for anything,' he said. Hamas and Zionism The final straw for Friedman came in December, when the university announced Massad’s new course on Zionism. Massad, a Palestinian-born professor of Middle Eastern studies at Columbia since the 1990s, has long been a vocal critic of Israel. His articles and speeches have sparked backlash from Jewish organizations, members of Congress, and fellow academics—especially after he praised Hamas' October 7 attack as 'remarkable' and 'a stunning victory over Zionism.' Despite public outcry, Columbia defended the decision to offer the course, citing academic freedom. 'His class is limited to 60 students and is not a required course,' the university stated in December, acknowledging that Massad’s remarks had 'caused pain' but reaffirming its commitment to free expression. Friedman was unconvinced. 'This wasn’t just Columbia reacting to events; this was an active decision to promote an anti-Zionist narrative,' he said. 'If a professor said the U.S. shouldn’t exist, would you let them teach American history? Would you let Meir Kahane teach a course on Palestinian self-determination?' He dismissed the university’s response as 'nonsense.' 'They kept telling me, ‘We are committed to academic freedom.’ But if Massad had made these comments about any other minority group, he’d have been fired in a minute. No question.' A wider battle over campus antisemitism Friedman’s resignation comes amid a broader reckoning over antisemitism on U.S. college campuses. Columbia has been at the center of this debate, with lawsuits, congressional scrutiny, and donor backlash intensifying in recent months. While Friedman is skeptical that his resignation will bring significant change, he sees growing pressure on universities to address antisemitism. 'Trump promised action, and I’m actually surprised he’s following through,' he said, referring to federal funding cuts and legal measures being pursued against universities accused of tolerating antisemitism. 'Right now, I’m cautiously optimistic,' he added. 'There’s movement—donors are pulling out, applications are declining, and it’s becoming harder for Columbia to recruit top talent. But this is a historic institution that has weathered worse. Will it change? How long will it take? Who knows. But at least there’s finally some pushback.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkgwvkkojg	2025-03-08T00:12:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/HJxXEvoVoJg/HJxXEvoVoJg_0_0_600_451_0_small.jpg

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol left a detention centre in Seoul on Saturday, after prosecutors decided not to appeal a court decision to cancel the arrest warrant of the impeached leader. Yoon remains suspended from his duties and under insurrection charges over his short-lived martial law imposition on December 3. The criminal case is separate from his impeachment trial, in which the Constitutional Court is expected to decide in coming days whether to reinstate him or remove him from office. The Seoul Central District Court cancelled Yoon's arrest warrant on Friday, citing the timing of his indictment and 'questions about the legality' of the investigation process. Yoon, the first South Korean president to be arrested while in office, has been in custody since January 15. On Saturday, Some 38,000 Yoon supporters rallied in Seoul, while 1,500 people demonstrated against him, Yonhap news agency reported, citing unofficial police estimates.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1pwwtkjkx	2025-03-08T00:00:06-08:00	
Hundreds of Alawite civilans executed in Syria: 'They killed ever...	Monitoring groups say at least 311 killed since Thursday; bloodshed began following ambush of government forces by what Damascus described as 'Assad loyalist gunmen' in country's Latakia province At least 311 Alawite civilians have been killed in Syria over the past two days in what appears to be a series of retaliatory attacks by the country’s new government and allied forces, according to activists and monitoring groups. The violence underscores Syria’s ongoing instability, three months after the overthrow of former president Bashar al-Assad. The bloodshed began Thursday when gunmen, identified by the new regime as loyalists of Assad’s ousted government, ambushed government forces near the coastal city of Jableh in Syria’s Latakia province. The area, home to a predominantly Alawite population that makes up about 9% of Syria’s citizens, was a stronghold of the previous ruling elite before Assad’s removal. Former regime loyalists, including ex-military personnel, remain active in Syria’s coastal areas and are suspected of carrying out recent attacks against the country’s new security forces. The ambush killed at least 50 members of the new government’s forces. In response, pro-government fighters stormed the villages of Shar, Mukhtariya, and Al-Fakh, killing civilians in apparent revenge attacks. 'They killed every man they saw,' said Rami Abdul Rahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The group reported that women were spared in the attacks. Pro-government demonstrations were held in regime strongholds in Damascus and Aleppo, where supporters waved the flag of Syria’s new leadership. The violence has raised concerns that Syria could descend into further chaos. A source in Iraq’s pro-Iranian militias told the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese news network Al-Akhbar that the situation marked 'the beginning of chaos.' 'The struggle for influence—Turkey’s attempts to assert control on one side, versus U.S. and Israeli-backed efforts on the other—will lead Syria into difficult times and endless challenges,' the source said. He denied any Iranian involvement in the violence but warned that instability in Syria could spill into neighboring Iraq. Among the Alawite casualties were dozens of fighters, but most were civilians, according to activists. Defense Minister Israel Katz on Friday shared a graphic, unfiltered video on X, formerly Twitter, showing the bodies of executed men, some with their pants pulled down. His office said his comments came 'in light of the massacre carried out by [Ahmad al-]Jolani’s forces against Alawites in Syria,' referring to Syria’s new leader. Other disturbing footage from Syria appeared to show bodies being dragged behind vehicles, armed men forcing captives to crawl on all fours while barking, and summary executions. The violence has sparked strong reactions across the Muslim world, with regional powers taking opposing positions. The United Arab Emirates, which supports Syria’s new government, condemned 'the attacks against Syrian security forces' and reaffirmed its commitment to 'Syria’s stability, sovereignty over all its territory, and efforts to achieve peace, security, and stability.' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, whose government backed Assad, blamed the new Syrian leadership for the unrest. 'The new rulers in Syria are responsible for the security of all Syrians. The instability there serves Israel’s interests and allows terrorist organizations and extremist militias to exploit the situation,' he said. A prominent Alawite figure from the coastal city of Baniyas told Ynet that conditions remain dire. He accused forces loyal to Syria’s new president Ahmad al-Sharaa of forcibly expelling Alawites from their homes and carrying out killings in the streets. 'Many are now homeless, hiding in forests, while bodies remain scattered in the open. No one can retrieve or bury them,' he said. 'Even the wounded are not allowed to enter hospitals. Armed groups are moving toward the coast, threatening to kill Alawites.' The source said he had reached out to Israel for assistance, asking it to intervene to protect Alawite civilians, who had been Syria’s ruling minority until Assad’s fall. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sytxeyto1e	2025-03-07T23:42:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/rkW11XUDtokx/rkW11XUDtokx_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
UNRWA helped Hamas kill our children': Hostage's mother demands ...	Ayelet Samerano, whose son Yonatan was killed and kidnapped by UN body's employee on October 7, slams organization's claims of it 'being under attack' An Israeli mother whose son was murdered and kidnapped by a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee on October 7 confronted the United Nations Human Rights Council on Friday, accusing the international body of ignoring Israeli victims while defending the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. Speaking at the council’s opening session in Geneva, Ayelet Samerano addressed 193 ambassadors, demanding accountability for her son, Yonatan Samerano, whose body remains in Gaza. 'Mr. Rapporteur, in your report, you claim the reputation of UNRWA is under attack. I speak today as a mother. My son, Yonatan, 21 years old, was shot on October 7. Then an UNRWA social worker kidnapped him. Right now, Yonatan is still held by terrorists in Gaza,' she said. 'So I know what an attack is. An attack is when terrorists, including UNRWA employees like Muhammad Abu Itiwi, enter a music festival and murder innocent young people. An attack is when a UN social worker, paid by this organization, kidnapped my son into Gaza. A UN employee who took upon himself to do good, yet did evil. No, UNRWA is not under attack. UNRWA is the attacker.' Samerano accused UNRWA’s infrastructure of actively supporting Hamas, citing testimony from 84-year-old Ditza Heiman and Emily Damari, both former hostages, who testified that they were held captive in UNRWA facilities in Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'An UNRWA teacher held 84-year-old Ditza Heiman captive. Terrorists held Emily Damari captive in an UNRWA building. UNRWA's entire infrastructure helped Hamas kill our children,' she said. Turning directly to the UN official, she asked: 'You talk about human rights. What about human rights? What about Yonatan’s rights? What about the hostages still suffering in Gaza right now?' UNRWA has been under increasing scrutiny since Israel accused multiple agency employees of direct involvement in the October 7 Hamas-led attack that killed approximately 1,200 people and resulted in the abduction of around 250 hostages. The United States, Canada, and several European nations have suspended funding to the agency, and the UN has launched an internal investigation. Samerano also addressed claims that UNRWA had suffered from the deaths of its staff, responding: 'Your report, Mr. Rapporteur, speaks of the death of UNRWA staff. Does this include the UNRWA worker who kidnapped my son, Yonatan? Mr. Rapporteur, I ask you. I ask all of the UN.' UN Watch, a Geneva-based organization that monitors the UN, invited Samerano to speak at the council session. Its executive director, Hillel Neuer, later shared a video of her speech, which quickly gained millions of views. 'The UN should apologize for the fact that many UNRWA employees—including school principals and teachers—were exposed as participants in the October 7 massacre and helped hold hostages in UNRWA facilities and employees’ homes,' Neuer said. 'Instead of being fired and prosecuted, the UN has the audacity to claim that the real victims are UNRWA employees.' Samerano has been a vocal critic of UNRWA in recent months. In August 2024, she traveled to Switzerland for a UN Watch event attended by UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. Standing on an improvised stage, she revealed a shirt that read, 'UNRWA kidnapped my son,' and confronted Lazzarini directly, asking, 'Where is my son, Mr. Lazzarini? Why are you silent?' In November, she interrupted a UN conference on UNRWA, telling Lazzarini: 'You are not human. My life has been destroyed—and you are responsible.' Samerano continues to fight for the return of her son’s body as negotiations over a possible hostage deal remain uncertain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1yn8okoke	2025-03-07T23:21:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/H1lj8Fpdsye/H1lj8Fpdsye_0_202_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Trump wrote to Iran’s leader about that country’s nuclear program...	POTUS' overture comes as both Israel and US warned they will never let Islamic Republic acquire nuclear weapon, leading to fears of military confrontation President Donald Trump sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, seeking a new deal with Tehran to restrain its rapidly advancing nuclear program and replace the agreement he withdrew America from during his first term in office. Iranian state media immediately picked up on Trump’s acknowledgment, given in excerpts from a Fox Business Network interview that aired on Friday — though there was no confirmation from Khamenei’s office that any letter had been received. The interview airs in full Sunday. It remained unclear how the 85-year-old supreme leader would react, given that former President Barack Obama had kept his letters to Khamenei secret ahead of the start of negotiations that led to Tehran’s 2015 deal with world powers. In comments to reporters in the Oval Office later Friday, Trump did not mention the letter directly. But he made a veiled reference to possible military action, saying: 'We have a situation with Iran that, something’s going to happen very soon. Very, very soon.' 'Hopefully we can have a peace deal,' Trump said. 'I’m not speaking out of strength or weakness. I’m just saying I’d rather see a peace deal than the other. But the other will solve the problem.' Trump’s overture comes as both Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels — something only done by atomic-armed nations. In the interview with Fox host Maria Bartiromo for 'Sunday Morning Futures,' Trump said, 'I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing.’' The United Nations welcomed Trump’s outreach to Iran. 'As a matter of principle, we reaffirm that diplomacy remains the best way to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program,' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. 'We welcome all diplomatic efforts towards that goal.' Trump’s outreach comes amid tensions The White House confirmed that Trump’s letter to Iran’s leaders is seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. The president’s comments in the Oval Office echoed his sentiments from the interview, in which he said the letter had been sent Wednesday. 'I would rather negotiate a deal. I’m not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,' Trump said in the interview. 'But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something’s going to happen one way or the other.' 'We have to do something because you can’t let them have a nuclear weapon,' he added. Trump offered no details on what, if anything, was specifically offered to Iran in the letter. The move recalled Trump’s letter-writing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term, which led to face-to-face meetings, but no deals to limit Pyongyang’s atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S. Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and with Israel as a shaky ceasefire holds in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has consistently said that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. A report last month, however, by the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog said Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium. Trump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran’s economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea — including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia’s oil production. Trump also ordered the attack that killed Iran’s top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020. Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile surges Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms (661 pounds). The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran’s program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran’s accelerated production of near weapons-grade uranium puts more pressure on Trump. He’s repeatedly said he’s open to negotiations with the Islamic Republic while also increasingly targeting Iran’s oil sales with sanctions as part of his reimposed 'maximum pressure' policy. Khamenei in a speech last August opened the door to talks with the U.S., saying there is 'no harm' in engaging with the 'enemy.' However, more recently the supreme leader tempered that, saying that negotiations with America 'are not intelligent, wise or honorable,' after Trump floated nuclear talks with Tehran. Whether Khamenei even would accept a letter remains in question. A previous attempt in 2019 for Trump to exchange a letter to Khamenei through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw the supreme leader refuse it and declare: 'I do not consider Trump personally worthy of exchanging any messages, nor do I have any response for him, and I never will.' But it also remains unclear how Iran will handle further pressure. The Islamic Republic’s currency, the rial, has dramatically fallen in value. Unemployment and underemployment remain rampant. Meanwhile, women have continued their defiance of laws on the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, and continue to go without the head-covering, two years after the death of a detained young woman, Mahsa Amini, sparked nationwide protests. Israel and Iran also have traded direct attacks during the Israel-Hamas war, while partners in Tehran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance' are reeling after the assassinations of their leaders by Israel. In Israel itself, officials have suggested striking Iran’s nuclear program now, something Trump has threatened while still insisting he’d prefer reaching a diplomatic deal with Tehran.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk5p68yoye	2025-03-07T21:11:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/r100SLOdiJe/r100SLOdiJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Forensic experts came to a heartrending conclusion Friday about the manner of death for actor Gene Hackman - heart failure with complications from Alzheimer's disease on an empty stomach a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease took the life of his wife at their home in Santa Fe. The partially mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances and revealed that Arakawa likely died Feb. 11 at home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, apparently was unaware that his wife was dead. 'He was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that's what resulted in his death,' chief medical investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said. 'It's quite possible he was not aware she was deceased.' Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqhjltjjg	2025-03-07T20:56:25-08:00	
Is Iran and US on track for a nuclear deal? Israel's stance and r...	For years, Israel opposed an agreement with Iran, highlighting its violations, but with Trump’s return and engagement with Tehran, Israel now prefers diplomacy over military action, though its goal remains preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons Following months of escalating threats and reports suggesting Israel might consider major military strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, Israel’s stance appears to have shifted as U.S. President Donald Trump looks to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran. Israel, which had previously expressed strong opposition to a nuclear agreement with Iran, is now more open to the possibility of a diplomatic solution. While Israel still supports a credible military option, officials say they would prefer diplomacy if an agreement could prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons. President Trump, in an interview with Fox Business Network, confirmed that he is seeking negotiations with Iran. 'I hope you're going to negotiate because it's going to be a lot better for Iran,' he said. Iran, in turn, has approached the United States through Switzerland, signaling its interest in engaging in talks aimed at advancing a nuclear deal. Last month, while signing an expansion of sanctions against Iran, an Israeli official told The Washington Post that Israel had developed plans to carry out joint military strikes with the U.S. on Iranian nuclear facilities following an attack in October. However, as diplomatic talks have gained traction, Israel no longer rules out a new deal, as long as it prevents Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in May 2018, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented what he called 'Iran's nuclear archive,' demonstrating that Tehran had been dishonest about its nuclear ambitions. Despite a lack of trust in Iran, Israeli officials say they are not ruling out the possibility of a new agreement that would secure Iran's compliance. Israel continues to prepare for the possibility of military action, including ensuring the readiness of its forces and weaponry. However, officials also emphasize the importance of diplomatic solutions. To that end, Israel has increased military coordination with the U.S., including joint exercises involving Israeli fighter jets and U.S. bombers. These actions signal a united front between the two nations, highlighting their shared goal of addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has warned that a military strike on Iran's nuclear program would spark a broader Middle Eastern conflict. 'A military attack would lead to a huge escalation in the region,' he said in an interview with AFP. Araghchi also rejected the possibility of talks under Trump’s 'maximum pressure' sanctions policy, emphasizing that Iran remains open to negotiations but is committed to defending its nuclear program. He added, 'If Iran’s nuclear facilities are attacked, we will respond immediately and decisively.' As tensions between Iran and the West continue to rise, Israel appears to be balancing its preparation for military action with a growing willingness to pursue diplomatic channels, contingent on ensuring that Iran’s nuclear ambitions are effectively contained. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1let1yske	2025-03-07T12:55:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg
Syria's Alawites appeal to Israel as violence intensifies	Violence between Syria’s new regime and Assad loyalists escalates, with 229 dead; Alawite source calls for Israeli intervention, citing oppression, executions, and atrocities against civilians Violent clashes between security forces of Syria’s new regime and those loyal to ousted president Bashar al-Assad continued Friday, with the death toll rising to 229 over two days along Syria's coastal region, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Among the dead were 134 Alawites, who were reportedly executed The violence has escalated across areas such as Latakia and Tartus, where many of Syria’s Alawite minority, including Assad's supporters, reside. These regions have long experienced alleged harassment and abuse from the new regime, led by Ahmad al-Shara, who insists the reported incidents are isolated. Following the disturbing scenes from battles across the country, Defense Minister Israel Katz shared a graphic, unedited video on his X account showing the bodies of men who had been shot, some with their pants down. 'al-Julani took off his galabiya, put on a suit, and presented a moderate facade. Now, he has removed the mask, revealing his true face: a jihadist terrorist from the Al-Qaeda school, committing atrocities against the Alawite civilian population,' Katz wrote. 'Israel will defend itself against any threat from Syria. We will remain in the security zones and Mount Hermon and protect the communities of the Golan and Galilee. We will ensure that southern Syria remains demilitarized and free of threats, and we will protect the local Druze population - anyone who harms them will face our response.' An Alawite source, managing a local news page from the coastal town of Anis, spoke with Ynet, claiming the recent violence was a natural development due to the regime's oppression. 'The situation in neighborhoods like al-Datur in Latakia and in Jableh is worsening. Forest fires, mass arrests, daily violations — it's not a planned uprising,' the source explained. He described the unrest as a response to systematic oppression, not support for Assad’s regime. 'The people can no longer tolerate the daily humiliation and terror,' he said, adding that the events were sectarian and not politically motivated by Assad loyalists. He also accused the regime of committing atrocities against defenseless civilians, including looting homes, stealing valuables, and arresting young people. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The source appealed directly to Israel for intervention, referring to Israel’s past statements about protecting the Druze community in Syria. 'The Alawites are asking for Netanyahu's immediate intervention,' he said, echoing growing calls from other minority groups facing persecution under the new government. Meanwhile, Syrian security officials, including a commander in the Tartus security apparatus, told Al-Jazeera that the violence was linked to remnants of Assad's regime collaborating with external actors. They claimed that sophisticated communications and weapons were found, with evidence that remnants of Assad’s forces were receiving regular payments to carry out attacks. Syria's General Intelligence Directorate chief, Anas Khattab, added in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that initial investigations suggested former military and security figures from Assad's regime were behind the recent violence, operating under the guidance of high-profile fugitives who had fled the country. He vowed retribution, declaring, 'We will not forgive those whose hands are stained with the blood of our people.' As the situation in Syria intensifies, minority groups like the Alawites continue to face severe repression, and their appeals for international intervention grow louder. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syzbb1fijl	2025-03-07T12:38:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/B1gIz2Mdskl/B1gIz2Mdskl_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israel strikes Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon, largest attac...	Lebanese reports said Israeli planes carried out about 30 strikes across southern Lebanon; IDF spokesman confirmed the attacks shortly after, stating that Hezbollah weapons and rocket launchers were targeted, posing a threat to Israel and violating agreements The IDF launched an extensive airstrike on Hezbollah military sites in southern Lebanon on Friday, marking the largest attack since the ceasefire agreement took effect. The strikes targeted weapons and rocket launchers used by the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah, which is active in the region. An Israeli military spokesperson stated that the presence of weapons and rocket launchers in these sites poses a threat to Israel and is a blatant violation of the agreements between Israel and Lebanon. 'The IDF will continue to act to remove any threat to Israel and will prevent any attempt by Hezbollah to rebuild and entrench itself,' the spokesperson added. The strikes occurred in the Wadi Zibqin area and between the villages of Ayta al-Jabal and Beit Yahoun, near the Litani River and the village of al-Ashiya, according to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network. Lebanese sources reported that the strikes were the most extensive in the area since the ceasefire was implemented, with approximately 30 strikes carried out across a wide area. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar channel stated that around 20 strikes took place in several villages.

Two days earlier, a drone strike targeted a vehicle near the village of al-Qasr, close to the Syria-Lebanon border. According to Saudi network Al-Hadath, the vehicle contained a Hezbollah member named Maher Nasr al-Din, who was killed in the attack. The location of the strike was approximately 150 kilometers from the Israeli border in northern Bekaa. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjmpzjtjke	2025-03-07T12:22:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/ryPF2aOiJx/ryPF2aOiJx_215_253_906_510_0_small.jpg

Trump revokes $400 million in grants to Columbia University	Newly established task force on antisemitism says Columbia’s $5 billion in federal funding is under review, calling this action just the beginning of the process The Trump administration announced Friday that it is revoking $400 million in grants to Columbia University in New York, citing the university’s failure to take sufficient action against antisemitism on campus following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack. 'This is just the beginning of the process,' stated the administration’s newly established task force on combating antisemitism, which is leading the move. The task force added that all federal funding to Columbia—totaling $5 billion—is now under review. The decision comes just days after President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would cut funding to universities that allow illegal protests. Brian Cohen, executive director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel, responded to the funding freeze, saying, 'Columbia has an antisemitism crisis. I hope this federal action serves as a wake-up call for the administration and the board of trustees to take antisemitism and the harassment of Jewish students and faculty seriously. That way, grants can be restored, Columbia can continue its vital work, and the university can once again be a place where the Jewish community thrives.'

The evacuation occurred after a group of protesters took over the library, prompting the New York Police Department to enter and arrest at least ten demonstrators. Barnard’s student government condemned the police intervention, arguing that the administration had 'broken a long-standing promise' not to invite law enforcement onto campus.

Israel's elite drone unit emerges as lethal force, eliminates ove...	With upgraded tech and female soldiers in enemy territory, Israel’s small drone unit—left inactive on Oct. 7—has boosted its lethal capabilities; Now key to recon, pursuit, and strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, it operates even in harsh weather The IDF Sky Rider drone unit, known as 'Rochev Shamayim,' has evolved into one of the military’s most lethal forces, responsible for eliminating more than 700 Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists since the start of the war. Once primarily reliant on small surveillance drones, the unit now operates advanced attack and reconnaissance drones, providing real-time support to ground forces. During the IDF's prolonged operations in Gaza's Jabaliya area before the hostage deal, Rochev Shamayim teams were responsible for nearly 60% of targeted strikes. Unit commander Lt. Col. A. said in an interview that the war has transformed the unit, shifting from basic reconnaissance missions to direct engagement, intelligence gathering, and precision strikes using a variety of drones. A key advantage of the unit is its ability to provide immediate aerial support to ground forces, eliminating the need to wait for air force drones or attack helicopters. In some cases, drones were deployed in poor weather conditions when air force operations were restricted. Recently released footage shows Rochev Shamayim operatives identifying a Hamas member preparing a rocket launcher in a destroyed building in Jabaliya. The operative was confirmed as a target and eliminated within moments. Another clip from southern Lebanon shows Hezbollah operatives loading weapons into a vehicle in violation of the ceasefire agreement. More than 40 Hezbollah members have been eliminated in similar operations in recent weeks. 'The unit has developed the capability to detect terrorists hiding inside buildings, even while infantry and armored forces are advancing,' said Lt. Col. A. 'Our teams are deployed at the front lines, working closely with battalion and company commanders, giving them real-time intelligence and strike capability.' During the October 7 attack, a team from Rochev Shamayim was stationed at the Nahal Oz base but was not activated, despite repeated requests from team commander Capt. Eden Nimri, who was later killed in combat. The unit has since expanded significantly, integrating reserve forces and growing to the size of an average battalion. It operates in a force-multiplying role, similar to elite units like Oketz (the IDF’s canine unit) and Yahalom (combat engineers), with small teams embedded within battalions. The unit is now preparing for renewed combat in Gaza and plays a central role in border defense operations in Syria and Lebanon. 'Rochev Shamayim fighters have identified and eliminated, or directly guided strikes that killed, more than 700 terrorists, primarily in Gaza,' Lt. Col. A. said. 'In a recent operation in Jabaliya, they eliminated over 10 terrorists within hours. In another case, a three-person team took out or assisted in neutralizing 60 terrorists in northern Gaza over the past month.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He noted that the unit’s front-line deployment gives it an operational edge compared to air force drone operators working from remote bases. 'Our teams operate in the field, not from air-conditioned control rooms with a cup of coffee,' he said. However, he acknowledged the psychological toll, as team members frequently witness their fellow soldiers wounded or killed in battle. The unit provides mental health support to its fighters, with only those injured in the October 7 attack having left. Rochev Shamayim is now preparing to deploy an upgraded version of Elbit’s Skylark drone, featuring vertical takeoff and high-speed horizontal flight, with plans to eventually integrate small precision-guided missiles. The first team is currently training on the new platform. 'During the war, our unit grew by 30%, and we now have five all-female teams, in addition to mixed-gender teams,' Lt. Col. A. said. 'While some missions require male fighters due to heavy equipment, once we secure operational control in enemy territory—whether in Gaza or Lebanon—our female teams also operate there.' Second Lt. S., a team commander, added, 'Over the past year, we’ve gone from targeting Hezbollah operatives at the Lebanese border to operating directly in ground combat alongside infantry brigades. We now identify deeper Hezbollah positions, hidden infrastructure, and rocket launchers concealed in orchards—and strike them without requiring ground troops to reach those sites first. Personally, I’ve directed various types of firepower, with munitions hitting their targets within minutes.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1hz7auojx	2025-03-07T11:19:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/rk11ch4Eoye/rk11ch4Eoye_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Israel and US plan to ask an American court for access to social media servers to gather evidence for criminal charges related to the October 7 massacre, with the goal to recover deleted footage filmed on the day of the attack, as well as track phones to pinpoint the terrorists' exact locations More than a year after the October 7 massacre, Israel and the U.S. are working together to gather evidence to support charges against Hamas terrorists. The two countries are preparing a request to an American court for a search warrant that would allow them to access servers of social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and X. The goal is to retrieve deleted footage taken by Hamas militants during the attacks to strengthen evidence in ongoing cases. Israel and the U.S. have been collaborating on this issue, with American officials traveling to Israel for meetings. The effort focuses on retrieving videos of the October 7 massacre that were deleted and some content that may still be stored on social media servers. Israel’s police have already shared investigative materials, including visuals, with U.S. authorities to assist in breaking cases and gathering intelligence. The challenge lies in linking the captured militants to specific crimes. Many cases have faced significant evidentiary difficulties, primarily because the crime scenes were not treated with the same procedures as regular criminal investigations, complicating the gathering of proof. U.S. authorities have the legal authority to issue such warrants, even for servers outside the U.S. This cooperation is seen as crucial in accessing important materials on social media servers, which could not only help with criminal cases but also provide intelligence benefits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel could have sought a search warrant in its own courts, but there are diplomatic and legal sensitivities when accessing servers located outside its borders. The U.S. law, however, allows for the compelled production of information from tech companies, regardless of where their servers are located. This legal difference has led Israel to seek American assistance in this sensitive investigation. This collaboration is also part of an ongoing investigation by the U.S. into the October 7 attack, which involved American victims and hostages. The findings from this cooperation are expected to contribute to both legal proceedings and intelligence efforts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkdekooskx	2025-03-07T08:21:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/yk14286873/yk14286873_0_83_1012_570_0_small.jpg

Both parties meet in Cairo in an attempt to bridge deal gaps amid negotiations deadlock; Israeli official says US envoy Steve Witkoff is not expected to visit the region until 'there are loose ends to finalize' A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Friday for negotiations following a reported U.S. proposal to the terror group, as Israel expressed satisfaction with threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and remained hopeful for progress. A senior Israeli official said Friday afternoon that Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, is not expected to visit the region at this stage. 'He will come only when there are loose ends to finalize. No progress is known at this time,' the official said. The official described Washington’s direct engagement with Hamas as 'a bonus without a deal,' adding that the U.S. is primarily focused on securing the release of American hostages. 'If they succeed—great, let them go ahead and secure their release,' he said. Israel is counting on both Trump’s threats and restrictions on humanitarian aid to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages, the official added. 'As long as Hamas continues to refuse, we will keep imposing sanctions and punitive measures. We want to exhaust every possibility to bring back as many hostages as possible before resuming combat—because once the fighting resumes, events will unfold rapidly, and the outcome will be unpredictable.'

The official emphasized that Israel would not agree to an extended cease-fire without the return of its hostages. Egyptian media reported that the Hamas delegation is expected to discuss 'advancing negotiations toward the second phase' of a deal.

Hamas releases video showing footage of hostage Matan Angrest	After 518 in captivity, the terror group published first video of hostage soldier Matan Angrest; 'The military placed them there on October 7, and the state is abandoning them, leaving them behind' parents say in a meeting with IDF chief Hamas released on Friday a video showing proof of life of hostage Matan Angrest, who has been held captive in Gaza for 518 days. The family has yet to confirm the video's publication or the statements made in it. Earlier this week, Angrest’s parents—whose son, an Israeli soldier who was abducted wounded and unconscious from his tank at the Nahal Oz military base on October 7—released the first footage of him in captivity. The footage was taken at least six months after his abduction. 'We demand that the Israeli government implement all stages of the hostage deal before moving on to the next phase of the war,' his mother, Anat, said. She stressed the urgency of securing his release, stating, 'Matan is in mortal danger. All the hostages must be brought home before more soldiers are sent to battle and don’t return.' Anat and Haggai Angrest met Friday with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir. 'We demand, first and foremost, the return of the hostages—only then should Hamas be dealt with,' they stressed. 'The top priority must be the hostages because they don’t have time. Lives are turning into casualties and casualties into missing persons. We cannot resume the war while hostages are still there. Bringing them back must be a milestone for continuing the war.' As former hostages met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington and senior White House officials stressed that American hostages remain a top priority, Matan Angrest’s parents emphasized their demand for international intervention. 'The Americans put their soldiers and fallen troops at the top of the headlines, and we ask them to help bring back the soldiers who don’t hold citizenship as well,' they said. 'It is unacceptable that a humanitarian list that included wounded hostages did not include soldiers who went out to defend the country and were injured—only for the state to abandon them and leave them behind, at the very end.' 'They are the only ones the state decided to place there that day, at that hour. The military put them there. There is an obligation—both from the IDF and the state—and yet they are treated as second-class.' According to the family, Angrest, who was taken while critically wounded, is enduring severe mistreatment in captivity, including torture during interrogations, and is being held under 'inhumane conditions.' The family also said that Angrest was excluded from the recent humanitarian release 'solely because he is an Israeli soldier.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Less than a month ago, Angrest’s father, Hagai, said the family received confirmation that he was alive through freed hostages. The accounts, which surfaced six months after Angrest appeared in a propaganda video from Gaza, indicated that he remains severely injured and is being held in harsh conditions. 'We heard from released hostages that our beloved son Matan is alive. It was incredibly emotional for us,' his father said. 'The time has come to bring him back, along with all the others. We expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to advance the second phase of the deal immediately. We all saw the horrific images—scenes of a Holocaust in 2025, here in Israel. Bring Matan and the rest of the hostages home now. Their situation is dire, and it is time to bring them back.' In September, Matan’s mother revealed an audio recording of her son at a demonstration on Begin Street in Tel Aviv. In the recording, he is heard addressing Netanyahu in a video filmed in captivity, in words that may have been dictated by his captors. 'Netanyahu, you must, must carry out this prisoner exchange between the prisoners in Israel and the prisoners here. I really want to see my family and friends. It’s very important. I think you can do it; you just have to want to. But I trust you. You can make it happen, and I hope it will be as soon as possible,' Matan said in the recording. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1y001ydj1x	2025-03-07T05:24:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/HkucstXjJg/HkucstXjJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US president urges Iran to negotiate a nuclear deal in a direct letter to Khamenei, warning of unspecified consequences if diplomacy fails U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and sent a letter to its leadership on Thursday saying he hoped they would agree to talk. 'I said I hope you're going to negotiate, because it's going to be a lot better for Iran,' Trump said in the interview with Fox Business Network broadcast Friday. 'I think they want to get that letter. The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can't let another nuclear weapon,' he added.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov discussed international efforts to resolve the situation around Iran's nuclear program with Iranian ambassador Kazem Jalali, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday. Trump's words come after the Israeli Air Force and U.S. Air Force conducted a joint aerial exercise this week, aiming to bolster military cooperation and enhance integrated operational capabilities. The exercise came amid escalating concerns over Iran's advancing nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that as of February 8, 2025, Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% reached 274.8 kilograms, marking a significant increase of 92.5 kilograms since November 2024.

IDF considers banning soldier filming at national ceremonies over...	Military weighs unprecedented restrictions on filming soldiers at national ceremonies amid fears of international arrest warrants tied to Gaza war allegations The IDF is considering banning the filming of soldiers at national ceremonies this year over concerns they could later be identified abroad and face arrest warrants for alleged war crimes amid the war in Gaza. With Israel’s Memorial Day and Independence Day approaching, the issue has been discussed in government forums, but security officials say no final decision has been made. The main concern is the annual ceremony honoring 120 outstanding soldiers at the president’s residence, where participants are traditionally photographed. Other high-profile events include Memorial Day ceremonies at Jerusalem’s Western Wall and Mount Herzl, as well as the Independence Day torch-lighting ceremony, which features IDF flag bearers from various units. Paratroopers and other combat soldiers, many of whom fought in the war in Gaza, are typically filmed during these events, potentially exposing them to legal action when traveling abroad. Anti-Israel organizations, such as the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), have been filing lawsuits against IDF soldiers for their actions in Gaza. The fund cross-references soldiers' faces with their social media profiles to initiate legal proceedings and arrest warrant requests in various countries. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: HRF previously forced an IDF soldier to flee Brazil and has also pursued cases against Israeli troops in Chile, Argentina and Thailand. Senior officers are also being targeted. HRF’s founder, Dyab Abou Jahjah, announced that the organization had petitioned the International Criminal Court in The Hague to issue an arrest warrant for Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, who heads the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), while he was in Italy in January. At the start of the year, the IDF issued strict media coverage guidelines for soldiers and officers. Any reporting on operational activity now requires specific approval. Officers ranked brigadier general and above can be interviewed with their full name, position and unit affiliation only after prior briefing. Lower-ranking officers must be filmed from behind or with their faces blurred and can only be identified by the first letter of their name. The guidelines explicitly prohibit linking interviewees to specific combat incidents without special approval. They also ban revealing the names of soldiers with foreign citizenship and mandate blurring their faces in any media coverage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skuvmd00syx	2025-03-07T03:24:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/05/04/SJ56XSlLc/SJ56XSlLc_0_170_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

'During my three decades in the IDF, I have always prioritized the state’s security and our mission, and I urge you to remain steadfast in this commitment,' Hagari said. 'We must stay professional, truthful and dedicated to earning public trust.

IDF chief Zamir blocks spokesperson Hagari's promotion, says will...	Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir has axes Daniel Hagari's military advancement and announces his departure within weeks; decision comes after months of tensions surrounding Hagari’s outspoken remarks IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir decided Friday that the military's top spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari will not be promoted to vice admiral and will leave the military. According to an IDF statement, the two 'agreed on Hagari’s departure.' Zamir expressed 'great appreciation for Hagari’s years of significant combat service for Israel.' The statement added that Hagari had carried out his role 'professionally and with dedication' during 'one of the most complex wars in Israel’s history.' Hagari, a former commander of the Israeli Navy's elite Shayetet 13 unit, was frequently the public face of the war while political leaders remained silent, including during difficult events. One of his most controversial remarks came when he criticized a proposed law which would grant immunity to those leaking classified information to Israel’s prime minister. 'This law is extremely dangerous for the IDF. It would allow any low-level figure in the military to steal documents,' Hagari said at the time. He later expanded on his concerns, warning that such a law 'would endanger lives, including those of soldiers and pose a serious risk to national security.' His comments sparked a political firestorm and then-IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi reprimanded him for 'overstepping his authority.' The IDF said at the time that 'the military does not criticize lawmakers but presents its position to the decision-maker through established channels.' Following the reprimand, Hagari acknowledged that he had spoken 'beyond his authority as IDF spokesperson' and stressed that the military 'conveys its stance on legislation through proper channels, not in other ways.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Tensions escalated further when Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered Halevi to cooperate with the state comptroller’s investigation. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit responded sharply, urging Katz to 'resolve issues through dialogue, not the media.' Katz’s spokesperson hit back, implicitly calling for Hagari’s dismissal: 'The IDF spokesperson, who recently apologized for overstepping his authority and attacking decision-makers, has done so again. This time, an apology won’t be enough.' In December, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ally Jacob Bardugo claimed Hagari would not be promoted and warned, 'If Defense Minister Israel Katz signs off on such a move, it will be the last day he serves as defense minister in a right-wing government.' Zamir’s swift decision surprised many in the IDF. Unlike past IDF spokespersons, Hagari was on the command track for promotion to vice admiral and was considered a candidate to lead the Israeli Navy, having distinguished himself as commander of Shayetet 13. Halevi had also recommended his promotion, citing his performance during the war and his lack of involvement in the October 7 failures. Zamir’s decision effectively ousted Hagari before removing officers directly tied to those failures. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjeseloojg	2025-03-07T02:33:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/S1WqDSdokg/S1WqDSdokg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

In a statement, the State Department said, 'Yesterday evening, we revoked the first visa of an alien who was previously cited for criminal behavior in connection with Hamas-supporting disruptions. This individual was a university student. ICE will proceed with removing this person from the country.' The student's identity and university were not disclosed due to 'legal constraints,' the department added.

Second war with Hamas inevitable, expert warns	Prof. Kobi Michael: In the early stages of the war, the Biden administration 'actually tied one hand of Israel behind its back' Hamas is unlikely to release all of the hostages—alive or dead—making a second military confrontation between Israel and Hamas inevitable, according to Prof. Kobi Michael of the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy. 'If Israel does not implement its objectives and figure out the war against Hamas, which means that Hamas will not be [in Gaza] anymore as a sovereign power, we are going to face very challenging threats on all other fronts that were involved in this war,' Michael said. He made these remarks during the latest episode of ILTV Insider, speaking against the backdrop of a recent U.S. State Department assessment that Hamas had reconstituted itself with as many fighters as before the war began. Additionally, scenes from recent hostage releases showed hundreds of Hamas members in uniform, reinforcing the notion that the terror group remains in control of the Gaza Strip. However, Michael said he expects a different outcome this time. He noted that, in the early stages of the war, the Biden administration 'actually tied one hand of Israel behind its back.' Now, he said, the U.S. is much more supportive of Israel’s efforts to eliminate Hamas. Watch previous episodes of Insider: Israeli Sovereignty Over Judea & Samaria: Is this Prophecy Unfolding? Is Israel Winning This War, Or Just Prolonging The Inevitable? Is Trump’s Gaza Strategy a Diplomatic Breakthrough or a Disaster? Michael also pointed to missteps by Israel’s military and political leadership early in the war, saying they erred by not reoccupying Gaza until Hamas was eradicated. 'Now, we are in a different position,' Michael said, 'with a different administration, with a different experience, and with different military personnel. And I assume that even the relationship between the political and military personnel could be different.' However, former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Jeremy Issacharoff agreed that Israel may need to continue the war but argued that this should not happen until all the hostages have been released and Israel can demonstrate that it has exhausted all possible diplomatic efforts to prevent further conflict. 'Our diplomatic situation in the world, and I've seen problems amid diplomatic circles, I think our situation today has become very, very negative,' Issacharoff said. 'It is very concerning to me.' Michael said that Israel can disregard European opposition to its fight against Hamas, emphasizing that American support is 'much more important.' Once Israel resumes the war—because, in his view, there is no other option—Michael believes 'the rest of the world will follow America.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkdknn00i1g	2025-03-07T00:02:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/ryeXhDvDoJe/ryeXhDvDoJe_0_0_2048_1153_0_small.jpg
US proposal to Hamas: 'Terror group seeks benefits in direct chan...	Reports say Trump administration seeks to free Israeli-American hostages through a cease-fire deal with Hamas while tensions flare as president warns of military escalation if negotiations fail The Washington Post reported Friday overnight that the U.S. proposed a deal to Hamas to release several live Israeli hostages, including dual U.S.-Israeli citizen and IDF soldier Edan Alexander, in exchange for a two-month cease-fire extension and continued humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. On Thursday, Sky News Arabia cited a Palestinian source saying the U.S. had asked Hamas to release 10 hostages as part of the offer. According to the Washington Post, Hamas has yet to respond to the proposal, which was discussed in meetings between Trump hostages envoy Adam Boehler and senior Hamas officials, including the terror group’s Gaza leader, Khalil al-Hayya, in Qatar. A diplomat familiar with the discussions told the outlet that Boehler and Hamas held multiple direct meetings without Qatari mediation. The report noted that Hamas previously rejected a proposal by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, which called for the release of half of the hostages immediately, with negotiations for the rest tied to a cease-fire during Ramadan and Passover. However, U.S. officials quoted by the outlet said Hamas was weighing the potential benefits of a direct deal with the Trump administration. Officially, Hamas continues to demand a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war, along with a Palestinian prisoner exchange for Israeli hostages. Sky News Arabia also reported Thursday that the new U.S. offer includes the release of 10 live hostages in exchange for a two-month cease-fire extension in Gaza. The names of the hostages were not disclosed, though U.S. media identified Edan Alexander as one of them. In Washington, analysts examined Trump’s recent threats in a social media post after meeting with a delegation of freed hostages. U.S. officials told the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s statement pointed to two possible outcomes: If Hamas releases the hostages, the U.S. will push for a permanent end to the war. If Hamas refuses, Trump is prepared to greenlight Israel’s military campaign against the terror group in Gaza. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper cited sources in Palestinian terror organizations who said their operatives were instructed to take precautions, cease using wireless communications and take Israel’s threats seriously. The sources warned that if mediation efforts fail to extend the cease-fire and halt the war, the IDF would target key figures and carry out 'special operations' in populated areas. Following Trump's meeting with freed hostages, senior Hamas official Basem Naim published an 'open letter' cynically suggesting that Trump also meet with released Palestinian prisoners to 'present balance.' Naim claimed that 9,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails were denied basic rights, including family visits and were subjected to 'ongoing psychological and physical torture.' After leaving their meeting with Trump, freed hostages met with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who was in Washington for talks with his U.S. counterpart, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Smotrich, who opposes the current hostage deal, recited to freed hostage Eli Sharabi a Jewish prayer thanking God for his release. Smotrich assured Sharabi that despite his opposition to the deal, he was 'working to bring all the hostages home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharabi responded, 'I’m here to make sure this happens with America’s help.' His brother, Sharon, told Smotrich, 'It's not enough to share the same goal — the timing is critical for saving lives and returning the fallen. The responsibility is also on your shoulders.' A day after his direct warning to Hamas, Trump confirmed that his administration was in direct talks with the terror group. 'We are having discussions and helping Israel,' he said. Witkoff added, 'It's time for Hamas to start acting responsibly and rationally.' Following his meeting with freed hostages, Trump said, 'I had the honor of spending a lot of time with several of the hostages we got out, and I can’t believe how horribly they were treated. Some of the stories were so terrible they couldn’t be shared.' 'We have 59 left — of which 24 are living [and] they said they’re in very bad shape… [but the released hostages] want to know if we could just continue,' he added. When asked about direct negotiations with Hamas, Trump replied, ' We’re not doing anything in terms of Hamas. We’re not giving cash. You have to negotiate. There’s a difference between negotiating and paying. We want to get these people out.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1pzhmujye	2025-03-06T23:56:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/H1qEPMdiJl/H1qEPMdiJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

You're under attack by Hamas': IDF chief Eyal Zamir launches ter...	Newly appointed IDF chief of staff wastes no time making his mark, launching a surprise military drill near Gaza on his first day; with war still unresolved, top commander is pushing for combat readiness and urgent structural changes within the army IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir marked his first day in office with a visit to the Gaza Strip, signaling a shift in approach following his predecessor Herzi Halevi’s failure to bring the ongoing war to a decisive end. However, Zamir’s visit was more than just a symbolic gesture — he staged an unannounced drill at a frontline position near Beit Hanoun. 'You’re under attack by Hamas,' he told the stationed company commander. Officers present said the outgoing IDF Southern Command chief, Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman was caught off guard. During the drill, Zamir simulated an October 7-style assault, moved between positions questioning soldiers on threats in the area, and even operated a machine gun himself. When the drill concluded, he told a company commander from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion, 'An attack like this will happen. It’s not a question of 'if' but 'when,' and you need to be ready.' Zamir’s opening act was clearly intended to send a message. He is taking charge of an army still reeling from the failures of October 7, a reality exposed in investigative reports. His newly appointed team, as reported by Ynet, will now work to correct the severe flaws in those inquiries. Senior military officials describe Zamir as stepping into the role with urgency, knowing time is not on his side. He made this clear to IDF leaders during a late-night personnel meeting, to the soldiers at the outpost and to municipal leaders he met. 'The war could reignite at any moment,' he told them. 'Hamas must be decisively defeated.' In his first official order, he acknowledged the military’s failure on October 7 and vowed to shake up the system. Given the ongoing issues with readiness and discipline, he faces an uphill battle with no grace period. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zamir also signaled to his General Staff — both those staying and new arrivals — that he meant business. Another high-level staffing discussion ran late into the night, beginning at 8:30 p.m. and dragging into the early hours. A similar meeting on Wednesday night lasted until nearly 4:00 a.m., followed by a strategic briefing just two hours later. 'It was a tough discussion,' a senior officer said. 'We talked about many fallen officers and shared memories of them.' Unlike performative leadership tactics, Zamir’s relentless pace stems from necessity. The outgoing chief’s insistence on remaining in office led to a bottleneck, leaving dozens of officers uncertain about their assignments. This caused internal unrest at a time when the IDF is already stretched thin against mounting regional threats. One of Zamir’s key priorities is strengthening the IDF’s ground forces, including forming a new tank brigade and reinstating reconnaissance units in armored divisions. But to achieve this, he requires more combat soldiers — something the government is not helping with, as it struggles to pass a new draft law. During his inaugural speech, Zamir underscored the importance of equal military service across all communities, making it clear he would not rubber-stamp legislation that increases draft exemptions. At the same time, he used religious language that earned praise in some circles. But he knows he’s walking a fine line, with political dangers that may prove even more treacherous than those in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syiubzoi1l	2025-03-06T21:52:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/yk14286979/yk14286979_0_0_1360_765_0_small.jpg

So in a way, it's easier for him to make this threat' It is easy for former U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten that 'all hell will break loose' on Hamas because Israel will be the one to carry out that threat, according to former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon. Speaking to ILTV News this week, Ayalon explained that Trump's warning does not require direct American action, such as deploying U.S. troops. 'The threat, if needed, will be materialized or realized by Israel. So in a way, it's easier for him to make this threat,' he said.

Is an Aliyah event key to making Israel your home?	If you're considering making Aliyah, attending a Nefesh B’Nefesh event could be the game-changer you need, according to Marc Rosenberg, vice president of Diaspora Partnerships at Nefesh B’Nefesh If you're considering making Aliyah, attending a Nefesh B’Nefesh event could be the game-changer you need, according to Marc Rosenberg, vice president of Diaspora Partnerships at Nefesh B’Nefesh. In an interview with ILTV News, Rosenberg emphasized that Nefesh B’Nefesh gatherings provide crucial support for Jews worldwide looking to move to Israel. In partnership with the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration and the Jewish Agency, the organization ensures a smooth transition for new immigrants—whether they need assistance with logistics, employment, or simply a boost of confidence. Currently, a series of events is taking place across North America, including specialized programs for medical professionals.

Global Jewish leaders unite in Israel for inaugural Voice of the ...	President Isaac Herzog: 'Our nation is ever challenged' Around 150 people from Jewish communities worldwide arrived in Israel this week for the first gathering of Voice of the People (VoP), a global initiative led by President Isaac Herzog to strengthen unity and empower Jewish communities. 'Our nation is ever challenged,' said Israeli President Isaac Herzog. 'The Jewish nation, the Jewish story, the story of Israel, the State of Israel, and the lack of knowledge and understanding of the challenges that each one of your respective communities faces, have to be told to one another.' Jewish Agency Chairman of the Board Marc Wilf emphasized the fresh perspectives and energy within the gathering. 'What I find here are people from all walks of life in the Jewish world, and I see a lot of new faces, a lot of innovative energy, and people that I don't necessarily know or have seen before, and so I think that's good.' The inaugural meeting, held in Haifa, marked the beginning of a collaborative effort to address key communal challenges, harness data-driven insights, and shape a shared vision for the Jewish future. 'It’s almost like the diplomatic version of the Startup Nation,' observed VoP delegate from London, Efrat Sopher. The delegation included 50 participants from Israel, 50 from North America, and 50 from other regions worldwide. Over five days, attendees engaged in meaningful discussions and developed actionable strategies to strengthen Jewish communities globally. The Voice of the People initiative aims to translate the ideas exchanged at the summit into concrete action. 'Who are we? And what is our voice?' asked Israeli VoP delegate Aleeza Ben-Sharlom. 'I think we are literally here to answer that question.' She elaborated, 'When we talk about Voice of the People, it’s ‘voice.’ We didn't say, ‘Voices’ of the People. We said, Voice of the People. We might live in different countries, we might speak different languages, and somehow we're supposed to have one voice and we're supposed to be unified.' Throughout the summit, key sessions focused on adaptive leadership, crisis resilience, and the role of technology and data in shaping the Jewish future. Prominent academics, analysts, government and diplomatic officials, and community leaders led discussions on security, combating antisemitism, strengthening Israel-Diaspora relations, fostering Jewish identity, and leveraging data for strategic decision-making. 'We have to make sure that we are strong together and that we know each other, respect each other, and break our heads together, bang our heads together, to come for solutions that are so important to the future of our people,' Herzog said. Sopher added, 'I hope that there'll be practical, very, very innovative solutions that haven't been considered before.' Beyond the discussions, the summit was also about embracing diversity and fostering hope for a better future—especially in the wake of the October 7 tragedy and nearly a year and a half of war. 'The Jewish people will persevere,' Wilf concluded. 'We need to be more in touch with our identity and our heritage. And I think when you come to a conference to voice the people, and you see all the great energy here, you feel very hopeful.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdgakdjyg	2025-03-06T19:07:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/H1xx11x00sJg/H1xx11x00sJg_0_49_2048_1153_0_small.jpg
SpaceX loses control of Starship in space in testing failure	SpaceX lost contact with its Starship rocket in space on Thursday during the company's eighth test mission, dooming a satellite deployment demonstration in the company's second consecutive Starship failure this year. The 403-foot(123-meter)-tall rocket system lifted off at around 6:30 p.m. ET (2300 GMT) from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, rocket facilities, with its Super Heavy first stage booster returning back to land as planned. But minutes later, the Starship upper stage began to spin out of control in space, SpaceX's live stream showed. A visualization of the rocket's engines showed multiple shutdowns before the company confirmed it had lost contact with the ship.

New IDF chief approves Gaza attack plans as Israel prepares for e...	IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir approved new attack plans on his first day in office; As Hamas continues to regroup, Israeli assessments indicate that once military operations resume, they will be difficult to halt; Meanwhile, IDF forces are expected to face operational restrictions in the field, while Hamas has learned from previous battles and reinforced its defenses. New IDF Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir approved new offensive plans for the Southern Command in preparation for a likely resumption of fighting against Hamas in Gaza. Hamas has been using the cease-fire to reorganize and, according to various assessments, once hostilities resume the conflict could escalate rapidly and become difficult to contain. The IDF has informed Israel’s political leadership that any new offensive in Gaza will be subject to various operational constraints, primarily in areas where hostages are believed to be held. Over the past month, multiple IDF divisions, including reserve brigades, have been preparing for a ground offensive in Gaza, combined with heavy aerial strikes. Hamas has been reinforcing its positions in anticipation of renewed fighting following the collapse of the cease-fire’s first phase without negotiations for a second. The terror group is believed to have learned lessons from previous battles, planted dozens of new explosive devices, redeployed thousands of operatives to Gaza City from the south, recalibrated rocket launchers, and restructured its combat units into companies and battalions. Zamir’s statement on Wednesday — that Hamas has yet to be decisively defeated, contradicting the stance of his predecessor, Herzi Halevi — has reinforced the military’s commitment to prolonged ground operations. The expectation is that these operations will continue for years until Hamas is militarily dismantled. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On his first day as chief of staff, Zamir entered Gaza and met with soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion. During a field tour with outgoing Southern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and other senior commanders, Zamir urged troops to maintain full readiness. 'You must always be prepared, always stay alert, always be suspicious, and always keep training,' he told them Referring to their role in protecting Israeli civilians, he told the soldiers: 'If you look back, you’ll see the homes of Sderot — you are defending the residents of Sderot. You are our frontline defense. That gives you a great responsibility, and I trust you to fulfill your mission to the best of your ability. We have outstanding commanders, excellent soldiers, and we will accomplish all our missions in the best possible way.' Earlier in the day, Zamir also met with local leaders from Israeli communities near Gaza, telling them the IDF is preparing for a return to combat amid the fragile cease-fire. However, he stressed that 'bringing the hostages home remains our top priority.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1tlmndiyx	2025-03-06T15:09:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/rJ7hPDPikg/rJ7hPDPikg_0_0_2048_1354_0_small.jpg
The murder of the Bibas brothers is not mentioned in UN report on...	A draft of the UN’s annual report on children in conflict zones omits Israeli victims, including murdered siblings Kfir and Ariel Bibas and 12 children killed by a Hezbollah rocket in Majdal Shams; UN ambassador Danon: Report 'serves as a platform for baseless accusations against Israel' The draft of the UN's annual report on children in conflict zones, expected to be published in June 2025, continues to demonstrate imbalance and an anti-Israel tone. The report, for example, ignores the youngest Israeli victims of the war — failing to mention the names of Kfir and Ariel Bibas, who were murdered in captivity in Gaza and whose bodies were returned in the last hostage deal. Additionally, the 12 children killed by a Hezbollah rocket in Majdal Shams are not mentioned at all. The report inflates figures, includes unverified information, and blurs the responsibility of terror organizations for causing harm to children. The draft was shared with Israel for its comments, but Jerusalem was shocked by the UN's insensitivity and hypocrisy and decided not to cooperate with the report. Among other accusations, the report blames the IDF for using exactly 27 Palestinian children as 'human shields,' yet it only vaguely mentions Hamas' systematic use of civilians as human shields, without verifying specific cases. The report claims Israeli security forces 'kidnapped a Palestinian girl,' while simultaneously omitting the names of Kfir and Ariel Bibas. If that were not enough, the report does not state that the young siblings were murdered by their captors, instead merely saying they 'died in captivity.' Furthermore, the report blames Israel for harming children due to the impact of rocket interception fragments during Iranian missile launches toward Israel — without acknowledging the original source of the attack. On the topic of humanitarian aid, the UN places almost all responsibility on Israel while almost entirely ignoring the fact that Hamas itself damaged the crossings designated for aid transfers and, according to countless testimonies and evidence, also stole aid intended for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip for its own purposes. The report claims that 2,723 requests for aid were denied but downplays the fact that 5,327 requests - nearly twice as many - were approved. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regarding the number of Palestinian casualties, the report presents thousands of deaths and injuries, many of which are unverified, creating a misleading impression of the scale of events. Responsibility for violations is placed almost entirely on Israel, while Hamas is not held accountable at all, and Hezbollah and Iran are given only marginal mentions in the biased report. The report also claims the IDF used schools and hospitals for military purposes in 10 different cases, but it mentions only one instance in which Hamas used civilian structures for military purposes — despite the well-documented fact that many 'innocent' buildings in Gaza were revealed to be bases for launching terror operations. The situation is no different in the reports on the northern front. In Lebanon, most of the harm to children is attributed to Israel, while Hezbollah is not mentioned at all as being responsible for any harm. Similarly, in Syria, Israeli actions are included in the total count of casualties, but — there is no mention of the 12 children killed in Majdal Shams. The UN 'verified' 8,555 serious violations against 2,960 children — only 15 of whom were Israeli children, while the rest were Palestinian children The draft also relies on unverified data that portrays Israel in a negative light while minimizing the severity of violations committed by terror organizations. According to the draft, which was shared with Israel, the UN 'verified' 8,555 serious violations against 2,960 children — only 15 of whom were Israeli children, while the rest were Palestinian children. Most of the cases occurred in Gaza, with thousands in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Additionally, 2,788 'serious violations' were verified for 2023 in Gaza, compared to only one 'serious violation' in Israel. Furthermore, the UN received reports of the deaths of 4,230 children in Gaza in 2024, for which the verification process is still ongoing. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, responded sharply to the biased report, saying: 'We will not cooperate with a report that serves as a platform for baseless accusations against Israel. The Secretary-General once again chooses to blatantly ignore the harm done to Israeli children — as far as he’s concerned, our lives are worth less and don’t deserve to be included in this report. We will not let diplomatic terrorism prevail.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15gk5vije	2025-03-06T14:40:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/06/BJbpKwJvvR/BJbpKwJvvR_0_293_961_541_0_small.jpg
Trump says he will go to Saudi Arabia to reach $1 trillion deal	I t for Riyadh to invest upwards of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy, including purchases of military equipment. Talking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said he would probably travel there in the next month and a half. He noted that the first overseas trip of his first term was to Riyadh in 2017 to announce Saudi investments estimated then to be worth $350 billion. He said that, at his behest, the Saudis were willing to invest $1 trillion over four years in American companies including purchases of U.S. military equipment. 'And they've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there, and I have a great relationship with them, and they've been very nice,' Trump said. Saudi Arabia has been taking a more prominent role in U.S. foreign policy. Trump's Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters the Saudis will host a U.S.-Ukraine meeting next week to discuss a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. In February, Trump met with officials of the PGA Tour and the Saudi-owned LIV Golf about resolving a rift between the two. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and Middle East adviser during his first term, started a private equity firm that received $2 billion in Saudi investment after Trump left office. Trump has also recently presided over a string of announcements about companies investing heavily in the U.S. economy including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Apple.

Haredi lawmakers tell Netanyahu what without draft exemption law ...	Members of the Haredi Agudat Israel Knesset faction, Yitzhak Goldknopf, minister of Housing and Construction, Yaakov Tesler, and Moshe Shimon Roth, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of exempting yeshiva students from compulsory military service. In their letter, they noted the clause in the coalition agreement in which the Netanyahu pledged to regulate the status of yeshiva students even before the 2023 budget. The letter clarified that 'the claim of a delay due to the war is not valid, as the Likud has returned to promoting legal reform.' They concluded their letter with the announcement that, in accordance with the instruction of their rabbis, they will vote against the budget as long as the status of yeshiva students is not regulated.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hki1tipi1e	2025-03-06T14:19:23-08:00	
Trump is fed up': US talks with Hamas and the American timetable...	Fears of the cease-fire deal's collapse are growing and Trump is losing patience after meeting with returned hostages; 'We are having discussions with Hamas. We are helping Israel in those discussions,' Trump told reporters; Witkoff clarified: 'We don't think Hamas has acted sensibly so far' There is definitely a deadline for returning to fighting in the Gaza Strip, according to President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, 'but I'm not at liberty to discuss it,' he told White House reporters on Thursday. Steve Wtikoff's statements come a day after Trump issued another threat to Hamas about facing 'hell to pay' if the terrorist organization does not release the hostages. Witkoff repeated those words on Thursday, saying that 'it is time for Hamas to start acting in a responsible and reasonable way.' Later on Thursday Trump confirmed the talks with Hamas, saying: 'We are having discussions with Hamas. We are helping Israel in those discussions.' Amid fears of a return to fighting, and in light of the terrorist organization's threats that such and escalation it 'will lead to the deaths of hostages,' Witkoff told reporters outside the White House that there is a deadline by which Israel will indeed return to action in the Strip. 'Trump was clear on the matter, we don't think Hamas has acted sensibly so far,' he noted. He also commented on the direct contacts the United States is holding with Hamas, that bypasses Israel, and said that the release of the American hostages, both alive and dead, is the administration's top priority. 'Eden Alexander is very important to us, as all the hostages are, but Eden Alexander is an American, and he's injured, and so he's a top priority for us,' Witkoff said. A day after the talks were revealed, Witkoff noted that Adam Boehler, the president's envoy for hostages, had indeed held talks with Hamas. 'We feel that Hamas has not been forthright with us, and it's time for them to be forthright with us,' Witkoff said, adding that the release of Edan Alexander would be a 'very important signal.' Witkoff said that it was President Trump's meeting with the freed hostages on Wednesday that led him to the message he conveyed on Truth Social. 'The president has issued a statement about what's acceptable to him and what's not, and hopefully we'll see some good conduct next week, and I'll be able to go in there and have discussions,' he said. After the cease-fire deal in its current form collapsed, Witkoff was asked if the framework of the agreement still exists. 'I don't want to put words in (Trump's) mouth, but I think it's, it's fairly clear he was saying, I've had enough. Like there's a lot of mistreatment. There's a lot of conversation among these hostages about the deprivation that they went through about murders that they saw, and I think that the president listened to it, absorbed it, and said this, it's unacceptable. I'm not going to tolerate this type of behavior,' he said. Witkoff spoke about the moving meeting held Wednesday night with the returned hostages. 'The president spent about an hour with the survivors of the captivity yesterday, taking pictures and listening to their stories. He was moved by it and I think they felt a tremendous sense of liberation that they were able to talk about the feelings they experienced,' he noted. 'To talk about other hostages who were in captivity with them and the need to bring them all home.' He said that Trump 'ended up spending about an hour with them, with each of the hostages pictures, and spent a lot of time listening to their stories about what happened to them in captivity. And he was clearly emotional about it. I think that they felt a really great sense of catharsis that they got to tell the president about their experience, talk about other hostages who they spent time with while they were in captivity, and the need to get them all home. And that led to his post last night. So I describe it as a very, very important day for them. I think they all went home feeling that they got a great sense of closure, at least in part.' The State Department, on the other hand, cooled the air surrounding the reports of direct contacts between the U.S and Hamas, saying that not every conversation is a 'negotiation.' In light of these remarks, a senior Israeli official familiar with the details told Ynet Thursday that there will not be a separate American move, but rather a combination of the return of the American hostages in a broader move. 'The chances of its success depend on Israel's flexibility and the U.S.'s determination to apply pressure on the parties,' he said. 'Trump talked all day about the freed hostages' President Trump's meeting with the eight returned hostages reportedly touched his heart deeply. Sources familiar with the matter said that the returnees managed to create a very strong emotional connection with Trump and that he talked about the meeting all day and thought about them all day. People who spoke to White House officials also got the impression that Trump intends to allocate the most resources to addressing the issue. The survivors' delegation included Noa Argamani , Doron Steinbrecher, Eli Sharabi, Naama Levy, Iair Horn, Omer Shem Tov, and Keith and Aviva Siegel. After the meeting, Trump called on Hamas to immediately release all hostages held in Gaza in what he called his 'last warning' to them while also urging the terror group's leadership to leave the Palestinian enclave. Trump posted on Truth Social: 'This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance. Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!' Trump said there will be 'hell to pay later' if hostages are not released. On Thursday evening, Hamas' military wing spokesman Abu Obeida issued his own threat in response, stating that an escalation by Israel and a return to fighting would lead to the deaths of hostages. Abu Obaida claimed Hamas is 'prepared for any scenario' and stated that the organization 'committed to the world and the mediators to uphold the terms of the cease-fire and the exchange of prisoners. Despite all of Israel's attempts to evade the agreement, we chose to continue honoring it.' He went on to accuse Israel of attempting to avoid fulfilling the stages of the agreement, saying: 'The enemy leadership is trying to evade the deal, seeking American cover to carry out aggression against our people.' The families of the hostages onThursday urged the negotiating teams, the Americans and the Israelis, to work toward the release of the hostages, all at the same time and without distinguishing between them. 'We urge the negotiators to reach an agreement on the release of all 59 hostages together, not in a trickle that will leave dozens of hostages to languish in Hamas' tunnels of horror for many more months,' the Hostage Families Forum said. 'We have seen the situation of the freed ones, it is not going to get better. Dealing with Hamas can always be done, the release of the hostages must be done immediately.' The talks behind Israel's back: 'A new era' Adam Boehler , Trump's envoy for hostage issues, has been talking to Hamas leaders for the past three weeks about the release of the American hostages. At least that's what emerged on Thursday, a day after the talks behind Israel's back were revealed. The test of the outcome will be whether Phase II of the cease-fire deal is implemented or at least whether there is a gesture from Hamas regarding Edan Alexander, who holds American citizenship, as well as the return of the bodies of four dead Israeli American hostages: Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai - but for now, whether the cease-fire will continue is unclear. 'The president asked me if there was any work I wanted to focus on,' Boehler said on Thursday. 'I told him that this (the issue of the hostages) is the only thing, because I think there is nothing more important to this country, that even if the citizens are abroad, the country has their back.' According to him, 'President Trump has made this issue a top priority. You saw what he said yesterday to Hamas, that kidnapping an American citizen or any other citizen is inappropriate and will be responded to in the harshest way possible.' He added: 'I have worked directly with the president, with Secretary of State Rubio and with National Security Adviser Waltz, to make sure that our policy is 100% focused on bringing people back. The president has no problem acting, we all back him, we are beginning a new era where it is unacceptable to detain American citizens.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The White House claimed to have consulted with Israel about the direct talks it had held with Hamas - but an Israeli official denied this. The New York Times reported that Israel did not learn about the talks from the United States, but from what was described as 'other channels.' Sources familiar with the matter told Ynet Thursday that 'there is a dynamic here that Netanyahu does not recognize and does not control. After all, there is no scenario where America releases its citizens without also releasing other hostages. Israel tried to claim that there is no second phase and that it is not prepared to enter into negotiations with Hamas, but here is the American administration that says: I will talk directly with Hamas and try to get the negotiations moving.' Israeli sources familiar with the details noted that: 'We don't know everything, but the feeling is that something is brewing between the administration and Hamas. The Americans are determined to release more hostages, they understand that a return to fighting and a ground operation is very bad news for the hostages, and they are prepared to go to places their predecessors have not gone. There is incredible determination and wonderful commitment here.' 'This is not a government that works normally,' a source who is in contact with the government told Ynet. 'It works very creatively and breaks all the rules, is not bound by any considerations.' This requires mental flexibility on the part of those conducting the negotiations, and they have this flexibility, a source said. 'Witkoff's team is very strong and active, a lot of things are happening below the surface.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy3fofpjkl	2025-03-06T13:47:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BkKUHcDYJe/BkKUHcDYJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Launch party for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's book thwarted in Rom...	The Israeli Embassy and Jewish community in Italy successfully blocked the launch of assassinated October 7 massacre mastermind Yahya Sinwar’s book at La Sapienza University; Pro-Palestinian organizers condemned the intervention, vowing to find an alternative venue despite widespread criticism of the event With the involvement of the Israeli Embassy in Italy and the local Jewish community, events planned to launch the book by slain terrorist mastermind Yahya Sinwar, titled 'The Thorns and the Carnation,' (or 'Le Spine E Il Garofano' it Italian) at a prestigious university were successfully prevented. The drama unfolded at La Sapienza University, Europe's largest public university situated in the heart of Rome. The event was organized by a pro-Palestinian student movement, led by a former Israeli Arab citizen named Maya Issa. The event was intended to launch Sinwar's book in Italian. Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre and responsible for the abduction and murder of numerous Israelis, was killed in October 2024 by IDF soldiers in an operation in southern Gaza after a year-long manhunt. The original plan was to hold the event in the Department of Physics, where organizers seemingly had connections. However, following efforts by the Israeli Embassy in Rome, in coordination with university contacts and senior officials, the Department of Physics withdrew its approval to host the event. As a result, the group attempted to relocate the event to another venue within the university, this time to the Department of Humanities. Once again, the embassy acted swiftly, and after its intervention with university management this attempt was also thwarted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The university subsequently issued a statement on social media clarifying that the event was prohibited from taking place. Following these developments, the student movement released a statement titled 'The Zionist Censorship,' detailing their attempts to hold the event and the obstacles they encountered. The statement criticized the collaboration between the university, 'Zionists,' and the Jewish community, while emphasizing their intention to find an alternative venue for the event in the coming days. The decision to cancel the event received attention in the local media, particularly in right-leaning publications. Meanwhile, the Jewish community's youth group released a press statement urging that Hamas propaganda not be allowed to find a platform. Israel's ambassador to Italy, Yonathan Peled, responded: 'This is crossing a red line. We are pleased that reason triumphed over madness and that our efforts bore fruit, leading to the cancellation of these events.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvcbuvi1e	2025-03-06T11:38:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/B1RE9PDsJe/B1RE9PDsJe_0_235_961_541_0_small.jpg

Anti-Israel activist who hunts IDF soldiers around the world accu...	The founder of the Hind Rajab Foundation claims the first Google result for his name leads to an Israeli government page exposing his ties to Hezbollah; Claims his NGO is 'dedicated to breaking the cycle of Israeli impunity' The founder of the anti-Israel Hind Rajab Foundation, Dyab Abou Jahjah, who is involved in the 'hunting' of IDF soldiers worldwide, accused Israel on Thursday of 'commandeering' his name. He claims that when searching his name on Google, the first result is an Israeli government page exposing his true identity. In a post published on the X platform (formerly Twitter), he stated: 'When you Google my name, the first result is a sponsored defamation article published on an Israeli government website. Beyond the irony of Israel spending American tax dollars to spread lies about me, this raises serious questions about Google’s role in enabling state-sponsored smear campaigns. By placing a government-funded hit piece at the top of search results, @Google is actively facilitating propaganda and defamation. Should a tech giant be allowing authoritarian genocidal governments lead by a wanted war criminal to manipulate public perception through paid disinformation?'' Abou Jahjah's past and the Hind Rajab Foundation Dyab Abou Jahjah, the founder of the Hind Rajab Foundation, is a former Hezbollah operative who presents himself as a human rights activist. However, investigations have revealed his connections to Hezbollah, his denial of the existence of gas chambers in Nazi extermination camps, and his support for the October 7 massacre. Thanks to the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs' efforts, searches for his name or the foundation's name on Google lead to links exposing their activities as supporters, and even operatives, of terrorism. In January 2025, the ministry successfully had a complaint dismissed against an Israeli soldier vacationing in Brazil after he was targeted by the foundation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to a comprehensive report published by the ministry that same month, the Hind Rajab Foundation was established in September 2024 in Brussels, Belgium, as a non-profit organization (NGO). The foundation claims to be 'dedicated to breaking the cycle of Israeli impunity,' according to its own statements. It was named after Hind Rajab, a Palestinian girl allegedly killed in Gaza following an Israeli operation. The foundation is essentially a legal branch of the 'March 30 Movement,' which was established by Palestinians in Europe at the start of the Gaza war. This movement has also filed lawsuits against IDF soldiers who fought during the initial months of the conflict. The founder, Abou Jahjah, was born in the town of Hanin in southern Lebanon and has stated that, in his youth, he joined Hezbollah to fight against Israel, participating in military training. He obtained Belgian citizenship in 1996 after marrying a Belgian woman, from whom he later divorced. Over 20 years ago, he was described in an article as the 'Malcolm X of Muslim immigrants in Belgium.' Abou Jahjah also regularly publishes opinion pieces in the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah. In a post on X following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Abou Jahjah eulogized him and noted that he had met him in 2001. On October 17, after the killing of Yahya Sinwar, he wrote: 'You can kill resistance leaders. Their deaths are a testimony against you. History will record that they stood up and said 'no,' showing the path that millions will follow. Your power will fade, your control will end, and so will you.' Abou Jahjah's associate, Karim Hassoun, also expressed support for the October 7 abduction of Israeli civilians. He even criticized Hamas for not kidnapping more Israelis, stating: 'I condemn Hamas for not taking 500 or 1,000 hostages instead of just 200.' Additionally, footage was published showing Hassoun proudly wearing a Hezbollah cap. Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs response Amichai Chikli, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, said in a statement: 'I am proud of the ministry's efforts to fight antisemitism. We will continue to expose the true faces of all those so-called 'human rights activists' who turn out to be Hezbollah and Hamas operatives and supporters. We will fight these organizations with every tool at our disposal and will not give them a moment of rest.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhfvwwj1l	2025-03-06T10:38:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/HJubr111wJl/HJubr111wJl_0_0_822_537_0_small.jpg
Zelensky says truce in air and at sea could test Russia's will to...	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on EU leaders on Thursday to support the idea of a truce between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the air and at sea, saying it would be a chance to test Moscow's will to end its three-year invasion. 'Everyone needs to make sure that Russia, as the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it,' Zelensky said, addressing a summit in Brussels where European leaders have gathered to discuss defense spending and support for Ukraine after the U.S. paused military aid to Kyiv. 'This can be proved by two forms of silence that are easy to establish and monitor, namely, no attacks on energy and other civilian infrastructure â€' truce for missiles, bombs, and long-range drones, and the second is truce on the water, meaning no military operations in the Black Sea,' Zelensky added. He underlined that any such truce could only be seen as a first step towards comprehensive agreement on ending the war and providing security guarantees to Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian leader, the release of all prisoners of war could also be a means of establishing 'basic trust.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bytvq00pi1g	2025-03-06T10:13:03-08:00	
Syrian forces clash with Assad-linked militants in escalating vio...	Fighters loyal to Syria's ousted leader Bashar Assad mounted a deadly, well-planned attack on government forces on Thursday, authorities said, in some of the worst violence against the government since Islamist-led rebels seized power. At least 13 members of the security forces were killed in the clashes in the coastal region of Jableh, the government-aligned Syria TV reported. The regional security chief said many members of the security forces had been killed and wounded in the attack by 'remnants of the Assad militias.' It marked a sharp escalation of tensions in the coastal area that forms the heartland of Assad's Alawite sect and has emerged as a big security challenge for interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa as he works to consolidate his control. Thursday's attack involved several groups of Assad-aligned militias who targeted security patrols and checkpoints in the Jableh area and surrounding countryside, the chief of security in Latakia province, Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kunaifati, said. The attack 'resulted in the fall of many martyrs and wounded among our forces', he added in statements published by the Interior Ministry. Security forces had absorbed the attack in the countryside around Jableh, though clashes were ongoing inside the city, he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk9lfuwsje	2025-03-06T10:09:05-08:00

Hamas dismisses Trump threats, says escalation will lead to death...	Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida warns that a return to fighting in Gaza will mean death for hostages, emphasizing Trump threats will not change their position; Trump’s Mideast envoy emphasizes the US commitment to securing hostage releases, signaling a new era of zero tolerance Amid stalled negotiations over the continuation of the hostage deal and the conflicting demands between Israel and Hamas regarding either extending Phase I or transitioning to Phase II, Abu Obaida, the spokesperson for Hamas' military wing, issued a threat Thursday evening. He warned that any escalation by Israel or a return to fighting would result in the deaths of hostages held by Hamas. Abu Obaida claimed Hamas is 'prepared for any scenario' and stated that the organization 'committed to the world and the mediators to uphold the terms of the cease-fire and the exchange of prisoners. Despite all of Israel's attempts to evade the agreement, we chose to continue honoring it.' He went on to accuse Israel of attempting to avoid fulfilling the stages of the agreement, saying: 'The enemy leadership is trying to evade the deal, seeking American cover to carry out aggression against our people.' In a cynical tone, Abu Obaida remarked that 'the world witnessed the good health condition' of the hostages and 'how the resistance treated them well.' However, he also issued a direct threat to Israel: 'What the enemy didn’t achieve through war, will similarly not be achieved through threats or tricks. Those will only lead to disappointment for the enemy and won’t result in the release of hostages.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He said that Hamas has 'proof of life' for the living hostages but warned that 'this could change in war. Any escalation or aggression against our people will result in the deaths of hostages.' Abu Obaida also responded to threats made earlier by U.S. President Donald Trump against Hamas, stating these threats reflect 'weakness and a sense of humiliation.' Trump envoy highlights US. commitment to hostages' release Meanwhile, Trump’s envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, addressed the issue Thursday evening. 'I think there’s nothing more important for this country (United States) than standing behind its citizens abroad. The country is their backbone,' he said. Boehler emphasized, 'President Trump has made this issue a top priority.' Boehler continued: 'You saw what the president said yesterday to Hamas — that taking an American citizen or any other citizen will be met with the harshest response possible. I’ve worked directly with the president, Secretary of State Rubio, and Advisor Waltz to ensure our policy is 100% focused on bringing the hostages home. The president has no hesitation in taking action, and we will all back him. We are entering a new era where it’s unacceptable to hold American citizens hostage.' Trump threatened Hamas after a visit on Wednesday with a delegation of former Israeli hostages at the White House. 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,' he warned in a post on his Truth Social site. 'I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.' The delegation of former Israeli hostages visiting Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday presented him with a gold plaque engraved with the Talmudic phrase, 'Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.' Trump told the former hostages that: 'We said you had to be freed and it was in their [Hamas’] best interest to release you. We really pushed for it, and something happened. Now we have to get the others out.' After the meeting, Trump called on Hamas to immediately release all hostages held in Gaza in what he called his 'last warning' to them while also urging the terror group's leadership to leave the Palestinian enclave. Trump posted on Truth Social: 'This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance. Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!' Trump said there will be 'hell to pay later' if hostages are not released. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1taylwj1l	2025-03-06T09:48:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/rylgkGJ0Kyg/rylgkGJ0Kyg_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

He also said, 'Today we are talking about a continuation of Phase I or Phase II. I don't really care what we call it, what we call what we call this, are we going to have a resolution? Are we going to have a peace deal? Are we going to get all of those hostages home, which is the aim of the Trump administration and and that that's going to require some good, reasonable humanitarian action on the part of Hamas, and it's time for them, I think, to gain some political capital and show what they're capable of doing.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byksivdiye	2025-03-06T09:40:17-08:00

Two Israeli tourists were injured in a brawl with transgender individuals in Phuket, Thailand; The incident, linked to disputes over stealing clients, ended with injuries, arrests and a reminder of travel guidelines issued by the Israeli Embassy for respectful behavior abroad Two Israeli tourists were injured on Wednesday during a brawl with transgender individuals on the Thai island of Phuket. Footage shared on social media shows at least one of the tourists fleeing from the scene after the physical confrontation. Thai media reported that the incident occurred on the famous Bangla Road, located in the nightlife district. According to the deputy commander of the Patong Police Station, the conflict began when four to five transgender women confronted two Thai women, accusing them of stealing Israeli clients. When the Israeli tourists tried to intervene, they found themselves caught up in the altercation. In the video, the two tourists are seen running down Bangla Road while the transgender individuals chase after them. Both the Israeli tourists and the transgender individuals sustained injuries. The tourists remained at the scene and were treated by Thai emergency services, which evacuated them to Patong Hospital. Photos from the incident published in Thailand show that at least one of the tourists' shirts was torn during the fight. Later, authorities identified three of the transgender individuals involved in the incident as Suwicha, 20; Apisit, 28; and Siwapoom, 29.

According to reports from Thailand, the Israeli tourists also were charged with the same offense. Last month, the Israeli Embassy in Thailand issued guidelines for Israeli travelers in the country to help them avoid getting into trouble. This followed a series of unpleasant incidents that have occurred recently across Thailand, particularly in the town of Pai. The guidelines, shared on the embassy’s Facebook page, outlined several basic rules to help Israelis enjoy their vacation without unnecessary complications. 'The Thai people respect and welcome Israeli tourists. Maintain this relationship, and don’t let isolated incidents damage the reputation of the hundreds of thousands of Israeli tourists who visit Thailand every year. It’s in our hands!

New Ebola cluster detected in Uganda, Africa CDC says	A new cluster of Ebola cases has emerged in Uganda, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said on Thursday, adding that efforts were being made to intensify monitoring and contact-tracing measures. Uganda declared an outbreak of the highly infectious and often fatal hemorrhagic disease in January in the capital Kampala after the death of a male nurse at the East African country's sole national referral hospital for Ebola cases. A second Ebola patient who died was a four-year-old child, the World Health Organization said on Saturday, citing the country's health ministry. Africa CDC official Ngashi Ngongo told reporters that since the last briefing on Thursday a new cluster with three confirmed and two probable cases had been detected. Overall, Uganda has recorded 14 cases and two deaths since the start of the outbreak, according to Africa CDC. 'Ebola in Uganda is a very important challenge, especially the resurgence of these cases. However, I think everything is being done in the country to intensify the monitoring,' Ngongo said told the briefing. Uganda last suffered an outbreak in late 2022 which killed 55 of the 143 people infected. That outbreak was declared over in 2023.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syy9alvi1e	2025-03-06T08:40:01-08:00

Israeli man transported bus bomb terrorist for 400 shekels, indic...	A resident of Holon has been indicted for driving the terrorist who planted explosive devices on buses in Bat Yam and Holon last month; According to the indictment, the terrorist spoke Hebrew, and the driver believed he was a resident of Jaffa; Judge ordered him released to one month of house arrest The Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court on Thursday ordered a resident of Holon to serve one month of house arrest after he was charged with assisting the terrorist who planted explosive devices on buses in Bat Yam and Holon. The indictment, filed on Thursday, accuses the driver of transporting an illegal resident but does not claim he knew he was aiding a terrorist. Despite the court’s decision, police opposed his release and issued a stay until a further hearing on Friday at 11:00 a.m. According to the indictment, the terrorist entered Israel on an unknown date and sought transportation from Bat Yam to the West Bank city of Ariel on the day of the attack. An intermediary, unaware of the terrorist’s identity, arranged for the ride for a fee of 400 shekels. Before the ride, the terrorist changed clothes to remove any scent of explosives. After reaching Ariel, he requested an additional stop near Zatra Junction for another 50 shekels, and then was dropped off near Tapuah Junction. Judge Benny Doron noted that 'the indictment does not state that (the driver)knew he was transporting a terrorist. His lawyer explained that the ride was arranged by another person who connected the two. The terrorist spoke Hebrew with an accent, and he believed he was a resident of Jaffa. Furthermore, no charges were filed against the intermediary, who has since been released.' While acknowledging the gravity of the case, the judge ruled that, without evidence of prior knowledge, the driver should be placed under house arrest with restrictions. The police objected to the decision, and a further hearing is set for Friday. The driver's attorney, Tzadok Khouri, told Ynet that 'the judge made a fair and balanced decision. He barred him from driving until the end of proceedings, but in the end this was much ado about nothing. If the judges had been more attentive earlier, we wouldn’t have reached this point. He was held under extremely harsh conditions without justification.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Before the hearing, the driver's father, Avraham, described his son’s arrest. 'The police came at four in the morning. I was on my way to synagogue when I saw them and thought they were Hamas as they burst through the doors. His wife was terrified — they have young children. This is not right. The kids were there. It happened 15 days ago, and I haven’t seen my son since.' The attempted bus bombings took place two weeks ago when explosive devices detonated on three buses parked in two lots in Bat Yam. No injuries were reported. A total of four bombs were planted — three exploded in two separate locations, while the fourth was discovered and neutralized near Wolfson Medical Center in Holon. Police stated that the devices weighed approximately five kilograms and were equipped with timers. At least one had the words 'Revenge from Tulkarm' written on it. Hamas’ Tulkarem Battalion later hinted at responsibility for the attack. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj0027uvi1l	2025-03-06T08:23:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/21/r177LmB51g/r177LmB51g_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel fears sharing intelligence with U.S. due to Trump's rappro...	NBC reports that Washington's allies are considering reducing the intelligence they share with the US as its relations with Moscow warm; The concern is that the identity of foreign assets could be accidentally revealed; No action has been taken yet, but a source says that 'discussions are already underway' The rapprochement between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump is worrying not only for Ukraine. According to a report on NBC Thursday, Israel and other allies of Washington are wary of sharing intelligence with the U.S. due to the warming of relations between the Kremlin and the White House. Among the countries that are wary of sharing information are the other members of the Five Eyes spy alliance - Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; and other countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. According to the report, the main concern of the countries and the intelligence agencies operating in them is that the identity of foreign assets, who they cooperate with, could be accidentally revealed due to this dramatic rapprochement between Washington and Moscow. According to several sources who spoke to NBC, 'discussions on the subject are already taking place.' However, one source said that no real action has yet been taken. The sources noted that the U.S. partnership is examining how protocols regarding intelligence sharing can be reexamined in a way that takes into account the warming of relations between the Trump administration and the Kremlin. The review is part of a wider examination of the wide range of relations with Washington among many U.S. allies, including diplomacy, trade and military cooperation, as well as intelligence matters, the sources said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: NBC noted that every intelligence agency treats its obligations to its foreign agents and sources as 'sacred,' and is committed to protecting their security and identities. Senior officials who are no longer in office told the U.S. news network that anything that would jeopardize this commitment would constitute a breach of trust between agents and sources and intelligence organizations, and that could lead some spy services to hold back on some information sharing with Washington. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1d8oswj1l	2025-03-06T07:24:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/BJfOEBPskl/BJfOEBPskl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

1st sign of life after 517 days: Freed hostage calls out to capti...	Sasha Troufanov revealed that he was held in captivity with Rom Breslavski, marking the first confirmation that Breslavski is alive; 'Rom, I hope my voice brings you light and hope in the dark place where you are,' Troufanov said in an emotional message; Meanwhile, the mother of kidnapped soldier Tamar Nimrodi, who has yet to show any sign of life, told Ynet: 'This is the moment of truth—we must bring them home' Recently freed hostage Sasha Troufanov revealed that he was held with Rom Breslavski for a short time. In a recorded message, Troufanov urged Breslavski to 'stay strong and not give up,' addressing him in both Hebrew and Arabic. Troufanov, who was held by Islamic Jihad, noted that other hostages, including Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, also were not heard from until their release. 'I am speaking today with a message I cannot keep just for my loved ones,' he said. 'On one hand, I am so happy to be home, to see my mother, my dear friends, my girlfriend, and all the people who prayed and hoped for me. But on the other hand, I cannot disconnect from the hostages who are still there in Gaza, the people left behind.' 'I think a lot about my friends, especially about one person I met briefly in captivity — Rom Breslavski,' Troufanov continued. 'Rom, I hope my voice brings you light and hope in the dark place where you are. I want you to know that I, your friends, your family, and all of Israel are praying for you and doing everything to secure your release.' Speaking in Arabic, he added: 'I hope this message reaches you. Stay strong and don’t give up. We are with you and praying for you. The redemption of captives is a supreme value in Judaism — please, do not leave them behind. Do everything possible to bring them home safely and as quickly as possible.' Rom Breslavski was working security at the Nova music festival in Re’im on October 7 when he was kidnapped. His family has received multiple testimonies of his heroism that day, as he helped others escape the attackers. 'I came here to deliver a clear and urgent message: Our mission will only be complete when all the hostages are back home,' said his father, Ofir. 'Rom was kidnapped while rescuing people from the massacre. He showed unimaginable bravery, risking his life to save others. Now, it’s our turn to save him. How can it be that someone who sacrificed himself for others is not considered a humanitarian case?' Turning directly to his son, he added: 'Rom, you are a hero. We love you and are with you. We will fight for you until our last drop of blood.' Overnight, Troufanov visited the Western Wall with his partner, Sapir Cohen, who was freed after 55 days in Hamas captivity. 'I came here, to the Western Wall, to give thanks and to experience this deeply emotional moment,' he said. 'I toured the tunnels beneath the Wall after spending so much time in the tunnels of Gaza’s darkness. Here, I felt the holiness of this place, and I heard about all the prayers that were said for me. Keep giving thanks for what you have, and keep praying for those who are still there.' During the visit, a special thanksgiving prayer, Mizmor LeTodah (Psalm of Gratitude), was recited in honor of the release of Sasha and Sapir, along with prayers for the swift return of the remaining hostages. Freed hostage’s partner breaks silence: ‘Our fight isn’t over’ Earlier in the day, Ziv Aboud, the partner of freed hostage Eliya Cohen, shared her emotions for the first time since his return. 'Since Eliya came home, I have been silent. Not because I had nothing to say, but because I needed a moment to breathe, to process, to feel again what I had lost for 505 days,' she wrote on Instagram. 'Today, I am breaking my silence — not because the pain is gone, but because it is time to say thank you. 'To all of you who fought, who prayed, who never gave up — these words are for you. 'On October 7, I lost everything in an instant. The life I knew shattered, and Eliya — the love of my life — was ripped away from me into the darkness. I was left with overwhelming fear, endless uncertainty and a longing that has no end. '505 days of struggle, of unextinguished hope, of sleepless nights, of tears and cries, of searching for any shred of information, of wanting to feel that he was still somehow with me. 505 days of holding onto my faith with all my strength, refusing to give up, fighting alongside his family and extraordinary people to bring him home. 'And today, I can finally say: Eliya is home. I write these words and can’t believe it. I waited 505 days for this moment, imagined it, swore it would happen — and here it is. But I could not have done it alone. 'Thank you. Thank you to everyone who prayed, who believed, who fought with me. Thank you to the families of the hostages who became my family, who swore alongside me that we would not leave anyone behind. Thank you to the soldiers and fighters who brought Eliya home, and to the heroic fallen who gave their lives so that we could live. 'Thank you to the Hostage Families Forum, to everyone who stood with us, protested, shouted and demanded action. Thank you to you, dear people, who had my back, who lifted me up when I fell, who gave me strength when I felt I had none left. And a special thank you to Amit, our officer. 'But our fight is not over. Elia left behind brothers in captivity. I know exactly what it means — to wait, to count the days, to endure the darkness.

With love, Ziv and Eliya.' ‘We must save them — both the living and the dead’ Shai Wenkert, father of freed hostage Omer Wenkert, spoke to Ynet about his son’s time in captivity. 'Omer was held alone for about 190 days, from the 54th day of captivity onward,' he shared. 'For 500 days, he had no communication, no information at all.

'We have to save the hostages — there are still 59 left. People ask me, ‘What do you mean by saving them?’ You can save the living, and you can also save the dead. I’m not talking about resurrection — I’m talking about giving them a proper burial in Israel. We need to bring them back before they are lost forever.' Wenkert also shared how his son coped with solitary confinement. 'He had no choice but to talk to himself,' he said. 'He had to practice a form of self-mentoring and meditation, constantly visualizing and describing to himself what his escape would look like. And somehow, it worked.' A mother’s demand: ‘Bring our soldiers home’ Herut Nimrodi, mother of kidnapped soldier Tamir Nimrodi, spoke to Ynet about her son, from whom no sign of life has been received. She revealed that she is set to meet with newly appointed IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir. 'There is a meeting scheduled, and I am waiting to hear from him and understand his approach to this very specific issue, as a leader responsible for the soldiers,' she said. 'We demand that he stand before decision-makers and fight for their return,' she added. 'The idea that soldiers can be left behind is unthinkable. Every hostage exchange so far has excluded our sons — we have known from the start that they were not included.

US mulls plan to disrupt Iran's oil by halting vessels at sea	Trump administration weighing plan to inspect Iranian oil tankers at sea under global anti-proliferation initiative, sources say; move, part of Trump's 'maximum pressure' campaign, aims to delay Iranian crude shipments but risks retaliation from Tehran U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering a plan to stop and inspect Iranian oil tankers at sea under an international accord aimed at countering the spread of weapons of mass destruction, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Trump has vowed to restore a 'maximum pressure' campaign to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports to zero, in order to stop the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Trump hit Iran with two waves of fresh sanctions in the first weeks of his second-term, targeting companies and the so-called shadow fleet of ageing oil tankers that sail without Western insurance and transport crude from sanctioned countries. Those moves have largely been in line with the limited measures implemented during former President Joe Biden's administration, during which Iran succeeded in ramping up oil exports through complex smuggling networks. Trump officials are now looking at ways for allied countries to stop and inspect ships sailing through critical chokepoints such as the Malacca Strait in Asia and other sea lanes, according to six sources who asked not to be named due to the sensitive subject. That would delay delivery of crude to refiners. It could also expose parties involved in facilitating the trade to reputational damage and sanctions, the sources said. 'You don’t have to sink ships or arrest people to have that chilling effect that this is just not worth the risk,' one of the sources said. 'The delay in delivery ... instills uncertainty in that illicit trade network.' The administration was examining whether inspections at sea could be conducted under the auspices of the Proliferation Security Initiative launched in 2003, which aims to prevent the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. drove that initiative, which has been signed by over 100 governments. This mechanism could enable foreign governments to target Iran's oil shipments at Washington's request, one of the sources said, effectively delaying deliveries and hitting supply chains Tehran relies upon for revenue. The National Security Council, which formulates policy in the White House, was looking into possible inspections at sea, two of the sources said. It was unclear if Washington had yet approached any signatories to the Proliferation Security Initiative to test their willingness to cooperate with the proposal. John Bolton, who was the U.S. lead negotiator for the initiative when it was formed, told Reuters: 'it would be fully justified' to use the initiative to slow down Iran oil exports. He noted that selling oil was 'obviously critical to raise revenue for the government of Iran to conduct both its proliferation activities and support for terrorism.' The White House National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment. Iran's oil and foreign ministries did not respond to separate requests for comment. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told Iran's parliament on March 2 that Trump 'has once again signed an order sanctioning many of our ships at sea, leaving them uncertain about how to unload their oil and gas cargo'. He was referring to Trump's latest round of sanctions. Potential blowback Previous attempts to seize Iranian oil cargoes have triggered retaliation by Iran. The U.S. tried to interdict at least two cargoes of Iranian oil in 2023, under Biden. This prompted Iran to seize foreign ships - including one chartered by Chevron Corp, which sent crude prices higher. The current low oil price environment gives Trump more options to block Iranian oil flows, from sanctions on tanker companies to seizing ships, according to Ben Cahill, an energy analyst at the Center for Energy and Environmental Systems at the University of Texas. 'I think if prices stay below $75 a barrel, the White House has more latitude to look at sanctions that would affect, you know, supply from Iran and other countries. It would be much harder to do this in a $92 per barrel environment,' Cahill said. Aggressive U.S. action could cut Iran exports by some 750,000 barrels per day in the short term, he said, but the longer the sanctions are in place, the less effective they are as Iran and buyers figure out ways around them. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A speedy resumption of oil exports from Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region would help offset any fall in Iranian exports. Reuters previously reported that the White House is piling pressure on Iraq to allow Kurdish oil exports to restart or face sanctions alongside Iran. Despite U.S. sanctions in recent years, Tehran's oil exports brought in $53 billion in 2023 and $54 billion a year earlier, largely in trades with China, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates. Iran relies on oil exports to China for vital revenue. Russia, which faces restrictions on oil exports and broader Western sanctions, is similarly focused on shipping oil to buyers in China and India. Finland and other Nordic countries have warned in recent months of the dangers of ships sailing close to their shores and the environmental risks they pose to their shores in oil spills if there is an accident. While European countries have spoken about inspections of ships transporting Russian oil suspected of not having valid insurance, little action has been taken and none mooted for vessels hauling Iranian oil. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjbfgzdjjx	2025-03-06T03:58:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/05/23/9986634/9986634_239_500_538_303_0_small.jpg

Preparing for Iran? US strategic bomber joins Israeli fighter jet...	Israeli and US air forces hold joint drill featuring Israeli F-35i and F-15i jets alongside US B-52 bomber, strengthening coordination amid rising regional threats; American heavy bomber would be key in any potential strike on Iran’s deeply fortified nuclear sites The Israeli Air Force and U.S. Air Force conducted a joint aerial exercise this week, aiming to bolster military cooperation and enhance integrated operational capabilities, the IDF said Thursday. The exercise featured Israeli F-35i and F-15i fighter jets flying alongside a U.S. B-52 strategic bomber, practicing coordination in a range of operational scenarios. The drills were designed to strengthen connectivity between the two forces and improve their ability to address regional threats, the IDF said in a statement. The joint exercise was conducted under the framework of cooperation between the IDF and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), reflecting the growing strategic partnership between the two militaries, according to the statement. This exercise comes amid escalating concerns over Iran's advancing nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that as of February 8, 2025, Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% reached 274.8 kilograms, marking a significant increase of 92.5 kilograms since November 2024. This level of enrichment is nearing weapons-grade material, intensifying fears that Tehran is approaching nuclear breakout capability. The inclusion of a U.S. B-52 Stratofortress in the exercise is particularly significant. The long-range heavy bomber, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons, is a key asset in any potential military strike on Iran’s deeply fortified nuclear facilities. Iran’s main enrichment sites, including the underground Fordow complex and the Natanz facility, are buried beneath reinforced layers of concrete and rock, making them difficult targets for conventional fighter jets. The B-52, with its ability to carry Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs)—bunker-busting bombs designed to destroy hardened targets—would be essential in any operation to neutralize Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. These bombs, weighing up to 30,000 pounds, are specifically designed to penetrate deep into fortified structures before detonating.​ In response to regional developments, reports indicated last month that Iran has heightened its defensive measures, placing missile defense systems on high alert due to fears of potential joint military action by Israel and the United States. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b14czmwo1e	2025-03-06T03:32:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/ryWCPblDj1e/ryWCPblDj1e_0_121_2047_1153_0_small.jpg
Trump plans to revoke legal status of Ukrainians who fled to US, ...	U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is planning to revoke temporary legal status for some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled the conflict with Russia, a senior Trump official and three sources familiar with the matter said, potentially putting them on a fast-track to deportation. The move, expected as soon as April, would be a stunning reversal of the welcome Ukrainians received under President Joe Biden's administration. The planned rollback of protections for Ukrainians was underway before Trump publicly feuded with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. It is part of a broader Trump administration effort to strip legal status from more than 1.8 million migrants allowed to enter the U.S. under temporary humanitarian parole programs launched under the Biden administration, the sources said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b15nazdjyl	2025-03-06T02:59:35-08:00	
US envoy, mediators cite progress on second phase of hostage deal...	As Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas, his envoy met with the group's leaders and mediators from Egypt and Qatar to discuss Gaza's post-war future; sources call talks 'positive'; Israeli official says 'not aware of any progress' U.S. officials held talks with Hamas leaders, Egyptian and Qatari mediators on Wednesday night to discuss post-war governance in Gaza and the potential advancement of the second phase of a hostage deal, two Egyptian officials told Reuters. The discussions reportedly ended on a positive note, raising hopes for progress in negotiations. However, an Israeli official countered the reports, saying, 'We are not aware of any progress in talks on the second phase of the deal.' According to the Egyptian sources, U.S. and Egyptian officials discussed potential leaders for Gaza’s post-war administration, following revelations that American negotiators had held direct talks with Hamas representatives in Qatar. The talks focused on the fate of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander and four others killed in captivity. The Emirati news outlet The National reported that U.S. officials held three rounds of discussions in Qatar in January, involving hostage affairs envoy Adam Boehler and two other American representatives. Hamas was represented by senior figures Khalil al-Hayya, Zaher Jabarin and Bassem Naim. The meetings, coordinated by Egypt and Qatar, took place in a Doha suburb on January 19, shortly before a temporary cease-fire went into effect. Negotiations on the second phase of the hostage deal, which was supposed to begin on the 16th day of the initial agreement, has yet to take off. Last Saturday marked the formal end of the first phase, during which Israel sought to extend the truce in exchange for further hostage releases, humanitarian aid deliveries and Palestinian prisoner exchanges. Hamas, however, refused and insisted on negotiations for the next phase. The talks remain stalled, as Hamas rejects Israel’s conditions for ending the war and withdrawing from Gaza. Meanwhile, Egypt presented on Tuesday an alternative reconstruction plan for Gaza, diverging from Trump’s proposal to turn the enclave into a resort destination. The Egyptian plan calls for a return of the Palestinian Authority in some capacity, the formation of a civilian governance committee, a regional security force including personnel from Arab states and an oversight body involving Arab nations, the U.S. and the European Union. Reports indicate that names of potential Gaza administrators, discussed in U.S.-Hamas talks, had previously been mentioned by Egypt. The Trump administration dismissed the Egyptian proposal, arguing it does not address the devastation in Gaza, which, according to U.S. officials, is currently uninhabitable. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump previously suggested relocating two million Gazans to Arab countries like Jordan and Egypt before rebuilding the enclave under 'American ownership.' His proposal was swiftly rejected by Egyptian and Jordanian leaders, along with the Arab League. Trump: 'For Hamas leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza' News of the Trump envoy's talks with Hamas came just hours after the president issued a stern warning to Hamas leadership regarding the hostages, following a meeting with Israeli former captives. 'I have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance. Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!' Opening his post in Hebrew with 'Shalom Hamas,' Trump added, '[This] means Hello and Goodbye - You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you. Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted! I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.' Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that U.S. officials declined to specify whether Trump’s remarks implied direct military action against Hamas or unequivocal backing for Israel should it resume the war. In response, Hamas condemned Trump’s comments, saying, 'His threats are yet another example of the American administration’s complicity in the genocide of our people.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkffhbvjye	2025-03-06T02:50:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/H14TeuIoJg/H14TeuIoJg_360_359_2610_1469_0_small.jpg

WIZO to honor ex-hostage Emily Damari with special pin as symbol ...	Ahead of International Women’s Day, the World Zionist Organization honors story of 28-year-old former hostage who survived 471 days in Hamas captivity and became a global symbol of strength and triumph Ahead of International Women’s Day, which will be marked worldwide on March 8, the Department for Diaspora Affairs at the World Zionist Organization has chosen to honor the inspiring story of Emily Damari. Held in Hamas captivity for 471 days, she has become a symbol of Israeli resilience. Throughout her time in captivity, Damari demonstrated extraordinary determination in the face of inhumane conditions. Despite the hardships, she managed to maintain her spirit and convey a message of hope to those awaiting her return. The image of her bandaged hand upon her release—after losing two fingers due to gunfire from the terrorists who abducted her in the October 7 terrorist attack—has become a symbol of inspiration for many around the world. 'A model of determination and female strength' As part of this initiative, the Department for Diaspora Affairs designed a unique pin in the shape of Damari’s bandaged hand, aiming to spread the message of strength, resilience and Zionism within Jewish communities worldwide. The limited-edition pins were distributed to opinion leaders across the globe and to organizations that promote women’s empowerment in the public sphere, generating significant demand that underscores the broad impact of the message. The initiative encourages all who believe in the strength of the Israeli spirit to wear the pin and share Damari’s story on social media using the hashtag #ZionistSheroes. Attorney Neria Meir, head of the Department for Diaspora Affairs, emphasized: 'Emily’s story is a model of determination and female strength under inhumane conditions.

'It was the worst thing that anybody could go through,' said Aviva Siegel, describing the brutal conditions. 'One of the days, they handcuffed one of the boys that was with us. And when he came, he brought a cutter and he cut his hand — and smiled. They used to eat in front of us while they starved us.' Eli Sharabi, whose wife and two daughters were murdered on the day of the attack, recounted the suffering he endured over his 491 days in captivity. 'I've been suffering there from starvation, violence and humiliation daily. One time they broke my ribs, and I was so hurt that I couldn't breathe for a month,' he said.

A decorated Armored Corps officer and former deputy chief of staff, the 24th IDF chief is known for his strategic vision and commitment to ground forces; he takes on the role amid an ongoing war and possible renewed fighting in Gaza Eyal Zamir, 59, who began his service in the Armored Corps and advocated for the creation of a Missile Corps, has now officially taken office as the 24th chief of General Staff of the IDF. Zamir was born in Eilat. His father, an IDF lieutenant colonel, was stationed there, which led the family to settle in the Red Sea resort town. At 14, he moved to a military boarding school in Tel Aviv. His yearbook entry predicted a promising military future: 'a chief of staff at the very least!'—a prophecy realized today. During school breaks, he stayed with his grandfather, Aharon, who lived in Tel Aviv's Kerem HaTeimanim neighborhood. Aharon immigrated to Israel from Yemen in the 1920s, fought as a member of the paramilitary Irgun and was wounded twice. Zamir’s mother, born in Jerusalem, comes from the renowned Abadi family, famous for their biscuit manufacturing, which traces its roots to Aleppo. Zamir has served in the IDF for 38 years in a variety of combat and command positions. He enlisted in 1984 in the Armored Corps, later completing the Tank Commanders’ Course with honors before becoming an officer. In 1992, he was appointed operations officer for the 7th Armored Brigade, and two years later, he took command of the 75th Battalion. He subsequently served as the operations officer of the 162nd Division. In 2003, Zamir was appointed commander of the 7th Armored Brigade, and four years later, he took command of the 143rd Division. He later led the 36th Division. In 2012, he became military secretary to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and in 2015, he was appointed head of the Southern Command. His last military role, from 2018 to 2021, was as deputy chief of staff under Aviv Kochavi. In that capacity, he oversaw the implementation of the Momentum multi-year plan and managed the military’s support for the civilian sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and Operation Guardian of the Walls in May 2021. In 2023, as a retired general, he became the director-general of the Defense Ministry, where he played a key role in strengthening Israel’s military capabilities and maintaining strong ties with the U.S. He oversaw an unprecedented procurement operation of weaponry, including fighter jets and munitions, as well as bolstering domestic arms production. Now, officially taking over as IDF chief of staff, Zamir has been promoted to lieutenant general. He is the first tank officer to hold the position since David 'Dado' Elazar in the 1970s and also the oldest chief of staff in the IDF's history. Zamir holds a bachelor’s degree from Tel Aviv University and a master’s degree from the University of Haifa. He also completed management courses at the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia and the École Militaire in Paris. He resides in Hod Hasharon with his wife, Orna, and their three children. His son Ori, a major in the Armored Corps, has been fighting in Gaza since the war began and previously received the chief of staff’s commendation. His daughter Roni, a former officer in the Golani Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, was called up for reserve duty during the war. His youngest son, Itai, is 15 years old. Zamir is known for his disciplined and methodical leadership. He opposed downsizing the IDF’s tank forces, resisted shutting down an attack helicopter squadron and backed former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman’s plan to establish a Missile Corps. A vocal critic of overreliance on the Air Force, he has pushed to strengthen the IDF’s neglected ground maneuvering capabilities. He was Netanyahu’s favored candidate for chief of staff as early as 2018, but at the time, he was deemed inexperienced, having only served in one General Staff role—Southern Command. He was also considered in 2022 but lost out to Herzi Halevi. Zamir is well-regarded within the military and across the political spectrum. Before his appointment, senior government officials said that 'Zamir is trusted by Israel’s leadership and is the right person to rebuild the IDF after the failures of October 7.' At a meeting at President Isaac Herzog’s residence, outgoing Chief of Staff Halevi told Zamir, 'This house is a source of strength and support for the IDF to ensure the military remains a unique institution, above any political agenda—focused solely on national security.' He expressed confidence that Zamir would lead the IDF to new achievements and higher preparedness. In his inaugural speech, Zamir stressed that Israel remains in an existential war and that Hamas has yet to be defeated. He vowed to prioritize the return of the hostages still held in Gaza and called for drafting ultra-Orthodox men into the IDF to ensure an equal distribution of the national defense burden. 'On the morning of October 7, the IDF failed in its mission. The border was breached. Our enemies infiltrated our communities, massacring our children, our women, our brothers and sisters. But from the devastation, the Israeli people rose again, demonstrating their strength and unity in times of crisis. Soldiers and civilians alike engaged the enemy, fighting as individuals and in small units, often at the cost of their own lives. They showed us that we are one people,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zamir emphasized that the fight is not over. 'We achieved significant victories on the battlefield. We won battles in Gaza and Lebanon and struck targets in Yemen and Iran. Hamas has been dealt a heavy blow but has not yet been defeated. The mission remains unfinished. We will never forget the horrors of October 7. We will etch in our hearts the memory of our sons and daughters, pure of heart, fleeing from a festival in an open field, hunted by predators. We will remember the entire families, the terror-stricken faces of children and parents, slaughtered and burned. We will never forget the cries for help against the sheer evil of the murderers. We will not forgive. We will not forget. This is a war for survival! We will continue the fight to bring our hostages home and achieve victory.' As Zamir assumes his new role, he faces significant challenges beyond the ongoing war, including appointing a new deputy chief of staff and a new commander of the Southern Command. He will also oversee the integration of ultra-Orthodox recruits, the potential military collapse of Hamas in Gaza if the war resumes and possibly an unprecedented operation in Iran with U.S. support. Zamir met with Defense Minister Israel Katz and IDF General Staff members, where he announced the formation of an expert team led by retired Maj. Gen. Sami Turgeman to reassess the IDF’s October 7 investigations. Katz also approved Zamir’s recommendations to appoint Maj. Gen. Yaniv Assor as head of Southern Command and Brig. Gen. Itzik Cohen as head of the Operations Directorate. In his first meeting with the General Staff, Zamir presented his vision for transforming and expanding the IDF, focusing on bolstering the ground forces, which have deteriorated over the past decade. He declared that 2025 would be a year of war, with an emphasis on Gaza and Iran, while also consolidating achievements in other theaters. He underscored the importance of military victory and called the return of the hostages a moral obligation, ordering that their photos be displayed in his office until they are freed. Zamir also instructed the reestablishment of an additional tank brigade and the potential formation of a new infantry brigade. Furthermore, he decided to disband the Strategic and Iran Directorate and transfer its responsibilities to other divisions. Longtime friend Roni Marom described Zamir as a leader of unwavering integrity, saying, 'He will always put the IDF first, free of any external or political influence. He is a man of principles who will see things through to the end, no matter the cost.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1f5sruoyl	2025-03-05T23:57:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/05/HJTQaeLoJx/HJTQaeLoJx_1_402_2400_1350_0_small.jpg
Biblical inspiration: Israel’s most popular baby names of all tim...	New report reveals the most popular baby names in Israel from its founding to today, with biblical names dominating the list In recent years, Israel has seen a shift in most common baby names, with new names appearing on the list alongside long-time favorites. While the annual list of popular names is regularly published, this time, the Population and Immigration Authority also provided a historical overview of names given to newborns in Israel from the country's founding to early 2025. Eight of the ten most popular boys' names since Israel's establishment in 1948 have biblical origins. The most common is Yosef, in all its variations, followed by David. Muhammad ranks third, followed by four more biblical names — Moshe, and the three patriarchs, Avraham, Yaakov and Yitzhak. In eighth and ninth place are Michael and Daniel, which have gained popularity in recent years, while Alexander rounds out the top ten. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Among Jewish Israelis, the most common boys' name is David, with Yosef in second place. Seven of the next eight names also come from the Bible: Moshe ranks third, followed by Avraham, Yitzhak and Yaakov in fourth through sixth place. The list concludes with Michael, Daniel, Chaim and Shlomo. For girls, the most frequently given name across all sectors since Israel's founding is Sarah, followed by Rachel, Miriam and Esther. Hannah ranks fifth, with Rivka in sixth place, Yael in seventh and Michal, Tamar (which topped the list for many years) and Leah completing the top ten. The Jewish sector saw a shift in the top two spots. Rachel is the most commonly given name to Jewish baby girls, followed closely by Sarah. Unlike the boys' list, all ten of the most common Jewish girls' names have biblical origins. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk8zgrujkg	2025-03-05T23:12:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/09/15/H1Argwlbs/H1Argwlbs_0_80_1000_563_0_small.jpg
Life in limbo: Displaced Israelis face uncertain future as rebuil...	Over 250,000 Israelis remain displaced since October 7, with many torn between rebuilding their lives or waiting for a home that may never fully recover Since the devastating events of October 7, over 250,000 Israelis have been displaced, with tens of thousands still unable to return to their homes. In Kiryat Shmona, a northern city near the Lebanese border, more than half of the buildings lie damaged or destroyed, leaving residents grappling with an uncertain future. Among those displaced is Raz, a mother now living in a Tel Aviv hotel with her family. After over a year away from home, she has begun rebuilding her life in central Israel, though the emotional toll remains heavy. Meanwhile, Yaniv, a 23-year-old rapper from the north, clings to hope of returning despite the widespread destruction. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Volunteers like Naor and social worker Sima have stepped up to support evacuees, offering guidance, organizing activities and providing a sense of stability amid chaos. Yet challenges persist. According to recent reports, 58% of northern evacuees rate government assistance as insufficient and nearly 70% express hesitation about returning due to safety concerns and inadequate rebuilding progress. As thousands remain in temporary housing, families face difficult choices: rebuild in the north, start anew elsewhere or wait for promises of recovery that feel increasingly distant. Their stories highlight the human cost of displacement and the resilience required to navigate an uncertain path forward.

South Korea air force jets accidentally drop bombs on homes, inju...	Fifteen people were injured in South Korea on Thursday after bombs dropped by fighter jets landed in a civilian district, damaging houses and a church during military exercises in Pocheon, the Air Force and the fire agency said. The fire agency said in a statement that 15 people were wounded, including two who were seriously hurt. Pocheon is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) northeast of Seoul, near the heavily militarized border with North Korea. South Korea's Air Force said eight 500-pound (225kg) Mk82 bombs from two KF-16 jets fell outside the shooting range during joint live-fire exercises. 'We are sorry for the damage caused by the abnormal drop accident, and we wish the injured a speedy recovery,' the Air Force said in a statement. The accident was due to a pilot entering incorrect coordinates, said a military official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The official said that the two jets then dropped four bombs each, with all of them detonating.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1vgrruiyl	2025-03-05T22:55:27-08:00

Who are the US-Israeli hostages? The names behind Trump's diploma...	Edan Alexander stayed on base by choice; Capt. Omer Neutra and Staff Sgt. Itay Chen fell in battle; Gad and Judi Weinstein-Haggai, both in their 70s, shot while out for a walk; Trump administration holds talks with Hamas to free them; these are their stories The Trump administration held direct negotiations with senior Hamas officials in Qatar in an effort to secure the release of U.S.-Israeli hostages Edan Alexander, the late Omer Neutra, the late Itay Chen and the late couple Gad Haggai and Judy Weinstein-Haggai. Israel, which was informed before the talks began, said the negotiations did not yield a breakthrough. The White House, however, confirmed 'ongoing talks and discussions,' but declined to disclose any further details as there are 'American lives at stake.' These five hostages remain the focus of U.S. diplomatic efforts, with hopes that their release could pave the way for a broader deal securing the freedom of additional Israeli captives. Edan Alexander Of the five, Edan Alexander is the only hostage confirmed to be alive. Alexander, 20, grew up in Tenafly, New Jersey, and immigrated to Israel at 18 to enlist in the Golani Brigade. He lived with his grandparents in Tel Aviv and on Kibbutz Hatzor, which hosted his military cohort. A former competitive swimmer and extreme sports enthusiast, he is the eldest son of Yael and Adi Alexander, and brother to Mika and Roy. On October 7, Alexander was eligible for leave to spend time with his visiting mother, a right granted to lone soldiers. However, he chose to stay on base so the burden of weekend guard duty wouldn't fall solely on his comrades. During the attack, he managed to call his mother, telling her that a shrapnel fragment had struck his helmet but that he was unharmed. In November, Hamas released a video showing Alexander delivering a scripted message 421 days into his captivity: 'Every day here feels like an eternity, and the pain from inside grows from day to day.' Omer Neutra Captain Omer Neutra, 22, from Long Island, commanded Tank No. 3 on the morning of October 7. He and his crew—Nimrod Cohen, Oz Daniel and Shaked Dahan—were stationed at the White House military post near Nir Oz. When the attack began, they rushed to their tank and engaged in combat. The vehicle, believed to have been faulty, was hit and disabled. A widely circulated image of a burning tank in Hamas-controlled media that morning was later identified as theirs—the only tank from which the entire crew was abducted. For over a year, Neutra’s family had no confirmation of his fate until December 2024, when they were informed that he had been killed on October 7. Dahan’s body was recovered and buried, but Neutra and Daniel remain missing. The only survivor from the crew is Nimrod Cohen, who remains in captivity. Neutra, the son of Orna and Ronen and brother to Daniel, was raised in Long Island, where he was an active member of the Conservative Jewish youth movement. In his senior year, he served as regional president of the organization in New York. His deep connection to Israel led him to participate in a gap-year program at the Galil Elyon pre-military academy before making Aliyah. He later volunteered for the Armored Corps and pursued officer training, despite not being obligated to serve. A passionate athlete, he was also known for his love of cats. Itay Chen Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, 20, from Netanya, was killed and taken hostage while fighting alongside his tank crew from the 77th Battalion in Nahal Oz. When the attack began, he informed his parents about the rocket barrages and his imminent deployment. That was their last contact with him. For 158 days, Chen and his crew were listed as missing in action until it was confirmed that they had been taken hostage. His fellow crew members, Captain Daniel Perez and Matan Angrest, were also captured, while their fourth comrade, Tomer Leibovitz, was killed but not abducted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Chen, an American citizen through his father, Ruby, and a German citizen through his mother, Hagit, was the middle of three siblings, younger than Uri and older than Alon. In high school, he enjoyed hiking and served as a youth field guide. Before enlisting, he played competitive basketball. Despite confirmation of his death, his family has chosen not to hold a formal mourning period until his remains are returned. They have launched an international campaign advocating for hostage releases, meeting with diplomats and traveling multiple times to both the White House and Doha, Qatar. Gad Haggai and Judi Weinstein-Haggai Gad Haggai, 73, and Judi Weinstein-Haggai, 70, were abducted from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. On December 22, 2023, the kibbutz announced that Gad had been killed during the attack. A week later, on December 28, it was confirmed that Judi had also been murdered that same morning. The couple is survived by four children and seven grandchildren. Originally from Canada, Judi moved to Israel at 24, volunteering at Kibbutz Ein HaShofet, where she met Gad. She taught English at the regional school for years and later became a mindfulness instructor, helping children and adults manage anxiety in the conflict-ridden Gaza border region. A poet and yoga teacher, she began each morning by posting a haiku on Facebook—the last was on October 7. She was set to begin a new role using puppet therapy with children at Sha’ar HaNegev school after the High Holiday season. On the morning of the attack, the couple had gone for a walk. At 7:05 a.m., Judi called a kibbutz member, a volunteer paramedic, and reported that she and Gad had been shot. The paramedic attempted to dispatch an ambulance, but Hamas terrorists intercepted it and set it on fire. Gad’s children recognized his body being dragged into Gaza in a Hamas propaganda video on October 7, but authorities initially could not confirm his death. Gad, who had a lifelong passion for music, moved to Nir Oz with Judi after being offered a job managing the kibbutz dining hall. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1twfauo1e	2025-03-05T22:08:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/05/HyHnj4UiJe/HyHnj4UiJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

‘God is giving Israel a blank check’: Pro-Israel Christian leader...	A new Christian-led organization aims to shape US policy in favor of Israel, focusing on sovereignty over the West Bank and countering antisemitism In a show of growing confidence and political influence, pro-Israel Christian leaders gathered at the Friends of Zion Museum in Jerusalem on Tuesday to celebrate the Israel launch of the Conference of Presidents (COP) of Christian Organizations in Support of Israel. The event, a follow-up to a similar gathering in Washington, DC, last September, comes just two months into U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration—a time when Christian Zionist voices believe they have more power than ever to shape U.S. policy in Israel’s favor. The coalition aims to advance pro-Israel policies at the executive, legislative, and state levels while mobilizing grassroots efforts to strengthen U.S.-Israel relations and combat rising antisemitism in North America, explained Mario Bramnick, president of the Latino Coalition for Israel and a co-founder of the Conference of Presidents. Other co-founders include Rev. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council; Michele Bachmann, dean of the School of Government at Regent University and former U.S. congresswoman; and Luke Moon, executive director of the Philos Project. 'We believe that not one organization alone is able to accomplish it,' Bramnick said in his opening address. 'We will encourage all of the great work of so many different organizations that are helping Israel now in America. But we believe that a united voice will be a strong voice with the Trump administration, legislatively and on a state basis.' Bramnick stressed the need for unity, pointing to the way Israel’s adversaries align their efforts. 'Enemies of the West know how to unite,' he said, citing alliances between progressive leftists and Islamists in the United States and Europe, as well as coordination among terrorist groups. Now, he added, it’s time for Christian supporters of Israel to do the same. The Christian Conference of Presidents is modeled after the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations led by William Daroff. That organization unites more than 50 Jewish groups to address the Jewish community’s most pressing issues. However, Moon noted a key difference. 'There is probably less internal conflict,' he said, explaining that the Christian coalition has fewer ideological divisions. 'We just feel the need to sing from the same songbook,' he told The Media Line. The Christian COP plans to push several key issues, chief among them Israel’s sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. Judea and Samaria are Hebrew names, with biblical roots, for the area commonly referred to by the international community as the West Bank, a term first applied to the territory by the Jordanian government. Ralph Reed, founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said his organization has consistently supported sovereignty because it sees Judea and Samaria as the biblical heartland—Israel’s own 'Bible Belt.' 'That’s where Hebron is. That’s where Bethlehem is. It’s the birthplace of Jesus, the home of King David,' Reed told The Media Line. 'There is a lot there; it’s the country’s spiritual heartland.' Reed added that he and his supporters have always believed the land belongs to the Jewish people. But beyond that, he argued that the land-for-peace formula—once seen as a viable path—has failed. He pointed to rising radicalization among the Palestinian population, noting that a Ramallah-based think tank found that a majority of respondents supported Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack. Palestinian control of any areas in Judea and Samaria, Reed warned, 'poses a long-term danger to the security not only of the Israelis who are living in Judea and Samaria and legally doing so, but it poses a long-term security threat to the whole country. It’s not quite on the level of the powder keg that Gaza was prior to October 7, but it’s very close, and it’s the next thing to blow,' he told The Media Line. Reed said he supports a stepped-up IDF presence in the area and Israel’s right to extend sovereignty over the land for its own protection. He admitted it remains unclear how the Trump administration will approach the issue, but he believes the U.S. president will be supportive. When asked at a press conference last month, President Trump said he would announce his administration’s stance on the annexation of Judea and Samaria within four weeks. That press conference took place on February 5, meaning an announcement is expected within the coming days. Perkins also attended the event and has spent much of his current trip—his third visit to Israel since the current Israel-Hamas War began—in Judea and Samaria. 'I believe this is a moment in which we need to educate the evangelical community about what’s at stake here, and this is the ability of Israel to protect itself, but also to rightfully exercise authority over the land that God has given to them,' Perkins said. He recalled attending meetings in 2004, ahead of Israel’s disengagement from Gaza, when more than 8,000 Jewish residents were forcibly removed from Gush Katif in an effort to make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, he noted, Israel endured 18 years of terrorism and rocket fire, culminating in the October 7 attack. 'Judea and Samaria is 16 times the land mass of Gaza,' Perkins told The Media Line. 'It’s unworkable.' Perkins said his goal is to spend more time in the biblical heartland, meeting with residents, religious leaders, and officials. He hopes to bring back firsthand experiences to share with his followers. Several Israeli politicians have already taken steps in that direction. Last month, MK Ohad Tal introduced a bill to apply Israeli sovereignty throughout Judea and Samaria. In December, new legislation was proposed stating that establishing a Palestinian state in these territories would require either the approval of 80 Knesset members or a national referendum. At the B’Sheva Jerusalem Conference last month, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told ILTV News that Israel has already been implementing de facto sovereignty in these areas for the past two years. He said Israel is building houses and roads and helping to establish a reality on the ground that would make it difficult to give up the land. ‘God is giving Israel a blank check’ In the evangelical Christian community, President Trump is widely seen as the most pro-Israel president in the country’s 77-year history. Many participants at Tuesday’s event described his presidency as Israel’s window of opportunity. 'The Biden administration was not a friend of Israel,' said Bramnick. 'It was literally trying to undermine Israel at every stage and pushing the atrocities, pushing a two-state solution, which would only benefit the genocide and reward the genocide. I am so grateful to God that there is a new sheriff in town and that God gave us President Donald Trump—not only to make America great again but to make the world and Israel great again.' Bramnick said he was among a select group of evangelicals who met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his recent visit to Washington. That meeting took place just before President Trump suggested relocating Gazans and building a Gaza Riviera under U.S. authority. 'I literally feel God is giving Israel a blank check to begin to write upon, to dream again,' Bramnick said. 'God’s hand is upon Israel, and this is your opportunity to arise in what God has for your nation.' Reed echoed Bramnick’s sentiments, adding that Christians fully support whatever actions Israel needs to take to eradicate terrorism from its borders. U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff is expected in the region in the coming days to push forward an extended Phase I of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal. But Reed dismissed diplomatic solutions, arguing that past negotiations have failed. 'I don’t see any other solution based on their track record other than hitting them high and hard militarily,' he said. Reed added: 'I am here to say that if Israel feels like it needs to take further military action in Gaza or anywhere else in order to protect its legitimate security interests, it will have our full support.' Many analysts argue that the Trump administration’s plan is unrealistic, if not illegal. Meanwhile, the Arab world has dismissed the proposal, putting forward its own alternatives. ‘US and Israel are intertwined’ Reed explained that Donald Trump’s 2024 reelection strengthened America’s conservative and faith-based communities. He said the Republican candidate’s victory clearly showed Americans wanted Democrats out. 'You could debate which contributed the most: Was it inflation? Was it the high cost of housing and groceries? Was it just a general feeling that the economy and the country were on the wrong track because those numbers were historically high? Was it the border? Was it all these radical woke policies, including the gender agenda or the trans agenda? I think the answer is that it was sort of all of the above. It was the radical social agenda combined with an amazing level of incompetence in both foreign affairs and domestic policy,' Reed contended. 'I think the American people had enough.' Evangelical Christians were a key voting bloc for Donald Trump, and Reed believes President Trump will reciprocate their support. He noted that American Christians—especially evangelicals—have a deep, biblical connection to Israel, and the president understands that. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, beyond faith, Reed said, the U.S. and Israel are intertwined for strategic reasons. 'Israel faces Iran on the threshold of obtaining a nuclear weapon and its military proxies, which are designed to eliminate the State of Israel off the face of the earth and to drive Jews into the sea. And they may be crazy, but they have to be taken seriously. You know, as with Hitler, you should believe what they say. They hate Jews. They hate Christians. Israel is the little Satan. America is the big Satan,' Reed told The Media Line. 'Since the fall of the Shah in 1979 and the establishment of an Islamist dictatorship in Tehran, Iran has been the most destabilizing force, not only in the Middle East but arguably in the world.' 'We’re here to simply say to the Israeli people and to their government that we stand with them,' Reed continued. 'We fully support them in this struggle. We will provide whatever they need. There is no substitute for victory.' Perkins added that evangelicals are not fair-weather friends. He emphasized their unwavering support as 'people of the book'—meaning people of faith. 'We want to make it unequivocally clear that we stand with the Jewish people and Israel,' Perkins said.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to begin dismantling the U.S. Department of Education, fulfilling a key campaign promise, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The order instructs newly appointed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to 'take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure.' McMahon, confirmed for the role earlier this week, told department staff that her mission is to 'return education to the states' and eliminate federal bureaucracy. However, shutting down the department entirely would require 60 votes in the Senate, as many of its programs—such as funding for students with disabilities and federal student loans—are legally protected and enjoy broad bipartisan support.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byfqv2is1x	2025-03-05T20:35:36-08:00	
Yale Law School suspends employee over ties to Palestinian terror...	Yale Law School has placed an employee on 'immediate administrative leave' over alleged ties to Samidoun, the North American financial arm of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a group designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Israel.

Russian missile attack kills two, seriously injures many in Ukrai...	A Russian missile smashed into a hotel in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih late on Wednesday, killing two people and injuring 29, many of them seriously hurt, a municipal official said. Twenty of the 29 injured in the strike were in serious conditions and rescue operations proceeded past midnight, Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the city's military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine's Emergency Services, also posting on Telegram, said 14 people had been rescued from rubble at the hotel which suffered heavy damage. They posted pictures of crews making their way through piles of rubble outside the floodlit five-storey building and clambering up and down ladders. Smoke billowed from the top of the hotel, and virtually all its windows were blown out. A crane was deployed to reach upper levels. Kryvyi Rih, home town of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, has been a frequent target since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rydjmnio1g	2025-03-05T20:28:04-08:00	
What are the new chief of staff's main missions?	He needs to understand that the military does not pick its own missions,' according to Brigadier General (Res.) Nitzan Nuriel Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, newly appointed as Chief of Staff of the IDF, has three main missions, according to Brigadier General (Res.) Nitzan Nuriel, the former head of the Counterterrorism Bureau at the Prime Minister’s Office. Nuriel stated that two of these missions are not directly related to military operations. The first is addressing the IDF's budget—assessing how much the war has cost and formulating a long-term financial recovery plan. The second is managing the ultra-Orthodox recruitment process, a challenge that is both political and military. However, Zamir must determine how to approach it from a military standpoint. Lastly, Nuriel emphasized that Zamir must learn how to translate cabinet directives into military operations. 'He needs to understand that the military does not pick its own missions,' Nuriel said. 'He has to understand what the political echelon [is] looking for from him, try to figure out the details, and then launch military actions.'

Why should Jews make Aliyah in 2025?	Dr. Liraz Margalit: 'Young people have both the right and an incredible opportunity to shape Israel's future' Why should Jews make Aliyah in 2025? ILTV asked Eilon Gilad, the CEO of BELONG, and Dr. Liraz Margalit, a specialist in shaping people’s behavior, why now is the right time for young Jews to move to Israel. Here’s what they had to say: ILTV: Why is there such a push to bring young people to Israel right now? Margalit: Because this is the time to shape the future. There’s a concept called success momentum, and the momentum is here—right here, right now. Israel has just gone through a very difficult period, and young people have both the right and an incredible opportunity to shape its future. If they truly want to make an impact, this is the moment. Beyond momentum, we always say that Israel belongs to them. If they want to do something meaningful with their lives—to shape the future, to have a voice, to make their values heard—this is the time. They should seize this opportunity with both hands. ILTV: Your new aliyah campaign features Theodor Herzl. Why? Gilad: When we look at Theodor Herzl’s vision for Israel, he envisioned a liberal state. He wanted a nation that included everyone—from professors to thieves—a place that represented the full diversity of the Jewish people. Israel was founded as a home for every Jew in the world, and we want to ensure that all Jewish voices are heard here. Our goal is to continue Herzl’s vision by maintaining Israel as a home base for every Jew and embracing its diversity. We want to see a liberal, democratic, Jewish state. That’s why we started with Herzl. We went back more than 100 years—from Basel to Israel’s founding—and now, in the present, we are reshaping Israeli society. After the hardships of war and the challenges of recent years, we are rebuilding. ILTV: Antisemitism is rising globally. In the U.S., college campuses are facing major challenges. How do you talk to young Jews about this, and what is your message to them? Margalit: We don’t tell them to come to Israel because of antisemitism. We tell them to come because it’s their right. Even if everything in the world were perfect, they should still come. This distinction is very important. We emphasize that Israel is their country—not just a distant land mentioned in the Bible. We have an incredible community here, filled with liberal and democratic values, and we need more people who share these values. That’s why we encourage them to come—not out of fear, but because of their ideals. Gilad: I would add that building the State of Israel is an ongoing mission. The Zionist project isn’t finished—we are still ensuring that Israel lasts forever. If young Jews want to make a real impact, now is the time. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy7l00ouj1g	2025-03-05T19:48:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/HkZT1JoXJx/HkZT1JoXJx_0_185_1170_659_0_small.jpg
Trump warns Hamas after hostages' White House visit: ‘last warnin...	Freed hostages thank Trump for their release, while his administration pushes for direct talks with Hamas to secure the return of American Israeli captives; Trump warns terror group 'not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say' U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Hamas after a visit on Wednesday with a delegation of former Israeli hostages at the White House. 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,' he warned in a post on his Truth Social site. 'I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.' The delegation of former Israeli hostages visiting Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday presented him with a gold plaque engraved with the Talmudic phrase, 'Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.' Omer Shem Tov told the president: 'My family and I believe you were sent by God to release the hostages. You truly helped and you have the power to do it again.' Naama Levy added: 'You gave us hope when we were there.' Trump responded: 'So you didn't think you'd be freed until I came?' and Levy replied: 'Since you were elected, we heard you did everything to secure a deal as quickly as possible.' Eli Sharabi added: 'We were so happy. Now it needs to happen again — thank you.' Trump also told the former hostages that: 'We said you had to be freed and it was in their [Hamas’] best interest to release you. We really pushed for it, and something happened. Now we have to get the others out.' He told Doron Steinbrecher, 'Take care of yourself. We're doing our best — thank you, dear. Stay strong, your stories are horrifying. We'll get them out. You have a bright future ahead, I promise.' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum issued a statement before the meeting. 'The delegation, arriving in Washington amid stalled negotiations, will stress to senior officials the need for the immediate and complete release of all remaining hostages,' according to the statement. 'Members will thank the Trump administration for its commitment to bringing back all hostages and will share firsthand accounts of the horrors inside Hamas tunnels.' After the meeting, Trump called on Hamas to immediately release all hostages held in Gaza in what he called his 'last warning' to them while also urging the terror group's leadership to leave the Palestinian enclave. Trump posted on Truth Social: 'This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance. Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!' Trump said there will be 'hell to pay later' if hostages are not released. Witkoff seeks cease-fire extension Meanwhile, Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, whose visit to the region has been postponed several times, indicated he still intends to arrive soon but has asked Israel to maintain the cease-fire in Gaza until then. The request comes despite Hamas’ refusal to extend the first phase of the deal. Witkoff’s visit was initially scheduled for last week, then postponed to this week, then to the weekend. It is now planned for next week. The Trump administration has been in direct talks with Hamas regarding the release of American hostages in Gaza and a potential broader deal that could end the war. 'In discussions with the U.S., Israel expressed its stance on direct negotiations with Hamas,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said, hinting at its opposition to the move. A senior Israeli official familiar with the discussions told Ynet that Israel has been briefed on the negotiations, which are being led by Trump’s envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler. 'He has held several conversations with senior Hamas officials in Qatar,' the official said. 'The official goal is to secure the release of Israeli-American hostages, both living and dead, while also signaling to Hamas that, if they demonstrate goodwill and release hostages, it could pave the way for the second phase of the deal.' According to the official: 'The Americans have made the release of Edan Alexander, a U.S. citizen, their top priority. There are also four other American citizens classified as deceased.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The White House, on the other hand, said that Boehler 'has the authority to talk to anyone, and before that we consulted with Israel. We are holding talks with people around the world to advance the interests of the American people, and the president has demonstrated that he believes in that. The talks and discussions are ongoing and there is no intention to elaborate on them - American lives are at stake.' After the White House announcement, the Prime Minister's Office also issued an official statement, stating that 'in contacts with the United States, Israel expressed its opinion on direct talks with Hamas.' Although U.S. law prohibits negotiations with terrorist organizations, and Hamas is designated as such by Washington, there is an exception that allows the president’s envoy for hostage affairs to engage in talks specifically for securing the release of American hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sya2dh8syl	2025-03-05T14:33:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/05/ByxulZBUjkg/ByxulZBUjkg_49_54_544_307_0_small.jpg
Police clear pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia U, make arrests	U.S. police forces moved in to clear a pro-Palestinian protest at Barnard College, part of Columbia University, early Thursday after demonstrators refused to leave the library lobby they had occupied for hours.

Dozens of demonstrators calling to 'Free Palestine' occupy lobby of Barnard College's library building in protest of suspension of 'anti-Zionist' students; In 2nd such trespass in a week, they wore keffiyehs and masks, carried Palestinian flags and tore up the documents demanding they vacate the premises Dozens of pro-Palestinian students at Columbia University occupied the lobby of the Barnard College library Wednesday night in protest of the suspension of students who had participated in 'anti-Zionist' activities in classrooms, disrupting academic proceedings. The protesters, wearing keffiyehs and masks, carried drums, flags and signs reading 'Free Palestine' while calling for a global intifada. They demanded the immediate reversal of all suspensions and disciplinary actions against pro-Palestinian students. Barnard College administration swiftly issued an official statement warning that the protesters would be forcibly removed if they did not vacate the premises immediately. However, when demonstrators received the written notice, they tore it up in response. This was the second such takeover in a week. Six days earlier, another group of anti-Israel students occupied Barnard College’s administration building, blocking the dean’s office. In that incident, school officials offered to engage in dialogue if the protesters removed their masks, but they refused. The students vowed to continue their demonstrations until their demands are met, blocking hallways, banging on drums, and distributing pro-Palestinian pamphlets. Some protesters pushed security personnel attempting to enter the building, and one administrative staff member was hospitalized following the confrontation. Earlier in the night, more than 200 pro-Palestinian students and activists, including members of the ultra-Orthodox anti-Zionist group Neturei Karta, protested outside Columbia University’s campus building during a speech by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The event was organized by the Jewish student group Hillel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Columbia University has seen repeated pro-Palestinian demonstrations since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. In one of the most notable incidents last April, university officials called in the New York Police Department to remove protesters who had occupied Hamilton Hall after refusing to dismantle a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus. Then-president Minouche Shafik faced intense criticism for involving law enforcement, and the university later announced it would no longer allow NYPD officers on campus for protest removals. In August 2024, Shafik resigned, partly due to backlash over her handling of the demonstrations. Her successor, Katrina Armstrong, later issued a public apology to pro-Palestinian students for their treatment by police and the administration. The White House is closely monitoring the situation. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced strict measures against universities that permit 'illegal demonstrations,' including freezing federal funding and expelling students. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump stated that students involved in such protests would face arrest or permanent expulsion, depending on the severity of their offenses. The administration is also considering freezing $51.4 million in federal funding to Columbia University and conducting a comprehensive review of additional federal grants and contracts totaling more than $5 billion. The initiative marks the first major action by the federal task force on combating antisemitism, which is focused on enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Education Secretary Linda McMahon emphasized that institutions receiving federal funding must protect all students from discrimination and that the issues at Columbia raise serious questions about the university’s eligibility for continued public funding. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk9neb8oje	2025-03-05T12:47:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/05/rJ11dNm8jyx/rJ11dNm8jyx_0_0_573_330_0_small.jpg

Pro-Palestinian protesters confront Naftali Bennett at Columbia U...	Activists led by anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for Peace clash with former Israeli PM at Columbia University, accusing him of war crimes and opposing Palestinian statehood, as campus tensions over Gaza war simmer Hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists gathered at Columbia University on Wednesday to protest former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett, who was speaking at the university as part of a campaign against the BDS movement, which advocates for a boycott of Israel. The protesters, who chanted 'Free Palestine' and called for Bennett to be barred from speaking, accused him of being a 'war criminal.' In flyers for the demonstration, the anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) claimed Bennett had previously boasted about killing many Arabs and said he had 'no problem with that.' Another flyer quoted Bennett as saying he would do everything in his power to ensure that 'Palestinians will never have their own state,' and referred to Palestinian children as 'terrorists.' Despite the protests, Bennett entered the university and completed his lecture. He will continue his U.S. tour at Ohio University. The former prime minister made the decision to speak at universities known for their strong anti-Israel sentiment to engage with students in support of Israel. Bennett responded to the protest later on his Telegram account, writing, 'Anti-Israel BDS activists at Columbia University tried to stop me from speaking to students. They failed.' 'For two hours, I spoke with hundreds of students about the just war we are fighting against a horrific Islamist terror cult and our right to the land (I explained to them, in terms they understand, that we Jews are the Indigenous people of Israel). We do not remain silent in the face of violence,' he added.

France, UK, Germany condemn Israel's withholding of Gaza aid	European nations warns Israel against blocking humanitarian supplies to Gaza, saying it risks violating international law and should not be used as a 'political tool'; Israel must 'ensure full, rapid, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the population in Gaza' France, the United Kingdom and Germany Wednesday urged Israel to ensure the 'unhindered' delivery of humanitarian supplies to Gaza, warning against using aid as a 'political tool.' A fragile cease-fire since January 19 saw an influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza, before Israel on Sunday announced it was blocking deliveries until Palestinian terror group Hamas accepted its terms for an extension of the truce. 'We call on the government of Israel to abide by its international obligations to ensure full, rapid, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the population in Gaza,' the countries said in a joint statement. 'A halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza such as that announced by the government of Israel would risk violating international humanitarian law,' they said.

They included exchanges of Israeli hostages taken when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a transition to the deal's second phase, which should lead to a permanent end to the war. Of the 251 hostages taken on that date, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 the IDF has confirmed are dead. 'It is vital that the cease-fire is sustained, all the hostages are released, and continued flows of humanitarian aid to Gaza are ensured,' the three European nations said.

Hostages' families visit UN Human Rights Council after being reco...	Hostage families spoke at a Geneva event following a UN report recognizing them as victims of torture; 'Forced separation of children from parents is moral and legal crime' The families of hostages Nimrod Cohen, Omri Miran and Elkana Bohbot met Wednesday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, and participated in an event organized by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in collaboration with the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists (IJL), with support from the German government. The meeting followed a report presented Tuesday at the Human Rights Council in Geneva by Dr. Alice Edwards, the UN special rapporteur on torture. The report determined that the families of hostages should be recognized as victims of torture due to the abduction of their loved ones and the continued lack of information about their fate. 'Even after 515 days, neither my daughters nor I can fully process what happened that day,' said Yishai Lavi Miran, wife of Omri Miran. 'The consequences of that day are immense, both now and for the future, but we are still trapped in that moment. We are still hostages because Omri has not been returned to us.' She described the painful questions her young daughters ask daily: 'Why is Daddy still in Gaza?'; 'When will Daddy Omri come home from Gaza?'; 'Mom, have you brought Daddy back from Gaza?'; 'My daughters live in constant uncertainty about the person they love most—their father. Their separation anxiety is felt every single moment,' she added. She also highlighted the ongoing plight of other fathers still held in captivity. 'Four fathers remain alive in Hamas captivity: Omri, David, Elkana and Maxim. Eleven other fathers were killed and are still being held by Hamas, preventing their children from finding closure,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'When we talk about children's rights, I want you to think of Roni and Alma—their fundamental right to live in safety was stolen from them on October 7. Their basic right to freedom was taken away. But above all, their right to live with their parents was ripped from them that day. 'We always promise our children that we will do everything to build them a better world. I need you to send a clear, unequivocal message: Omri must be freed for Roni and Alma. I ask you to raise your voices, to truly consider my daughters' best interests, their basic rights, and to help us bring Omri and all the fathers back home.' Rivka Bohbot, wife of Elkanah, reinforced the urgent call for action: 'Now, more than ever, based on testimonies from released hostages and the report by Alice Edwards, we know that the hostages are enduring severe torture. This is not speculation — it is a horrific truth. 'Israeli men are being tortured daily: shackled for months, completely isolated, suffering from starvation. They are imprisoned in brutal conditions, deprived of their most basic rights, reduced to mere shadows of themselves — living corpses struggling to survive. Anyone with a conscience, anyone who believes in justice and humanity, must ask themselves: How can we, as a global society, allow this to continue?' Bohbot stressed the violations of international law: 'The international conventions are clear — every child has the right to life, to proper development, to love, and to family. The forced separation of children from their parents is not just an emotional disaster—it is a moral and legal crime. 'Every day that passes without these children hearing their father's voice, feeling his touch, or receiving his embrace inflicts irreversible damage. And if there is one thing we cannot accept, it is indifference. We must not become numb to this. We must not stop calling for help. Because every moment the world remains silent, every day the international community fails to do everything in its power to bring the hostages home—the world fails, over and over again.' She concluded with a vow to her children: 'And to you, our beloved children, I promise: We will not be silent. We will fight so that you can live in a world where your father is beside you, holding you, stroking your hair, telling you bedtime stories. A world where you will no longer have to ask, 'Where is Daddy?'—because he will be here, with you, exactly where he belongs.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk110xmljkg	2025-03-05T10:41:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/05/ryb1SbLoJe/ryb1SbLoJe_0_230_1280_721_0_small.jpg

A hijacked democracy': Justice Minister Yair Levin moves to dism...	Justice Minister Yariv Levin has initiated proceedings to dismiss Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, citing 'improper conduct' and fundamental disagreements with the government, while urging an urgent vote on the matter. The move has sparked fierce opposition, with critics, including Yair Lapid, condemning it as an attack on the rule of law, while Levin had reportedly been preparing for this step behind the scenes Israeli Justice Minister Yariv Levin has formally requested that Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs convene a government meeting to discuss the dismissal of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. In a letter, Levin stated that 'the government expresses no confidence in the attorney general due to her improper conduct and the ongoing, fundamental disputes between her and the government, which prevent effective cooperation.' Levin emphasized the urgency of the matter, urging Fuchs to schedule the meeting as soon as possible to allow all ministers to attend. 'The presence of an overwhelming majority of ministers is essential,' he wrote. The justice minister criticized the current structure of the attorney general’s role in Israel, calling it an anomaly in democratic systems. 'In no Western democracy does an attorney general serve as a non-political appointee carried over from one government to the next while also wielding extraordinary powers that extend far beyond legal counsel. Over time, this has made the attorney general one of the most powerful figures in government, with no parallel anywhere in the world,' he argued. Levin accused Baharav-Miara of undermining democratic principles while claiming to uphold them. 'She has twisted the concept of 'rule of law' into a cynical and dogmatic tool, much like a medieval church acting 'in the name of God,'' he wrote. 'Under her leadership, the attorney general's office has become a politically oppressive institution, at times even aggressive and overbearing. She operates as an extension of the government’s opponents, using every means at her disposal to thwart the will of the voters.' Political maneuvering behind the move Levin had initially planned to delay the move until after legislation on the Public Complaints Commissioner and judicial appointments committee reform was completed. However, with delays in the judicial appointments bill and mounting pressure from Likud ministers, he decided to push forward. In recent weeks, Levin has been gathering materials in preparation for the dismissal process. He has also begun assembling a public committee, chaired by retired Supreme Court President Asher Grunis, to review the case. Levin has approached the Knesset Constitution Committee and Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana to appoint a lawmaker to the committee and requested that a former justice minister or attorney general also be included. The possibility of dismissing Baharav-Miara has been under consideration for months. In November, Ynet reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was weighing the move. A senior government official at the time noted that public clashes between Baharav-Miara and lawmakers on the Constitution Committee, led by Knesset lawmaker Simcha Rothman, were 'not coincidental' and that Netanyahu was increasingly confident about proceeding with her removal. Opposition leaders fiercely condemned Levin’s move. Yesh Atid head and Opposition Leader Yair Lapid accused the justice minister of attempting to dismantle Israeli society during wartime. 'Yariv Levin, one of the chief architects of the October 7 disaster, has learned nothing. He is harming the country, undermining the rule of law, and damaging the war effort. His attempt to dismiss the attorney general is criminal, violent, and unconstitutional. We will do everything necessary to stop it,' Lapid declared. National Unity leader Benny Gantz called the move 'a disgrace.' 'In a functioning democracy, a justice minister who dismantles democracy and sows division would be fired. In Netanyahu’s October 7 government, he seeks to fire the attorney general instead. I warn you again, Netanyahu — stop tearing the country apart,' Gantz said, vowing to fight the dismissal through all legal means. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: MK Gilad Kariv of the Democrats party labeled the move 'a watershed moment for Israeli democracy,' accusing Levin and his allies of attempting to undermine the legal system to shield Netanyahu from prosecution and exempt ultra-Orthodox youth from military service. 'This is political violence, anti-democratic, and anti-patriotic, and it must be met with fierce resistance in the streets, in public squares, and in the Knesset,' Kariv said. Merav Cohen of Yesh Atid warned that if the government proceeds with Baharav-Miara’s dismissal, it would be a direct violation of Netanyahu’s conflict-of-interest agreement, potentially triggering legal action to declare him unfit for office. Meanwhile, Likud Minister Miri Regev welcomed the move, calling it 'long overdue.' 'Finally! It’s time to remove the attorney general, who has consistently opposed the government, and put an end to bureaucratic overreach,' she said. The Legal Battle Ahead The process of dismissing an attorney general is complex. The Shamgar Commission, formed after the 1997 Bar-On–Hebron affair, determined that a government cannot fire an attorney general unilaterally. Instead, such a decision must be reviewed by a public committee led by a retired Supreme Court justice. The current head of this committee is Justice Asher Grunis. Under the commission’s guidelines, there are four grounds for dismissal: lack of competence, criminal investigation, inappropriate conduct, or prolonged and fundamental disagreements that prevent effective cooperation. Levin is citing the latter as the basis for his request. If the government moves forward with the dismissal, Netanyahu will not be able to participate in the decision due to his ongoing corruption trial. The committee will then review the case and, if it supports the dismissal, the government will need to defend its decision in expected petitions to the Supreme Court. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ac3giikg	2025-03-05T10:11:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/SySeRx4UJg/SySeRx4UJg_0_108_1181_665_0_small.jpg

Over 500 October 7 victims sue Palestinian Authority for $1.2 bil...	Lawsuit claims the Palestinian Authority and PLO directly financed and trained the terrorists behind the October 7 massacre, demands billions in compensation Over 500 victims of the October 7 massacre filed a lawsuit Wednesday in the Jerusalem District Court, seeking NIS 4.5 billion ($1.2 billion) in damages from the Palestinian Authority (PA), the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and former Palestinian Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee head Qadura Fares. The plaintiffs accuse the defendants of direct and indirect responsibility for the attack and its prior planning. Among the plaintiffs are the Akuni family from Netiv HaAsara — Ruti and Aryeh, along with their daughter Or, were murdered — the family of Ohad Yahalomi, who was laid to rest Wednesday and Yonatan Brosh, who was wounded in his home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz while his wife, Shoshana, was murdered before his eyes. 'Our lives were shattered in an instant on October 7,' Brosh said. 'At 6:50 a.m., terrorists broke into our home, throwing grenades and firing as they reached our shelter, which we thought would protect us. The bullets penetrated the door, killing Shoshi and wounding me. I fully support suing those who backed and participated in crimes against innocent civilians.' The lawsuit was prepared over the past year, during which testimonies were collected and victims were gathered at a dedicated center. Research teams in Israel and abroad investigated the attack’s planning and funding, with input from experts in security, medicine, intelligence and law. According to the plaintiffs, the lawsuit is based on 'pioneering research' alleging that the PA, the PLO and Fares — who oversaw payments to Nukhba terrorists and their families — were directly involved in preparing and financing the October 7 terrorists. The lawsuit details alleged PA and PLO activities between 2018 and 2023, including joint training exercises in Gaza involving terror factions under the so-called 'Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.' It also claims that terrorists were trained in Palestinian educational institutions run by Hamas and funded by the PA. 'The preparations and training for 'Al-Aqsa Flood' (the Palestinian name for the massacre) took place over five years and included multiple large-scale exercises across Gaza involving thousands of terrorists from various terror groups,' the lawsuit read. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'These activities required extensive logistical and governmental support from 'civilian' offices in Gaza. The funding for this support was provided by the defendants — the PA and PLO — through their budget allocations to Gaza’s 'civilian' authorities,' it added. The plaintiffs are seeking a ruling that the PA, PLO and Fares bear direct and indirect responsibility for the massacre and should be ordered to pay NIS 4.491 billion in compensation to the victims' families and survivors. They are also demanding punitive damages for deterrence. The lawsuit was filed by attorneys Dr. Gideon Fisher, Mordechai Haller and Shai Rubin on behalf of more than 500 plaintiffs and their families, all officially recognized as victims of terrorism who suffered physical or psychological harm from the October 7 attack and the ensuing Gaza war. ZAKA search and rescue head Dubi Weissenstern, one of the plaintiffs, said, 'Even after more than a year of war, many ZAKA volunteers and I cannot forget the horrors we saw in those first weeks. Despite our experience with disaster sites, the sheer scale, smells and nightmarish scenes deeply affected us and those around us. This lawsuit is the most justified action we can take.' Lt. Col. (res.) Maurice Hirsch, a member of the expert team, added: 'The PA bears no less responsibility than Hamas for the October 7 massacre. It has poisoned Palestinian society with anti-Jewish hatred, promoted the destruction of Israel and paid hundreds of millions of shekels annually to reward terrorists. 'It later provided them with international diplomatic cover. Since the PA is a driving force behind terrorism, it must be held accountable. Instead of funding terrorist salaries, it should be paying terror victims.' Attorney Dr. Gideon Fisher added, 'After filing three lawsuits against terror financiers in the U.S., we have now filed the first lawsuit in Israel against the PA and other defendants for their role in the October 7 massacre and their direct and indirect responsibility for the terror originating from Gaza. 'Alongside the military efforts and the hostage rescue mission, we see it as our duty to disrupt the terror pipeline through legal action and secure justice for the victims.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjrdvl8oyx	2025-03-05T08:08:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/H1lzd5Ki9yx/H1lzd5Ki9yx_0_253_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

US held direct talks with Hamas: Goal was to secure release of Id...	Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs spoke with senior Hamas officials in Qatar about freeing hostages with US citizenship held in Gaza, telling them that demonstrating goodwill by releasing hostages could pave the way for the second phase of the deal The Trump administration is holding direct talks with Hamas regarding the release of American hostages held in Gaza and the possibility of a broader deal to end the war, journalist Barak Ravid reported Wednesday. A senior Israeli official familiar with the discussions told Ynet that Israel has been briefed on the negotiations, which are being led by President Donald Trump’s envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler. 'He has held several conversations with senior Hamas officials in Qatar,' the official said. 'The official goal is to secure the release of Israeli-American hostages, both living and dead, while also signaling to Hamas that, if they demonstrate goodwill and release hostages, it could pave the way for the second phase of the deal.' According to the official: 'The Americans have made the release of Edan Alexander, a U.S. citizen, their top priority. There are also four other American citizens classified as deceased.' Although U.S. law prohibits negotiations with terrorist organizations, and Hamas is designated as such by Washington, there is an exception that allows the president’s envoy for hostage affairs to engage in talks specifically for securing the release of American hostages. Until now, Boehler has not been directly involved in negotiations for hostages held by Hamas, but he previously led efforts to secure the release of Elizabeth Tsurkov from Iraq. Against the backdrop of stalled talks, the White House has now opted to engage directly with Hamas leadership rather than relying on intermediaries. This shift also explains why Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, has not yet traveled to the region — suggesting Washington wants to first exhaust Boehler’s direct diplomatic channel.

'Our hearts ache and we don’t have words to express the shock and sorrow,' said Pardes Hanna-Karkur council head Yoni Hakimi after the announcement of the teen's death. 'Despite doctors' efforts, Yaheli didn’t survive and we had to part with her far too soon this morning. It was a despicable, brutal murder of a young, innocent girl whose only 'crime' was being a Jew in her homeland. 'She was full of life, dreams and aspirations, all cut short in unimaginable cruelty.

Leket Israel: The Food Rescue Network Nourishing Hundreds of Thou...	As thousands of Israelis struggle to put food on the table, Leket Israel rescues surplus agricultural produce and cooked meals, ensuring that no one is left hungry. Each week, the organization distributes food to over 415,000 people through a network of 300 nonprofits and the dedication of 95,000 volunteers. In the wake of war, the need for food assistance has never been greater—and Leket Israel remains at the forefront, bridging the gap between abundance and scarcity In collaboration with Leket Israel In the heart of Israel’s battle against food insecurity, Leket Israel, the National Food Bank, stands as a beacon of hope. At a time when thousands struggle to put food on the table, Leket rescues surplus agricultural produce and cooked meals, ensuring that nutritious food reaches those who need it most. From a Modest Initiative to Israel’s Largest Food Rescue Organization Founded in 2003 by Joseph Gitler, an oleh from New York, Leket Israel started as a small volunteer initiative aimed at addressing the stark contrast between food waste and widespread hunger. Over two decades later, it has grown into Israel’s largest food rescue organization, recovering fresh produce and prepared meals that would otherwise go to waste. Leket distributes these resources through a network of 300 nonprofit partners, providing essential food to more than 415,000 Israelis each week. This effort is made possible through the tireless work of over 95,000 volunteers from Israel and around the world, individuals who dedicate their time and energy to ensuring food reaches those who need it most. Leket Israel serves vulnerable populations across the country, including Holocaust survivors, the elderly, the homeless, youth at risk, single-parent households, and families facing severe economic hardship. In a country where nutritious food is often out of reach for many, the organization plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between abundance and scarcity. Strengthening Local Food Production to Ensure National Stability The urgency of food rescue has only grown in the wake of the Swords of Iron War. The conflict has heightened food insecurity across Israel, affecting those already vulnerable while straining national food supplies. Rising food prices and supply chain disruptions have made it even harder for struggling families to afford essential nutrition. This crisis has reinforced the importance of Israeli agriculture in ensuring national food security. The government’s attempts to stabilize the food market through increased imports have not resolved price inflation or supply shortages. Strengthening local food production and expanding food rescue operations remain key strategies for maintaining stability both in times of peace and in periods of crisis. For years, Israeli farmers have donated their surplus agricultural produce to Leket Israel, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive fresh, nutritious food. Just as they have stood by those in need, Leket is committed to standing by them. Since the onset of the war, Leket has actively supported farmers in distress, helping to rehabilitate their fields and ensuring that Israeli produce continues to feed hundreds of thousands of people across the country. In the southern moshav of Ohad, near the Gaza border, lives Yossi Inbar, a third-generation farmer whose connection to the land runs deep. For Yossi, the soil is far more than just a source of income; it’s his home, his roots, and a profound bond between man and nature. Every fruit and vegetable planted, nurtured, and harvested is an inseparable part of who he is. War and Food Insecurity: A Growing Crisis On October 7th, when the war erupted, what had once been a quiet haven was plunged into chaos and loss. Militants breached the moshav, inflicting devastation on its residents and claiming the lives of close friends and family. Yossi’s wife, originally from Kibbutz Be’eri, endured an unbearable personal loss—her grandmother was murdered along with many others in the community. The extensive damage to the agricultural fields presented a daunting challenge. Neglected fields, crops on the brink of destruction, and a dramatically reduced workforce compounded the crisis. Many of the foreign workers, who had also suffered personal losses, asked to return home. Though Yossi understood their need to be with their families, he was left to face this overwhelming reality largely on his own. Yossi and his father have been long-time partners with Leket Israel, routinely donating their surplus produce to feed those in need. When disaster struck, Leket knew it was time to return the favor. In no time at all, buses filled with dedicated volunteers arrived, ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work. Day after day, they planted, harvested, and breathed new life back into the land. Leket Israel's impact extends beyond farmers and into the homes of those who remained in Israel’s most dangerous regions. In November, Leket launched a unique project to support the residents of Kiryat Shmona who remained on the frontlines. Out of the city’s 24,000 inhabitants, roughly 3,000 people—many elderly or families with children with special needs—were subjected to continuous attacks, deprived of basic necessities, and barely able to leave their homes to buy groceries. In partnership with the Chabad of Kiryat Shmona, Leket delivered hot meals and hearty soups directly to their doorsteps each day, ensuring they had access to fresh, nourishing food. Shulamit Tal, a local resident, stayed in her home with her husband and two children. Leaving was simply not an option. 'If we had a way to evacuate, we wouldn’t have hesitated, but my family’s health situation simply didn’t allow it.' She says. 'We stayed here in an empty city, with no way even to get basic supplies.' 'Knowing We Weren’t Forgotten Gave Us Strength' For Shulamit’s family—and dozens of others remaining in the city—stepping outside was impossible. They had to be near shelters, with tension and worry mounting day by day. Shulamit describes the city as a ghost town: empty streets, shuttered shops, and an overwhelming silence filled with uncertainty. Often, she risked venturing out as far as the next open city just to buy basic groceries, since everything locally was closed. Her son, who is ill, needs regular dialysis treatments. At times, air-raid sirens and mortar fire interrupted their journey to the hospital, yet they had no choice but to press on. Amid the oppressive, ever-escalating stress of daily life, a ray of light—a glimmer of hope—finally emerged. 'Every day, we received something new; every day, we enjoyed a hot meal.' Says Tal. 'It gave us strength—not just physically, but also for our souls. Knowing that someone cared about us, that someone was watching over us, made us feel a little less abandoned during this challenging time.' As Purim approaches, Leket Israel is launching its annual Matanot Le’evyonim campaign, reinforcing the holiday’s tradition of giving to those in need. This initiative provides critical support to individuals like Shulamit and her family, who have faced immense hardship and uncertainty during these turbulent times. The mitzvah of Matanot Le’evyonim ensures that every individual, regardless of circumstance, can partake in the joy of Purim. This year, the campaign takes on even greater significance as thousands of Israelis continue to grapple with economic hardship in the wake of the war. Through its unwavering dedication, Leket Israel continues to bridge the gap between surplus and scarcity, waste and nourishment, despair and hope. With a powerful network of volunteers, generous farmers, and steadfast supporters, the organization remains steadfast in its mission to rescue food, feed the hungry, and build a stronger, more resilient Israel—one meal at a time.

Completely false': Qatar blasts Shin Bet over Oct. 7 report	Gulf kingdom rejects agency's assertions that aid to Gaza strengthened Hamas, insisting all funds were transferred with Israeli oversight for humanitarian use Qatar issued a rare statement Wednesday denouncing a report by Shin Bet security agency that alleged Qatari funds contributed to the strengthening of Hamas. The statement came nearly a day after the Shin Bet published its findings, which claimed that financial aid from Qatar to Gaza helped empower the terrorist organization. 'These are false accusations by the Shin Bet, which is linking Qatari aid to the massacre. This is yet another example of incitement driven by self-preservation interests,' the Qatari statement read. The statement, issued by Qatar’s International Media Office, emphasized that the Gulf state has long supported the Palestinian people and has provided humanitarian aid to families in Gaza for years. 'Qatari assistance has included essential supplies such as food and medicine as well as electricity for homes. It is well known in Israel and globally that all aid sent from Qatar to Gaza was transferred with the knowledge, support and full oversight of the Israeli government and its security agencies, including the Shin Bet,' the statement said. Qatar insisted that 'no aid was ever delivered to Hamas’s political or military wing,' despite multiple investigative reports suggesting a direct link between Israeli government approval for the transfer of Qatari cash into Gaza and the bolstering of the terrorist organization. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Against the backdrop of stalled negotiations on a potential hostage deal and an increasingly fragile cease-fire, Qatar’s statement called on Israel’s security agencies to shift their focus. 'At this critical moment, the Shin Bet and other Israeli security agencies should concentrate on rescuing the remaining hostages and finding a solution that ensures long-term regional security rather than using diversion tactics by scapegoating Qatar.' The Qatari media office reiterated its stance, stating, 'The claims that Qatari aid was transferred to Hamas are completely false and serve as evidence that those making the accusations aim to prolong the war.' Despite what it described as 'unjustified attacks,' Qatar said it remains committed to mediating peace, believing that diplomacy is the only viable path forward for a better future for both Palestinians and Israelis. The Shin Bet report, released Tuesday, asserted that one of the key factors enabling Hamas’s military buildup and its ability to launch the October 7 attack was the influx of Qatari funds, which it claimed were directed to the group’s military wing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/symfihrsje	2025-03-05T03:11:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/05/HJRdd2rjyg/HJRdd2rjyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Four Islamic State-affiliated militants killed in Dagestan, Russi...	Russian counter-terrorism forces killed four militants affiliated with the Islamic State jihadi group who were plotting an attack in the mainly Muslim region of Dagestan, Russian security services said on Wednesday. Intelligence services have been alarmed by an upswing in militant Islamist activity and plots in Russia and Central Asia from where thousands travelled to join jihadi groups fighting in the Syrian civil war. Islamic State-Khorasan, or ISIS-K, claimed responsibility for the 2024 Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow which left at least 145 people dead, and there have been a number of Islamic State-linked plots foiled in the Muslim regions of southern Russia and in the former Soviet republic of Central Asia. Russian security services said the militants in Dagestan had been plotting to attack a regional branch of the interior ministry.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkuvn3hike	2025-03-05T02:58:01-08:00

The Qatari government condemned on Wednesday the Shin Bet security agency over what it called 'false accusations' in its investigation into the events of October 7, which alleged that Doha financed Hamas. Qatar's International Media Office issued an official statement rejecting the Shin Bet's claims, calling them 'yet another example of incitement driven by self-interest in Israeli politics.' The statement further asserted that 'all aid sent from Qatar to Gaza was transferred with the knowledge, support, and full supervision of the Israeli government—including the Shin Bet. Aid was never delivered to Hamas.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s17pk2sokx	2025-03-05T02:47:12-08:00	
Greek top court orders release of Israeli mining magnate Steinmet...	Greece's Supreme Court overturns ruling ordering extradition to Romania over alleged attempts to secure land rights illegally Greece's top court has ordered the release of Israeli mining magnate Beny Steinmetz, setting aside a lower court ruling for his extradition to Romania on an arrest warrant, sources with knowledge of the legal case told Reuters on Wednesday. Steinmetz was initially detained by Greek police on October 13, hours after he arrived on a private aircraft at Athens International Airport. He had been freed from custody on restrictions and detained again in January after a judicial panel ordered his extradition to Romania. Steinmetz had appealed against that decision at the country's Supreme Court. 'The top court has accepted his appeal,' one of the sources said on Wednesday. An arrest warrant has been issued against him in relation to a case dating back several years and concerning his involvement in a group that allegedly tried to illegally secure land rights in Romania. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Steinmetz's legal advisors had dismissed the Romanian authorities' accusations as 'unfounded' and called the extradition requests by Romania 'abusive', arguing that he has the right to travel freely. Romanian authorities have repeatedly attempted to indict Steinmetz in various jurisdictions on the same allegations. In 2022, a Greek court that examined his case had ruled against his extradition. Last year, Cyprus' Court of Appeal also ruled against his extradition to Romania, overturning a lower court ruling. A court in Italy has also rejected the request. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ceg2bskl	2025-03-05T02:16:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/01/28/10510415/10510415_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Eyal Zamir sworn in as IDF's new chief of staff	The former tank officer comes into office with wide range of crises and challenges: Threat of renewed fighting in Gaza, hostage deal and U.S. coordination over possible strike in Iran After more than two years in office and in the shadow of the October 7 attack, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi officially stepped down Wednesday as Israel Defense Forces chief of staff. His successor, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, was formally appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, becoming the IDF’s 24th chief of staff. Zamir takes command at a critical moment, with ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal that could collapse and reignite fighting in Gaza at any time. Due to the war, the usual transition ceremonies were scaled down, with attendees in IDF fatigues rather than dress uniforms. After receiving his new rank, Zamir visited the Western Wall and met with President Isaac Herzog before heading to the national memorial hall to lay a wreath in honor of fallen soldiers. Netanyahu and Katz selected Zamir for the post last month, with his appointment swiftly approved by the advisory committee and the government.

Freed hostage Or Levy's new reality: 'He cannot do this alone'	After losing his wife and surviving captivity, Or faces a long road to recovery; His friends have stood by him, caring for his home and son; Now, they’re crowdfunding to help him rebuild his life Or Levy will never stand alone. The released hostage has a firm and loyal group of five friends who have vowed to be with him and support him and his young son as they rebuild their lives, destroyed in the massacre of October 7 when Or's wife Einav was murdered and he was abducted to Gaza. The group came together when they all began working at the same company in 2017. They formed a commune of sorts, Omri, one of Or's close friends explains. He, Shahar and Daniel, started there with Or, and Rachel, the fifth member of the group, was already there. 'We worked in the same team and we all live in the same neighborhood, so we began doing things together, from Friday night meals to parties, to outings to the beach and to concerts.' Or and Einav's home became where they gathered together. 'They had a roof terrace and their home was always open. They taught me the meaning of unconditional love,' Daniel says. 'We would be over there often five times a week. They would never say no. It was Or who made it happen.' Two days before the massacre, Or tried to convince the group to go with him and Einav to the Nova music festival. 'I had exams and Daniel was working on his thesis, so we decided not to go,' Omri recalls. 'On Saturday, while we were in the shelter during the rocket strikes, we texted or because we knew they had tickets to the festival but were not sure if they were there. He wrote back that it was a mess and that they were under a rocket attack. Once we realized what had happened, we became a command center, joining our knowledge in technology and intelligence.' They began online searches. 'We tried to speak to people who were with them in the shelter, survivors of the massacre, but no one remembered.' Einav was buried on Thursday and since the couple was always together and were seen in a clip from the shelter, the friends thought they would soon hear about Or's body being found. 'When we were in the week of mourning, we got news that Or had been taken hostage. Since then, we've been on a mission to support the family and Almog, their little son, to make sure they have everything they need. 'Or has a green thumb and cares for his potted plants with dedication,' Daniel says. 'We would come to the apartments two or three times a week to water the plants and basically keep an eye the place. This was another mission for us.' 'I refused to give up on the notion that he would soon be back,' Rachel says. 'I kept telling myself that as long as there is a chance, I will have faith and would not allow myself to think otherwise. When we got the call from Geula, Or's mother, we were elated. We watched his release together and went to the Sheba Medical Center to greet him when he arrived. We saw how he was in shock when he grabbed his face in his hands. Our Or was back,' she says. 'We saw him standing on his own feet. There is no greater excitement than when we saw him standing on his own feet, walking, ' Daniel says. 'From the moment we met him, things were normal. He asked that we speak openly about everything.' The friends had discussed what they would tell Or when he returned after such a long time. Omri wanted to update him on what was important: that Luka Dončić had moved to the L.A. Lakers, but Daniel beat him to it. 'I called Geula, who was on the border to meet him and she handed over the phone. I asked who this was and a familiar voice asked, 'Who do you think, you jerk?' I had to say something quickly, so I blurted out the news about Dončić.' Despite the joy and excitement when the friends reunited, they are aware that Or has a long road ahead. 'On October 6, he was a married engineer with a son. A year later, he is a widower and a single parent. It is not just the time that was taken away from him, so much was. He tells us bits and pieces of stuff,' Omri says. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'He tells us about Alon, Eliya and Eli who were with him in the tunnels, chained and hungry. They are part of him. He cannot be what he was. He has to begin a new chapter of physical and emotional recovery and raise a child, living with what had happened. Now, the friends have a new mission. They launched a funding campaign to ensure a future for Or and Almog. 'Or is an amazing father,' Rachel says. 'He reconnected with Almog immediately even though he missed nearly a third of the little boy's life. Or calls it a rebirth. He has to grieve for Einav and build a new life. We want them to be happy and lack nothing. He cannot do this alone and he certainly won't have to. He has us, his tribe.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bj00ipkbsyg	2025-03-05T00:03:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/Sk2WlrrKyl/Sk2WlrrKyl_0_217_1170_659_0_small.jpg

Shin Bet Oct. 7 report fuels clash between director, Netanyahu	Call comes after Ronen Bar was sidelined from cease-fire negotiation team; AG's office insists PM must present solid legal grounds for removal Following the publication of the Shin Bet's October 7 internal report, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear on Tuesday he wants director Ronen Bar to resign. However, comments made by Bar in the report show that he is planning to do so anytime soon. Should Netanyahu decide to force Bar’s removal, he would need to call him to a hearing and present sufficient justification for the decision. Yet, even before reaching that step, Netanyahu must address the legal challenges posed by Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon has already stated that such a significant decision must be grounded in 'a solid and comprehensive factual basis, free of external considerations and consistent with legal and administrative principles.' In a letter, Limon emphasized that 'under the current circumstances, if such a process is to be considered, it must undergo prior review by the Attorney General to ensure it adheres to both procedural and substantive guarantees before proceeding.' Additionally, Netanyahu would later need to bring Bar’s dismissal to a government vote, though he is unlikely to encounter substantial resistance at that stage. Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi openly called for Bar’s immediate removal on Tuesday night. Alongside a mocking caricature of Bar, Karhi tweeted, 'The man who knew to send a tequila team to the Gaza border on the night of October 7 because he sensed something terrible was unfolding, abandoned IDF soldiers and the region’s residents to their fate. He thinks he can distract from his failures by resorting to threats. We will not allow someone who remained silent in the face of insubordination, fell asleep, abandoned his duties, or committed crimes to have any influence on Israel’s security future.' On the other side of the political spectrum, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid criticized Netanyahu, saying, 'The Prime Minister continues to shift blame onto others. This time it’s ‘they didn’t wake me,’ the cowardly twin of ‘no one pulled on my jacket.’ What did you do when they did wake you? Were you not alerted when warnings about the judicial overhaul eroding deterrence were given? Were you not informed when intelligence reports cautioned of disaster? Were you unaware when you transferred suitcases of money to Hamas? This country has been awake for 515 days. We still have hostages in Gaza. It’s time for you to wake up, apologize, and take responsibility. This happened on your watch.' Recent Shin Bet investigations into the failures of the October 7 massacre had only deepened the rift between Netanyahu and Bar. Findings serve as a damning indictment of the political leadership, which pursued a 'quiet policy' with Hamas despite recommendations to act preemptively. Bar has made it clear he intends to remain in his position at least until May, though he does not plan to serve his full term, originally set to end in a year and a half. The Shin Bet report pointed directly at the political leadership while also criticizing the transfer of Qatari funds and the policy of restraint, which ultimately strengthened Hamas. In response, Netanyahu’s associates launched a scathing attack on Bar, accusing him of failing to cooperate with the State Comptroller and presenting findings that fail to address the scale of the failures. 'The conclusions of the Shin Bet investigation do not align with the magnitude of the organization’s and its leader’s failures,' sources close to Netanyahu said. Netanyahu’s office added, 'Shin Bet Chief completely failed in everything related to the organization’s handling of Hamas, especially during the events of October 7. Bar misread the intelligence landscape and was trapped in a false perception. During routine intelligence assessments, including just days before the massacre, Shin Bet’s main thesis was that Hamas wanted to maintain quiet and avoid escalation. 'The most serious issue is that Shin Bet and its leader failed to address even the basics of the ‘Jericho Walls’ plan for the destruction of Israel (which was not presented to the Prime Minister before October 7)—neither in routine assessments nor on the night of the attack,' Netanyahu’s office continued. 'This is despite the fact that Shin Bet had knowledge of the plan as early as 2018. Furthermore, Shin Bet Chief failed to see the importance of waking the Prime Minister on the night of the attack—a fundamental and obvious decision one would expect.' To clarify, Bar did not instruct anyone not to wake the Prime Minister that night. Following Bar’s intelligence assessment around 5:30 AM, instructions were issued to update the Prime Minister's Military Secretary and the Chief of Staff’s director-general. Netanyahu himself delayed appointing an external manager to review the investigations for four months, prolonging the process while prioritizing war-related matters. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The previous clash between Netanyahu and Bar occurred just two weeks ago, centered on the hostage deal negotiations. A senior official familiar with the matter accused the previous negotiation team, particularly Bar, of mishandling the situation. Netanyahu’s office hinted they were behind the senior official’s claims, as suggested by Lapid. However, a source involved in the negotiations dismissed these accusations, stating, 'The hostages’ release was secured because Bar put pressure on Hamas, while Witkoff pressured the Prime Minister. The rest is just an attempt to rewrite history.' Security officials added, 'The criticism isn’t clear because, at the end of the day, the agreements and framework for Phase 1 were approved by the Prime Minister. He was involved at every stage and signed off on each step of the process.' Previously, security officials involved in the negotiations responded to the accusations, saying, 'Everything related to the deal was put together by the original negotiation team. They decided early on that the phases could be consolidated at the end. In any case, there are two phases: live hostages on Saturday and bodies afterward. It’s the same agreement. Hamas wanted to speed things up, understanding Netanyahu doesn't want a Phase 2, and sought to capitalize on Phase 1’s achievements as quickly as possible.' Netanyahu’s office rejected claims that Hamas initiated the acceleration of the release phase, calling it 'an echo of Hamas propaganda.' They stated, 'Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister defined the goal of securing the release of all remaining live hostages from Phase 1 in one stage instead of two. Understandings were reached due to the Prime Minister’s firm stance, his directive to bolster IDF troops around and inside Gaza, and an ultimatum from U.S. President Trump. Let us remind you: Hamas initially refused to release our hostages, violating the agreement. Only Israel’s steadfast position forced Hamas to back down.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyoa7dssyg	2025-03-04T22:42:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/HJdWgxHo1g/HJdWgxHo1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
They took my diamond': Slain hostage Ohad Yahalomi's funeral pro...	Yahalomi was abducted wounded from his home in Nir Oz on October 7, held captive for 510 days before body was returned; Wife and daughters escaped captors near Gaza’s border, while son Eitan was freed after 52 days in captivity The funeral of Ohad Yahalomi, who was murdered while being held hostage in Gaza, began Wednesday morning, nearly a week after his body was returned to Israel as part of a hostage deal with Hamas. Yahalomi will be laid to rest at the cemetery in Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived and from where he was abducted on October 7. The procession started at the Great Synagogue plaza in Rishon Lezion, where hundreds gathered with Israeli flags to support his family. Yahalomi’s mother, Esti, who fought tirelessly for her son’s return, spoke through tears at the funeral’s outset: 'There are no words to describe what we are feeling in this moment. They took my diamond and did what they wanted with him because he was wounded. If he hadn’t been injured, he would have shown them what he was made of.' The procession began after prayers and eulogies, with Yahalomi’s casket transported slowly through Rishon Lezion as mourners walked behind it. The song Habayta ('Home'), which his mother sang to him daily while he was in captivity, played in the background. When the song ended, the crowd began singing Hatikvah, Israel’s national anthem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Rishon Lezion Mayor Raz Kinstlich, who attended to support the family, described Esti as a mother who 'fought like a lioness to bring her son home,' singing to him every morning and holding onto hope until the very last moment. 'How heartbreaking that she is now accompanying him to his grave in Nir Oz,' he said. During the October 7 attack, 50-year-old Yahalomi sheltered in a safe room at his home in Nir Oz with his wife, Bat Sheva, and their three children. When the door failed to lock, he stepped outside to secure it and protect his family. Gunmen then stormed the house, shooting and injuring Yahalomi before abducting him. His wife and daughters were taken on one motorcycle, while his 12-year-old son, Eitan, was taken on another. Later, Yahalomi, wounded, was also taken into Gaza. Near the border, the terrorist transporting Bat Sheva and her daughters lost control of the motorcycle, allowing them to escape. However, Eitan and Ohad were taken into captivity. After 52 days—16 of them spent in solitary confinement—Eitan was released in the first hostage deal in November 2023. After 510 days in captivity, Yahalomi’s body was returned last week along with those of Itzik Elgarat, Tzachi Idan, and Shlomo Mansour, all of whom were abducted alive and later murdered in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1x3udbsjx	2025-03-04T22:20:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/05/BkK6QOrs1l/BkK6QOrs1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

U.S. rejects Arab League's plan for Gaza: 'Trump stands by his vi...	White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes says proposal does not address reality in the Strip, which he says is currently 'uninhabitable' The United States on Wednesday rejected the Arab plan for the rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip, with an official saying it does not align with the current situation in the enclave. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable, and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,' White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said late on Tuesday. 'President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas.' Hughes's comments came hours after the Arab League adopted the plan for Gaza proposed by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for the reconstruction of Gaza at the cost of $53 billion, which would avoid displacing Palestinians from the enclave, in contrast to Trump's vision for a Riviera in the Strip. 'There will be no real peace without the establishment of a Palestinian state,' Sisi said. Sisi said Egypt had worked in cooperation with Palestinians on creating an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the governance of Gaza after the end of the Israel-Gaza war. Jordan’s King Abdullah, whose country was mentioned in Trump’s proposal as a possible recipient of Gaza’s displaced residents, declared at the summit: 'We support the Egyptian plan. We reject any plan to displace the Palestinians and endorse the initiative for Gaza’s reconstruction.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The king added, 'We must formulate a clear, implementable vision for Gaza’s administration and its connection to the West Bank. The two-state solution is the only path that guarantees the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. We reject Israel’s decision to block humanitarian aid to Gaza.' According to reports on the Egyptian plan, 'a temporary cease-fire will be established, during which confidence-building measures will be implemented, followed by direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.' The Gaza reconstruction plan, as published by Al-Hadath, requires $38 billion, with most funds allocated to rebuilding housing. Temporary housing will be provided in several cities during the reconstruction process, which will take place in two phases — the first lasting two years and the second two and a half years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1a7z00hokx	2025-03-04T21:57:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/H17aYb9Ykx/H17aYb9Ykx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Zelensky ready to make a deal, Trump tells Congress	Trump reads out from a letter sent by the Ukrainian president, adding that Zelensky is ready to sign a mineral deal at any time; the president barely mentions the Middle East in a 100-minute speach as freed hostages listen on U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he received a letter from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the Ukrainian leader expressed willingness to come to the negotiating table over the Russia-Ukraine war. 'Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskiy of Ukraine. The letter reads, 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,' he said,' Trump said in his address to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday while quoting from that letter. 'My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,' Trump quoted Zelensky as writing. 'We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence.' Trump added that Zelensky said he was ready to sign the minerals deal 'at any. time that is convenient for you.' Zelensky's talks with Trump in the White House on Friday broke down in acrimonious exchanges and on Tuesday the president stalled all military aid to Ukraine. 'Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace,' Trump said. 'Wouldn't that be beautiful?' While Trump has appeared to fault Ukraine for starting the war, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found 70% of Americans - including two-thirds of Republicans - say Russia was more to blame. Regarding the war in Gaza, the president only said, 'We were getting our hostages back,' and said that in his first term, his administration achieved the historic Abraham Accords, based on which a better future was built for the entire region. A delegation of freed hostages, invited to meet with the president, were in attendance. Trump took a victory lap in an address to Congress on Tuesday, drawing catcalls and interruptions from some Democratic lawmakers who held up signs and walked out mid-speech in protest. The primetime speech, his first to Congress since taking office on January 20, capped a second day of market turmoil after he imposed sweeping new tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China. At 100 minutes, the speech was the longest presidential address to Congress in modern U.S. history, according to The American Presidency Project. The speech was reminiscent of Trump's campaign rallies, though he largely avoided his habit of straying from prepared remarks to deliver asides. The president assailed his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, attacked immigrant criminals as 'savages' and what he called 'transgender ideology.' He vowed to balance the federal budget, even as he urged lawmakers to enact a sweeping tax cut agenda that nonpartisan analysts say could add more than $5 trillion to the federal government's $36 trillion debt load. Congress will need to act to raise the nation's debt ceiling later this year or risk a devastating default. Democratic protests 'To my fellow citizens, America is back,' Trump began to a standing ovation from fellow Republicans. 'Our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again.' Democrats held up signs with messages like 'No King' and 'This Is NOT Normal,' and dozens walked out mid-speech. One Texas congressman, Al Green, was ordered removed after he refused to sit down. 'The chair now directs the sergeant at arms to restore order. Remove this gentleman from the chamber,' Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said after warning Democrats to maintain decorum. Green, shaking his walking cane at Trump, appeared to be shouting that Trump did not win a mandate in November's election after the president bragged about the Republicans' victories. As Green was led from the chamber, some Republicans sang, 'Nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, goodbye.' Trump, a political brawler by nature, appeared to revel in the disagreements. 'I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud,' he said after Green's ejection. Trump spoke in the House of Representatives, where lawmakers huddled in fear for their lives a little over four years ago while a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 victory over the then-incumbent Trump. The president praised billionaire businessman Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has downsized more than 100,000 federal workers, cut billions of dollars in foreign aid and shuttered entire agencies. Trump credited Musk with identifying 'hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud,' a claim that far exceeds even what the administration has claimed so far. Musk, seated in the gallery, received ovations from Republicans. More tariffs coming Trump reiterated his intention to impose additional reciprocal tariffs on April 2, a move that would likely roil financial markets even more. 'Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries,' he said. On this point, many Republicans remained seated, a signal of how Trump's tariffs have divided his party. Trump's 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of the country's closest allies, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports deepened investor concerns about the economy. The Nasdaq Composite is down more than 9% from its record closing high on December 16, near the 10% decline commonly called a market correction. Trump, who has often taken credit for market increases, did not mention this week's downturn in his speech. He also barely mentioned stubbornly high prices, blaming Biden and saying he was 'fighting every day' to lower costs. Just one in three Americans approve of Trump's handling of the cost of living, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, a potential danger sign amid worries his tariffs could increase inflation.

Israel's war with Hamas will be 'much more aggressive,' expert sa...	Dr. Harel Chorev says any future escalation 'won't look as it looked by the end of the first phase of the war' If Israel goes back to war with Hamas, the war will be 'much more aggressive' than it was during the first 15 months, according to Dr. Harel Chorev, a senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University. Chorev told ILTV News that any future escalation will likely involve less infantry on the ground and more fire from the air. 'This is exactly the message that [Israel is] trying to send to Hamas,' Chorev said, 'that it won't look as it looked by the end of the first phase of the war.'

Innovation on the Bar': Here's how Israeli high-tech is driving ...	Dror Bin and Nir Zuk discuss why Israel has become a global hub for innovation and startups Two of Israel's most prominent leaders in tech joined forces for a promising night of inspiration at the 'Innovation on the Bar' event last month, held at the eclectic Abraham Tel Aviv Bar. In partnership with the Israel Innovation Authority, Nir Zuk, founder and CTO of Palo Alto Networks, and Dror Bin, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, led a panel discussion titled 'Israeli High-Tech is Shaping Tomorrow: Technology as a Force that Changes Reality.' With their talent and experience in the tech world, they discussed why Israel has become a global hub for innovation and startups. 'Talent is what makes Israel so special,' Bin told ILTV. 'When you meet with entrepreneurs, people that have ideas about new tech ventures, you just see the spark in their eyes. And if you tell them it's impossible to do, then you just motivate them even further. I think that over the last five decades, many amazing tech companies started out here in Israel as startups and then grew into global markets. Especially in this year of war, 2024, against all odds, we saw an even more vibrant ecosystem, with more people identifying new needs and wanting to bring technological solutions to those needs.' More than 300 people filled the room at the Abraham Tel Aviv Bar to hear the panel discuss Israel's booming innovation ecosystem and what is needed to maintain a high level of effectiveness for startups, according to experts. 'A lot of enterprise-related innovation came out of Israel,' Zuk noted. 'Traditionally, Israel has been known for creating very innovative technology but struggling to turn it into products. What we've seen in recent years is the ability of Israeli companies not just to innovate and create groundbreaking technologies, but also to productize them, sell them, and scale their businesses to relatively high levels. 'There is an opportunity, a proven opportunity, here to build companies worth billions of dollars that are fully developed into selling products around the world,' he said. Both Bin and Zuk discussed the future of high-tech in Israel and how the industry can reach new levels of success. 'We now see a potentially very strong wave of deeper technologies, including artificial intelligence and quantum computing, but also many other sectors that involve not just software, but tangible products designed to solve major global challenges,' Bin said. 'Think about energy, climate change, health, and transportation.' Zuk added: 'Israelis are known for believing they know better than everyone else, and it's been very common for Israeli startups to assume they understand customer needs better than the customers themselves. That almost always turns out to be true. This is really the role of product management. The more Israeli companies become product management-driven rather than solely engineering-driven, the better and more successful they will be.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyaamuhoyl	2025-03-04T19:37:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/26/rJropeYZA/rJropeYZA_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Faith-based diplomacy aims to rebuild Israel-Norway ties	Norwegian Israel Allies Caucus relaunches amid sharply deteriorated relations between Israel and Norway in the aftermath of the Hamas massacre and the ongoing war Relations between Israel and Norway have sharply deteriorated in the aftermath of the October 7 Hamas massacre and the ongoing war. However, earlier this week, Christian parliamentarians in Norway took a stand for Israel by relaunching the Norwegian Israel Allies Caucus. On Monday, more than half a dozen Norwegian parliamentarians came together just days after the Oslo Symposium 2025 at the Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel in Oslo. The symposium, a biennial Norwegian Christian conservative conference that took place on February 28, included a special session on Israel. Key political figures, thought leaders, and activists at the event addressed the rising challenge of antisemitism in Norway, Scandinavia, and Europe. Among them was MK Shelly Tal Meron of Yesh Atid, a member of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus (KCAC) and the first Israeli legislator to visit Norway in some time due to strained diplomatic ties. 'My visit symbolizes the potential for a positive change in these relations,' Tal Meron said. Her visit and the relaunch of the caucus come at a crucial time, as Norway prepares for its parliamentary elections on September 8, 2025. The results of this election could significantly impact Israel-Norway relations, explained Israel Allies Foundation Europe Director Leo Van Doesburg. 'The election is an opportunity for a policy shift that could restore a strong and enduring friendship between Israel and Norway,' he said. Israel Allies Foundation President Josh Reinstein emphasized the importance of mobilizing support. 'We need to get our allies focused so that they can change the leadership in September,' he added. The Israel Allies Foundation works to educate and empower pro-Israel, faith-based legislators worldwide who believe in Israel's right to exist in peace within secure borders, with Jerusalem as its indivisible, eternal capital. Today, the IAF coordinates 54 Israel Allies Caucuses worldwide. The relaunch of the Norwegian caucus is expected to play a key role in fostering political support for Israel in Norway. It will counter antisemitic rhetoric, advocate for Israel’s right to self-defense, and work to mend the strained relationship between the two nations. Reinstein criticized Norway’s current stance toward Israel, calling it 'extreme, one-sided, and anti-Israel.' He attributed this shift to leftist parties in power and Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide, whom has been accused of being openly hostile toward the Jewish state. In May, Norway joined Spain and Ireland in recognizing Palestine as an independent state. Later, Eide declared that Norway would arrest Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Gallant if they entered the country, following the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrants. Norway has also refused to classify Hamas as a terrorist organization and, in July, joined South Africa in its ICC case against Israel by submitting a formal filing. 'The relationship between Israel and Norway is broken, and faith-based diplomacy is key to rebuilding it,' Reinstein said. 'The growing Christian support for Israel in Norway provides a strong foundation to push back against rising antisemitism and rebuild trust.' Norwegian parliamentarian Himanshu Gulati, chairman of the Israel Allies Caucus in Norway, reaffirmed his party’s commitment to Israel. 'The MPs in the Progress Party, the biggest Norwegian opposition party, are proud friends of Israel. We fully support Israel’s right to defend itself and are appalled by the increase in antisemitism since the horrific attacks of October 7. The Israel Allies Caucus relaunch … [is] a testament to our support and friendship towards Israel in Norway.' Reinstein, who spoke at the Oslo Symposium, urged attendees to take action. 'Stand up and tell your fellow citizens that you are being lied to,' Reinstein said. 'We have to support the only free democracy in the Middle East. We need to elect individuals who will stand fearlessly.' He noted that Christian support for Israel is stronger than ever. 'There are people like you in every country standing and acting for Israel. Indeed, it is Christians, not countries, that are standing with Israel like never before,' Reinstein said. With the relaunch of the caucus, he believes, 'the relationship between Israel and Norway is not over.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syngfsbj1x	2025-03-04T18:23:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/05/H1LoQBSiJe/H1LoQBSiJe_0_0_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Hostage deal talks have reached a deadlock: This is what could ha...	Mediators have informed Israel that Hamas is refusing to show flexibility or engage in talks based on the framework proposed by the U.S. envoy to the region. While fighting in Gaza could resume as early as next week, officials in Jerusalem hope that a series of measures currently under consideration will ultimately push Hamas toward compromise Four days after the first phase of the hostage deal ended, negotiations for its continuation have reached a deadlock. Mediators informed Israel that Hamas is refusing to show flexibility or discuss the framework proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff. Instead, Hamas insists on proceeding with the second phase of the deal and accuses Israel of violating the agreement. Despite Hamas’ refusal, Israeli officials remain hopeful that the terror group will soften its stance at the last moment, knowing that Israel is moving closer to resuming military operations. Jerusalem believes that as Hamas recognizes Israel’s full coordination with Washington and the strong backing of the U.S. president, it will opt for compromise. While Israeli officials estimate that military operations may not resume immediately, they do not rule out the possibility of renewed fighting as early as next week. In the meantime, newly appointed IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir begins his tenure Wednesday, and the political leadership aims to give him a few days to settle into his role. Israel also does not expect a breakthrough before Witkoff visits the region. As of now, no date has been set for his trip, and it appears that, if he does come, it will not be before next week. A senior Israeli security official said Witkoff is in no rush to arrive due to the lack of progress in negotiations. Over the weekend, Israel’s political leadership decided to halt humanitarian aid to Gaza in response to Hamas’ refusal to engage in further talks and the expiration of the cease-fire. Israel is now preparing to escalate pressure on Hamas, including cutting off water and electricity to the Strip. Under Witkoff’s proposal, half of the remaining hostages — both living and dead — would be released on the first day of the agreement. The second half would be freed at the deal’s conclusion, contingent on an agreement for a permanent cease-fire. Foreign Minister: Hamas must commit to hostage release Foreign Minister Gideon Saar declined to comment on whether Israel had set a deadline for Hamas to comply, after which military operations would immediately resume. 'If we decide to act, we will,' he said regarding a potential return to fighting. 'We are ready to proceed with the second phase, but we demand a commitment to the release of the hostages.' Referring to the decision to halt humanitarian aid, Saar stated: 'We cannot allow aid to be used to sustain Hamas’ war against Israel.' In a briefing with foreign media, he emphasized that Israel had fully implemented its commitments in the previous hostage deal. 'Israel accepted U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff’s proposal to extend the agreement, but Hamas refused. That is why Israel has halted the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Any aid that reaches Hamas is not humanitarian — it has become the terror group’s main source of revenue. Hamas exploits it to fund terrorism, rebuild its capabilities, and recruit more terrorist operatives.' Proposed interim solution for Ramadan A senior Israeli official revealed that Israel had proposed a temporary 'bridging solution' in Cairo, which would include the release some hostages in exchange for a short-term arrangement during the current week. However, after Hamas rejected the proposal, Israel decided to shut down border crossings. The official dismissed the term 'humanitarian aid,' instead describing the halted shipments as 'logistical supplies,' despite Israel’s previous decisions — led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — to allow food, electricity, and fuel into Gaza. 'I would like to see hostages released and allow the entry of goods suitable for Ramadan celebrations,' the official said. 'If Hamas releases hostages, we will certainly consider allowing in supplies needed for the holiday and for Iftar meals. But first, we must take care of our own people. We need to bring back both the living and the dead.' The temporary arrangement, according to the official, was meant to create a buffer period between the completion of the first phase and negotiations for the next step. Israel sees this next phase as discussions over Witkoff’s framework, rather than a continuation of the original second phase of the hostage deal. 'We wanted a window of time between negotiating Witkoff’s plan and the first phase of the deal,' the official explained. 'We don’t view it as moving on to ‘Phase II,’ but rather transitioning to a new stage.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Israeli officials, Witkoff’s framework would require several weeks of negotiations to address key issues. In the meantime, Israel insists that hostage releases must take place as a condition for continuing talks. Officials argue that Hamas’ refusal to release hostages before further negotiations is what could ultimately derail the entire process. 'Israel’s policy is clear — there is no such thing as a cease-fire without the release of hostages,' the official stressed. 'For us, negotiations must take place either under fire or within an agreed framework. Hamas simply refused to continue talks in a mutually acceptable manner, which is why the government decided on Saturday night' to halt humanitarian aid transfers. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkpfewhj1l	2025-03-04T14:13:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/Hyy8hLc5kx/Hyy8hLc5kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Heroic last stand at Nahal Oz: These IDF soldiers defended base f...	These are the stories of three IDF soldiers who bravely fought against overwhelming odds to defend their military base and save countless lives during the harrowing Hamas attack on October 7 On the morning of October 7, IDF soldier Adir Bogale stood alone at the entrance post of the Nahal Oz base as Hamas launched its attack. His two comrades, Dor Lazimi and Ori Karmi, ran to reinforce him under heavy mortar fire. Together, the three fought against dozens of terrorists until they were killed in battle. Their families, who recently received footage and testimonies from the event, spoke with pride: 'We knew they were heroes, but we didn't know to what extent.' An IDF investigation into the attack, presented Monday, commended Lazimi, Karmi and Bogale. At 6:36 a.m., as the assault began, the three engaged in a fierce battle against dozens of terrorists. For about 40 minutes, they held their ground before being overrun. 'I always knew my brother was a hero' Dor Lazimi’s brother, Bar, told Ynet he didn't know how many had fought at the gate until the report was released. 'Dor and Ori were the only ones who didn’t fight from the shelter — they were on the front line,' he said. 'Dor made his decision without knowing the full scope of what was happening. He thought only 20 terrorists had infiltrated. Communications were overloaded so he handled things by phone and then ran out to fight.' Bar described watching a video showing his brother sprinting toward the entrance post 'without knowing what was happening.' He added: 'It's reassuring to know those were his choices but I'm also angry. 'Maybe if he'd stayed in the shelter, things would be different. Some from the shelter survived. I always knew my brother was a hero — but I didn't understand how much until I saw the footage,' he said. 'They fought for nearly 40 minutes and you can see in the videos how the terrorists couldn’t breach the base because Dor, Ori and Adir were holding them back,' he continued. 'They were found with empty clips. It was a brutal fight. They could have stayed in the shelter, but moved to the front line instead — just 50 meters (164 feet) from the terrorists attacking from both sides. They chose to leave the base rather than stay inside — that’s courage.' Bar described Dor as someone who always stepped up to help. 'He would say yes first and figure things out later. In battle, it was different. In that split second when he had to choose, he chose to fight. 'It was instinct — no time to think, just pure bravery. You can see in the footage how he goes from zero to 100, grabs his gear and runs to the post. I called him while he was there but he didn’t answer. He sent me his last message at 6:57 a.m. from the post: 'I'm okay.'' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite his brother’s heroism, Bar said it doesn’t ease the pain of his loss. 'There's no comfort, because we always knew he was brave. Even after all this time, it’s hard to process. These reports come out of nowhere and pull you back. It's hard to hear, hard to go up to his room and see that nothing has changed,' he said. 'They still haven’t told us everything,' he added. 'There are more videos we haven’t received. But I'm not going to fight it — we’re small compared to the system. We’ll take what we can get. I told the officers that at least now I have more to say about Dor.' 'We don’t abandon our post' Adir Bogale’s father, Gidon, said the investigation left him with a heavy heart. 'Given the situation they were in, they had no proper weapons for that kind of fight,' he said. 'It’s frustrating that with all the warnings and intelligence, they were left so unprepared. 'Adir was alone at first until his two friends jumped out of bed and joined him. Not many know about their fight. They faced a wave of terrorists with incredible bravery.' 'They had no grenades or anti-tank missiles — just rifles, so they could only hit the terrorists when they got really close,' he added. 'They didn’t have much. That’s what pains us. Watching the footage was difficult. What if they hadn’t been there? The disaster would have been much worse. We’re proud of what they did, of their courage.' Gidon recounted how his son refused to retreat. 'Adir chose to stay at the post and told his friends, 'We don’t abandon our post.' And when he realized the battle would get worse, he took the Golani Brigade flag, rolled it up, and placed it in his vest,' according to his father. 'That’s what the people who treated him told us. He loved Golani, wanted to serve there and he died as part of Golani. He could’ve stayed home that weekend — he was injured — but he wanted to return so his leave wouldn’t come at his friends’ expense,' he added. Adir, his father recalled, 'was always giving. He didn’t come home to party — he came to help people and hand out food to those in need. He had a deep respect for others, especially the elderly. His cousins and nieces called him 'Grandpa' because he was always looking after people.' 'He was the first to run there' Lidor Karmi, Ori Karmi’s sister, described an overwhelming sense of pride. 'At 6:29 a.m., Ori is seen wrapped in a blanket. A few minutes later, he’s running with Dor to the post,' she said. 'He then ran back to the shelter to warn the others that this was a much bigger attack than they thought. The terrorists surrounded the post. Ori, Dor and Adir never stood a chance.' 'It was nearly an hour-long battle of sheer heroism,' she continued. 'They stopped the first wave of terrorists and everyone who stayed inside the base is alive today because of them. I feel immense pride. They were elite soldiers, true heroes. 'This was a battle of bravery for everyone in the base. Anyone who was at Nahal Oz that day is a hero. They faced complete abandonment and did everything they could to save lives. Thanks to them, what happened in Kibbutz Nahal Oz wasn’t as catastrophic as in Nir Oz,' she said Lidor recalled how her brother always rushed to help. 'Ori wasn’t at the post initially but he was the first to run there. Even if he had survived that, he would have died somewhere else. He had no chance — because he would have run into danger anywhere to protect others. Now we’re waiting for more footage they won’t release. We want to see the battle up close.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjn6r1hj1g	2025-03-04T13:21:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/Hy04jSPu1e/Hy04jSPu1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

In their own hand: Memorial honoring Kfar Aza massacre victims fe...	The unique memorial has been inaugurated near Kibbutz Kfar Aza, featuring the names of 64 victims of the October 7 massacre posted in their own handwriting — an emotional design created in collaboration with their families Nearly a year and a half after the October 7 massacre, a new memorial — Ktav V'Shem (Written and Named) —has been inaugurated near Kibbutz Kfar Aza to honor the victims. The monument bears the names of the 64 kibbutz members and emergency response team members who were murdered that day along with a map of the kibbutz. The victims' names are etched into iron plates using their own handwriting. The memorial was built in collaboration with the victims' families and was completed in recent days. It is now open to the public, offering a view of the kibbutz, the surrounding fields, and the Gaza border. In the coming weeks, President Isaac Herzog is expected to visit the site as part of an official inauguration ceremony. The memorial was constructed by Israel’s Drainage Authority in partnership with the Sha’ar HaNegev Regional Council and the kibbutz administration. 'The idea was to create a path in the middle of the memorial that resembles a kibbutz walkway—concrete pavement with benches, just like in Kfar Aza,' said architect Tzvika Pasternak, who designed the site. 'But the most powerful aspect is how the names were created,' Pasternak added. 'Together with the bereaved families, we found handwritten signatures of the victims and replicated their names exactly as they wrote them. That’s why the site is called Ktav V'Shem.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The central walkway in the memorial, lined with the victims' names, symbolizes an ordinary path within the kibbutz but also reflects the rupture and trauma that Kfar Aza has endured since that dark day. 'At the edge of the memorial stands a metal map of the kibbutz, engraved with the names of key locations, such as the Dor Tza'ir residence, one of the massacre’s focal points where many young people were murdered or abducted — including Gali and Ziv Berman, who remain in Hamas captivity,' he said. 'The map at the end of the memorial represents the kibbutz’s resilience and rebuilding, despite everything.' The Ktav V'Shem memorial is part of the BaMAH Trail (Bitachon, Mayim, Hitnachalut—Security, Water and Settlement), a route connecting 14 sites that tell the story of settlement in the northern Negev, from pre-state days to the present. These sites highlight the challenges of settlement, securing water for the region, and the struggle of living near Gaza. Each site includes an informational sign and a short film, offering visitors insight into the people behind the names — those who once lived there and are no longer. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjaqireoje	2025-03-04T12:46:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/HysdQwEske/HysdQwEske_0_317_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Wartime baby boom: Birth rates surge despite war	Following outbreak of war in 2023, many chose to expand their families despite the challenges, citing resilience and hope; Hospitals have reported overcrowded maternity wards, with data showing 7% rise in births in September 2024 compared to last year; 'After October 7 took so many lives from us, bringing a life into the world felt like the right thing to do' In the early days of the war that erupted in October 2023, Hadar Raphael, 34, from Ramat Gan, was called up for reserve duty under an emergency mobilization order. His wife, Shir Noy Feiner, 34, was left at home with their two children — Sol, 5, and Ofek, then just three months old. 'It was a difficult time for the country and for us at home,' Feiner recalled Monday. 'I found myself on maternity leave with two small children while my husband was away in the reserves.' Despite the challenges, the couple welcomed their third child, a daughter named Libi, two months ago. 'I grew up with deep Zionist values and love for this country,' Feiner said. 'My grandparents were Holocaust survivors, and my late father was an Air Force navigator who served in all of Israel’s wars. Even when I was recovering from childbirth at Sheba Medical Center, and later at home, we found ourselves running with three little ones to the safe room during air raid sirens.' Bringing children into the world during a war, she added, was not easy, but she and her husband remained hopeful. 'We believe Israel will get through this, and our children will know a life without war. That is our strength as a people — we have endured wars, loss and sorrow, yet we continue to build families.' War-time birth rates surge The Feiners are not alone. A report by the Knesset Research and Information Center, obtained by Ynet, reveals a significant increase in births between August and October 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In September 2024, for example, 15,968 births were recorded — about 7% more than the 14,878 births reported in September the previous year. According to the report, more than 80% of women in Israel give birth between weeks 37 and 40 of pregnancy, indicating that most of the women who gave birth during those months likely conceived in the first few months following the outbreak of war, between November 2023 and January 2024. The report was compiled at the request of Knesset Member Pnina Tamano-Shata (National Unity Party), chair of the Committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality. It includes data only on Israeli women and does not account for births among foreign nationals or Palestinian women who gave birth in Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The rise in births is particularly striking against the backdrop of a declining birth rate in Israel from 2021 to 2023. According to the Population and Immigration Authority, 172,500 births were recorded in 2023, while in 2024, the number jumped to approximately 181,000. The trend has continued beyond the Knesset study period. Data from Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics shows an increase in births from November 2024 through February 2025. Hospitals across the country have reported overflowing maternity wards, with some likening the trend to the 'baby boom' seen in the United States after World War II. 'Despite the unimaginable hardship of the past year, we see how the people of Israel choose to grow from grief,' Tamano-Shata said. 'The rise in births is proof of our inner strength and our ability to create new life even in the most difficult times.' Families choosing life over uncertainty For some, the decision to have children during wartime was not in spite of the conflict — but because of it. Moran Bouzaglo, 40, a Pilates instructor from Tel Aviv, and her husband, Shimi, 35, welcomed their first child four months ago. She became pregnant several months after the war began, and she said the decision was a deliberate one. 'It gave us some light and sanity in a dark time,' she explained. 'At the same time, there were fears. I kept asking myself: What will happen when he reaches the age of military service? It was terrifying, but we decided to go for it anyway. After October 7 took so many lives from us, bringing a life into the world felt like the right thing to do.' The night Bouzaglo gave birth, maternity wards were unusually crowded. 'At Lis Maternity Hospital alone, there were more than 50 births that night, and they had to open an additional ward,' she said. Even in moments of joy, reality intruded. 'Just minutes after I gave birth, a siren went off. Luckily, the hospital was fortified. But yes, this is what it means to have a baby during wartime — running to shelters with a newborn.' A family grows despite war For Rotem, 30, and Hanan Sasson, 32, from Rehovot, the war interrupted their family life almost immediately. Their firstborn son, Itamar, was just six weeks old when the war broke out, and Hanan was called up to reserve duty that same day. The couple did not see each other for two months. 'We could only communicate through letters,' Rotem said. 'I sent him pictures so he could see how our son was growing. We had no direct contact at all.' Hanan has since completed more than 300 days of reserve duty, first in Gaza and later on the northern front with Lebanon. In April 2024, while Hanan was home on a month-long break, Rotem discovered she was pregnant again. 'I told him I wanted another child,' she said. 'Strangely enough, during the war, we felt an even stronger urge to expand our family.' Rotem learned she was pregnant while Hanan was deployed in Gaza. 'I waited two weeks until he was home to tell him,' she recalled. She had hoped the pregnancy might keep him from returning to the battlefield, but for Hanan, it became another reason to fight. 'He felt he was fighting for our children’s future, so they wouldn’t have to fight when they grow up,' she said. When they learned they were expecting another son, Hanan told her, 'We need more soldiers.' Their second son, Roee, was born in January 2025 at Shamir Medical Center. 'Throughout his reserve duty, I kept praying he would make it home for the birth,' Rotem said. 'Thankfully, he did.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b14tmbnijx	2025-03-04T11:11:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/ByK00mZEoyx/ByK00mZEoyx_0_570_831_468_0_small.jpg

IDF eliminates Hamas' Jenin commander and Hezbollah’s naval chief...	The military also expanded operations in the West Bank and heightened security near Gaza amid rising tensions The IDF reported Tuesday it killed a senior Hezbollah naval commander in southern Lebanon and a top Hamas leader in the West Bank city of Jenin, as tensions continue to escalate across multiple fronts. In southern Lebanon, an Israeli drone strike targeted a vehicle in Rashidieh, near the city of Tyre, killing Khader Shaaib Hashem, the commander of Hezbollah’s naval forces within its elite Radwan Unit. The IDF accused Hashem, who had been with Hezbollah for two decades, of facilitating arms smuggling via maritime routes and planning attacks against Israel’s navy, including during a recent cease-fire. 'His activities posed a direct threat to Israel and violated existing understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' the IDF said. Footage published by Lebanese media showed the aftermath of the strike, with the targeted vehicle engulfed in flames. Hezbollah did not immediately confirm the commander’s death. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, the IDF expanded the military operation in Jenin overnight, moving into additional neighborhoods using armored personnel carriers. The raid, led by special Border Police undercover units along with soldiers from the Menashe Brigade, targeted Hamas terrorists in the area. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the operation, Israeli forces killed Isr Saadi, identified as Hamas’ commander in Jenin, along with another terrorist, the IDF said. Three other suspects were arrested. A subsequent search of the building where Saadi was hiding uncovered an M-16 rifle, a handgun and other weapons. 'The intensified operations in Jenin’s refugee camp are forcing militants to flee and expose themselves to our forces,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said, vowing to continue counterterrorism efforts across the region. In a separate incident, a suspected terrorist approaching Israeli troops near the settlement of Homesh was shot and killed by soldiers from the 931st Battalion of the Nahal Brigade. The military reported no Israeli casualties. Further south, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian man near the Philadelphi Corridor, a security buffer zone along Gaza’s border with Egypt. The military said the man, though unarmed, was deemed an immediate threat to soldiers. Palestinian media reported heavy Israeli gunfire targeting homes in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan neighborhood. The escalation comes amid heightened tensions over the potential resumption of hostilities in Gaza, following the collapse of a temporary cease-fire, the suspension of humanitarian aid deliveries, and Hamas’ rejection of a U.S.-mediated proposal for an extended truce. 'The IDF will continue operating to remove any threats to Israeli civilians and troops,' the IDF said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15df64jje	2025-03-04T10:18:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/rkZAsLEjJx/rkZAsLEjJx_0_473_961_540_0_small.jpg

Arab League adopts Egypt's plan for Gaza reconstruction at summit...	Egypt’s Fattah el-Sisi presented his reconstruction plan at the Arab League's emergency summit 'which preserves the Palestinian people’s right to remain on their land' The emergency Arab League summit on Tuesday in Cairo adopted Egypt's plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, positioning it as an alternative to U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to remove Gaza’s population — a plan widely opposed by Arab states. 'There will be no real peace without the establishment of a Palestinian state,' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared. At the start of his speech, Sisi stated, 'The region is facing major challenges that threaten security and stability. The war in Gaza has forced the people of Gaza to choose between destruction and displacement. Egypt has been working to halt the fighting from the very first day of the war, together with Qatar.' Addressing Egypt’s reconstruction plan for Gaza, Sisi said, 'We have collaborated with our Palestinian brothers to establish a committee of independent Palestinians to manage the Gaza Strip. We are working on training Palestinian security teams that will be responsible for security in Gaza in the next phase. We call for the adoption of our plan, which preserves the Palestinian people's right to rebuild their homeland and remain on their land. We urge support for a fund that we will establish to implement this plan.' Sisi also spoke about 'violations in the West Bank' and warned of 'the consequences of continued attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque and the undermining of its status quo.' Looking ahead, he reiterated, 'There will be no real peace without the establishment of a Palestinian state,' adding: 'Peace cannot be imposed by force. The peace agreement between Egypt and Israel is a model for transforming a state of war into peace and prosperity.' In a pointed remark to the U.S. president, he added; 'President Trump has the ability to put an end to tensions and hostilities in our region.' Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit stated: 'Today's summit is a significant event in the history of the Palestinian cause and aims to prevent another catastrophe from befalling the Palestinian people. We reject the displacement of the Palestinian people and cannot accept illegal American projects in the region.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Jordan’s King Abdullah, whose country was mentioned in Trump’s proposal as a possible recipient of Gaza’s displaced residents, declared at the summit: 'We support the Egyptian plan. We reject any plan to displace the Palestinians and endorse the initiative for Gaza’s reconstruction.' The king added, 'We must formulate a clear, implementable vision for Gaza’s administration and its connection to the West Bank. The two-state solution is the only path that guarantees the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. We reject Israel’s decision to block humanitarian aid to Gaza.' Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also spoke at the summit. 'We are facing challenges that threaten the Palestinian cause, particularly the calls to uproot our people in Gaza,' he said. 'We commend the Egyptian-Arab plan for Gaza’s reconstruction without displacing its population. We call on President Trump to support efforts to rebuild Gaza while ensuring that our people remain there.' Abbas also stated that he is 'ready to hold presidential and parliamentary elections next year, provided that circumstances allow it.' Lebanese President Joseph Aoun addressed his country's new standing amid the ongoing cease-fire. 'Lebanon has returned to Arab and international legitimacy. We will not abandon our prisoners (Lebanese citizens captured by Israel during the war), and there will be no peace without the release of the last inch of our land. There will be no peace without Palestinian rights and the liberation of Lebanese territory. Lebanon has suffered greatly, but we have learned from our suffering not to be a pawn in others’ wars,' he said. Also attending the summit are Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman did not attend the summit, sending Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan in his place. UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed also did not attend. Additionally, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and European Council President Antonio Costa are present at the summit. Earlier, Saudi news channel Al-Hadath published details from a draft of the summit’s final declaration. According to the report, the summit participants will declare that 'there is a need to launch a political process that fulfills the aspirations of the Palestinian people. The priority is to implement the second and third phases of the cease-fire agreement.' Al-Hadath reported that the final statement will include support for international coalition efforts, led by Saudi Arabia, to implement the two-state solution, as well as 'a commitment to the International Court of Justice’s decisions regarding Israel’s crimes.' Various Arab and Western news agencies released details of Egypt’s reconstruction plan ahead of the summit. Reuters reported Monday that, according to key points in the plan, Hamas will not be part of Gaza’s governance. A special committee overseeing Gaza’s civil administration will be responsible for distributing humanitarian aid and rebuilding the Strip for an indefinite period. '$53 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction' According to the same report, the proposal states that 'there will be no significant international funding for Gaza’s reconstruction if Hamas remains the dominant political and armed force controlling local governance.' Reuters further reported that security control of Gaza would be assumed by an 'international stabilization force' composed mainly of Arab states, which would also establish a new local police force. The Egyptian plan also outlines that governmental and security bodies would be organized, supervised and guided by a steering committee comprising key Arab states, members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the U.S., the UK, the EU, and other nations. Qatar’s Al-Arabi channel reported Tuesday that it obtained a copy of the Egyptian reconstruction plan. According to the report, the Egyptian plan envisions rebuilding Gaza at a cost of $53 billion and establishing a six-month administrative committee to oversee the Strip before the Palestinian Authority resumes control. The Qatari report also noted that the UN Security Council might consider deploying international peacekeeping forces in Gaza. The committee managing Gaza will be composed of independent figures and will operate under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority, with seven designated areas in Gaza set up to provide temporary housing for 1.5 million Palestinians. Al-Hadath also reported that an independent technocratic committee would manage Gaza for six months, with no representatives from Palestinian factions. The report stated that Egypt and Jordan would oversee the training of Palestinian police forces in preparation for their deployment in Gaza. The Qatari channel added that, under the Egyptian proposal, 'the issue of armed factions could be addressed through a political process.' According to reports on the Egyptian plan, 'a temporary cease-fire will be established, during which confidence-building measures will be implemented, followed by direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.' The Gaza reconstruction plan, as published by Al-Hadath, requires $38 billion, with most funds allocated to rebuilding housing. Temporary housing will be provided in several cities during the reconstruction process, which will take place in two phases — the first lasting two years and the second two and a half years. Egyptian channel Al-Qahera Al-Ikhbariya reported today that 'the Egyptian plan is based on preserving the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people and the two-state solution.' The report emphasized that 'Gaza is an inseparable part of Palestinian territories, and any attempt to deny the Palestinian people hope for statehood or to seize their land will only lead to more conflicts and instability.' The plan rejects the displacement of Palestinians and condemns the suffering caused by the war. The Egyptian channel also reported that the plan stresses the need for the international community to 'address the humanitarian disaster caused by the war' and calls for maintaining the cease-fire in Gaza, urging international support for Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. in brokering a cease-fire agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwkb2eokl	2025-03-04T10:00:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/BkN23KNi1x/BkN23KNi1x_234_26_792_446_0_small.jpg
Released hostages Omer Wenkert, Eliya Cohen leave hospital and fi...	The former hostages, freed after 505 days in Gaza, are met by thousands as they arrive at their homes for the first time; they pledge to bring all remaining hostages home; 'I dreamed of this moment for more than 500 days. It's finally here' Former hostage Omer Wenkert, 22, who was released in the latest hostage deal after 505 days in Gaza, was discharged from Rabin Medical Center on Tuesday and returned to his home in Gedera. Thousands gathered to welcome him, chanting his name. He sang the song that gave him strength during captivity and thanked those present. Before entering his home, Wenkert wrapped himself in an Israeli flag, stood at the doorstep, kissed the mezuzah and recited a blessing. Inside, he embraced his parents, family members and close friends. He then raised a glass of wine with his parents, who beamed with joy. 'I dreamed of this moment for more than 500 days. It's finally here. I'm glad I never stopped believing — cheers,' he said. 'It’s not over yet. I’m joining the fight to bring back my brothers Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David, who remain in Gaza, and all the hostages. We won’t rest until they’re all home.' 'Omer defeated captivity — as he put it, he overcame it,' said his father. 'We’re deeply moved by everyone’s love and support. It’s a great joy — thank you, the Israeli public, for celebrating with us. Omer is home but we’re not celebrating yet. We’re waiting for all the hostages to return. He still has two brothers, Guy and Evyatar, left behind. He never expected the overwhelming love he received. He’s in good condition and recovering.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His mother, Niva, echoed the sentiment. 'Thank you. Our journey isn’t over. Guy, Evyatar and 22 other living hostages are still in Gaza. We must bring them home — along with those who were murdered. We want every family with a loved one in captivity to experience the same embrace we did today.' Wenkert’s grandmother, Tamar Mantzur, also wrapped herself in an Israeli flag. She clapped as her grandson returned, receiving warm embraces from those around her. 'I didn’t breathe or live for 505 days while Omer was in captivity,' she said. 'My wonderful Omer is home. May all the hostages come back!' She then shouted with joy: 'Omer is here! I’m overjoyed — he gives us strength. It’s incredible.' 'Omer Wenkert, admitted last Saturday, was discharged today after completing the necessary medical tests,' Rabin Medical Center said in a statement. 'He will begin outpatient rehabilitation at the hospital. The hospital will continue to support Omer and his family, ensuring they receive all necessary care.' Last week, Wenkert danced again — more than 16 months after being kidnapped from the Nova music festival. In an Instagram post, he wrote, 'It happened. I’m free,' sharing a video of himself dancing with his father. 'There’s no price for freedom. I had almost forgotten how sweet and beautiful it is,' he added. Former hostage Eliya Cohen, also was discharged from Rabin Medical Center on Tuesday and arrived at his home in Tzur Hadassah. 'Eliya, who was admitted to the hospital last Saturday, was discharged after completing the necessary tests and will begin outpatient rehabilitation,' the hospital said in a statement. 'Thank you to each one of you for the fight to bring me home, whether it was shouting my name at protests, hugging my mother or sending challah and cakes on Fridays,' Cohen said emotionally. 'Each of you contributed to the fight — this is not my moment, it's all of ours.' Cohen stressed that the mission is not over, raising a shirt with a photo of Alon Ohel, who was kidnapped with him and is still held captive. 'We all have an important mission and it’s not over — we must bring everyone home!' Cohen was abducted from the Nova music festival along with his partner Ziv Avod, nephew Amit Ben-Avida and his partner Karin Shwarcman. When the surprise attack began, the four hid in a shelter later dubbed the 'shelter of death.' Amit and Karin were killed on the spot and Cohen was taken captive along with three others — Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy and Alon Ohel. Ziv Avod, Cohen’s partner, miraculously survived the events in the shelter. After the kidnapping, it was revealed Cohen had planned to propose to her and had even bought a ring. Last week, Ziv shared that testimonies from other released hostages revealed Cohen did not know she was alive. Last week, Cohen's mother, Sigi, expressed shock at the harsh conditions her son endured, after details of the inhumane captivity conditions were revealed, including being chained. On the day of his release, Cohen was seen stepping onto the stage unaided, smiling. Friends and relatives gathered to celebrate his freedom in various locations across the country. Additionally, his extended family watched the moment of his release while wearing shirts that read, 'Welcome home Eliya, the heart beats again.' 'We are overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude for Eliya's return home after 505 long and painful days in captivity,' his family said in a statement. 'Seeing him today give us strength and great hope for the long rehabilitation process ahead.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjwohsvsje	2025-03-04T09:52:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/Bkze9O4jyx/Bkze9O4jyx_1_69_1280_720_0_small.jpg

The policy that turned Hamas into a monster, the eroded deterrenc...	Intelligence agency's internal investigation outlines critical failures in intelligence and IDF coordination, revealing the agency's role in the rise of Hamas and the unpreparedness for the October 7 massacre; Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar: 'As head of the agency, I will carry this heavy burden for the rest of my life' The Shin Bet on Tuesday published its probe into the failures of Hamas' October 7 attack. The agency has taken responsibility for its failure to prevent the assault, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies over the past decade and a half of fueling the terror group's rise. In a written statement to the press, the security agency outlined its findings from an internal investigation into the Hamas invasion that marked the start of the surprise war. The report, which spanned only eight pages, echoed the findings of the IDF's investigations, with both organizations blaming Netanyahu's approach of separating the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. The Shin Bet, however, delivered much stronger, more direct accusations: 'The main reasons for Hamas' rise and the subsequent attack include a policy of calm that allowed Hamas to strengthen, Qatari funding to its military wing, an erosion of Israeli intelligence and the ongoing treatment of prisoners, all of which encouraged Hamas to act.' The agency insists it did not underestimate the threat posed by Hamas, saying: 'There was a deep understanding of the threat and efforts to thwart it, particularly targeting Hamas leaders.' Failure to recognize invasion plans The Shin Bet acknowledged failing to fully comprehend Hamas’ invasion plans, which were detected by Israeli intelligence in 2018 and 2022. 'These plans were never fully processed as an imminent threat, which led to a lack of preparation,' the report read. 'This failure impacted intelligence gathering and decision-making in the hours leading up to the war.' The agency also admitted shortcomings in its internal coordination with the IDF and its failure to integrate data from the Military Intelligence Directorate regarding the possible threat from Hamas. Despite receiving alerts about unusual mobile phone activity from Hamas terrorists in Gaza, the Shin Bet did not act swiftly enough. The agency did release some early warnings, such as at 3:03 a.m. on October 7, providing intelligence about Hamas' potential offensive. However, the report read that, while the alert signaled an escalation, it did not specify the scale or timing of the attack. Acknowledging past failures and improving future operations The Shin Bet’s investigation noted that its intelligence operations in Gaza had suffered due to restricted operational freedom and a lack of comprehensive coverage in the years leading up to the attack. Although sensor installations had been made in Gaza, the Shin Bet admitted that these did not fully mitigate the intelligence gaps prior to the attack. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The investigation also revealed operational failures in its human intelligence (HUMINT) network, which had been weakened in recent years. In 2018, a significant blow was dealt to the HUMINT infrastructure in Gaza after a failed operation, resulting in long-term damage to intelligence gathering capabilities. The Shin Bet also pointed to a lack of collaboration between its own analysis and that of IDF intelligence, creating further gaps in understanding the evolving threat landscape. Despite identifying some warning signs, such as heightened Hamas activity and the mobilization of phone SIM cards in Gaza, the Shin Bet did not have the necessary information to fully assess the danger in time. The road to October 7 Shin Bet also traced the roots of the October 7 attack to earlier years. Between 2018 and 2021, Israel maintained a policy of economic concessions to Hamas in exchange for calm. However, Shin Bet claimed that, despite the apparent success of Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021, Hamas emerged stronger, using Iranian and Qatari funding to build a military force capable of launching an organized, armed and fortified attack. The agency noted that, by 2021, Hamas had dramatically increased its efforts to direct terrorism against Israelis from the West Bank. The Shin Bet had developed plans to combat these threats but the Israeli government rejected them throughout 2022 and 2023. Despite these efforts, the Shin Bet sent multiple warnings to the government in the months leading up to the October 7 massacre, pointing out the increasing motivation of Israeli enemies to strike amid rising internal divisions and strategic erosion. Regarding the agency's operations from the morning of the war's outbreak, the investigation noted the opening of relevant command posts for combat, locating hostages, identifying the missing, locating terrorist cells and manning operations room for coordinating efforts to locate and eliminate the terrorists who participated in the massacre and returned to Gaza. The Shin Bet also initiated the rapid establishment of an interrogation facility for Hamas terrorists, whose quick results greatly assisted forces maneuvering within Gaza. The agency noted that as a result of its lessons learned it took several actions: the creation of an 'online' intelligence and warning control unit; an in-depth review, which is underway, challenging assumptions and undergoing changes within the organization's research division; establishing a joint counter-terrorism financial unit with the IDF; setting up a department for Gaza-based interrogators; creating warning models for each counter-terrorism division; and beginning staff work to improve collaboration with the IDF intelligence's Unit 8200. 'We did not prevent the October 7 massacre,' said Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. 'As the head of the agency, I will carry this heavy burden for the rest of my life. Had the Shin Bet operated differently, both in the years leading up to the attack and on the night of the attack — professionally and in terms of management — the massacre would have been prevented. 'This is not the standard we expected, nor the Israeli public expected from us. We did not underestimate the enemy, according to the investigation; on the contrary, there was an initiative for action, an attempt to engage and efforts to cut off the threat while it was still in its infancy, yet we failed,' Bar said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sju9cseoyl	2025-03-04T08:28:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/B1oizUvKJx/B1oizUvKJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
BBC chief says Gaza documentary controversy a 'dagger to the hear...	Samir Shah urged a thorough review, saying the issue stemmed not just from faulty processes but from people failing to do their jobs BBC Chair Samir Shah has described the controversy surrounding the documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone as a 'dagger to the heart' of the broadcaster’s impartiality, calling for an independent review of its Middle East coverage. Speaking to the Culture, Media & Sport Committee on Tuesday, Shah said the BBC Board is 'very exercised' by the issue and vowed to take appropriate action. The controversy erupted after it was revealed that one of the documentary’s narrators is the son of a Hamas minister. The BBC has launched an investigation, led by Peter Johnston, and U.K. media regulator Ofcom has said it could intervene if it is unsatisfied with the BBC’s response. 'I agree that this is a really bad moment,' Shah said. 'What has been revealed is a dagger to the heart of the BBC’s claim to be impartial and trustworthy, which is why I and the board are determined to answer the questions being asked.' The BBC pulled the documentary from its streaming service last week, stating that its producer, HOYO Films, failed to disclose the narrator’s family ties. Hundreds, including BBC presenter Gary Lineker, have since signed an open letter condemning what they called 'censorship on Palestine.' Meanwhile, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has criticized the broadcaster’s handling of the matter.

'I have a worry that it wasn’t so much the processes that were at fault but that people weren’t doing their job,' he said. He compared the situation to his experience covering Northern Ireland. 'We had to be very careful about the circumstances of which a terrorist organization works and how they control things,' he said. BBC Director General Tim Davie defended the broadcaster’s decision to remove the documentary, stating that he lost trust in the film after learning of the narrator’s ties. However, he did not rule out reinstating it once the review is complete. 'If you think we bow to lobbies, then come and spend a day with me,' Davie said, insisting that the BBC operates independently. The review into the Gaza documentary follows recent scandals at the broadcaster, including misconduct allegations against former news anchor Huw Edwards. Shah said he was determined to address the BBC’s workplace culture, emphasizing, 'The BBC is bigger than any individual.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1tgoq4i1l	2025-03-04T08:00:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/BJbp1KP4ckx/BJbp1KP4ckx_419_246_1753_987_0_small.jpg

U.S. Vice President JD Vance denied on Tuesday disrespecting Britain and France by describing a planned peacekeeping force in Ukraine as 20,000 troops from some 'random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years'. Vance's comments about the planned British- and French-led European peacekeeping force caused politicians and veterans in both countries to say he was dishonoring hundreds of troops killed fighting alongside U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Vance said it was 'absurdly dishonest' to suggest he had criticized British or French troops in his comments, made in an interview with Fox News on Monday. 'I don't even mention the UK or France in the clip, both of whom have fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond,' he said on X. Vance said on Tuesday he was referring to other potential countries in what British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called at the weekend 'a coalition of the willing' that would contribute to any post-war peacekeeping force in Ukraine.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00qtsvj1e	2025-03-04T07:26:54-08:00

IDF report uncovers missed warnings, poor communication and deadl...	Official IDF probe into October 7 battle reveals how intelligence gaps, command failures, and hesitation allowed 3 terrorists to massacre 17 civilians in Netiv HaAsara despite full military superiority; IDF: 'Most frustrating' battle report The IDF on Tuesday presented its investigation into the battle at Netiv HaAsara, which it described as 'the most frustrating' among the battle reports of October 7. Despite full military superiority over the terrorists who infiltrated from the air, an early presence of a senior commander, a permanent Golani Brigade force from the outset and a well-trained and armed local emergency squad, three terrorists managed to murder 17 civilians in the community. At 6:55 a.m., three terrorists faced 37 soldiers, including a battalion commander. No IDF soldiers were killed in Netiv HaAsara on the day of Hamas' invasion. The town is one of three border-adjacent communities near the Gaza border, alongside Nahal Oz and Kerem Shalom, located just a few hundred meters from Gazan territory. This fact was central to the investigation led by Lt. Col. A., currently the deputy commander of the Judea and Samaria Division, who fought as a reserve brigade commander in Gaza. Failures in response The investigation revealed patterns similar to those found in other battle reports, such as that of Nahal Oz: military norms broken, overreliance on barriers and technology and forces that, despite their superiority, failed to engage the enemy. It found that the town’s security coordinator, a military-operative figure subordinate to the local battalion, instructed 25 local alert squad members to remain inside their homes when the three terrorists entered. He himself also stayed inside, later offering two explanations: a lapse in judgment and fear of friendly fire from incoming military forces. Despite being one of the best-trained alert squads in the region, its members kept their weapons in home safes rather than a locked armory, as was the case in kibbutzim such as Kfar Aza and Nahal Oz. Additionally, four Golani soldiers from the regional battalion were permanently stationed in and around the town. However, they were ineffective that morning, having moved to nearby greenhouses at the outbreak of the attack without working communication devices — their radio batteries drained quickly and they had no spares. This group of Golani soldiers arrived at the town’s entrance about 90 minutes later but remained there for 30 minutes, staring at their phones while waiting for a wounded person’s location to be sent via WhatsApp. The prolonged sounds of gunfire from inside the town did not prompt them to take action. Failures in military preparedness The investigation was accompanied by Maj. Gen. Nimrod Aloni, who commanded the Gaza Division until three years ago, despite his role in entrenching some of the division’s defensive failures. The findings highlighted what was termed 'routine security failures': operational procedures that eroded over time, as well as shortages in manpower and equipment that no one sought to address. For instance, between Operation Protective Edge (2014) and Operation Guardian of the Walls (2021), two full platoons — about 40 soldiers — were tasked with protecting Netiv HaAsara, which faces Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun. However, Israel’s and the IDF Southern Command’s overconfidence after the latter operation led to a reduction in forces, leaving just a small squad inside the town. At 6:35 a.m. on October 7, three terrorists on motorized paragliders landed in the town, acting as an advance force for an estimated 30 terrorists expected to arrive on foot from the adjacent Palestinian town. A resident identified two of the aerial infiltrators — similar to those landing in Kfar Aza at the same time — and fired dozens of rounds at them along with his son, an off-duty soldier. Their shots missed due to the angle and movement of the one-seater aircraft, but they forced the terrorists to land separately and delayed their regrouping. The resident immediately reported the breach to his security coordinator. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Command failures and missed opportunities At the time, another responsible for the northern Gaza border was dealing with eight other infiltration points and over 10 active enemy engagements. However, its commander, Lt. Col. Sh., who led the 77th Armored Battalion, chose to head to Netiv HaAsara first due to its proximity to the border and the presence of a large, undisclosed terror tunnel nearby. He also ordered his deputy, who was en route to the Erez border crossing where fighting had begun, to reroute and join him. Two hours earlier, Lt. Col. Sh. had received an unusual order from the brigade: not to send the two tanks stationed near the town to their designated positions under an IDF protocol meant to disrupt enemy plans. 'Had the tanks been in position, they would have engaged the Nukhba unit advancing on the town.' However, as helmet-camera footage from one terrorist later showed, the Nukhba terrorists failed to breach the town’s perimeter wall due to a technical error, unlike similar walls elsewhere in the region that morning. Instead, they abandoned the attack and likely sought another target, possibly the Erez crossing. Partial successes and broader failures Unlike other sectors, the battalion under Lt. Col. Sh. managed to deploy mortars for isolating areas and authorized the first airstrike of the day in the western Negev at 7:20 a.m., using a drone just outside the town. Additionally, the IDF’s 'See-Shoot' system operator effectively eliminated a double-digit number of terrorists trying to storm the town. However, the investigation found a critical flaw: only one 'See-Shoot' control station system was operational, despite the presence of four remote-controlled heavy machine guns in the sector, forcing the operator to choose which to use. The report praised the three alert squad members who defied orders and fought back. However, it noted that no force followed combat techniques and the reserve battalion was misplaced at the front rather than in-depth, violating defensive doctrines. Instead of reinforcing attacked positions, it had to fight off its own mass infiltration. The investigation concluded that the Golani squad commander erred by not coordinating with the community’s security coordinator, who himself failed by managing the event from his home instead of in the field. 'The security coordinator neglected his responsibility,' the report read, adding that he justified his lack of coordination with Golani troops by saying, 'They rotate every week anyway.' The military culture among the town’s IDF defenders was described as deeply flawed, with a lack of initiative and soldiers treating their mission as 'a week off.' Battle for Netiv HaAsara: Minute-by-minute 6:29 a.m.: A rocket barrage is launched from Gaza, including toward Netiv HaAsara. Many residents wake up and take shelter. 6:34 a.m.: Three terrorists infiltrate using motorized paragliders. A resident spots them and fires, missing but disrupting their landing. He immediately reports to his security coordinator, as does a military lookout who identifies the breach. 6:40 a.m.: Four Golani soldiers stationed to defend the town move to the greenhouses outside. Lacking a working radio due to dead batteries, they hesitate to advance toward gunfire from the nearby Erez base. 6:42 a.m.: The Nukhba force fails to breach the town’s wall and retreats toward the Erez crossing. The three terrorists regroup and one begins the massacre. 6:43 a.m.: The security coordinator's warning to residents to stay indoors does not reach their phones, likely due to a malfunction. 6:45 a.m.: The security coordinator orders all residents, including the 25 emergency squad members, to remain inside their homes. 6:46 a.m.: The massacre continues. 6:48 a.m.: Defying orders, two alert squad members head out to fight. Others remain in their homes, weapons ready. 7:07 a.m.: Alon Keren, an alert squad member, hears a terrorist near his home, steps out cautiously, and eliminates him. 7:14 a.m.: An IDF drone arrives from Nablus, conducting its first strike of the day in the Gaza border — disrupting but not eliminating terrorists due to targeting difficulties. 7:28 a.m.: Two terrorists continue their killing spree, undetected by IDF forces scanning the area. 8:17 a.m.: The battalion commander and his team flank a house where terrorists are hiding. The terrorists open fire first and escape to Gaza. The military does not pursue them. 12:14 p.m.: Seven unarmed looters enter Netiv HaAsara, despite supposed operational control by the IDF. They steal money and jewelry before being captured after a short chase. 1:00 p.m.: Senior commanders arrive and organize a safe evacuation corridor, allowing residents to leave by evening. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkcs394o1g	2025-03-04T06:58:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/17/HJ7hPeHNp/HJ7hPeHNp_0_140_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
3 hours after 1st wave of terrorists was repelled, massacre and k...	Investigation details finds small counterterrorism force repelled first wave but was later overwhelmed due to delayed reinforcements and command failures; report highlights severe intelligence lapses, mismanagement by senior officers and tragic use of hostage in live-streamed surrender demands that went unnoticed by security forces A small team from the undercover counterterrorism unit, stationed at Kibbutz Nahal Oz as part of preparations for border protests, played a key role in preventing a large-scale massacre on October 7, 2023. The kibbutz, located just a few hundred yards from the Gaza border, faced a deadly infiltration by Hamas terrorists. However, reinforcements from the IDF’s Maglan unit were delayed after encountering a deadly ambush in a nearby forest. By the time they reached the kibbutz at midday, the counterterrorism officers and local alert squad were already overwhelmed, and the toll was devastating. According to an IDF investigation published Tuesday, the first wave of infiltrators from Gaza was repelled through extraordinary bravery and professional skill, with a handful of fighters holding off dozens of terrorists. However, the second wave, which arrived around noon, carried out a massacre and kidnappings. The report also revealed that, in the aftermath of the battle, three kibbutz residents were mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. The findings highlight a severe intelligence failure by Unit 8200 and other surveillance systems within the IDF, police and Shin Bet, which even Hamas had expected to be operational. One Hamas terror cell that entered the kibbutz used 17-year-old resident Tomer Eliaz-Arava as a human shield, forcing him to convince residents hiding in their reinforced safe rooms to come out and surrender. The terrorists also broadcast their demands live on Facebook using his mother’s account, calling for an end to Israeli airstrikes. Realizing that no one in Israel’s security apparatus was monitoring the live broadcast, the terrorists switched to another Facebook Live feed using the phone of another kibbutz resident. However, this too went unnoticed by any command center, police operations room or intelligence unit. Nahal Oz is one of the three most vulnerable border communities in the Gaza border region. However, unlike conflict-prone areas in the West Bank, the kibbutz’s security cameras were not funded by the Defense Ministry — despite their critical role in defense. The investigation found that on the morning of October 7, power outages rendered the cameras inoperable. Any attempt by the kibbutz to install a backup generator or repair the system would have required funding from the regional council’s municipal budget — effectively equating the residents’ security needs with basic public services like garbage collection. Over the course of the massacre, 15 Israeli civilians were murdered in Nahal Oz, and eight others were taken hostage to Gaza. Five of them have since been released alive. Four security personnel were also killed. On the holiday of Simchat Torah, 450 people were in Nahal Oz, which is located near two military outposts intended to protect it: Camp Nahal Oz, just 300 yards away, and Outpost Pega, about two miles away. Another base, Magen Alumim, which housed a battalion reserve force, was also within the kibbutz’s security sector. The investigation revealed that a small IDF force, including a tank and a Golani company commander, arrived at Nahal Oz relatively quickly — within 15 minutes of the attack’s start — blocking a major infiltration route. However, the first wave of 40 Hamas terrorists from the elite Nukhba force breached the kibbutz from another direction, entering through the back gate. Around 10:00 a.m., another 60 terrorists from Gaza City’s Shati neighborhood joined them as part of the second wave. At the time of the attack, Nahal Oz had 16 members in its local alert squad, but only four were armed. The community’s armory could not be opened due to the power outage, and only the local security coordinator, Ilan Fiorentino — who was killed early in the attack after saving a teenager out for a morning run — knew the access code. 'There was no clear directive to keep weapons stored in home safes rather than in the armory,' the investigation found. 'It was a disorganized policy set by the division and northern brigade.' The attack on Kibbutz Nahal Oz – minute by minute 6:45 a.m.: Security coordinator Ilan Fiorentino reports a power outage in the kibbutz to the Northern Brigade. He activates an undercover police counterterrorism unit that was on standby for expected border protests. The unit consists of 11 officers from the Jerusalem District Yamas tactical unit, equipped with two heavily armored Wolf vehicles. Meanwhile, Fiorentino spots 13-year-old Ariel, who was out for a morning run. He picks him up, drives him to a safe room in one of the kibbutz homes, and saves his life. 6:46 a.m.: A small Golani and Armored Corps force, led by Lt. Daniel Perez, engages dozens of Hamas terrorists attempting to breach the kibbutz from the main gate. They manage to block the advance, but other attackers infiltrate from the rear entrance, where they are met by the undercover unit and four alert squad members. Three Israelis are killed in this first wave, but the small defending force prevents the kibbutz from being overrun. 6:50 a.m.: The undercover police team, led by First Sgt. Yaakov Shlomo Krasniansky, quickly engages the terrorists, killing many of the attackers. 7:12 a.m.: Fiorentino and three alert squad members fight Hamas terrorists at multiple locations within the kibbutz, preventing further infiltration. Fiorentino is killed in close combat. 7:20 a.m.: Krasniansky and his team push back the Nukhba unit, which is still attempting to enter homes. Just as they are about to gain full control, Krasniansky is killed in a final charge against the terrorists. Four of his men are wounded. 7:25 a.m.: Roy Revivo, a former police officer, hears a terrorist outside his home. He leaves his family inside the safe room and goes out armed with his pistol. 7:30 a.m.: Relative calm is restored in Nahal Oz after the undercover police unit kills around 30 terrorists in 40 minutes, preventing a larger massacre with the help of a small number of local emergency responders. However, some Hamas fighters remain in the kibbutz. 8:40 a.m.: Reinforcements fail to arrive, leaving residents to tend to the wounded themselves. Ruti Wagner shelters and cares for eight injured people in her home until 1:15 p.m. 8:45 a.m.: The undercover unit repeatedly requests reinforcements from the Northern Brigade and Gaza Division, fearing a second wave of attackers. 9:02 a.m.: At the request of Lt. Perez, an attack helicopter fires at a swarm of terrorists moving from Gaza toward Nahal Oz and Kfar Aza. 9:20 a.m.: Less than an hour before the arrival of the second wave of terrorists, a few remaining infiltrators from the first wave target homes of elderly residents, murdering Shlomo Ron and Haim Livne in cold blood. 10:00 a.m.: The second wave of Hamas terrorists, arriving from Gaza City’s Shati neighborhood, storms the kibbutz, unleashing a campaign of murder, looting and kidnapping. By 11:00 a.m., 180 terrorists are in the kibbutz, facing only eight remaining defenders after the Armored Corps and Golani forces had moved on to battles at Nahal Oz base and Kfar Aza, and four Yamas Israel Border Police unit fighters had been evacuated with serious injuries. 10:40 a.m.: A Nukhba squad from the second wave enters the Eliaz-Arava family home and begins a live broadcast on Facebook using the account of Dikla Eliaz-Arava. Her partner, Noam, is shot in the leg. The terrorists demand that Israeli airstrikes in the area stop, but no IDF, police or Shin Bet operations center is monitoring the broadcast. Noam pleads for them to take him hostage instead of his children — but is executed. 10:50 a.m.: The terrorists take 17-year-old Tomer Eliaz-Arava from his home, forcing him to convince his neighbors to surrender and leave their locked safe rooms. The event is broadcast live on Facebook, but no security forces are watching. Tomer remains calm, reassures his neighbors and tries to signal distress through the broadcast, but his plea goes unnoticed. 10:52 a.m.: A police intelligence officer in the kibbutz attempts to guide an Apache attack helicopter toward a group of terrorists preparing for the second assault near the kibbutz gate. However, a miscommunication leads the helicopter crew to believe the target is two moving vehicles containing security forces. Unwilling to take the risk, the pilots fire a 'disruption strike' near the vehicles instead. The explosion startles the terrorists, who flee—only to return two minutes later. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 10:58 a.m.: Dozens of terrorists storm the foreign workers’ housing, unleashing chaos, terror and brutal executions. The attackers film themselves attempting to behead a Thai worker with a hoe while he is still alive. Failing to do so, they shoot him at point-blank range. Elsewhere, they capture a Tanzanian student, mistakenly believing he is an Ethiopian Israeli. His desperate pleas fail, and another group of terrorists demands custody of him. A violent dispute erupts between the two Hamas groups, which ends when one terrorist executes him with a bullet to the head 11:00 a.m.: A Nukhba squad attempts to storm the Levi family home, where M., a former police special forces officer now working as the kibbutz landscaper, is holed up. Armed with 10 magazines he had prepared for an emergency, he eliminates nearly every terrorist who approaches, firing through windows and doors. 11:10 a.m.: Realizing that no one in the IDF is monitoring their Facebook Live broadcast from Dikla Eliaz-Arava’s phone, the terrorists attempt to stream from another resident’s phone—but again, no one is watching. 11:20 a.m.: As Tomer Eliaz-Arava is being forced at gunpoint to go house to house, his family is abducted in a Hyundai SUV that arrived from Gaza. A soldier spots the vehicle near the kibbutz dairy farm and opens fire, unaware that hostages are inside. Dikla is killed instantly, while her wounded husband, Noam, tries to escape but is shot dead by terrorists. Their daughters, Dafna and Ella, are kidnapped and later seen in Gaza in footage from the Strip. 11:30 a.m.: The only substantial remaining defense force in the kibbutz consists of seven undercover officers in a single armored Wolf vehicle. The unit’s two other vehicles had already evacuated the wounded. The team patrols the kibbutz, engaging terrorists wherever they can, firing through the vehicle’s riot-control gun ports. At one point, they are hit by an anti-tank missile but continue driving, despite heavy damage. 12:00 p.m.: A reinforcement unit—a light Jeep Wrangler carrying five Maglan soldiers, led by Maj. Chen Bouchris—encounters a Hamas ambush in a wooded area near the kibbutz. Bouchris and two soldiers are killed in the ensuing gunfire. The two surviving soldiers continue fighting and radio for backup. 12:30 p.m.: The terrorists holding Tomer Eliaz-Arava arrive at the Zohar family home, but the situation takes a tragic turn. The family of four had survived thus far thanks to a deadbolt that father Yaniv had installed inside their reinforced safe room. After two hours of silence, they step outside—just as the terrorists arrive. The attackers open fire, killing all four. 12:35 p.m.: After two hours of being forced to accompany the terrorists, Tomer Eliaz-Arava realizes they are no longer taking hostages—but executing them. After witnessing the Zohar family’s murder, he makes a desperate run for the dairy farm. He is shot dead on the spot, likely by Israeli forces who mistakenly believe he is a terrorist. 1:00 p.m.: Terrorists attempt to abduct an entire family in their own vehicle, but the car stalls within the kibbutz. They then drag one of the family members toward Gaza on foot, taking her across the border into captivity. 1:15 p.m.: A second Maglan force of 70 soldiers arrives, advancing through the fields to avoid ambushes. As they enter the kibbutz, the last known hostage abduction takes place via the rear gate. 1:30 p.m.: Another Maglan unit arrives, accompanied by Maj. Gen. (res.) Noam Tibon, who drove from his home in Tel Aviv in his private car to rescue his son, Amir, and his grandchildren. On his way, Tibon stops near Kibbutz Mefalsim to assist wounded soldiers. He leaves his wife, Gali, behind to help evacuate the injured and continues toward Nahal Oz, joining a crowded military vehicle. A wounded Yamam counterterrorism officer, who refuses to evacuate, also joins the force. Near the kibbutz, Tibon, 63, drops his personal handgun and picks up the weapon of fallen Maj. Chen Bouchris to engage in combat. 1:40 p.m.: The force enters the kibbutz, eliminating remaining terrorists and securing the area. Tibon leads the effort to evacuate the wounded from the ambush site, transporting them to where his wife, Gali, is stationed near Mefalsim. There, he meets Maj. Gen. (res.) Israel Ziv and a Givati reconnaissance unit. The two former generals join the Givati fighters on their return to Nahal Oz. 2:30 p.m.: A tragic friendly fire incident unfolds, marking the third such incident in two hours. A Givati reconnaissance team is ordered to hold position near a gate for evacuation operations. However, an unauthorized group joins them, including an officer, a cadet, and a man from Netivot who claimed to be a former Yamas officer, wearing a police cap and civilian clothes. Against orders, the group begins clearing buildings. Spotting movement on the second floor of a house, they suspect a terrorist is inside and request permission to fire. The 'security officer' from Netivot opens fire, killing 48-year-old Ran Poslushni, a local alert squad member who had been fighting terrorists all morning with his soldier son’s weapon. 3:00 p.m.: Tibon takes part in clearing operations and, for the first time that day, reaches his son Amir’s home in the kibbutz. 3:30 p.m.: The final engagement in Nahal Oz takes place, with one last terrorist killed after dozens of others had fled back to Gaza. 6:30 p.m. – 8:00 a.m. (next morning): Residents are evacuated to the Mishmar HaNegev military base, before being relocated to Kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. The failures of the Northern Brigade Despite being vastly outnumbered and caught by surprise, the small defending forces in Nahal Oz successfully repelled Hamas’ first assault on October 7, demonstrating exceptional courage and skill. However, for three critical hours, reinforcements failed to arrive, command coordination was ineffective and the second wave of terrorists — responsible for most of the massacres and abductions — was able to advance unchallenged. The battalion reserve force was diverted to Kfar Aza, where it proved too weak, undersized and poorly equipped due to decisions made at the regional brigade and divisional command levels. The investigation found that the Gaza Division and Northern Brigade lacked any reserve force, a fundamental failure in defensive planning. Col. Haim Cohen, commander of the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade, who remains in his position despite multiple command failures identified in previous investigations, stayed in the division’s command center rather than positioning himself closer to the battle, failing to provide an accurate assessment of the situation in Nahal Oz. A whiteboard in his office incorrectly listed elite units such as Sayeret Matkal, Yamam and Shayetet 13 as being deployed in the kibbutz, creating a false operational picture detached from reality. According to the investigation, Cohen should have set up a forward command post in the field, in line with standard defensive doctrine for surprise attacks. The original plan called for a command post near Mavki'im north of Gaza, but given the unfolding disaster, it should have been relocated to Sa’ad Junction — a key intersection in northern Gaza border communities, linking Sderot, Kfar Aza, Nahal Oz, Re’im and southern battle zones. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, thousands of soldiers and officers rushed from their homes to join the fight, arriving at Sa’ad Junction hoping for orders. However, brigade and division commanders lost control, leaving many to self-deploy into scattered battle zones without clear direction. The investigation also revealed critical intelligence failures, including the brigade’s unawareness that Nahal Oz’s emergency weapons were locked in an armory instead of being stored in responders' homes, severely hampering defense efforts. Despite these failures, the report praised the bravery of several key figures who played a decisive role in preventing an even greater tragedy: First Sgt. Yaakov Krasniansky (killed in action), whose undercover police team held back dozens of terrorists; security coordinator Ilan Fiorentino (killed in action), who saved lives and fought to defend the kibbutz; and Maj. Gen. (res.) Noam Tibon and his wife, Gali, who, while en route to rescue their son, joined the fight and assisted in life-saving evacuations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjx2gfvoke	2025-03-04T06:58:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/Byb52Ktsqyl/Byb52Ktsqyl_0_155_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

We knew this was point of no return—then the hunt began': The so...	Seventeen were killed at Zikim Beach on October 7, but IDF probe finds toll could have been far worse without Navy control operators who spotted threat and raised alarm; 'Nothing prepares you for this moment,' they recall Naval control units played a crucial role during the October 7 attack, being the first to identify the infiltration of Hamas naval commandos via the sea. This was explicitly detailed in the Israeli Navy's investigation published last week. Lieutenant S., a 21-year-old who served as the shift supervisor that morning, was the one who declared, over the communication system, a confirmed infiltration into Israel, enabling the Navy forces and 916th Flotilla from Ashdod base to respond quickly and prevent a larger disaster. Thanks to her vigilance and the alerts she issued along with her shift colleagues, security forces were prepared in Zikim and managed to prevent a more severe infiltration into the kibbutz. The Navy successfully destroyed five out of seven Hamas attack boats. However, their valiant efforts notwithstanding, 16 terrorists managed to reach the shore, where they carried out a massacre of civilians, murdering 17 people. In an interview with Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, Lieutenant S. described the moments of pressure and how she and nine other control operators dealt with the extraordinary event. She said that declaring the maritime infiltration was an unforgettable moment when she fully realized the magnitude of the responsibility on her shoulders. Alongside tight cooperation with fighters at sea, control operators worked tirelessly to guide the forces and try to prevent a larger disaster. Following the harrowing experience, Lieutenant S. decided to stay in the military and become an officer, driven by a desire to apply the lessons learned and mentor the next generation of control operators to protect the State of Israel. Navy's investigation of October 7 'This was a completely normal shift, a calm night shift with nothing unusual,' recounted Lieutenant S. 'At 6:30, alarms and red alerts started sounding in the Gaza border region, and we began sensing that something was happening. A few minutes later, we detected targets moving rapidly northward. 'At first, we thought they were Gazan fishing boats we’re accustomed to seeing on a daily basis. But then we saw them crossing the border. At that moment, I declared over the communication system that there was an infiltration event, and from there, things unfolded. We detected more and more targets arriving one after the other. 'We called and scrambled forces. We called the Zikim security officer several times and warned him about a terrorist cell heading toward Zikim. Although we’re responsible for the maritime border, there are also assets on land that could be affected by this, and we tried to respond to every incident and issue alerts. We succeeded to some extent because, in the Zikim area, they were prepared with a rapid response team thanks to our warning. We prepared them for the arrival of the terrorists, as well as other positions along the coast.' 'We realized this was the point of no return' She described how, initially, there was hysteria and panic, but they quickly composed themselves and began acting: 'As the shift supervisor, I tried to manage the event together with the control officer on duty in the operations center. We tried to understand what was happening, calm the other operators, and take control of the situation,' she recalled. Lieutenant S. and her shift colleagues were determined to prevent the entry of hundreds of terrorists. 'From the moment we identified the targets, we guided the Dabur patrol boats at sea to intercept the targets, even as they came under fire. Targets continued advancing northward, and some were stopped just before reaching sensitive coastal areas,' she said. 'We managed to stop some boats, but others landed on the shore. One by one, the targets reached Zikim beach, and the last one landed at the Erez post on the shore. The terrorists disembarked from their rubber boats, threatening the forces stationed there and even firing anti-tank missiles at sea. 'We discovered other Hamas rubber boats that landed near the lifeguard's station—a civilian gathering point where there was also an infantry force. We identified the boats landing and starting to carry out a massacre of civilians. We tracked each boat and directed our forces to intercept them. Some were successfully intercepted, others weren’t. We did everything we could. It’s a very large sector, and this event extended far beyond the landing of Hamas forces. By 7:30 a.m., all the terrorists had landed, and we began a pursuit to locate them all along the 2.5-mile coastline. They were hiding among the bushes, and we finished intercepting them with the help of the Dabur boats at sea.' 'Nothing prepares you for this moment' 'What I remember most from that morning is the realization that this was the point of no return; the event was happening, and it wasn’t just a localized incident—it was targets crossing northward,' she said of those moments on that horrendous Saturday. 'The moment I declared the border crossing and the raid on the shore is one I’ll never forget. It was a moment where I tried to do my best because I understood civilians could be harmed, and that’s why I do this job.' Lieutenant Z. added: 'I didn’t expect this, certainly not during a routine shift that began so normally. Nothing prepares you for this moment or gives any sign that something different would happen during this shift. I didn’t think I’d witness such a situation during my service because it’s not something that’s happened or been seen recently. During routine operations, we dealt with other threats, like Gazan fishermen encroaching into restricted areas. I didn’t think I’d be on a shift where everything would change so drastically. No one expected this level of intensity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although control operators prevented a greater disaster and achieved significant successes in certain instances, according to IDF investigations, she still feels a heavy sense of responsibility and guilt. 'During the event, it’s hard to grasp that the border under my responsibility was breached and that I was responsible for ensuring the maritime border wasn’t penetrated. When targets crossed the border, I declared it over the communication system and realized they were heading for the shore. It’s very hard to accept that the border was breached and that I wasn’t able to fulfill the mission. We did everything we could, but we failed in the end. The sense of guilt doesn’t change. In the end, it doesn’t matter if it was one person on the shore who didn’t return or 18. Ultimately, it’s people I was supposed to protect, and I didn’t fulfill my mission. It doesn’t matter if people tell me I did a good job. It’s nice to know we prevented a larger disaster, but it doesn’t lessen the guilt—it’s hard. The shift ended, and I understood the outcome.' 'We are their eyes, and they are our strength' 'We had great cooperation with the fighters at sea, who understood the event very quickly and immediately engaged,' she emphasized, crediting the success to the fighters on the ground. 'They were with us throughout the event, and we had significant collaboration. Ultimately, following the instructions they received from the base commander, after he declared a confirmed terrorist attack, they did everything to neutralize the targets we directed them to. We are their eyes, and they are our strength. Control operators will always work hand-in-hand with the fighters at sea. It’s inevitable.' Lieutenant S. enlisted as a naval control operator, but following the events of October 7, she decided to remain in the military and become an officer in the same unit where she served that fateful Saturday. 'I always wanted to be an officer, but during my service, I thought it wouldn’t work out,' she shared. 'After October 7, everything suddenly fell into place, and I realized I wasn’t ready to leave. I wanted to give more of myself and contribute more to the system, both professionally and as a leader. Another colleague who was on the same shift decided with me to go to officers’ training, and the base fully supported us. We went to officers’ training after already being in mandatory service, all to return here and bring the lessons and insights, and to be part of the next generation of the army and the defense of the State of Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkfdrueijg	2025-03-04T03:31:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/04/H1X00u00HhR/H1X00u00HhR_0_28_566_319_0_small.jpg

Footage shows vehicle engulfed in flames after airstrike; incoming IDF chief Zamir assesses military readiness in Gaza, Jenin and Lebanon An Israeli official confirmed that a senior commander in Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force was killed on Tuesday when a drone targeted a vehicle in Rashkenani, near the southern Lebanon city of Tyre. Footage published by Lebanese media showed the vehicle engulfed in flames after the strike. Hours earlier, Israeli forces identified a suspect approaching them near the Philadelphi Corridor in the southern Gaza Strip. According to the IDF, the suspect posed an immediate threat and was shot. The individual, a Palestinian local, was unarmed and killed. Palestinian reports described 'intense gunfire' from Israeli military vehicles toward homes in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan neighborhood. The incidents come amid heightened tensions over a possible resumption of fighting, following the end of the cease-fire, the halt of humanitarian aid deliveries and Hamas’ rejection of an extended deal mediated by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 'We will continue to act against any threat to Israeli civilians and forces,' the IDF said.

Infants as young as one raped in Sudan, UNICEF says	UN says least 16 children under five have suffered sexual violence in ongoing civil war, blaming paramilitary RSF for most incidents, as well as using sexual violence as weapon Children under five, including babies, are among victims of sexual violence in the war between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), according to findings shared on Tuesday by U.N. children's agency UNICEF. The U.N. agency cited a database compiled by Sudan-based groups helping survivors of sexual violence which showed that of 221 cases involving children registered since last year, 16 were under five years old, including four one-year-olds. About one-third of victims were male, it said. The database includes cases from across the country, but aid workers and rights groups think it represents just a fraction of the cases because stigma, fear of reprisals and lack of access to medical facilities limit reporting. Some of the survivors cited by UNICEF say they fell pregnant as a result of the assaults, resulting in rejection by relatives and additional hardships. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One woman who was held in captivity with other women and girls was quoted saying, 'After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming.' 'They only release these girls at dawn, and they return almost unconscious.' UNICEF did not say who was responsible for the child rapes, calling on both sides to respect international law. Neither the RSF nor the army immediately responded to requests for comment. 'Children as young as one being raped by armed men should shock anyone to their core and compel immediate action,' UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement sent to journalists. War erupted in April 2023 from a power struggle between the army and the RSF ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, triggering huge displacement and hunger crises. A U.N. fact-finding mission has described levels of sexual abuse as 'staggering'. The majority of known cases were perpetrated by the RSF and its allies, the mission said, noting it was more difficult to report in army-controlled territories. Reuters has reported on women who said they were gang raped in ethnically targeted attacks by the RSF and allied Arab militiamen. U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk said last week that over half of reported rape cases in Sudan were gang rape, 'an indication that sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war'. The RSF has previously said it would investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h100g6l4iye	2025-03-04T02:25:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/04/17/H12a5R5f3/H12a5R5f3_0_176_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Injured, starving and held near a waste pit—new testimonies reveal hostages Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal’s worsening condition; their brothers say both suffer from untreated infections, restricted movement and severe psychological distress 'They're begging for their lives, watching their friends being released, and then the door is slammed in their faces, throwing them back into the tunnel': This is how the cruel video of their younger brothers, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, pleading for their lives while watching the release ceremony of other hostages, reached Ilay David and Gal Gilboa while they were in the U.S. as part of their joint efforts to bring their brothers and all the other hostages home. 'We were sitting in an auditorium watching a speech by Trump,' Gilboa recounts. 'We saw the images while Trump was speaking, also about the hostages. Our phones started going crazy, and we saw the videos—it shook everything. It was very stressful, very frightening and very frustrating. We started watching it without sound. Of course, we immediately recognized them. Ilay said, 'Wait, let's go outside and look,' but it was hard for him. I couldn’t hold back, and in the end, we watched it together. There were senior officials from the White House there, and we showed it to as many of them as we could. They were horrified.' He adds, 'My mom didn’t want to see the video—they were hysterical at home. This was one of the things we feared seeing the most.' 'At home, everything fell apart—my mom and sister lost it,' David continues. 'There are a lot of mixed emotions here. On one hand, it’s a first sign of life from Evyatar. On the other hand, suddenly you see their expressions—they’re literally begging for their lives. You see their friends being released, and then the door is closed in their faces before they’re thrown back into the tunnel. You realize this is the first time they’ve seen daylight in months. It’s devastating.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I immediately wanted to go out into the world and scream for them to bring Evyatar and Guy back to us. We haven't seen them in 500 days. We haven't heard their voices,' says Gilboa. 'Despite all the difficulty, it also gave a certain hope. They’re alive, and they’re together. It feels so close, but they’re still so far away—it’s maddening. You can’t cope with it.' David adds, 'We tried to find the good in it, maybe even laugh about it—it’s clear they’re playing along, and they’re terrible actors.' 'I thought about coming back to Israel,' Gilboa says, 'but this caused such a media storm, and we realized that because of the video, we could stay and continue our work. We tried to leverage it, to show everyone the cruelty of their captors, who are mentally torturing them. We’re not politicians. We’re appealing to people’s hearts first and foremost, and it served us in that way. But the psychological toll is enormous—it’s psychological torture.' What else did you see in their faces that perhaps we wouldn’t notice? David: 'Exhaustion, depression, anemia. Hostages who returned and were with them told us this as well. We got indications from those who were released that they’re not in good health. You can see it—their eyes are dark, lifeless. They’re half the people they were before. They’re exhausted, depressed, in an extremely difficult mental state. 'And that’s just the preview. After hearing testimonies from those who’ve returned, I’m broken. I now know in detail what my brother is going through there. I know that every day, he walks through an 11-meter-long tunnel, one meter wide, with a hole for waste. The only advantage to being underground is that they’re not threatened by IDF bombings. Other than that, it’s the worst kind of hell for any human being.' Gilboa: 'The condition of both of them is very bad. They both have untreated infections. They don’t see daylight and have restricted movement. Evyatar doesn’t have his glasses. They’re starving.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1cvnbns1l	2025-03-04T02:22:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/rJjcfVWbckl/rJjcfVWbckl_1_93_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Arab leaders meet to back alternative to Trump 'Gaza Riviera' pla...	Middle East leaders seek alternative to US takeover of Gaza; Egyptian idea for interim bodies gaining most traction; Hamas would be sidelined in plan to be aired at summit Arab leaders meet in Cairo on Tuesday with Egypt to present a plan for Gaza that would sideline Hamas and create interim bodies run by Arab, Muslim and Western states in a counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump's idea of depopulating the enclave and transforming it into a beach destination. Who will run Gaza is the big unanswered question in negotiations over the future of the Palestinian enclave shattered by 15 months of Israel's war with Hamas. The terrorist group has said it rejects any solution imposed on the Gaza Strip by outsiders. Egypt, Jordan and Gulf Arab states have for almost a month been consulting over an alternative to Trump's ambition for an exodus of Palestinians and U.S. rebuild of Gaza, which they fear will destabilize the entire region. Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said the United States would take ownership of the war-ravaged territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern 'Riviera.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law. Meanwhile, Egypt's idea is the frontrunner, diplomats and sources say. It envisages a Governance Assistance Mission replacing Gaza's Hamas-run government for an unspecified interim period, with responsibility for humanitarian aid and for starting reconstruction, according to a draft seen by Reuters. Israel is unlikely to oppose an Arab entity taking responsibility for Gaza's government if Hamas is off the scene, said a source familiar with the matter. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters the group rejects any attempt to impose projects or any form of non-Palestinian administration, or the presence of any foreign forces on Gaza Strip territory. 'We are keen for the success of the summit, and we hope that there will be a call to reject the displacement and to protect the right of our people in resisting the occupation and govern itself away from any custodianship and intervention,' he added. No to Trump plan Egypt's plan firmly rejects the U.S. proposal for mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, which Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan see as a security threat. The Egyptian plan does not say who would pay to rebuild Gaza at a UN-estimated cost of more than $53 billion. Two sources told Reuters that Gulf and Arab states would need to commit at least $20 billion in the initial phase. Any proposal will require heavy buy-in from oil-rich Gulf Arab states like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, who have the billions of dollars needed. The UAE, which sees Hamas as an existential threat, wants an immediate and complete disarmament of the group while other Arab countries advocate a gradual approach, said another source close to the matter. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas launched the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 others abducted into the Gaza Strip and held hostage. Hamas-led terrorists are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released in cease-fire agreements. Israel has rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more. Since Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority out of Gaza after a brief civil war in 2007, it has crushed all opposition there. Supported by Iran, it built an extensive security apparatus and military organization around a vast network of tunnels, much of which Israel says it has now destroyed. Egypt's proposal envisions that states on a steering board could establish a fund to support the interim governing body and arrange donor conferences to seek contributions for longer-term reconstruction and development plan for Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syumyi4ojl	2025-03-04T01:20:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/23/S1gkbd1g00kx/S1gkbd1g00kx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Iran summoned Turkey's ambassador following Ankara's warning rega...	Iran's foreign ministry summoned Turkey's ambassador, state TV reported on Tuesday, after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned Tehran against undermining Syria's stability. The Iranian foreign ministry published a statement saying that a meeting took place on Monday between the Turkish ambassador and Mahmoud Heydari, the Iran foreign ministry's Director General for the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. 'The common interests of the two countries and the sensitivity of regional conditions require avoiding wrongful comments and unreal analyses that could lead to differences and tensions in our bilateral relations,' Heydari said. Fidan last week gave an interview to Qatar's al Jazeera in which he said Iran's foreign policy relying on militias was 'dangerous' and needed to change. 'If you are trying to cause anxiety in a third country, other countries can also disturb you by supporting groups in your own country,' Turkey's foreign minister added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkkswlno1e	2025-03-04T01:11:16-08:00

Russian missile experts flew to Iran amid clashes with Israel	Records show senior specialists in air defense, artillery, rocketry, advanced weapons and missile testing, traveled to Islamic Republic in 2023, reportedly visiting missile sites, Caspian Sea base - with purpose of visit unclear Several senior Russian missile specialists have visited Iran over the past year as the Islamic Republic has deepened its defense cooperation with Moscow, a Reuters review of travel records and employment data indicates. The seven weapons experts were booked to travel from Moscow to Tehran aboard two flights on April 24 and September 17 last year, according to documents detailing the two group bookings as well as the passenger manifest for the second flight. The booking records include the men's passport numbers with six of the seven having the prefix '20.' That denotes a passport used for official state business issued to government officials on foreign work trips and military personnel stationed abroad according to an edict published by the Russian government and a document on the Russian foreign ministry's website. Reuters was unable to determine what the seven were doing in Iran. A senior Iranian defense ministry official said Russian missile experts had made multiple visits to Iranian missile production sites last year, including two underground facilities with some of the visits taking place in September. The official who requested anonymity to discuss security matters didn't identify the sites. A Western defense official who monitors Iran's defense cooperation with Russia and also requested anonymity said an unspecified number of Russian missile experts visited an Iranian missile base about 15 km (9 miles) west of the port of Amirabad on Iran's Caspian Sea coast in September. Reuters couldn't establish if the visitors referred to by the officials included the Russians on the two flights. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The seven Russians identified by Reuters all have senior military backgrounds, with two ranked colonel and two lieutenant colonel, according to a review of Russian databases containing information about citizens' jobs or places of work, including tax phone and vehicle records. Two are experts in air defense missile systems, three specialize in artillery and rocketry, while one has a background in advanced weapons development and another has worked at a missile testing range, the records showed. Reuters was unable to establish whether all are still working in those roles as the employment data ranged from 2021 to 2024. Their flights to Tehran came at a precarious time for Iran which found itself drawn into a tit for tat battle with arch foe Israel that saw both sides mount military strikes on each other in April and October. Reuters contacted all the men by phone. Five of them denied they had been to Iran, denied they worked for the military or both, while one declined to comment and one hung up. Iran's defense and foreign ministries declined to comment for this article, as did the public relations office of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite force that oversees Iran's ballistic missile program. The Russian defense ministry didn't respond to a request for comment. Cooperation between the two countries whose leaders signed a 20-year military pact in Moscow in January has already influenced Russia's war on Ukraine with large numbers of Iranian-designed Shahed drones deployed on the battlefield. Rockets and artillery The flight booking information for the seven travelers was shown to Reuters by Hooshyaran e Vatan, a group of activist hackers opposed to the Iranian government. The hackers said the seven were traveling with VIP status. Reuters corroborated the information with the Russian passenger manifest for the September flight which was provided by a source with access to Russian state databases. The news agency was unable to access a manifest for the earlier flight so couldn't verify that the five Russian specialists booked on it actually made the trip. Denis Kalko, 48, and Vadim Malov, 46, were among the five Russian weapons experts whose seats were booked as a group on the April flight the records showed. Kalko worked at the defense ministry's Academy for Military Anti-Aircraft Defense, tax records for 2021 show. Malov worked for a military unit that trains anti-aircraft missile forces according to car ownership records for 2024. Andrei Gusev, 45, Alexander Antonov, 43, and Marat Khusainov, 54, were also booked on the April flight. Gusev, 45, is a lieutenant colonel who works as deputy head of the faculty of General Purpose Rockets and Artillery Munitions at the defense ministry's Penza Artillery Engineering Institute according to a 2021 news item on the institute's website. Antonov, 43, has worked at the Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate of the Defense Ministry according to car registration records from 2024 while bank data shows Khusainov, 54, a colonel has worked at the Kapustin Yar missile testing range. One of the two passengers onboard the second flight to Tehran in September was Sergei Yurchenko, 46, who has also worked at the Rocket and Artillery Directorate according to undated mobile phone records. His passport number had the prefix '22.' Reuters was unable to determine what that signified, though according to the government edict on passports, it isn't used for private citizens or diplomats. The other passenger on the September flight was Oleg Fedosov, 46. Residence records give his address as the office of the Directorate of Advanced Inter-Service Research and Special Projects. That is a branch of the defense ministry tasked with developing weapons systems of the future. Fedosov had previously flown from Tehran to Moscow in October 2023 according to Russian border crossing records viewed by Reuters. On that occasion, as he did for the September 2024 flight, Fedosov used his passport reserved for official state business, the records showed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjd2l74oke	2025-03-03T23:14:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/12/HkhnJTefke/HkhnJTefke_0_171_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Blue and white security independence	How can we strengthen local defense manufacturing, reduce dependence on foreign countries, and overcome existing barriers and challenges? All the answers to the most pressing questions will be addressed at the Defense Tech Conference, organized by the Yedioth Ahronoth Group in collaboration with the Chamber of Engineers, taking place on March 4. The conference will be held at the Lago Hall in Rishon LeZion and will feature senior professionals, government and security officials, and a lineup of experts on stage The current war has underscored the critical importance of Israeli-made defense systems. A special panel, set to take place this Tuesday at the Defense Tech Conference organized by the Yedioth Ahronoth Group in collaboration with the Chamber of Engineers, will delve into Israel’s security independence, the potential risks of reliance on the U.S., and strategies for preserving and strengthening local production. Reducing Reliance on Foreign Suppliers: A Strategic Imperative Participants in the discussion will include Maj. Gen. (res.) Muni Katz, VP of Strategy and Israel at Israel Aerospace Industries; Maj. Gen. (res.) Michael (Miki) Edelstein, VP of Strategy and Senior Vice President at Elbit Systems; Brig. Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi, Chairman and Founder of the Habithonistim movement; and Ali Bing, Deputy Budget Director at the Ministry of Finance. The panel will be moderated by Yedioth Ahronoth and ynet journalist Elisha Ben Kimon. 'Strengthening independence and the need for security self-sufficiency is a global trend that has been gaining momentum in recent years,' explains Maj. Gen. (res.) Muni Katz. 'Israel is a unique case due to its security challenges and geo-strategic position. We will never achieve 100% independence, but it is crucial to continue striving for it while minimizing reliance on foreign countries as much as possible.' Brig. Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi adds: 'The findings of the Nagel Committee on the IDF's force-building strategy, to which we testified and contributed, reinforced the understanding that external sources alone cannot be relied upon—we need a stable, flexible, and advanced local production system. Defense exports are not just an economic growth engine but also a diplomatic tool that enables Israel to strengthen international ties.' The Future of Israel’s Defense Industry: Innovation and National Security Maj. Gen. (res.) Michael (Miki) Edelstein emphasizes: 'The past year and a half has proven beyond doubt that local production is essential for maintaining independence, ensuring flexibility and operational superiority, and rapidly adapting solutions to the battlefield—providing a decisive operational advantage. Some of these developments are also generating significant interest from militaries and governments worldwide.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: From an economic perspective, Ali Bing explains that increasing security dependence has introduced numerous challenges. According to him, 'The dilemma surrounding the depth of security independence carries significant budgetary implications, as well as broader economic impacts. Expanding government involvement in areas without a comparative advantage could potentially hinder growth.'

‘He was completely alone’: Hostage’s father shares son's harrowin...	Omer Shem Tov spent more than a year in Hamas captivity, most of it underground; his father, Malki, describes his harsh conditions and the family’s fight for his release, culminating in emotional reunion after 505 days For nearly 450 days, Omer Shem Tov was held captive in Hamas tunnels, much of it in isolation—including 50 days confined to what his captors called a 'dungeon.' His father, Malki Shem Tov, described his son’s ordeal in his first interview since Omer’s release. 'We had assessments that this was the situation,' Malki told Ynet on Monday. 'But we didn’t know for sure. When they told us, it hurt. The hardest part was knowing he was completely alone.' During the first hostage release deal, Omer was unaware that his fellow captive, Itay Regev—the younger brother of his close friend, Maya—had been freed. 'It surprised them both,' Malki said. 'Itay didn’t know he was being released. They were just told they were being separated. After two days, Omer realized Itay had likely been freed.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following Regev’s departure, Hamas terrorists transferred Omer to a deeper and longer tunnel, where he was confined to a cramped, underground cell. 'It was so small he couldn’t even stand or stretch his arms,' Malki said. 'No electricity, complete darkness, except for a small flashlight whose batteries would sometimes die, leaving him in total blackness.' At first, his captors provided flatbread, but eventually, he received only biscuits. 'The water was salty, undrinkable,' Malki recounted. 'It was incredibly hard. In his last days there, he struggled both physically and mentally to hold on.' 'Even in hell, there are levels' After 50 days, Hamas moved Omer again—this time to a different tunnel, still alone but in a slightly larger space. The walls were lined with white tiles, creating an illusion of light. 'Apparently, even in hell, there are degrees of suffering,' Malki said, his voice tinged with bitter humor. Omer remained in that tunnel until he was freed as part of the hostage deal. His older sister, Dana, explained that forced labor helped him endure captivity. 'They made him cook, clean after them, carry things. That kept him occupied.' His captors also gave him books—some left behind by Israeli soldiers—including The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest, which he read five times. 'They also gave him a book on the weekly Torah portions and even a Sudoku puzzle he couldn’t finish because he had no Internet to check the answers,' Malki said. Despite the psychological torment, Omer relied on his social skills. 'He has this personal charm, a way of connecting with people,' Malki explained. 'He quickly understood that to survive, he needed to build rapport with them. There was psychological terror, and when new guards arrived, they were harsher. But most of the time, he was with the same captors, and he managed to win them over.' The fight for his return While Omer struggled to survive, his family waged a relentless campaign for his release, traveling the world to speak on his behalf. Yet, inside the tunnels, Hamas manipulated what he saw. 'They had a TV, and he watched Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya,' Malki said. 'But those channels only showed the protests at the Prime Minister’s Office, not the ones in Hostage Square, where we were. His captors used that against him, telling him, ‘Look, even your parents aren’t looking for you.’' Dana added: 'He didn’t believe them, but it still hurt. He desperately wanted to see us somewhere.' Hamas did allow Omer to see social media posts, including an Instagram video of his family celebrating his birthday. He also saw a Ynet interview with his parents from October 2023. 'His captors showed him the picture and said, ‘Your parents look old,’' Malki said. 'We looked so gray and lost.' Like his family, Omer learned of his impending release from television. When the list of 33 hostages to be freed was published, he saw his name. 'His captors told him it wasn’t true, but he kept seeing hostages being released and realized it was happening,' Malki said. Three days before his release, Hamas terrorists blindfolded Omer and put him in a vehicle. 'Suddenly, he heard Arabic with an Israeli accent,' Dana said. 'He was in shock. He realized there was another Israeli next to him—one of ours.' That man was Eliyah Cohen, another hostage. 'At first, Omer couldn’t speak, but after a few hours, they became like brothers,' Malki said. 'Every day there feels like a lifetime, and in those three days, they bonded deeply—Omer, Eliyah, Tal Shoham and Omer Wenkert.' The moment of reunion Back home, his family endured agonizing anticipation. 'We packed his clothes—nothing new, so he’d feel at home,' Dana said. At the reception point at the IDF base in Re'im, his parents, Malki and Sheli, prepared his room with his favorite shoes, hat and handwritten notes reading, 'Your favorite clothes' and 'We’ve waited so long for this moment.' After 505 days, the reunion finally arrived. 'We walked in and saw him sitting with his face in his hands,' Malki recalled. 'We ran to each other and hugged. His first words were, ‘I’m so lucky you’re my parents.’' Omer later told them that in captivity, he and Regev spoke constantly about their families. 'They worried about us, hoping we weren’t suffering,' Dana said. 'When I hugged him, he said, ‘I’m glad it was me who was taken. If it were the other way around, I don’t know how I would’ve survived.’' As part of his recovery, Omer met with the parents of Ori Danino, a hostage who was killed in captivity. 'They came to see him and Eliyah, who had spent time with Ori,' Malki said. 'It was a devastating meeting. Omer had believed Ori was killed on October 7 because he suddenly disappeared. Only after being freed did he learn Ori survived nearly a year before Hamas murdered him.' Another emotional reunion was with Regev and his sister, Maya. 'It was a huge moment of closure,' Dana said. 'There were tears, laughter, so much emotion. They truly understand each other. Even though they were together for only 50 of Omer’s 500 days, every day in captivity is a lifetime.' During their time together in Hamas tunnels, Omer and Regev initially coped by pretending they were at their old restaurant jobs, with Omer 'serving' Regev imaginary meals. Eventually, hunger overtook their imagination. Still, one craving persisted—Omer dreamed of a hamburger. 'When they returned his notebook, we found doodles—one of a hamburger,' Malki said. 'He had dreamed of it for 505 days. When he was flown back in a helicopter, he even wrote it on the whiteboard inside.' That night, dozens of burgers arrived at the hospital, fulfilling that long-held wish. Now, Omer is headed to the White House to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, despite barely spending time at home in Herzliya. 'Two days ago, they asked if he’d be willing to go, and he immediately agreed,' Malki said. 'He’s ready to do whatever it takes to bring the hostages home. He understands what they’re going through and wants to make sure the world does too.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1vnmt7jkx	2025-03-03T22:17:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/01/SJGKbkbo1g/SJGKbkbo1g_2_0_1138_854_0_small.jpg
China hits back at U.S. imports as Trump's fresh tariffs take eff...	China on Tuesday swiftly retaliated against fresh U.S. tariffs, announcing 10%-15% hikes to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products, moving the world's top two economies a step closer toward an all-out trade war. Beijing also placed twenty-five U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds, but refrained from punishing any household names, as it did when it retaliated against the Trump administration's February 4 tariffs. Ten of these 25 U.S. firms were targeted by China for selling arms to Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory. China's latest retaliatory tariffs came as the extra 10% duty U.S. President Donald Trump threatened China with last week entered into force at 0501 GMT on March 4, resulting in a cumulative 20% tariff in response to what the White House considers Chinese inaction over drug flows.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjykbxni1e	2025-03-03T21:41:29-08:00	
Trump pauses all US military aid to Ukraine after angry clash wit...	US president suggests minerals deal with Ukraine still possible; Vance says best security is US economic stake in Ukraine; European leaders propose peace plan, seek US support U.S. President Donald Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine following his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official said, deepening the fissure that has opened between the two one-time allies. The move comes after Trump upended U.S. policy on Ukraine and Russia upon taking office in January, adopting a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow - and after an explosive confrontation with Zelensky at the White House on Friday in which Trump criticized him for being insufficiently grateful for Washington's backing in the war with Russia. 'President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,' said the official on Monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The White House had no immediate comment on the scope and amount of aid affected or how long the pause would last. The Pentagon could not provide further details. Zelensky's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment nor did the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington. On Monday, Trump again said Zelensky should be more appreciative of American support after earlier responding angrily to an Associated Press report quoting Zelensky as saying the end of the war is 'very, very far away.' 'This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!' Trump wrote on Truth Social, using an alternative spelling of the Ukrainian leader's name. Minerals deal not dead, says Trump Since Russia's invasion three years ago, the U.S. Congress has approved $175 billion in total assistance for Ukraine, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Trump administration inherited $3.85 billion worth of Congressionally-approved authority to dip into U.S. arms stocks for Ukraine, but given the growing row between Washington and Kyiv, it was already unlikely for that assistance to be used. Monday's move goes beyond the no-new aid stance Trump had taken since assuming office - and appears to halt deliveries of military equipment approved by Biden including munitions, missiles and other systems. But Trump also suggested on Monday that a deal to open up Ukraine's minerals to U.S. investment could still be agreed despite his frustration with Kyiv, as European leaders floated proposals for a truce in Russia's war with its neighbor. The Trump administration views a minerals deal as America's way of earning back some of the tens of billions of dollars it has given to Ukraine in financial and military aid since Russia invaded three years ago. When asked on Monday if the deal was dead, Trump said at the White House: 'No, I don't think so.' Trump described it as a 'great deal for us' and said he would give an update on the situation on Tuesday night when he addresses a joint session of Congress. Security guarantees In an interview on Fox News, Vice President JD Vance called on Zelensky to accept the minerals deal. 'If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,' Vance said. Zelensky has made clear that a cease-fire must carry explicit security guarantees from the West to ensure that Russia, which holds about 20% of its land, does not attack again. Trump has refused to give any such guarantees. Beyond the military portion, U.S. assistance to Ukraine also includes budgetary assistance, largely delivered through a World Bank trust fund, and other funds that had been delivered through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been throttled by the Trump White House. The U.S. decision left many questions unanswered, including whether munitions for the already delivered weapons systems can now be supplied or if the U.S. would still share intelligence with Ukraine on target identification and missile launches. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Key members of congressional oversight committees were not notified of the decision, including those on the Senate Armed Services Committee, a person with knowledge told Reuters. Razom for Ukraine, a Ukrainian advocacy group, condemned the White House's decision on aid. 'By abruptly halting military assistance to Ukraine, President Trump is hanging Ukrainians out to dry and giving Russia the green light to keep marching west,' the group said in a statement. Europe seeks peace plan Prior to the White House's decision to halt its aid, European nations were rallying around Zelensky and trying to hatch a peace plan. Privately, and sometimes publicly, officials are fuming at what they see as a betrayal of Ukraine, which had enjoyed staunch support from Washington since Russia's invasion. France, Britain and potentially other European countries have offered to send troops to Ukraine in the event of a cease-fire - something Moscow has already rejected - but say they would want support from the U.S., or a 'backstop.' 'There are clearly a number of options on the table,' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byaaawvj1g	2025-03-03T20:33:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/BymdxFkjkg/BymdxFkjkg_0_0_3000_1853_0_small.jpg

U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Monday that giving Washington an economic interest in the future of Ukraine will serve as a security guarantee for the country that Russia invaded in February 2022. President Donald Trump has been seeking a minerals deal with Ukraine - home to a trove of lithium deposits and rare earth minerals - as payback for billions of dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine during Russia's invasion. Trump said he will give more details on the future of that potential deal on Tuesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's talks with Trump in the White House on Friday broke down in acrimonious exchanges and ended without a formal agreement on that front.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byss3b4syx	2025-03-03T20:15:30-08:00	
US pauses military aid to Ukraine, says White House	The United States is pausing military aid to Ukraine days after U.S. President Donald Trump clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, a White House official confirmed on Monday. The official said the U.S. is pausing and reviewing aid to ensure it is contributing to a solution. The pause will last until Trump determines the country's leaders demonstrate a good-faith commitment to peace, according to Bloomberg and Fox News reports. 'This is not permanent termination of aid, it's a pause,' Fox News quoted a Trump administration official as saying. Bloomberg reported that all U.S. military equipment not currently in Ukraine would be paused, including weapons in transit on aircraft and ships or waiting in transit areas in Poland. It added that Trump ordered Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to execute the pause.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjtnnb4sjg	2025-03-03T20:13:46-08:00	
Inside one organization's vision to transform northern Israel thr...	JNF-USA CEO Russell Robinson: 'This is a magnificent, beautiful nation, and here's a magnificent, beautiful area of the country' A new venture by Jewish National Fund-USA will bring a fresh skill set to northern Israel: culinary arts. 'If you look out, close your eyes, open them – you're in Tuscany,' JNF-USA CEO Russell Robinson said last week during a tour of what will soon be the Galilee Culinary Institute by JNF. 'This is a magnificent, beautiful nation, and here's a magnificent, beautiful area of the country. The breathtaking views of northern Israel can oftentimes make you feel like you're in another part of the world. 'I see the beauty and the life and the tranquility, all the things that maybe you don't use in words when describing anything in Israel,' Robinson continued. 'Sometimes you can literally hear cars driving from miles away because it's so quiet—the animals, the beauty of the area, and the tranquility of it.' He said there is a spirit in the north—people who want to build the nation of Israel. And since JNF-USA has been investing in the north long before October 7, 2023, and the war, the nonprofit has seen the fruits of its labor. Robinson said he envisions continuing to transform northern Israel into thriving communities. 'For us, it was always about going north, bringing people up north,' he told ILTV News. 'October 7 and the war—we had to shift, but not change. We had to pivot. But we're still heading forward. And we're heading forward in a way that brings people back home, brings people home, and brings people to the region with new opportunities—putting it on the map.' In Kibbutz Gonen, where the culinary institute will be located, the vision is to literally bring something new to the table. The dream of the institute began seven years ago—to make it the 'finest institute in the world,' Robinson said. He noted that students will have the opportunity to learn French cooking while overlooking vast farms in the distance. The institute will feature a bakery, winery, and beer brewery, as well as a restaurant and dorms for students coming from all over the world. 'You're going to be utilizing the beauty of Israel, and the experience of Israel is part of the whole culinary teaching experience,' Robinson explained. 'It's not that you come here and you're going to learn only because of what we're going to teach you. You're going to learn from everything that goes on here.' He said JNF-USA envisions the Culinary Institute playing a key role in revitalizing the ever-growing city of Kiryat Shmona and its surrounding communities. The nonprofit is investing not only in culinary education but also in entrepreneurs, medical facilities, and pre-military programs in the region. With each new opportunity, they hope to see the area continue to expand. 'Israel is all about being a light unto the nations, and it's going to be that place where people say, ‘Wow,’' Robinson concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byj1qges1l	2025-03-03T19:03:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/03/15/BkNjGBsSL/BkNjGBsSL_0_176_1805_1017_0_small.jpg

IDF strikes military compounds in northern Syria	Military attacks come amid growing tensions between Jerusalem and Damascus over Syrian Druze community and demilitarization of border region The IDF confirmed on Monday that it targeted a military site in Qardaha, in the mountains of Latakia province, northwest Syria, where weapons belonging to the previous regime were stored. According to an IDF statement, the attack was carried out 'due to recent developments in the area.' The statement added that the IDF continues to monitor the situation in Syria and will take all necessary measures to protect Israeli citizens. Syrian sources said the raids struck three former Syrian army assets, a radar station north of the city, weapons depot and a berth near Syria's Mediterranean port of Tartus, which is a driving distance away from Latakia. Syrian state news agency SANA also confirmed the strikes in the vicinity of Tartus, which it said caused no casualties. Prior to the attack, the IDF reportedly sent SMS warnings to residents along Syria’s coastal region, urging them to 'stay away from gathering sites of terrorists.' Roughly two hours after the Tartus strike, Al Jazeera reported another Israeli attack in the Janta area, near the Syria-Lebanon border. The IDF has previously carried out strikes in this region to prevent arms smuggling by Hezbollah. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan commented on recent statements by Israeli leaders extending IDF protection over Syria’s Druze community against government forces and the demilitarization of the southern border region. Without mentioning Israel by name, Erdogan said, 'Those who seek to benefit from Syria’s instability must know they will not achieve their goals. We will not allow Syria to be divided as they envision.' His remarks followed warnings issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz on Sunday, cautioning the Syrian government against harming the Druze population in the city of Jaramana, near Damascus. 'We will not allow the extremist Islamic regime in Syria to harm the Druze. If they do, they will face consequences,' the two officials warned. Since the fall of the regime of former president Bashar Assad, Israel has maintained ties with Syria’s Druze community. The Foreign Ministry recently delivered 8,000 humanitarian aid packages to Syrian Druze, each valued at 300 shekels (approximately $80). The Israeli warning to Syria came against the backdrop of escalating clashes in Jaramana between government forces and Druze armed groups. Arab media reported that Syrian government security forces launched an operation around the city after one of their members was killed by gunmen. A Druze resident of Jaramana described the situation as 'very dire' and called on Israel to intervene. Speaking to Ynet, he said, 'We need Israel to act as soon as possible. We cannot live in an Islamic state, and we do not want one. The situation is terrible—there is no water or electricity. We buy drinking water, and we stay up at night to protect our families.' Despite Syria’s change in leadership, Israel continues to carry out strikes across the country. Under the Assad regime, Israeli attacks targeted Iranian entrenchment efforts as well as Syrian military infrastructure. In recent days, Israel has reportedly conveyed to Syria’s new leadership that it expects the border region—from Damascus southward—to remain demilitarized. 'Any attempt by Syrian regime forces or terrorist organizations to establish a presence in the southern security zone will be met with fire,' Defense Minister Katz warned following Israel’s latest strikes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/synzxjxo1l	2025-03-03T14:39:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/ryibhvXike/ryibhvXike_0_508_810_457_0_small.jpg
Canada seeks court order to ensure Pornhub operator obtains conse...	Canada's privacy watchdog said on Monday he was seeking a court order against the operator of Pornhub.com and other adult entertainment websites to ensure it obtained the consent of people whose images were featured. The move by Privacy Commissioner Philippe Dufresne marks the second time in a year he has expressed concern about Montreal-based Aylo Holdings. In February 2024, he said it broke privacy laws by allowing the sharing of intimate images without the direct knowledge or permission of everyone depicted. In a statement, Dufresne said he was seeking a Federal Court order to require Aylo to comply with Canadian privacy law. 'To date, Aylo has not adequately addressed the significant concerns that were identified in my investigation. Privacy is a fundamental right, and individuals must be protected,' he said. Aylo was not immediately available for comment.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkxslnxo1l	2025-03-03T13:44:00-08:00

The prisoners’ dilemma: Israel vows to eliminate freed terrorists...	As part of the hostage deal, 736 prisoners and 1,167 Gazans were freed; Israel's security officials debate which is better—deporting them to Gaza, the West Bank or exile them abroad. Can Israel monitor them? What if they rejoin terror? Will Israel release another Yahya Sinwar? The goal is sacred, but the numbers are hard to grasp: 736 prisoners and security detainees and another 1,167 Gazans held in Israel were released from prison as part of the current hostage deal. Now Israel's security establishment is debating whether they should be deported to Gaza, the West Bank or be exiled abroad. How can Israel keep a close eye on them? What if they return to engage in terrorism (and some of them certainly will)? What if Israel needs to carry out hits on top terrorists who are released to Turkey or Qatar? But most of all, there is one big concern about releasing another potential Yahya Sinwar. November 25, 2023, the second day of the first hostage deal, was a day of joy and excitement in Israel, as 13 Israeli hostages were released after 50 days in Hamas captivity. Among them were also small children, like Emily Hand, Ohad Munder and Yahel Shoham, and the pictures of all the returned hostages, embraced by their families, were a silver lining in dark days. But it was also a celebration day for Tarek Daoud, whose record at the age of 18 included a host of security offenses, for which he was arrested, convicted and detained in Israeli prison. Then the news received at his home in Qalqilya was that Daoud had been included in the lists of prisoners slated to be released as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. He was neither a prominent nor prolific terrorist, nor did he make the headlines in Israel. He was just another name added to the list of 39 terrorists—which this time included mostly female terrorists—to be set free. Shortly after his release, the security establishment received indications that Daoud had once again joined Hamas terrorists in the West Bank and returned to terrorist activity. The Shin Bet and the IDF attempted to arrest him several times, raided his home, and according to a Palestinian report, also arrested his brother in the hope to exert pressure on Daoud so he would turn himself in. This did not help. The released terrorist went underground and became wanted. On August 12, 2024, a 60-year-old Israeli man took his car to be serviced in the West Bank city of Qalqilya. A member of Daoud's terrorist group who was in the car repair shop at the time called Daoud, informing him that an Israeli was there. The armed Daoud rushed to the scene, recognized the Israeli and opened fire at him, seriously wounding the Israeli and injuring two Palestinians who were also in the vicinity. Daoud was pursued by IDF troops outside Qalqiliya as he attempted to flee the city and was ultimately eliminated by Col. Netanel Shamaka, commander of the Efraim Regional Brigade, who led the pursuit. Daoud was the first terrorist released in the first hostage deal to be eliminated, but certainly not the last: that same month, another freed terrorist, Wael Masha, was killed after trying to harm IDF troops. Shortly after, a third released terrorist, Jibril Jibril, was eliminated. All this happened just nine months after their release from Israeli prison. Terrorists like Daoud and his colleagues are the new-old 'headache' of the Israeli security establishment. Many of the terrorists released in previous deals have returned to engage in terrorism. How many exactly? The figure is disputed. Last June, Advocate Lt. Col. (res.) Maurice Hirsch, formerly director of the Military Prosecution in the West Bank, said that 55-60% of released terrorists return to terrorist activity. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar presented to Security Cabinet ministers even harsher data, stating that '82% of those released in the Gilad Shalit deal in 2011 returned to terrorism.' Lior Akerman, a former senior Shin Bet official, claims that the numbers are much lower, claiming that 'only 12% of released prisoners actually engage in planning and executing terror attacks. All the rest reflect the number of released prisoners who remain in contact with their terror groups and receive stipends or compensation or are active at the level of spreading messages and the like. Historically, there have been scarce cases of terrorist operatives returning to prominent activity, like Yahya Sinwar.' Either way, this is a significant addition to the number of terrorists, some of whom are experienced, whose time in prison enhanced their reputation and authority, who return to terrorism. Of the approximately 240 prisoners released in the first hostage deal in November-December 2023, 30 have already been rearrested, not including the three who were eliminated. With the conclusion of the first phase of the current deal, which saw the release of 33 Israeli captives in exchange for the release of 736 convicted terrorists or detainees. Besides them, 1,167 detained Gazans who did not participate in the October 7 massacre were also freed. According to a government decision, 47 Palestinians released in the current deal had already been released in the 2011 deal for the release of captive IDF soldier Gilad Shalit but returned to terrorism and were re-arrested. No one deludes themselves that any of them have become Zionists all of a sudden. 'The Palestinians are motivated by messianic ideology and persuasion,' says Shalom Ben Hanan, a former senior Shin Bet official. 'All those who return to terrorism believe that this is what needs to be done. They did not change their minds in prison. From their perspective, the State of Israel is still a glitch.' Israel's defense establishment is firmly supportive of hostage deals. but at the same time, there are debates about the way Israel should deal with freed prisoners. In recent weeks, we have spoken with former senior Mossad and Shin Bet officials, who have spent quite a few hours with released security prisoners, asking them the difficult questions: Where should the freed prisoners go? Will it be effective to deport them abroad? How can Israel keep a close eye on them? And what should Israel do if they return to terrorism? Arik Barbing, known as 'Harris,' is a former Shin Bet division head who previously led the Jerusalem and West Bank Region and served as head of the agency’s Cyber Division. 'Since my early days as a coordinator,' he said this week, 'I've dealt with the most dangerous and ruthless prisoners we've had.' The three terrorists from the previous deal were eliminated nine months after their release. Is that the time it takes them to return to terrorism? 'From our experience with the Gilad Shalit deal, it takes them about a year to get a clear picture of the situation. At first, if they are tasked with a mission, they will check that they are not being fooled by the Shin Bet. Secondly, as they are still reluctant to go back to prison, they will be more cautious. That's why they will not talk on the phone, and they will keep a low profile, trying to avoid falling into a trap. But since they have no other job in life, and in prison they only grow stronger and get to know each other better – recidivism will happen.' Should they be deported abroad or sent to the West Bank? At the time of the Gilad Shalit swap deal, Shalom Ben Hanan served as the head of the Hebron desk at the Shin Bet; he examined with his colleagues the 1,027 names that were to be exchanged for Shalit, including that of Yahya Sinwar. 'The released terrorists who are sent to the West Bank, return to their neighborhoods, welcomed by their families and embraced by members of the organization to which they belong. If they are Fatah prisoners, many of them will be directed to work, real or fictitious, within the Palestinian Authority (PA). In addition, they will be provided with subsidies for their studies and other rewards, especially if they are senior in their status.' How is seniority determined? 'Seniority depends on the length of imprisonment, the severity of the act committed and the prisoner's status at the organization before the imprisonment,' says Harris. How much money does such a prisoner receive? 'There are bonuses and there is a salary. Every released prisoner receives a grant according to the following formula: up to a five- to six-year stay in prison, 5,000-7,000 shekels ($1,400-$2,000). Senior prisoners who have spent about ten years in prison will receive a grant of 12,000 shekels ($3,400), consisting of PA funds and Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) funds. Those who are sentenced to life imprisonment or longer periods are liable to a grant of 20,000 shekels ($5,600), also from PA funds and organization funds. 'Then, as a salary, a prisoner released after serving a life sentence will receive up to 8,000 shekels ($2,200), a prisoner who served five to seven years, will get about 5,000 shekels ($1,400), but this salary may vary because released prisoners are at the risk of getting killed. That's a lot of money for someone who lives in the West Bank.' And what happens to a Hamas prisoner who returns to Gaza? 'Even in that case, they will receive some kind of reward from the PA because every prisoner is considered as someone who sacrificed something for the benefit of the Palestinian people, but they will receive full support by their organizations in Gaza. 'Generally, the PA does not finance Hamas' released prisoners. Hamas also pays regular stipends for the period the terrorists spent in Israeli prison, so compensation is being paid both for the prisoners and their families. Hamas prisoners receive stipends according to the length of imprisonment, but currently, these payments are not guaranteed due to the destruction in Gaza coupled with Hamas' financial woes. 'However, all prisoners will receive assistance, both because of the price they paid and because the prisoners' narrative is particularly sensitive in Palestinian society. From their perspective, these are freedom fighters who paid a heavy price and should be treated very carefully.' One of the serious dilemmas that the security establishment is debating is where to transport the released terrorists. There is a big difference between prisoners who are sent to the West Bank, those who are released to Gaza and those who are deported abroad. 'In the Shalit swap deal, Hamas governed in Gaza, so most lifers were sent there, even if they were originally from the West Bank,' explains Ben Hanan, currently a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) and a lecturer at the MA program at the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy at Reichman University, specializing in Hamas and terrorism. 'Hamas took them in and gave them houses, money, jobs. In the first years, we saw pictures of them living in beautiful houses, riding horses, spending time at the beach. Later on, as they wished to maintain their terrorist activity, Hamas established the 'West Bank headquarters,' a unit based in the Gaza Strip that is responsible for planning Hamas' terror attacks against Israel within the West Bank borders. 'Hamas took advantage of the connections their operatives built in Israeli prisons in order to better plan and execute terror attacks in terms of financing, purchasing weapons and instructions. 'The clan that kidnapped and murdered the three Israeli boys in June 2014, for example, received funding from the West Bank headquarters. The headquarters did not even know what the outline of the attack was; they only knew that they were giving money for terrorist activity.' This time, Israel will not repeat the same mistake, which involved deporting prisoners originally from the West Bank to Gaza. In the Gilad Shalit deal, Israel believed that deporting West Bank prisoners to Hamas-controlled Gaza would neutralize them. Hamas violently suppressed PA officials in Gaza. 'We thought that deporting them to the Gaza Strip would prevent them from engaging in terrorism,' says Harris, 'but this notion blew up in our face. 'The mastermind behind the terror attack in June 2014, who provided the funding for the kidnapping and murder of the three teens, was a Hebronite who was exiled to the Gaza Strip in the Gilad Shalit exchange in November 2011. 'He was deported to Gaza, where he later carried out a terror attack. Hamas leaders saw the deported prisoners as serious operatives, and they quickly aligned with Sinwar, [Mohammed] Deif and [Marwan] Issa, launching attacks in the West Bank. They recruited Palestinians in Nablus, Ramallah and Jenin to carry out further attacks. When we alerted, there was no approval, for all sorts of reasons, to hit them in the Gaza Strip, mainly out of fear that it would cause escalation.' What about the opposite scenario of deporting Gaza terrorists to the West Bank? 'Deporting Gazans to the West Bank is the worst and most dangerous scenario, which is something you wouldn't want to do,' says Harris. 'The PA isn't interested in that either. They are afraid that the arrival of these Gazans, who belong mainly to Hamas and PIJ sections, would lead to radicalization. These Gazans, from the PA's perspective, could threaten the stability of their regime.' 'In the 2011 Shalit deal, Saleh al-Arouri (former head of Hamas’ military wing in the West Bank who was eliminated in Beirut in the current war), as well as other terrorists, upgraded their status through the connections they have created both in the West Bank and in Hamas' external leadership in Qatar, Syria and Iraq. As time goes by, if we don't keep our eyes close on these terrorists, leading to their arrest in due course, we will face great challenges and real dangers.' According to Harris, this personal networking woven between terrorists while in Israeli prison, which they use after their release for terror purposes, is a game-changer. 'The terrorists improve their position in prison in terms of the information they gain and the inter-regional connections between the West Bank and Gaza that they make,' he adds. 'These connections do not flourish immediately, but they are exploring the area, and we, for our part, are keeping a close eye on them.' 'Naturally, the security establishment's ability to monitor each and every one of them constantly, to the extent of revealing their intentions and goals, such as whether they intend to recruit young people, or whether they are connecting with either explosives specialists or officials in Gaza or in foreign countries - is limited.' Despite these difficulties, all the senior officials we talked to agree that the surveillance of the released prisoners is critical. 'We use wiretaps, we have airplanes monitoring them all the time,' says Ilan Lotan, a former senior Shin Bet official. 'It's like playing 'cat and mouse'. Part of the reason they build an underground in Gaza is for fear of being monitored. 'We use also cyber, lookouts, all the available collection methods, but the experienced terrorists – and some of the freed terrorists within the swap deals are very experienced – know how to be careful and they still manage to carry out attacks.' 'One of the lessons we should learn, for example, is to acknowledge the fact that we cannot rely mainly on technology. We need to go back to old methods, such as HUMINT (human intelligence). The Shin Bet is adapting itself to the new reality in the Gaza Strip.' 'The role of the Shin Bet and the IDF,' emphasizes Harris, 'is to bring information about every single terrorist, certainly about those who were in Israeli prison and are swapped in deals, and to monitor their actions, i.e., who do they call, what do they do? All of this is feasible.' 'In The West Bank, for example, Israel has intelligence and operational superiority, even if not hermetic. We know well everyone who is released. In addition, we need to make sure that they don't create connections, say between Hebron and Jenin or between Nablus and Ramallah, based on the connection with their inmates.' Luxurious hotels in Qatar Another alternative, which has been tried in the past, is to deport the released prisoners abroad. In the current hostage deal, the Israeli government decided that security prisoners set to be released, convicted of murder or manufacturing weapons that were used for killing, or convicted of sending terrorists to carry out an attack which involved casualties, will be released on the condition that they are transferred to Gaza or abroad and do not return to Israel or the West Bank territories for three years or permanently. If they wish to return, the released terrorists should refrain from engaging in terrorism for three years, and even then, they should get the approval of the Shin Bet and Israeli cabinet. The assessment is that in the current deal, most hardened terror convicts will be deported to foreign countries, probably Turkey and Qatar. However, opinions within the security establishment are divided about the effectiveness of deportation abroad. On the one hand, distance makes it difficult to engage in terrorism from afar. On the other hand, if they return to terrorism, hitting them on foreign soil is much more complex than in the West Bank or even in Gaza. Harris, who currently engages in intelligence consulting, believes that exile is effective, at least for some of them. 'If you exile them to Turkey or Qatar - geographical distance matters,' he says. 'The further away you are, the easier it is for us to identify the connection to terrorism and deal with it.' 'Obviously, you can go to Ramallah every evening to arrest the same person. But as far as knowledge experts and senior leaders are concerned, I prefer them to be far away. The more distant you are, while having digital access, the more advantage we have, which we know how to exploit. This is the work of the Shin Bet, Mossad and Military Intelligence.' If you identify an axis, a connection between a terrorist in a distant country and the West Bank, Israel and its allies have the upper hand, capable to deter and hit them, which may lead to deterrence. But in recent years, this has hardly happened, therefore Israel's deterrence capacity has decreased.' Oded Eilam, former head of the Terrorism Division of the Mossad, holds the view that it would be preferable that most dangerous terrorists be nearby. 'I think it's a mistake to exile terrorists,' he says. 'We know the story of Saleh al-Arouri who established a complete array of terror operatives from abroad, and the same goes for Khaled Mashal, Qatar-based Hamas leader. Our capability to deal with terrorists abroad does exist, but it is immeasurably lower than our ability in Gaza and in the West Bank.' Can terrorists from abroad return to Gaza or the West Bank without Israel's permission? 'These terrorists abroad become targets,' says Ben Hanan. 'They can't return to the West Bank through the Allenby Bridge crossing, nor can they pass through Ben-Gurion Airport. But there have been cases in the past of terrorists who smuggled themselves into the area.' So, what can be done? 'It requires a close cooperation with the Mossad. There was such cooperation in the past, and there will be again in the future. Israel has the intelligence capabilities to monitor whoever it wants.' 'They are not deported to countries that are friendly to us, such as the U.S. or Europe, but rather to countries who welcome and embrace them,' says Amnon Sofrin, former senior Mossad official. 'Because no one else wants to have them.' 'In Turkey, for example, there is an official representative of Hamas, who was released in the Shalit deal, and was also the driver of the car of the Hamas cell that kidnapped the late Israeli soldier, Nachshon Waxman.' 'The officials in the foreign coutnries take care of their housing, their salaries. Saleh al-Arouri lived in Turkey first. There is an existing, active infrastructure there, which knows how to recruit people, provide them with everything they need, and knows how to orchestrate terror attacks in Israel and abroad. Once the terrorists are under the auspices of another country, it is impossible to touch them.' What can be done if a prisoner deported abroad returns to terrorism? 'In terms of terrorists abroad, you should choose who to focus on. Not all senior released terrorists have the same capability, and not all of them are equally dangerous. Since we know who they are, we can tell who the most dangerous ones are; so, we start monitoring them, using all the available means, to build their profiles: who they meet, who their circle of people are, and what they are planning. Then you can foil their plans.' 'These terrorists have become cautious, so you have to use all your abilities to understand what kind of terror acts they can carry out. You must be very careful, because you are operating on foreign soil, and as an institution, you are the main suspect. We are constantly learning and improving our methods and capabilities, adapting them to the new reality.' Akerman, now Head of National Resilience Desk in the Institute for Policy and Strategy at the Reichman University, also prefers that the freed prisoners be nearby. 'As a general rule,' he says, 'the Shin Bet prefers to keep the released prisoners near, to monitor them better. However, the political echelon preferred to exile some of them for political reasons.' 'The Shin Bet is capable and designed to gather intelligence and monitor all the released prisoners. None of them disappear from our sight. There are intelligence capabilities to identify abnormal security behavior or a return to terrorism of any released prisoner.' 'In Turkey, for example, it's tricky. In the past, terrorists were restricted or expelled due to interests vis-à-vis the Turkish government,' says Ben Hanan. 'Of course, today the situation is different, and it is likely that these guys will return to terrorism. No one could really complain that Erdogan doesn't supervise Hamas terrorists enough.' 'It is neither realistic to complain to Qatar, Hamas' supporter. Look, they told Qatar to expel Hamas. Have you heard of that? Certainly not. They will continue to live there in luxurious hotels. I assume that the headquarters will embrace the released prisoners, provide them with money, budgets, titles, and in the end, they will return to terrorism.' But there was at least one case where exile abroad did work. In April 2002, during Operation Defensive Shield, about 50 terrorists were hiding in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, holding hostages. Since it is one of Christianity's most sacred sites, the attack made the headlines abroad. Israel preferred to negotiate with the terrorists over a military operation. After 39 days, an agreement has been achieved, according to which a small number of terrorists were exiled to Gaza, most of them to Cyprus, from where they went on to exile in Ireland and Spain.' 'They were cut out from terrorism as a result of the strict monitoring in the countries who took them in,' says Ben Hanan. 'These West European countries took them in under strict conditions because even if they sympathized with the Palestinian cause, they were not keen to have terrorists raising money and carrying out terror attacks on their soil. Neither did they want the Mossad to eliminate terrorists in their countries. These terrorists were like prisoners on license.' Why not try it now? 'It worked in the case of Church of the Nativity terrorists because most of them were Fatah members, and a few were Hamas members; so, when they were sent to European countries, they integrated, and almost all of them refrained from recidivism,' says Harris. 'They realized that life could be better, and they got along. But now, most of the released terrorists belong to Hamas and Jihad, and less to Fatah. Moreover, it happened more than 20 years ago. Today, European countries will no longer want to take in such people.' Initiative instead of reaction Of course, there is no way knowing in advance how many of the prisoners released in the current deal will ultimately return to terrorism. 'It's a 'Russian Roulette,' maybe the released terrorists will murder, maybe not,' says former MK Adv. Zvi Hauser, who served during the Gilad Shalit deal as Cabinet Secretary and Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman, as well as chairman of the Subcommittee on Intelligence. 'These are all estimates.' Hauser objected to the Gilad Shalit deal. 'The fact is that there are people who paid with their lives because of the Shalit deal, which means that Israel could not prevent murder attacks. Our intelligence capabilities are good but not hermetic. We may have prevented more killings, but not all of them.' Even if we accept the low estimates that only 12% of the released prisoners in the current deal will return to terrorism, we are still talking about many dozens of terrorists. In such a case, the security establishment has a variety of options to deal with them, which are also subject to the location of the terrorists. None of the options, as Hauser claims, are hermetic. If terrorists that are sent to the West Bank or Gaza do something wrong, they will first get a warning call from a Shin Bet official, like 'We know that you met with this and that and did this and that, be careful, you are a released prisoner.' But it doesn’t always help. 'I sent coordinators to released prisoners and summoned them for warning calls,' says Harris. 'It has the same effect as receiving a reprimand from a schoolteacher.' For terrorists who have been deported abroad, says former Mossad official Eilam, these warnings are less relevant. 'Abroad, I don’t want them to think that they are being monitored. I don't want them to be alert, to switch places or use obfuscation techniques. It's not our interest to say, ‘you are my target,' because that will make them be precautious.' If the released prisoners reiterate their terrorist activity, we will act according to their whereabouts. If they are in the West Bank, they may be declared wanted, and the security forces will want to arrest them. As mentioned, about 30 of the prisoners that were released in the first deal have already been rearrested. If they are abroad, it's a bit more complicated. In a friendly country, you can ask the authorities to act. Obviously, this is not really an option that currently exists in Qatar or Turkey. The more extreme option is, of course, a targeted assassination of the released terrorists, which is also very complex, even if the terrorists are in the West Bank or in Gaza. 'After the Shalit deal, there were a few targeted assassinations in the Gaza Strip. It is at Israel's discretion, says Ben Hanan. Is it a political decision? 'It's never solely political. It's a decision taken by the entire system. The security establishment doesn't go to government meetings, saying, 'Let's eliminate terrorists.' Until October 7, the entire system was stuck in a notion that in the name of maintaining quiet, they don't want to eliminate someone from the West Bank headquarters, for example.' 'I felt that these terrorists were 'immune,' to the extent that we couldn't get even with them. Now, everyone says that things will change, but I'm skeptical. I assume that West Bank operatives who remained alive will return to their pre-October 7 engagements.' Lotan believes that the political system was the factor that stopped the targeted assassinations. 'Over the years,' he says, 'there were terror attacks in the West Bank on the instruction of Gaza leaders, and there were quite a few recommendations to strike them with a preemptive blow, recommendations that were not approved by Israel's political echelon. Before October 7, for example, the Shin Bet recommended initiating action against Hamas in Gaza. Why didn't it happen? Ask the politicians.' What can be done now? 'Initiating actions, rather than reacting. Secondly, we should attack their military capabilities instead of looking for targets. If you identify military capabilities at your enemy, like machinery for making mortar bombs, you should hit it immediately. Don't wait to see if they intend to shoot or not. We have to change our perception.' 'The Shin Bet mainly knows how to arrest the terrorists,' says Harris. 'In exceptional cases, when they face a ticking bomb terrorist in the West Bank, they receive a special approval to kill him. The problem is with the system. If a freed prisoner has now returned home and is searching on the Internet 'how to make explosives,' I want to be able to reach him, legally, from the moment I identify his terror intention or thoughts.' And this is not what's happening? 'In the past, after they were released, the security system would treat them as if their past activity had been cleared, and that was wrong. If I'm releasing prisoners ahead of time within an exchange deal and they commit the tiniest felony, I want to have a legal platform that will allow me to arrest them, track them, etc.; it should be a faster platform than with another resident of the West Bank who was not released in a deal.' 'This platform did not exist in the Shalit deal. The released prisoners returned to terrorism, and each time, we had to start over. But these are not new terrorists; they were released in a deal, they were spared seven years of prison, and I want us to treat them as released terrorists. We need to have sharper and faster mechanisms, and closer security coordination in dealing with and that we and the PA have in common.' The targeted killing of released prisoners on foreign soil is much more complicated. Taking action abroad is a long and complex process, which requires a lot of resources and has political implications,' says Ilam. 'Why haven't we eliminated the terrorists in Qatar to this day? Why do senior Hamas officials such as Khaled Mashal and Abu Marzouk still sit a kilometer from the airport in Qatar? Both because of Qatar and because of the Americans. Even after the war, we didn't touch their top leaders in Qatar. We didn't eliminate them in Turkey. As evidence, Haniyeh was sitting unharmed in Turkey until he moved to Iran and was eliminated in Tehran in July 2024 by Israel.' Maybe because it's much harder to do it in such countries. 'Israel and the Mossad know how to reach their targets. It's not always possible in terms of operational or intelligence capabilities, and sometimes there are political considerations involved. But still, Mossad knows how to reach them.' 'Unfortunately,' says Harris, ' most of those who were deported abroad and transported to countries around the world were not eliminated. Saleh al-Arouri, former head of Hamas’s military wing in the West Bank, who for a long time established terror infrastructures, was not killed until the Iron Swords war.' 'I think they should be deported to as many countries as possible. Distance creates varied intelligence opportunities. Sometimes, it is easier to hit and eliminate in distant places than in close ones. The sense of security abroad is higher for them, and sometimes the ability to hit them abroad is more accessible.' Eilam hopes that this has changed now with the newly released prisoners and the ones who will follow. 'It is important to understand that Israel has changed in terms of its willingness to use force,' he says. 'We have a completely different security perception since October 7. Israel, to a certain extent, has taken off the gloves. And we see it now in Tulkarm and Jenin, and of course in Gaza and Lebanon.' 'The era of Israel calling the U.S. begging it to convince Hezbollah to move the tent is over. In Gaza or in the West Bank, too, in my opinion, there is no more 'knock on the roof' procedure (a warning of imminent bombing attacks to give the inhabitants time to flee the attack). It's over. Terrorists who have been released in the deal should know that they will be eliminated if they return to terrorism. And that their death will occur on the ground, not through a court judgment.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rkmff9gqke	2025-03-03T13:06:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/rJlyvvNL00Jl/rJlyvvNL00Jl_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg
White House seeks plan for possible Russia sanctions relief, sour...	The United States is drawing up a plan to potentially give Russia sanctions relief as President Donald Trump seeks to restore ties with Moscow and stop the war in Ukraine, a U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The White House has asked the State and Treasury departments to draft a list of sanctions that could be eased for U.S. officials to discuss with Russian representatives in the coming days as part of the administration's broad talks with Moscow on improving diplomatic and economic relations, the sources said. The sanctions offices are now drawing up a proposal for lifting sanctions on select entities and individuals, including some Russian oligarchs, according to the sources. So-called options papers are often drafted by officials working on sanctions, but the White House's specific request for one in recent days underscores Trump and his advisers' willingness to ease Russian sanctions as part of a potential deal with Moscow. It was not immediately clear what Washington could specifically seek in return for any sanctions relief.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sklrbj7ijx	2025-03-03T12:40:49-08:00	
Top IDF operations officer resigns amid high command reshuffle	Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk's departure comes amid intense scrutiny over military's failures on Oct. 7, being among several top generals who dismissed warning signs night before deadly attack Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk, head of the IDF's Operations Directorate, announced Monday evening that he intends to retire from the military. Basiuk, the third-highest-ranking officer in the IDF hierarchy, had been expected to step down, as his resignation comes just two days before the transition of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who is also leaving his post, to his successor, Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir. Basiuk informed Zamir of his decision during a meeting, during which the incoming chief of staff accepted his request but asked him to remain in his position for the coming months due to 'operational challenges,' according to an IDF statement. Zamir’s request reflects both an acknowledgment of Basiuk’s experience and trust in his leadership, raising the likelihood that he will complete four full years in the role before stepping down in early summer. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The tenure of the head of the Operations Directorate typically does not exceed two to three years, making Basiuk’s extended service nearly twice the norm. His departure follows a pattern seen in other resignations from the IDF in the wake of the failures of the October 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack, which occurred toward the later stages of the war and close to the expected end of their terms, such as that of Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld, the former commander of the Gaza Division. A military investigation into the performance of the Operations Division under Basiuk’s command did not find negligence or major failures in relation to the scale and development of the Oct. 7 attack. However, there had been expectations that he would assume responsibility as the head of the directorate overseeing the IDF’s operational activities. Over his decades-long military career, he held multiple positions in the Armored Corps before serving as head of the Strategic Planning Division in the IDF’s Planning Directorate. According to military investigations released last week, Basiuk was one of three members of the General Staff Forum who participated in overnight consultations ahead of the Hamas-led assault. He was joined by Halevi and Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman. On the night before the attack, Israeli intelligence detected five 'warning signs' suggesting that Hamas might be preparing for an assault. These included the near-simultaneous activation of dozens of Israeli SIM cards in Gaza, suspicious movements within the group's rocket infrastructure and other unspecified indicators. However, intelligence officials reportedly rationalized away each of these signals, noting that similar patterns had occurred in the weeks, months and years leading up to the war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymuscqijg	2025-03-03T12:29:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/SygM5FIG91l/SygM5FIG91l_1_584_2311_1302_0_small.jpg

Trump says Canada, Mexico tariffs to take effect on Tuesday; stoc...	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that there was no chance for Mexico or Canada to prevent 25% tariffs from taking effect on Tuesday, sending financial markets reeling on the prospect of new economic barriers in North America. 'They're going to have to have a tariff. So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,' Trump said at the White House. He said there was 'no room left' for a deal that would avert the tariffs by curbing fentanyl flows into the United States. U.S. stock indexes extended their losses after Trump's comments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.58% for the day, the S&P 500 was down 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.47%. Trump also said reciprocal tariffs would take effect on April 2 on countries that impose duties on U.S. products. The tariffs are scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) on Tuesday. At that point, Canada and Mexico would face tariffs of 25%, with 10% for Canadian energy. Mexican officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rycbtqxjjx	2025-03-03T12:21:38-08:00	
Katz: 'Israel won't allow Egypt to breach peace agreement'	Defense minister calls peace treaty with Cairo 'historic' decision that changed Israel’s reality and ended Egypt’s role in cycle of war; warns 'gates of hell will open' and Gaza fighting will resume if Hamas fails to release hostages soon Defense Minister Israel Katz reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to its peace treaty with Egypt, warning Monday that Israel 'will not allow violations of the agreement or disruptions to infrastructure.' He emphasized that Israel is actively addressing any concerns but stressed that the treaty remains intact. Calling Egypt 'the largest and strongest Arab country,' Katz highlighted that the agreement removed Egypt from the cycle of war, describing it as 'a historic leadership decision that changed Israel’s reality and continues to do so today.' Katz’s remarks follow reports that Cairo is amassing forces in northern Sinai, potentially violating the 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yechiel Leiter called it a 'very serious violation,' saying Jerusalem will formally address the issue. However, military officials later downplayed concerns, saying Egypt does not pose an imminent threat to Israel. Katz also issued a warning to Hamas, echoing recent remarks by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'If Hamas does not release the hostages soon, the gates of Gaza will close, and the gates of hell will open,' he said. 'We will resume fighting, and Hamas will face the IDF with an intensity and in ways they have never seen before.' Egypt to present Gaza plan at Arab League summit As the Arab League summit convenes Tuesday, Egypt is expected to present its vision for Gaza’s future, according to a Reuters report outlining key elements of the plan. The proposal reportedly excludes Hamas from any governing role and focuses on establishing a civilian administrative committee to oversee humanitarian aid and reconstruction. The Egyptian plan states that 'significant international funding for Gaza’s reconstruction will not be provided if Hamas remains the dominant political and armed force.' Instead, a multinational stabilization force, primarily made up of Arab nations, would take over security control in Gaza and establish a new local police force. However, the proposal does not specify how Hamas would be removed if it refuses to cede control. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri has rejected the proposal, saying, 'Hamas opposes any attempt to impose projects, any form of non-Palestinian governance or the presence of foreign forces on Gaza’s land.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Notably, the Palestinian Authority is not included in the Egyptian plan. Instead, governance and security would be overseen by a steering committee comprising key Arab nations, members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the U.S., the UK, the European Union and other actors. The plan also does not specify who would finance Gaza’s reconstruction, which the United Nations estimates will cost more than $53 billion. According to Reuters, sources suggest Gulf states and Arab nations would need to commit at least $20 billion for the initial phase of rebuilding. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybmvyqi1g	2025-03-03T12:18:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/Bk700tj2QPJe/Bk700tj2QPJe_0_221_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Ex-hostage Amit Soussana: 'I fought off many men'	After receiving a special award for sharing her sexual assault experience, captivity survivor says she understands the strength and determination needed to fight this battle Amit Soussana, a survivor of Hamas captivity who bravely shared her experience of sexual assault during her ordeal, was honored with a special award from the Michal Sela Forum for her groundbreaking efforts in the fight against sexual violence. Soussana, 40, a lawyer at Luzzatto & Luzzatto, was kidnapped on October 7 and released after 55 days of captivity in Gaza. Upon receiving the award, Soussana said, 'I chose to speak about the trauma I endured. I wanted justice for the women and men who have been hurt, justice for our country and justice for myself. I couldn’t bear the denial.' 'After sharing my story, many women reached out to me, sharing their own experiences. We, women, are the stronger sex—we just need a more balanced playing field. This is the strength of this forum, which seeks solutions to prevent violence. I fought off many men; I know how much determination and willpower are required in this battle. My struggle may have been lost from the start, but that's not the case for this forum. I thank you for your valuable work.' In her harrowing testimony, which was published after her release in a hostage-prisoner swap with Hamas in November, Soussana described how, days after being abducted from her home in Kfar Aza, one of her captors—an armed Hamas terrorist named Mohammed—began asking her about her sex life. She was held alone in a children's room, which she recalled was covered in posters of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants, chained at her ankle. According to her, her captor would sleep in an adjacent room, often entering while only wearing underwear, sometimes sitting on her bed, lifting her shirt and touching her. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Soussana recounted how he repeatedly asked when her menstrual cycle was due. When her period ended around October 18, she tried to avoid being assaulted by pretending her period was still ongoing, even for an entire week. The severe sexual assault occurred several days later, around October 24, when her captor freed her from her chains and insisted that she take a shower. After resisting, he took her to the kitchen, showing her a pot of boiling water on the stove, before leading her to the bathroom, where he forced her to pour the hot water on herself. After washing for several minutes, she heard him calling her from the door, demanding she hurry. As she turned around, she saw him standing there with a weapon. She tried to cover herself with a towel, but he struck her. 'Amit, Amit, take it off,' he demanded, and she was forced to comply, with the weapon in his hand. 'He pushed me onto the edge of the bathtub. I closed my legs and resisted. He continued hitting me, placing his weapon in my face, then dragged me to the bedroom,' she recalled. After the assault, he took a shower, leaving her naked in the dark. When he returned, she said he showed remorse, saying, 'I’m bad, I’m bad. Please don’t tell Israel.' She explained that after the assault, she feared being attacked again at any moment. 'You can’t look at him, but you must. He’s the one guarding you, you’re with him—and you know it could happen again at any moment. You’re completely dependent on him.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvziomjke	2025-03-03T11:33:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/Syj11qcDmi1e/Syj11qcDmi1e_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu warns Hamas of ‘unimaginable consequences’ if hostages ...	PM vows to continue war until Hamas dismantled and all hostages returned, accuses opposition of echoing Hamas rhetoric, defends hostage negotiations and credits Trump for supporting voluntary migration from Gaza Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Monday that Israel will not stop its military campaign in Gaza until Hamas is completely dismantled and all hostages are returned, warning the terror group of 'consequences they cannot imagine' if captives are not released. 'We are preparing for the next stages of the war—on seven fronts,' Netanyahu said during a parliamentary debate, adding, 'We will not stop until we achieve total victory—returning all our hostages, destroying Hamas’ military and governing power and ensuring Gaza is no longer a threat to Israel.' Netanyahu also addressed ongoing hostage negotiations and the proposal by U.S. mediator Steve Witkoff, saying Israel was not violating any agreements but remained prepared to resume fighting if necessary.

Don't want to live in an Islamic state': Syrian Druze plead for ...	Druze resident of Jaramana, near Damascus, says community 'wants Israel to intervene before it’s too late,' describing dire conditions, with no water or electricity, while locals stay up at nights to protect their families Amid ongoing clashes between armed Druze militias and Syrian government forces in the city of Jaramana, near Damascus, a local Druze resident described the situation as 'extremely difficult' and urged Israel to intervene 'as soon as possible.' The plea follows warnings from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz against Syria’s new Islamist regime, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, saying Israel will not tolerate any harm to the Druze population. According to the resident, the unrest stemmed from 'isolated incidents' that escalated citywide. He welcomed Israel’s warnings to the Syrian government, saying, 'We don’t want to live in an Islamic state, and the situation here doesn’t allow us to.' He described dire conditions, with residents lacking water and electricity, relying on bottled drinking water, and staying up at night to protect their families. Jaramana’s Druze community is particularly vulnerable. Unlike Druze populations in southern Syria, which are more independent and better armed, those in Jaramana—living in a mixed Druze-Christian area near Damascus—have limited means of self-defense. Following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, Israel warned of a possible power struggle in the region, placing it under close observation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The resident claimed that Syria’s new leadership provides financial aid only to Sunni Muslim communities, leaving Druze residents without support. 'We want Israel to intervene before it’s too late,' he said, stressing the desire for peace. Regarding Syria’s broader instability, he added, 'As long as the country remains unstable, unrest will continue. The situation could worsen. If a decisive resolution is not reached for the Syrian people and the southern region, disorder will persist.' However, not all Druze in Jaramana share this view. Rabea Manzar, a local resident, told Al-Jazeera, 'We are Arab-Syrians, we are connected to our land, and we didn’t ask for protection from anyone. The Syrian government will respond to Netanyahu’s threats.' After days of tension, cautious calm has returned to Jaramana, with security forces loyal to the new regime deploying in the city.

Known for his academic expertise and diplomatic impact, the former Israeli UN ambassador played a key role in shaping Israel’s foreign policy and global relations for decades Dore Gold—a former Foreign Ministry director-general, political advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's ambassador to the United Nations—passed away on Monday at the age of 71. Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Gold received his primary education at Hartford Yeshiva and later attended the prestigious Mount Hermon private high school in northern Massachusetts. He pursued his academic studies at Columbia University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in Islamic Studies in 1975. He obtained a master’s degree in Political Science a year later and completed his Ph.D. in 1984. Gold studied classical Arabic, and his doctoral dissertation, which focused on Saudi Arabia, served as the basis for his book Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism. The book, which appeared on The New York Times bestseller list, argued that Saudi Arabia actively funds terrorist organizations and supports the enemies of the United States. Gold immigrated to Israel in 1980 and served in the IDF. After his discharge in 1983, he embarked on an academic career, serving as a senior research fellow at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. Later, he served as head of the project on U.S. Foreign and Security Policy at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, under the direction of Maj. Gen. (res.) Aharon Yariv. In 1991, Gold served as one of the advisors to the Israeli delegation at the Madrid Peace Conference and the subsequent Washington talks. During this period, he became close to Benjamin Netanyahu and served as his political advisor, a role he continued to fulfill when Netanyahu was elected prime minister. Gold played a key role in establishing ties between the Likud Party leadership and Jordan’s Hashemite Kingdom as a counterbalance to the strategic connections established between the Labor Party-led government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), headed by Yasser Arafat. Gold accompanied Netanyahu in his meetings with Jordanian leaders between 1994 and 1995 in London, Amman and Aqaba. In his role as Netanyahu’s political advisor following his 1996 election victory, Gold conducted negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and other Arab actors. Among his notable contributions was his involvement in drafting the Hebron Agreement's annexes, which focused on mutual obligations between Israel and the Palestinians. French journalist Charles Enderlin noted that Gold extracted a commitment from then-U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher ensuring that the 'deposit' promised by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin regarding the future of the Golan Heights would not bind the State of Israel. This effort also secured a new American commitment from the Clinton administration to the 1975 letter from President Gerald Ford, which declared that the United States would give significant weight to Israel’s retention of the Golan Heights. From 1997 to 1999, Gold served as Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations. In 1998, he was part of the Israeli delegation to the Wye River Memorandum, which involved Israel, the Palestinian Authority and then-U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Between 2001 and 2003, he served as an advisor to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and was particularly involved in the Aqaba Summit, which included then-U.S. President George W. Bush. During this period, Gold frequently appeared in American media as a spokesperson for Sharon’s government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eulogized him: 'My wife Sara and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Dore Gold—a prolific academic researcher, a brilliant Israeli diplomat and a close personal friend. For over three decades, Dore accompanied me as a dedicated public servant of unparalleled caliber. Dore, with his exceptional talents, served as a political advisor, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, and director-general of the Foreign Ministry. He possessed unique intellectual integrity, a remarkable ability to get things done and a deep love for the State of Israel. 'Added to this were his passionate Zionist vision and sharp analytical skills, which bore fruit for Israel in the international arena. One clear example, among many, is his contribution to achieving the Abraham Accords with Arab states. His insightful books clearly present the just path of the State of Israel. Dore will be missed by our country, and he will be personally missed by me and my wife. Sara and I extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Orit, and his family.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkaa8f7iyg	2025-03-03T09:27:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/10/28/9562694/9562694_1_111_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Police detain driver who plowed at high speed into a group of people but have not confirmed a motive; authorities urge the public to avoid the area amid ongoing investigations A car drove into a crowd of people in the western German city of Mannheim on Monday, killing at least one person, injuring several others, and overshadowing carnival celebrations in the region where police had been on alert for security attacks. The car's driver was detained, a police spokesperson said, adding that it was unclear whether there were other suspects. Police have appealed to the public to stay away from the city center. People were seen lying on the ground at the scene and at least two were being resuscitated, an eyewitness told Reuters. Bild newspaper reported that two people were killed and 25 injured, citing security sources. It was unclear whether the driver acted deliberately or if there was any connection to Germany's carnival celebrations, which culminated on Rose Monday with a number of parades, although not in Mannheim, which held its main event on Sunday. A black car drove at high speed into a group of people, travelling from the centrally located Paradeplatz square towards the city's landmark water tower, the Mannheim24 news website reported.

‘They talk to his picture’: Hostages' children struggle with fath...	Nearly 18 months after their fathers were kidnapped by Hamas, children face ongoing uncertainty, emotional distress; experts say children are indirect terror victims, denied fundamental rights under international law Nearly a year and a half after their fathers were kidnapped by Hamas, the hostages' children are still living in uncertainty, not knowing when or if they will see them again. For these families, every day is a battle to hold on to hope, even as time passes and answers remain out of reach. Among those waiting is four-year-old Re'em David. His father, Elkana Bohbot, was taken captive on October 7. His mother, Rivka, describes the daily struggle to keep him hopeful. 'What does it mean to live without a father? It means telling my son every day that Daddy will come back, so he doesn’t lose hope,' she said. 'It means explaining that people are looking for him, listening when he cries that he misses him. When he sees a plane in the sky, he asks, ‘Bring my daddy back.’ He’s afraid to be left alone, afraid that I will ‘go to Gaza’ too. He feels his father’s absence in everything.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite his young age, Re'em holds onto his father’s memory. 'He says, ‘I love summer like Daddy. I like warm water like Daddy.’ He even saves up money for him, convinced that someone must have stolen his father’s wallet. On Family Day at kindergarten, he drew us—Elkana in bright colors, and the rest of us in black and white, because he knows we are sad.' But Rivka refuses to let go of hope. 'I know Elkana is holding on. He knows he has a wife fighting for him, a son waiting for him. He will be shocked to see how much his child has grown. No one will take my hope away.' Lishay Miran-Lavi faces a similar struggle with her daughters, Roni and Alma. Their father, Omri Miran, was kidnapped before their eyes. 'I do everything I can to make sure my daughters live with joy, despite the pain,' she said. 'But the reality is that Roni and Alma were also hostages. They saw their father taken from them, and it left deep scars. Roni is three and a half, and she constantly talks about her father. She remembers every detail of that day, who was there, why they came.' 'Alma never even got to know him. She was only six months old when she lost the basic right to grow up with her father. And in a way, they are still stuck in that day,' Lishay said. 'But I tell myself, and I know—Omri will come back, on his own two feet. There is no other option. We must bring him home. He has two daughters waiting for him. We must bring them all home.' Children's rights are being violated Legal experts argue that beyond the emotional toll, these children’s rights are being systematically violated under international law. A new legal document submitted by Prof. Dana Pugach and attorney Sheli Aviv-Yani highlights how the hostage crisis has deprived these children of their fundamental protections. 'The impact on these children is not just emotional—it represents a continuous breach of their basic rights,' the document states, citing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international treaties. It asserts that Israel has a legal obligation to recognize these children’s rights and prioritize them in efforts to secure the hostages’ release. 'This is not just a matter of sympathy or compassion,' said Prof. Pugach. 'It is a concrete legal duty of the state to protect these children, who have become indirect victims of terrorism. The rights of these children must be at the forefront of negotiations.' Pugach noted that hostages are often categorized into different groups—women, the elderly, the sick, and others—but the fathers of young children have not received enough attention. 'After nearly a year and a half in captivity, none of the hostages are in good health. But certain groups require special focus, such as fathers with young children,' she said. 'There must be a clear message—any deal to bring them home must also consider the rights of their families, especially their children.' While international law strongly protects children’s rights, Pugach said, the responsibility to uphold them does not lie with Hamas, but with Israel and the global community. 'My expectation is not that Hamas will suddenly recognize children’s rights,' she said. 'It is that Israel will uphold its obligation to these children, and that the international community will acknowledge the need to protect their interests. These legal efforts are also a way for families to reclaim some control over a situation that has left them feeling powerless.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbyai7jyl	2025-03-03T08:57:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/yk14279908/yk14279908_0_140_676_381_0_small.jpg

Lone guard, breached fence, abandoned posts: IDF probe reveals Na...	On October 7, just one soldier guarded Nahal Oz base, a stone's throw from Gaza, as forces were thin, tank crews off standby and machine guns locked away; seized Hamas manual shows terror group knew base's security gaps, aiding 250 terrorists in its takeover An IDF investigation report released Monday exposed a chain of systematic failures in military norms in the Nahal Oz base, which Hamas was able to exploit to deliver a well-coordinated blow on October 7. The large military base, located a few hundred yards from the Gaza border, was not drilled for an attack; tank crews were told not to be on standby for their tanks; defense positions facing Shijaiyah were empty, and only one soldier, a sentry, was guarding the entire base—these are some of the disastrous initial conditions that contributed to the rapid collapse of the base. Intelligence gathered from the Gaza Strip during the war revealed a Hamas attack manual for the Nahal Oz base. According to senior IDF officials, it wouldn’t be out of place in an elite unit’s operation file, detailing all the base's weaknesses and characteristics: the gaps in the fence through which 60 Nukhba terrorists infiltrated during the first wave, ultimately taking the base within half an hour; the holes in the western wall, which were used as firing slits for gunmen to shoot crossfire at the soldiers inside; a reckless IDF procedure that approved reducing combat forces by about half on weekends so soldiers could enjoy time off at home; precise locations of every room, command center, office, and building within the camp; daily life routines; the number of weapons; the exact location of the bomb shelters, and more. Hamas knew it would be relatively easy to infiltrate the base. Its perimeter watch towers were not only empty and lacking machine guns (which were locked in storage), but the base also lacked significant trenches and obstacles. The investigation reveals that no military routine was maintained at the base, which housed several units, each in a different corner: no formations, no ceremonies, no daily briefings, and no posts. According to various testimonies, Hamas even built a model of Nahal Oz in Gaza to train for its conquest, understanding that if they took it and the other four battalion and brigade bases in the area, the way to murder and kidnap in southern Israeli towns would be quick and easy, as it turned out to be. The result was the loss of 53 soldiers at the Nahal Oz base: 22 combat support soldiers, including 16 lookouts, 31 fighters, including 19 from the Golani Brigade, and 10 who were kidnapped to Gaza. Every second was filmed, every angle documented The investigation, conducted over ten months by a team led by Colonel A., the commander of the IDF’s 551 Paratroopers Reserve Brigade, uncovered strange contradictions in the after-action reports of the units that operated at the base that Saturday. To uncover the truth, he organized all the data, communications, and hours of recorded footage. Colonel A.'s life was relatively easy, despite the differing testimonies of the survivors. He had almost every moment at the base captured on video. He received footage from Hamas terrorists’ GoPro cameras, drones used by the terrorist organization, armored vehicle cameras, and security cameras. One of the videos lasted an hour and 50 minutes, from when the attacker turned on the camera at 6:00 a.m. as he aimed his weapon in the Shijaiyah neighborhood until the attack ended and he returned to Gaza, along with about half of the Nukhba terrorists who had infiltrated the base. The IDF said the investigation was harder for Colonel A. than any of the battles or experiences he went through in his 20 years of service with the IDF's Shayetet 13 naval commando unit, even harder than the moments when he lost 20 of his soldiers during the war. Unlike other investigators, and against a backdrop of poor command climate, Colonel A. recommended personal measures, possibly even dismissals, against the senior officers responsible for the Nahal Oz debacle. His recommendations have not yet been accepted due to outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi's decision to leave the decisions to his successor, Major General Itzik Tzukrel. Even the commander of the northern brigade on October 7, Colonel Haim Cohen, who was responsible for the faulty operational management of the base before the war, remained in his position until recently, when he announced he would step down. 'The story of the fall of Nahal Oz could easily be linked to the long-standing failures that strengthened Hamas, the intelligence failure to provide warning, and the large-scale attack that included dozens of combat points,' said an IDF source. 'But in reality, the events there revealed something else: a shift in operational culture in recent years.' Hamas' goal: Capture in 15 minutes On the morning of October 7, there were 162 soldiers at the Nahal Oz base—about half the usual number on weekdays—according to a policy implemented by the IDF General Staff five years ago to accommodate soldiers’ preferences, based on the assumption that terrorists would only strike on weekdays. Of these soldiers, 81 were fighters, 91 carried weapons, and the rest were combat support personnel, including spotters from the Northern Brigade, medics, drivers, and logistics and armament soldiers. The night before the invasion, two separate breaches were detected in the security fence, just a few hundred yards from the base, which is one of the closest to the border. The update was sent at 4:00 a.m. to the Northern Brigade and the division, which were focused on nighttime assessments due to signs of an impending threat from the Gaza Strip. These signs, however, were not passed down to the Border Defense Battalions in order to avoid compromising intelligence sources. The breach in the fence was not fully analyzed, and according to the investigation team, it likely wasn’t linked to the upcoming invasion. However, it did lead to increased caution, and the forces were instructed to delay their morning patrol to verify no further infiltration at the border. Hamas’s operational plan to capture the Nahal Oz base, found in a document in Jabalia, reveals the sources from which Hamas gathered information about the base. These included not only drones launched intermittently but also hundreds of photos and videos uploaded by soldiers to social media from within the base itself, as well as media reports by the IDF about frequent changes in defense strategies in the sector. 'Hamas knew where every commander slept, where the dining hall was, which sections of the agricultural roads leading from the fence to the base could slow them down, and determined in their plan that the Nukhba battalions attacking the base had to do so within 15 minutes to ensure its capture,' the investigation report states. 'Hamas analyzed that it would take 15 minutes for a tank to reach Nahal Oz in case of an event. They monitored drills to determine how long it would take for nearby forces to reinforce. They understood they also had to neutralize the nearby Pega outpost, as it housed mortar positions supporting Nahal Oz, which they successfully did.' The base was divided in advance, with each Nukhba unit assigned to capture a specific area. The first wave, between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m., included 65 of Hamas' best fighters, and another 50 joined the second wave by 9:00 a.m. By 10:00 a.m., 100 more terrorists joined, completing the capture, killing, and kidnapping operations. At the height of the invasion, about 250 Hamas terrorists were inside the Nahal Oz base, which had a perimeter of only 1,200 meters. The commander of the Nukhba platoon was killed early in the battle, but his force continued according to plan. Half of the infiltrating terrorists were killed, while the rest managed to return to Gaza. The Hamas force was well-equipped, and in addition to their numerical advantage, they had a deadly arsenal: while the IDF saw no need to regularly distribute fragmentation grenades or mortar grenades to its soldiers, and machine guns were locked away in storage, Hamas arrived with numerous RPGs, explosive devices of various types, Kalashnikov rifles, and more. An investigation into the first Nukhba platoon’s conduct revealed further intelligence failures. The evening before, starting around 6:00 p.m., the Nukhba platoon had been briefed for the invasion plan. First, the commanders were briefed, followed by the terrorists. All of this occurred in Shijaiyah, an area that should have been covered by the IDF's Gaza Division’s Combat Intelligence Battalion. Yet, no one noticed the activity just one or two kilometers from the border. The second Nukhba platoon that infiltrated the base came from the Al-Furkan neighborhood, a bit deeper into Gaza City. The investigation found that the entry of Golani's 13th Battalion into the area was relatively smooth. Four months before the massacre, a brigade-level drill had included scenarios such as a Nukhba platoon raiding the nearby Pega outpost and an attack on a combat team by a Hamas drone. However, the scenario of an attack on the base itself was never practiced, even though, as noted, the base was only a 15-minute jog from the hostile Shijaiyah neighborhood, less than a kilometer from the border, and fully exposed to Gaza due to the area's topography. Despite the Nukhba raid scenarios discussed by the Gaza Division the year prior to the war, no one thought it necessary to drill Nahal Oz soldiers. Accordingly, as mentioned, the base was guarded by only one soldier at a sentry post and a few others guarding internal sections of the base, mainly to prevent theft, including a section with damaged observation balloons. The standby unit assigned to protect the entire base consisted of a platoon commander and three soldiers. Control at Nahal Oz had been lax even before October 7, despite inspections that seemingly had no effect. It took Colonel A.’s team four full months to compile a basic unit roster of the soldiers at the base as of 6:29 a.m. This indicates just how far basic norms had deteriorated at this front-line, threatened base. 'This base is right across from the kibbutz, and the civilian atmosphere had a negative impact,' the investigators noted. 'Golani’s battalion worked hard during this period, but was focused on the disturbances at the border. On Friday afternoon (October 6), it was once again stationed along the border, reinforced slightly by snipers from the Paratroopers’ reconnaissance unit and the counter-terrorism unit, but pulled back in the late afternoon because the border was unusually quiet and empty.' The shift in the IDF’s operational culture worsened with the change in standard operating procedures known to every soldier in the army until a decade or two ago in border areas: readiness at dawn. Under this procedure, all soldiers are expected to wake up and prepare to defend their post or sector, understanding that these are the most volatile hours, between the dark of night and the first light of dawn. This procedure, it turns out, was modified and contracted so that only the command posts and standby platoons performed it with the sector patrol. One of Golani’s platoon commanders, who waited at 5:30 a.m. at the base junction for a platoon from his unit to join in carrying out the procedure, angrily sent them back to base for being late. Another small unit didn’t wake up at all, according to the investigation. At 6:29 a.m., with the first barrage of fire, Golani company commander Maj. Shilo Har-Even, who was killed in action, shouted, 'This is not a drill. We’re under fire. Iron Dome interceptions. Purple rain.' 'Purple rain' is a code used in IDF operations that originated during the security zone in southern Lebanon, instructing soldiers to take positions at a post, understanding that a barrage of mortar shells could signal the start of a ground assault. Purple rain in 2023 in the IDF was primarily a reference to the Red Alert system. A video from a soldier’s phone at 6:30 a.m. showed Golani fighters laughing inside a bomb shelter in a relatively calm atmosphere. Some were still in their sleepwear, and one officer, wearing only a vest, followed the unfolding events on his radio while waiting for orders. Later, that officer would be one of the heroes of the difficult battle. No one in the IDF had taught these soldiers the real meaning of 'purple rain' or what to do in such a situation. From this point onward, the investigation notes, the spotters maintained remarkable composure, providing detailed, life-saving reports over the radio and did not stop, even when they realized that dozens of terrorists who had just blown the fence were racing toward their base in trucks and on motorcycles. Minute by minute: Fighting at Nahal Oz base 6:31 a.m.: A lookout spots the first Hamas cell before it breaches the fence and immediately reports it to the Golani force outside the base. The commander of the Nahal Oz sector, Golani 13th Battalion Deputy Commander Major N., informs all forces via radio: 'This is a complex event. Purple rain and Turkish cavalry' (code names for infiltrating terrorists). 6:33 a.m.: Another lookout reports the first explosion at the newly constructed 'formidable' border fence, which easily collapses, allowing a Nukhba unit to quickly enter the area in trucks and motorcycles, each carrying two terrorists. The platoon commander, Har-Aven, orders everyone to prepare: 'This is definitely a complex event.' 6:35 a.m.: Major Har-Aven joins a nearby company combat team in his armored patrol jeep. He quickly boards a heavily armored Namer APC attached to a tank. He forgets his mobile phone in the jeep. 6:36 a.m.: Two Golani soldiers run under mortar fire to reinforce their comrade, who is guarding the base's gate alone. The trio—Staff Sgt. Dor Lazimi, Staff Sgt. Ori Karmi, and Staff Sgt. Adir Bogale—will fight heroically at their position against dozens of Hamas terrorists until they fall in battle. 6:37 a.m.: Two active-duty soldiers from the northern battalion stationed at the base leave in a jeep as part of a military protocol, despite their comrade, tracker Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba, urging them to stay and defend the camp. Investigators viewed their actions negatively, but like other soldiers in rare instances who did not seek contact, they were hard to judge. The two remained in the sector, found themselves in another battle zone, and fought until they were injured. 6:38 a.m.: A third lookout in the Nahal Oz command post identifies and reports a new breach in the fence and a large-scale infiltration of terrorists about a kilometer from the base. She and her colleagues try to contact the Pega outpost to request mortar fire on the breach area, but communication problems and ongoing fighting at Pega prevent this. 6:42 a.m.: Cpt. Shir Eilat, the lookout platoon commander, constructs a full situational picture for all forces, detailing enemy positions and IDF units. Based on this, the brigade reserves are activated towards Nahal Oz. 6:43 a.m.: Major N., stationed at the observation post, observes a new breach where dozens of Hamas terrorists are heading toward Route 25, which leads to the Sa'ad junction and then to the entire Gaza envelope. He rushes to the base junction to block the infiltration, becoming the first Nahal Oz commander to encounter terrorists. At this point, the commander of a nearby Golani company orders his soldiers to spread out in the base’s fortified perimeter positions. 6:46 a.m.: As commanders fighting in the base area shout over the radio, 'Where are the tanks?!' two tank crews, who had not been put on relevant standby, mount their tanks, crush 3-4 terrorists, and fire a shell, killing another five in the base’s southwest corner, where about 40 terrorists are concentrated. The tank crews do not see the remaining terrorists and continue toward a position near the border, following their training protocol to reach the fence as quickly as possible, 'because the enemy is in Gaza.' 6:49 a.m.: Major Har-Aven realizes he is in command of the sector alone and divides his limited forces—one tank and one Namer APC—into two fighting hubs. A mortar section commander from a nearby force requests permission to fire. The debrief describes this as another example of the significant cognitive gap among the soldiers, as they were trained this way, despite the fact that the event had been ongoing for 20 minutes. 6:50 a.m.: A tank arriving from the outpost towards Major Har-Aven receives orders from him to head to the Kfar Aza. However, the arriving force struggles to understand what’s happening in the settlement, takes a position outside, and becomes ineffective. Meanwhile, Major N., continuing to fight desperately at the base entrance, is hit by a bullet to his head and severely injured. His soldiers try to stabilize him under fire, but the already-weak human defense line collapses after about ten minutes, and the terrorists breach the base. 6:51 a.m.: The number of soldiers at the base when the attack began, 18, steadily decreases due to numerous casualties. The terrorists exploit gaps in the outpost fence and holes in the western wall, intended for lifting concrete panels, to fire crossfire from outside into the soldiers. 7:00 a.m.: Major Har-Aven receives orders from the brigade commander to command the battalion. The remaining armed personnel in the base focus on protecting the fortified rooms, where dozens of unarmed and frightened soldiers are sheltering. Major Har-Aven receives another report about the dire situation in Kfar Aza and sends his reconnaissance force with two jeeps, but they do not enter the settlement, likely due to fear, and head north instead. Later, they will testify: 'We saw an RPG missile flying near us, so we didn’t enter Kfar Aza and continued to the outposts, then to Sderot.' The debrief viewed their conduct negatively, but they did not flee or hide, instead reaching the Sderot checkpoint and engaging in heavy fighting with the terrorists there. 7:08 a.m.: More than 40 terrorists breach the weakened defense line at the base and begin firing at its buildings. Cpt. Shir Eilat, the lookout officer, hears them approaching the command post door and physically raises her orders according to the 'position abandonment procedure.' 4-5 staff officers from the Golani 13th Battalion stay with the lookouts and do not exit to fight. 7:30 a.m.: Major B., commander of Company B, is occupied with blocking a Nukhba unit attempting to infiltrate the Nahal Oz kibbutz. Major Har-Aven returns to the base with his Namer APC and sprays terrorists in his path with a MAG machine gun. At this point, an anti-tank missile is fired at him, severing his hand almost completely. 7:41 a.m.: The first airstrike, by a UAV, disrupts the movement of terrorists in a field adjacent to the base. 7:55 a.m.: Major Har-Aven retreats slightly due to his injury and meets his friend, Major B., the second-in-command, at the gatehouse to receive help with the kibbutz sector. The two plan an assault on the captured base with two tanks and a Namer APC. Major B. tells his injured friend, still on his feet: 'Let’s go, it’s just you and me against the world.' 7:56 a.m.: In these minutes, moments of heroic valor are seen in the fortified rooms. Captain Eden Nimri, commander of a Sky Rider team, manages firefights with terrorists surrounding the shelter alongside four of her soldiers. Female soldiers throw back two grenades thrown at them; the third explodes and injures them. The chaos is used by 11 other female soldiers to escape to another shelter. The terrorists follow them, but a UAV strikes nearby as they are at the door, forcing the terrorists to flee, and the 11 soldiers survive. 8:00 a.m.: Major Har-Aven begins fighting inside the outpost with the tank but realizes it is ineffective compared to the Namer APC. He decides to exit because the terrorists flee whenever they see the armored vehicles, while they continue slaughtering the rear-echelon soldiers in the camp. It is difficult for his three Namer soldiers to exit into the hellish scene, but he urges them: 'This is why we enlisted, this is what we swore to.' They go out with him into the battle for their lives, as their commander bleeds and has his hand severed. Few against many, they charge and kill terrorists, but deadly fire from four directions hits them. Major Har-Aven and two soldiers are killed. The radio operator, Soldier S., takes a bullet to his weapon but continues to fight. 8:54 a.m.: Nahal Oz base is finally overrun. The two tanks inside attempt to evacuate casualties, including Major Har-Aven and his soldiers. Eventually, they make the difficult decision to exit towards the border to block the continuing invasion. At this point, around 200 terrorists flood the base. The small armored team, along with a platoon sergeant from Golani, takes position in a field between the base and the border, facing 60 terrorists of the third wave rushing toward them. The soldiers charge forward, absorbing anti-tank missiles and heavy fire, killing terrorists until they, too, are overrun. 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.: The toughest hours at Nahal Oz base. Terrorists move from shelter to shelter, from room to room, including killing soldiers from the Balloon Observation Unit. Air support struggles to assess the situation due to the chaos, smoke, and fires, but succeeds in some disruption strikes around 11:00 a.m. Combat helicopter pilots identify a Humvee stolen by terrorists from the base but suspect it may contain kidnapped soldiers, so they refrain from attacking it. Tracker Ibrahim Kharuba from the village of Marar, raised in the Paratroopers Brigade, guards with two other soldiers the room where the lookouts are hiding. The northern brigade commander instructs him: 'Act according to your judgment, you’re the commander there now.' The terrorists call on him in Arabic to surrender. He calls his family to say goodbye, telling the female soldiers, 'It has been an honor to die for the country and for you.' He goes to charge and is shot dead. 12:00 p.m.: The command post and adjacent room where 22 soldiers, including lookouts and five staff officers from Golani, are sheltering, are set on fire. Most die from the flames or suffocate from the smoke, but some manage to escape by crawling out through a small window. Investigators struggled to assign blame to those present in the situation, who were simply trying to survive, but concluded, 'In the IDF, an officer should leave after a soldier, and a female soldier after a female soldier.' Senior fire investigators who examined the scene found no evidence of harmful chemicals or accelerants used. 1:30 p.m.: The first reinforcements from Shayetet 13 and the YAMAM counterterrorism unit begin arriving and find only one or two terrorist cells that hadn’t managed to retreat back to Gaza. Nahal Oz base is mostly in ruins, with bodies, fire, and smoke. Conclusions, lessons and recommendations Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg, commander of Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion, who later fell in combat in Gaza, had conducted numerous drills for his forces from Nahal Oz, including one just before the massacre, emphasizing the need to be prepared for a surprise attack. However, no exercises simulated an attack on the base itself, which was not organic and included forces from different units that did not know each other—this proved detrimental on the morning of October 7: The collection battalion’s forces, including the lookouts and the Balloon Unit, were too dispersed across bases in Orim, Re’im and Nahal Oz, contributing to the loss of control and operational confusion in real time. Although the command post was closest to enemy territory, it wasn’t designated as a defensive target and was only prepared against rocket and mortar threats, with only a fire extinguisher assigned in case of fire. The division didn’t rehearse scenarios with the brigade, which didn’t train the Nahal Oz battalion, and so on for an attack scenario on the base. The lack of coverage for the base’s western positions was a critical and dangerous failure. Base staff officers were sleeping with their weapons not at hand, despite being only 15 minutes from the Gaza Strip. The debrief concluded: Operational norms were lacking. A minimum number of forces must be assigned to the outpost at all times. Multi-unit bases should be discontinued. Command climate was deficient. The battle at the base represents a profound and painful systemic failure that touches upon the core values of the IDF. While there were moments of heroic valor and exceptional resourcefulness from soldiers and officers, there were also soldiers and commanders who did not seek contact. The investigation did not examine the lookout warnings prior to the war and how the commanders responded to them, but they clearly warned about the threat. This needs to be investigated separately. Also, the way the IDF handled the bereaved families from the base after October 7 should be reviewed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1userxojx	2025-03-03T07:58:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/Hy04jSPu1e/Hy04jSPu1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

700 soldiers, senior commanders and chaos: Inside the October 7 m...	IDF probe into October 7 Hamas attack on Kfar Aza reveals critical intelligence failures, delayed military response and acts of heroism as outnumbered defenders fought to protect their community Seven hundred combat troops, battalion and brigade commanders and two division commanders were present, yet none were able to contain the horrific attack. Cries for help went unanswered as the first forces arrived in the Young Generation neighborhood, much after several residents had already been abducted. Instead of evacuating residents, they were instructed to remain in their safe rooms—where the terrorists ultimately reached them. Others were evacuated to the kibbutz gate and told to hitch rides from there. The military investigation into the events of the October 7 massacre at Kfar Aza reveals both failures and acts of heroism. The IDF's official inquiry focused on one of the more problematic decisions made by senior command in the past decade: a significant reduction in troop deployments along the Gaza border on weekends and holidays. While Israelis were unaware of this policy, Hamas was not. The terror group exploited it to the fullest—not only in the massacre at Kfar Aza, where 64 residents were murdered and 19 were abducted, including Gili and Ziv Berman, who remain in captivity—but also in the wounding of many others and the near-total destruction of the kibbutz. Eighteen IDF soldiers were killed defending Kfar Aza. Half of the force assigned to protect it was on leave for the holiday. The probe found that it took approximately two hours before a small, insufficient force arrived to ward off the attack, despite the kibbutz being just three kilometers (under two miles) from the Nahal Oz military base. By then, 200 terrorists of Hamas' elite Nukhba force had already overrun the community. For those two hours of unrelenting violence, the kibbutz was defended solely by its 18-member alert squad. Seven were killed, and others fought on despite being wounded and lost valuable time in retrieving weapons from an armory that had been locked under IDF orders. The decision to allow so many troops to take leave—made out of concern for their well-being—has since been reversed, albeit belatedly. There were many acts of heroism that day. One example highlighted in the IDF inquiry was that of 22-year-old Neta Epstein, who threw himself onto a grenade hurled into his safe room, sacrificing his life to save his partner. Military intelligence failed to detect Hamas’ preparations for the massacre, which began on Friday evening. By dawn Saturday, dozens of terrorists were already in vehicles, waiting for the order to attack. At 6:29 a.m., Hamas launched 960 rockets and missiles at IDF positions along the border to pin down any reinforcements. That was the signal for terrorists to storm the border fence, which was breached near Kfar Aza at three points: 6:35, 6:41 and 6:43 a.m. At the same time, six Nukhba terrorists on gliders landed in the kibbutz—a moment captured on film by Ynet photographer Roy Edan, who was murdered in the attack. His young daughter, Abigail, witnessed her father's killing before being taken from his arms and abducted to Gaza. According to the IDF probe, a Hamas terrorist told Abigail to run to the neighbors, who were later taken hostage as well. Initially, 80 terrorists infiltrated Kfar Aza, later joined by 170 more in two subsequent waves. Unlike in other communities and military posts, they looted relatively little. According to intelligence, most of the terrorists in Kfar Aza had planned to continue their assault on Kibbutz Sa’ad—where their attack was thwarted—and on the city of Sderot. Instead, they remained in Kfar Aza. The terrorists took up fortified positions inside the kibbutz. Around noon, an IDF officer arrived and found a hand radio near a terrorist’s body. He overheard orders instructing the terrorists to 'stay in the kibbutz and prepare for a long battle.' The intelligence failures leading up to the massacre continued throughout the attack. No one in the elite SIGINIT Unit 8200 thought to monitor the communications of terrorists who had already infiltrated Israel. The attackers were prepared for an extended battle, bringing advanced first aid kits to treat their wounded, along with military equipment and ammunition to last for days. The destruction in Kfar Aza was among the most extensive that day. Six of the kibbutz’s eight neighborhoods were devastated. In the Young Generation neighborhood, 11 of the 37 residents were murdered, and seven were abducted. At the peak of the assault, 250 terrorists were inside Kfar Aza, using it as a staging ground for swift movement. In addition to motorcycles, pickup trucks and private vehicles they had driven from Gaza, they also used cars and even bicycles belonging to kibbutz members. Only two families, realizing the danger early, managed to escape by car. The IDF carried out seven airstrikes to support Kfar Aza, but only one occurred on the day of the attack; the rest took place the following day. Another 19 airstrikes were launched on Saturday elsewhere, seemingly slowing down additional terrorists heading toward the kibbutz. Despite the presence of three battalion commanders, three brigadiers and two division commanders—including one kibbutz resident who fought the terrorists with only a knife—along with 1,200 reinforcements from 24 units, no senior officer was able to take control of the chaos. As a result, most Kfar Aza residents remained trapped in their safe rooms with the wounded and dead for two more days as the fighting continued into a third day. The last resident was murdered on Saturday at 6 p.m., and the final soldier was killed on Tuesday afternoon. A total of 101 terrorist bodies were found inside the kibbutz, but most of the attackers managed to escape back to Gaza. The last terrorist inside Kfar Aza was killed on Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. The IDF inquiry concluded that misplaced confidence in the Gaza border barrier led to an inadequate defense strategy, creating dangerous gaps in situational awareness and operational readiness. For an entire day, troops operated without command and control. They arrived without proper combat gear, and even by evening, many were still acting independently, without clear orders from the Southern Command or IDF General Staff. The lack of coordination enabled further kidnappings. Until late Saturday night, no force managed to secure the three-to-four-kilometer stretch between Kfar Aza and the border. Senior officers did not fully grasp the plight of the besieged residents for half a day. It was only after two officers managed to reach the command post at the kibbutz entrance, which was set up Saturday evening, that a clearer picture emerged. Residents, particularly those evacuated late, reported seeing IDF forces remaining outside the kibbutz. However, according to the investigation, only a few troops hesitated to enter, primarily in the morning hours. Most of the forces seen outside were medical teams and administrative personnel. The investigation praised the United Hatzalah emergency response organization for dispatching ambulances into the combat zone and saving many lives. The IDF said that Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s primary ambulance service, did not cooperate with the inquiry. The findings revealed that, in some instances, IDF forces did not treat residents appropriately. Some wounded civilians, evacuated only to the entrance of the kibbutz, were left to hitch rides to hospitals—even on Saturday night. The bodies of murdered residents were removed late, only on Tuesday, and survivors of the massacre were exposed to horrific scenes during an evacuation that was largely unsecured. Numerous desperate pleas for assistance from residents to the IDF went unanswered. 'We did not properly instruct soldiers on how to evacuate civilians, so the blame does not lie with them. In the Young Generation neighborhood, trapped residents cried out for help even during the night,' the IDF acknowledged. 'There is a need for an external review of the events at Kibbutz Kfar Aza. At this stage, no personal conclusions have been drawn—some lessons have yet to be learned, while others have already been implemented.' Minute by minute: The massacre at Kfar Aza 6:42 – 6:45 a.m.: Following a barrage of dozens of rockets and mortars targeting the kibbutz, which began at 6:30 a.m., six Hamas terrorists land inside Kfar Aza as an advance force, arriving on three motorized paragliders. From the air, they fire at residents, some of whom are still outside their homes, trying to grasp what is happening. This is likely when Ynet photographer Roy Edan was murdered, after managing to capture the first moments of the infiltration. His young daughter, Abigail, was later abducted, while his wife, Shin Bet employee Smadar Mor Edan, was killed in the family's reinforced safe room shortly after. 6:50 – 6:54 a.m.: The first pickup truck carrying terrorists enters the kibbutz through the rear solar-powered gate, which was breached with an explosive charge. Almost simultaneously, Hamas operatives break through three sections of the border fence. Another terrorist vehicle enters via a second rear gate, intended for pedestrian use. The attackers spot 72-year-old kibbutz resident David 'Kachko' Katzir on his morning run and kill him—making him the first victim of the massacre. 6:55 a.m.: The terrorists know exactly where the kibbutz armory is located—possibly due to intelligence provided by Gazan laborers who had worked in the community, according to the investigation. Members of the local alert squad rush to retrieve their locked weapons, but the attackers head there as well, aiming to neutralize the defense force. Heavy fighting erupts. Among those battling the terrorists is Brig. Gen. (res.) Israel Shomer, a resident of the kibbutz and former commander of the 146th Division. At 6:40 a.m., he had managed to call IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Southern Command head Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, reporting the situation. 7:25 a.m.: A regional force, including a single tank, reaches the outskirts of Kfar Aza. It was dispatched by company commander Shilo Har-Even, who later fell in battle at the Nahal Oz military base and has since been recommended for the Medal of Valor. However, from the tank’s position, its crew is unable to fully assess the chaos unfolding inside the kibbutz. The tank’s communication systems were damaged at the onset of the attack, and its crew struggles to operate their mounted machine guns due to the sustained fire. Unable to reach Golani Brigade officers engaged in fierce combat elsewhere, the tank commander contacts his direct superior from the 77th Armored Battalion. The officer advises him to leave Kfar Aza and redeploy southward to other battle zones. 'I didn’t understand the full picture of what was happening inside, so I left,' the tank crew later explained. Meanwhile, the rest of the regional Golani forces are engaged in heavy defensive battles between the Nahal Oz military base and Kibbutz Nahal Oz, as well as on the border bridge, trying to repel the mass Hamas infiltration. 7:28 a.m.: Dorrit Wertheim, 54, who was responsible for distributing emergency messages to kibbutz residents, is murdered. A fellow resident takes over the critical task of providing guidance to the community, but communication on WhatsApp remains unsynchronized with the IDF. 7:30 a.m.: Another 150 Hamas Nukhba terrorists infiltrate the kibbutz, entering through a third breach near the Young Generation neighborhood, adjacent to the perimeter road. By this point, there are already 10 Hamas pickup trucks and multiple motorcycles inside the kibbutz, each carrying two terrorists. The attackers go house to house, killing residents in cold blood. When they find many safe rooms locked, they decide to set them on fire. 8:30 a.m.: For the first time since the attack began, an initial IDF force arrives—a small, outnumbered contingent from the regional battalion, unable to shift control from Hamas. The force is led by Capt. (res.) B., commander of Company B from the 13th Battalion, who arrives under orders from Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg, who was returning from weekend leave. (Greenberg was later killed in Gaza during the war.) B. takes an armored personnel carrier (Namer) from the battalion’s reserve near Kibbutz Alumim and advances into Kfar Aza, where 150 terrorists are still present and 37 residents have already been murdered. Two Golani reconnaissance jeeps are sent toward the kibbutz, but their troops decide to continue north rather than enter. 'We looked in the rearview mirror and saw an RPG rocket pass right by us, so we decided to head toward Kibbutz Mefalsim,' they later told investigators. The same soldiers eventually reached Sderot, where they played a key role in the heroic battle at the city's captured police station. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 8:33 a.m.: Capt. B.’s armored personnel carrier runs over several terrorists and relies primarily on WhatsApp messages from residents to determine where to go and where wounded civilians need rescue. At 8:42 a.m., the first attack helicopter is deployed at B.’s request, conducting a strike to isolate the kibbutz from external threats. 9:44 a.m.: A joint force of 15 police officers and soldiers arrives at the kibbutz after navigating Hamas ambushes that have effectively cut off the area by targeting roads and intersections. The force is immediately engaged upon entry, sustaining casualties but managing to eliminate several terrorists. 10:34 a.m.: A military force from the Duvdevan unit, consisting of 16 soldiers in two armored vehicles from the Samaria region, enters the kibbutz and is immediately drawn into heavy fighting, including anti-tank fire targeting their vehicles. The unit is aided by a fellow Duvdevan soldier who lives in the kibbutz and helps guide them. During the battle, the force loses six soldiers. At one point, they spot a man emerging from a house with a shotgun, mistake him for a terrorist, and fatally shoot him. Meanwhile, a small team from Sayeret Matkal arrives at the kibbutz, splitting into two groups. Four of them attempt to flank the enemy but are ambushed and killed at close range by terrorists hiding inside a house. 10:46 a.m.: The commander of the elite Maglan unit arrives at the kibbutz with a small force, along with undercover officers from the Israel Police’s Southern District. Simultaneously, a force from the Paratroopers' 890th Battalion enters the kibbutz. The various units attempt to organize combat teams, divide sectors and launch counterattacks against the large number of terrorists still inside. 11:00 a.m.: Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfuss, commander of the 98th Division, arrives at the kibbutz by chance and fights alongside Maglan soldiers for about an hour. He then leaves to assume command of the wider battle zone and orders the commander of the Commando Brigade to take charge of all operations inside the kibbutz. 11:24 a.m.: Chief Superintendent Shimon Portal, an intelligence officer from the Israel Police’s Southern District, arrives at the kibbutz to rescue his daughter and other young people trapped in the Young Generation neighborhood. His presence proves critical, and the intelligence he relays back helps military commanders realize that the IDF must concentrate its efforts on this area, where many terrorists are barricaded inside fortified prefab homes, along with stunned civilians. 11:48 a.m.: A second Duvdevan force enters Kfar Aza with 53 regular soldiers. During the two-hour period from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., despite the arrival of initial reinforcements, 18 residents are murdered, 19 are abducted to Gaza and seven soldiers are killed. Only 18 civilians are successfully evacuated from the kibbutz during this time. 12:50 p.m.: A military force arrives at the Young Generation neighborhood, hours late—after the abductions have already taken place, but with many terrorists still barricaded inside small apartments and safe rooms alongside terrified residents. Despite repeated pleas for help, no rescue had come until now. Confusion reigns across the kibbutz, where hundreds of soldiers are now present, but no single commander is coordinating them. 'We went house to house, saw residents, confirmed they were okay and just told them to stay in their safe rooms instead of evacuating them,' soldiers later told investigators. 'After we left and continued searching, terrorists reached some of them.' 1:30 p.m.: Brig. Gen. Shomer joins forces with the Paratroopers’ 202nd Battalion. As they advance toward the Young Generation neighborhood, they encounter heavy resistance, with soldiers killed in the fighting. Meanwhile, the commander of the Jerusalem District Counterterrorism Unit is alerted by one of his officers inside the kibbutz, who directs him toward the embattled neighborhood and warns of a large ambush at its entrance. 1:52 p.m.: Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg, commander of the 13th Battalion, leads a force of around 50 soldiers from Duvdevan and Sayeret Matkal into the Young Generation neighborhood. However, breaching the fortified buildings proves difficult. A Namer armored personnel carrier attempts to ram through buildings with limited intelligence on whether terrorists, civilians or both are inside. 2:00 – 4:00 p.m.: By this point, more than 700 soldiers are in the kibbutz, including Givati Brigade Commander Col. Liron Batito, who joins the fighting. Yet no one considers deploying forces to isolate the area. Many terrorists remain hidden in the surrounding fields, launching attacks on soldiers into the night, including along the kibbutz’s perimeter fence. 4:00 p.m.: A unit from the elite Shaldag reconnaissance force is dispatched to locate 10-month-old twins from the Berdichevsky family, whose parents, Itay and Hadar, were murdered that morning. The infants are found crying by IDF soldiers and finally evacuated to safety at 8:00 p.m. by Lt. Col. Greenberg. 5:00 p.m.: For the first time, Givati Brigade Commander Col. Liron Batito assigns combat sectors within the kibbutz, working alongside the Paratroopers' 202nd Battalion. Meanwhile, the Commando Brigade commander assumes leadership of the battle in Kfar Aza. 6:00 p.m.: Eliyahu Orgad, 72, is killed—likely by IDF fire—when troops target a vehicle carrying Hamas terrorists attempting to flee toward Gaza. Unbeknownst to the soldiers, Orgad was restrained inside the car and hidden from view. Meanwhile, hundreds of kibbutz residents remain trapped in safe rooms, still awaiting evacuation. 6:41 p.m.: An additional 300 reservists from the 55th Brigade arrive and begin searching the kibbutz’s empty industrial area. 7:00 p.m.: The Commando Brigade’s command center is established at the Alonit gas station near the kibbutz entrance. 9:00 p.m.: A kibbutz resident, having spent the entire day hiding in his safe room, cautiously emerges and spots a military vehicle. As he slowly approaches, he opens the rear door to ask for help, but the soldiers, fearing he is a terrorist, open fire, wounding him moderately. Another soldier, realizing the mistake, kicks the wounded man away from the line of fire to save him but is also shot in the leg in the process. 11:00 p.m.: The evacuation of most Kfar Aza residents finally begins, following the intervention of two residents, Yoni Peled and Nira Shpak, who arrive at the command center and push for urgent action. Due to widespread fear, civilians only agree to open their safe rooms after receiving a prearranged password. Many are horrified to see the bodies of dozens of their neighbors as they exit the kibbutz. 11:30 p.m.: A young Maglan officer realizes that control will not be established overnight without better coordination. He creates a WhatsApp group named 'Kfar Aza Command & Control' and adds dozens of commanders from different units—IDF, Shin Bet and police—who were operating in the kibbutz but had no direct communication with each other. While the group improves coordination, it also spreads unverified rumors, such as false reports of a tunnel near the kibbutz from which 25 terrorists allegedly emerged. Midnight – dawn: Although many residents are evacuated, some remain stranded outside the kibbutz at the Alonit complex, while others reach Route 232, forced to hitchhike out as the sounds of ongoing gunfire echo from the Young Generation neighborhood. In a bizarre moment, an officer also resorts to hitchhiking—but in reverse: he stops bulldozers and a reservist tank unit from the 10th Brigade on Route 232 and redirects them to help breach the fortified safe rooms where terrorists remain barricaded. The chaos continues, with a deadly clash between Shayetet 13 forces and terrorists near the kibbutz swimming pool at 5:37 a.m. Sunday, 8:00 a.m.: The IDF has managed to evacuate 60% of the kibbutz residents, but hundreds remain trapped. Dozens of Hamas terrorists are still inside Kfar Aza, and the battle continues throughout the day, though the combat zones are increasingly contained. Monday morning: Shayetet 13 is tasked with rescuing the last remaining civilians still hiding in safe rooms—now in their third day without food or water, some wounded and others trapped alongside the bodies of their loved ones. Tuesday morning – Tuesday evening: The final phase of the evacuation takes place, followed by sweeps to locate and eliminate the last remaining terrorists, most of whom are wounded. By the afternoon, an order is given for all active combat units to withdraw, leaving 55th Brigade reservists in charge of securing the kibbutz. At 6:00 p.m., troops from the 28th Battalion of the brigade spot and kill the last wounded terrorist, who is still clutching a knife. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyfca4qoyg	2025-03-03T07:08:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/27/r1rgcadKzT/r1rgcadKzT_0_196_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

I am sure you feel at home now': Slain hostage Itzik Elgarat lai...	Hundreds gather in Kibbutz Nir Oz to bid farewell to slain hostage after 509 days in Hamas captivity; family and mourners honor his memory in emotional funeral, vowing to continue fight to bring home remaining hostages Hundreds of mourners gathered Monday afternoon to lay to rest Itzik Elgarat, who was abducted from his home on October 7 and whose remains were returned to Israel after 509 days in captivity. He was buried in Kibbutz Nir Oz, the community from which he was taken. Earlier in the day, thousands assembled outside the Great Synagogue in Rishon Lezion, waving Israeli flags and paying their respects before joining the funeral procession that departed the city in the morning and reached the kibbutz in southern Israel by midday. Elgart’s sister, Rachel Dancyg, eulogized him with a moving tribute. 'Itzik, my dear brother, now you are up there with Eli, Uri, Mom and Dad, watching over us, sending love. I am here below, a survivor from Kibbutz Nir Oz. I love you all. The Elgart family is well known—an unusual family, a family of artists, talented, leading and beloved. You, Itzik, were the kibbutz’s handyman. You could fix anything, improvise with extraordinary skill.' Reflecting on their lives in the community, she recalled, 'Eli, Itzik and I arrived at Kibbutz Nir Oz in the 1970s, after our military service. We gave so much of ourselves, and we received so much—until it all ended. The land became a field of blood and slaughter. The army didn’t come. They took you, and they took Alex Dancyg, the father of my children, into dark tunnels, into hell. You never returned. We failed to save you and our friends. So many of our loved ones vanished that day—murdered, abducted, children taken, complete devastation. None of us remain.' Elgarat’s brother, Danny, who fought tirelessly for his release, also delivered an emotional eulogy. 'My brother, you have come home. I promised I would bring you back, and I kept that promise. I am sure you feel at home now—you have returned to Nir Oz. Itzik, sadly, you were right. Your last words before you were taken, bleeding, were ‘Danny, this is the end.’ You already knew, but we refused to believe. We fought with all our strength to prove you wrong. We failed. We didn’t do enough.' Before the funeral procession left Rishon Lezion, mourners approached Danny to offer their condolences. 'I’m so sorry that we received Itzik in a coffin—that he did not come back alive,' one woman told him. Danny, a civics teacher at a local high school, expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support. 'I am overwhelmed by what I see here,' he said, thanking Rishon Lezion’s mayor, whom he called 'a true leader.' He added, 'We will continue until the last hostage comes home.'

The crowd sang Israel’s national anthem, Hatikva, as Danny addressed Itzik one final time: 'You are returning home now, to the land of Nir Oz. I promised to bring you back—alive or dead—and now you are home.' As the funeral procession continued toward Nir Oz, where Elgart was laid to rest, the struggle to bring home the remaining hostages carried on. Rishon Lezion Mayor Raz Kinstlich also paid tribute to Elgart. 'This is not how we wanted to welcome you home, Itzik. Our hearts are aching. Thousands have come to salute you and bid you farewell. Itzik endured 509 days in Hamas captivity—in hell on earth. A father of two daughters, a brother to Danny and his sisters, Itzik was taken from the safe room in Nir Oz. His brother Danny fought to bring him home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjgztbmojg	2025-03-03T06:24:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/BkZkjf7oyx/BkZkjf7oyx_0_215_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Haifa terror attack: Assailant gets off bus and stabs repeatedly ...	A terrorist from Shfar'am carried out a stabbing attack in Haifa, killing a resident of Kafr Kanna on a bus near the entrance to the city's central station. After exiting the bus, he stabbed another person, with chilling recordings from the scene capturing the panic: 'This is a terror attack! I see three casualties, there is a child on the ground'; The attacker’s family claims he suffered from mental health issues, while investigators are focusing on his activities abroad and why he returned to Israel. Recordings from emergency responders reveal the panic during Monday morning’s deadly stabbing attack at Haifa’s Central Station. 'Someone on the bus pulled out a knife. This is a terror attack! There’s a small child on the ground. I see three casualties,' a woman is heard saying as she called for medical help. Footage shows the assailant stepping off the bus and continuing his attack, repeatedly stabbing a 65-year-old man from Kafr Kanna in the back until he collapsed. The attacker, a 20-year-old Druze resident of Shfar'am, was shot dead by security personnel. See footage of the attack: According to Magen David Adom, the first report of the attack came at 9:53 a.m. A total of five people were wounded, including the man who was killed. Three others were seriously injured, including a 15-year-old boy whose condition later stabilized and is now listed as moderate. A woman in her 70s was also wounded and is in moderate condition. Israel Police confirmed that the attacker, named as Yitro Shahin, a 20-year-old with German citizenship from the northern city of Shfar'am, began his stabbing spree on a bus before exiting at Haifa’s Central Station, where he continued attacking people until he was shot dead by security personnel and a civilian. Investigators are now examining his recent stay abroad and his reasons for returning to Israel last week. His family claims he suffered from severe mental illness. 'We are shocked by what happened. He had been struggling with mental illness for years,' his uncle, Roni Haris, told Ynet. 'I am an IDF veteran with a disability, and his other uncle is a reservist. There is nothing in our family that is hostile to the state. This is a tragic incident, and we want to understand what really happened because all we have been told is that he was killed. We want the truth and answers to our questions.' Eyewitness accounts suggest that the assailant traveled on a bus from northern Israel before boarding another bus and continuing to Haifa. 'He got off at the central station, shouted 'Allahu Akbar,' and started stabbing people on the platform,' a witness said. Security guards then shot and neutralized him. The deputy mayor of Shfar'am, Faraj Hanifas, echoed the family’s claim that Shahin suffered from severe mental illness and was receiving treatment from the city's welfare department. However, he expressed strong condemnation of the attack. Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, also denounced the attack. 'We strongly condemn this morning’s incident. My condolences go to the family of the victim, and I wish a full recovery to the wounded. This is a tragic and painful event, and my heart is with the families. Before drawing conclusions, it is important to wait for a thorough investigation by security forces regarding the background, circumstances, and the severe mental illness from which he suffered,' he said. He also emphasized that members of the Druze community actively fight terrorism, noting that Druze security personnel were involved in neutralizing the attacker. In the aftermath of the attack, authorities investigated whether the 65-year-old victim, in addition to being stabbed, may have been mistakenly shot by a security guard who had identified him as the assailant. Following examinations, officials confirmed that the man had suffered multiple stab wounds to his neck and that a single bullet wound was found on his foot — likely from the shots fired at the terrorist. However, police stated that the gunshot was not the cause of death, and his body was sent for an autopsy. Magen David Adom paramedic Itai Mazor described the chaotic scene: 'There was absolute mayhem, with security guards and police officers rushing in from all directions. Despite the tragic outcome, the attack could have been far worse. Fortunately, there weren’t too many civilians at the scene, or it could have ended much more tragically.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel’s police chief, Danny Levi, visited the site of the attack, which is one of Israel’s largest transportation hubs, and confirmed that 'one terrorist was eliminated by civilian forces.' He added that security forces were conducting searches and setting up roadblocks to ensure that the assailant acted alone. Acting National Security Minister Haim Katz held a security briefing to assess the situation and receive updates on the victims. 'The coming days will be challenging,' he said. 'The Israel Police and all emergency and rescue agencies are on high alert, but the public must remain vigilant and report any suspicious individuals without hesitation. I commend the security guards who acted swiftly and neutralized the terrorist.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkiquqxokl	2025-03-03T04:34:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/Byl4vB11Xjkl/Byl4vB11Xjkl_425_461_2576_1450_0_small.jpg
Phishing attack targets Foreign Ministry staff around the world	Diplomats receive messages claiming to be from senior officials or well-known personalities in an effort to breach Foreign Ministry computers and retrieve sensitive information Employees of the Foreign Ministry around the world have become targets of a sophisticated phishing attack in recent days. The attackers, who portrayed themselves as senior officials such as cabinet secretary Yossi Fuchs or well-known personalities such as Avi Berkowitz, a close associate of U.S. President Donald Trump, attempted to dupe the staffers using fake messages that appeared as if they were formal communication, asking them to click on links or accept Zoom calls which would enable the attackers to access ministry computers and retrieve information. One such message addressed to an employee of the ministry was claimed to be from Berkowitz. Dear Eyal, the message read, I am a Special Representative of Mr. Kushner. Given the need for extensive diplomatic cooperation between the US government and the MFA we intend to have more extensive cooperation in this area. You are one of the most important people in this area and I intend to discuss further details regarding the expansion of diplomatic cooperation. Given the importance of this matter, I have been assigned to contact you personally. Another message claiming to be from Fuchs was sent to a staffer in the ministry. 'I decided to cooperate more in this matter,' the message said. 'I hope we can discuss more details in the future.' A senior ministry official said the matter is under investigation and the ministry is working in cooperation with security and cyber authorities to identify the attackers and prevent further harm. Similar attacks have been made against official and strategic targets in Israel in recent months. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Data security officials said these attacks were especially sophisticated and meant to retrieve sensitive information and erode the confidence in Israel's diplomacy. Among clear indications that these are false messages are the misspelling of names, requests to connect to unknown links and invitations to Zoom calls from suspicious sources. The Foreign Ministry published guidance to its employees, stressing that such communications must be blocked and the relevant authorities notified. 'Remember, do not click on links sent by unfamiliar sources on WhatsApp or via e-mail.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by9zdm7i1l	2025-03-03T04:00:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/08/17/HJQEtK5A5/HJQEtK5A5_0_0_3000_2250_0_small.jpg

Close Netanyahu ally says peace deal with Palestinians possible i...	Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer tells Jeiwsh Agency Board of Governors that once Palestinians realize Israel cannot be destroyed, they would join Arab states in making peace and that Hamas must be destroyed but first hostages must be freed; Says PM told him Qatari funding for Gaza brings quiet to south Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said a peace deal could be signed with the Palestinians if Hamas was defeated. Dermer spoke in a closed meeting with the Jewish Agency's Board of Governors. According to the minister, after the eradication of Hamas, the Palestinians would understand that the notion that Israel could be destroyed is impossible and after seeing it achieve peace with Arab states, would make peace as well. Dermer, who rarely makes public appearances, said he is certain that Hamas could be defeated, but the hostages must first be extracted from Gaza and that there are considerable efforts underway to get more of the hostages out. Regarding the day after the war, the minister said Israel is waiting to see how the outline proposed by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, which Israel supports, would develop. Dermer said that during the war, then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told him that Hamas was an idea that could not be destroyed, to which he replied that the Nazi ideology was also an idea and there is no Nazi state. Hamas, he said, may remain an idea but must not rule over territory. The Trump administration is better for Israel and the president has given his full unequivocal support, Dermer said, adding that President Joe Biden had done a lot for Israel and his actions are appreciated, but Hamas had identified the small differences between the previous administration's position and that of Israel and hoped to cause a rift between the two. Under Trump, he said, there is not even a slight gap. Dermer told the Board of Governors that when he was Israel's ambassador to the U.S. he refused to publish a post approving of Qatari money being delivered to Gaza. Dermer did not say who had asked for him to publish the post but said he ultimately published a watered-down version after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him it would calm the situation in the south. He then shared that, during Netayahu's visit to the White House last month, Trump was given a gold pager as a gift, alluding to the successful operation against Hezbollah when thousands of pagers exploded in the hands of senior operatives of the terror group. Vice President J.D. Vance then asked for one as well and a special one in silver was made for him. Now, Dermer said, there is an ongoing competition among officials in the White House to see who will receive a pager in bronze	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk111szqsyl	2025-03-03T03:01:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/SJByJHCDJe/SJByJHCDJe_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Bedouin tracker, who defended IDF female lookouts at Nahal Oz on ...	Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba fought until his last bullet defending the female lookouts at Nahal Oz base on October 7; His extraordinary bravery has led to a recommendation for Israel's second-highest honor; 'He was a man of values' his father said The investigation into the battle at the Nahal Oz base on the morning of October 7, 2023, exposed severe operational failures but also highlighted the extraordinary bravery of the soldiers stationed there, including Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba, who is one of two soldiers recommended in the investigation to receive the Medal of Valor, the second-highest decoration in the IDF. 'He acted admirably — this is how I raised him. He was a man of values,' his father, Hassan, said. Kharuba served as a tracker in the northern brigade of the Gaza Division. On October 7, 2023, he joined the deputy commander of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, who had taken control of the area. Realizing the magnitude of the attack, Kharuba took command of the fighting at the entrance to the lookout post's command center. Together with two officers from the 13th Battalion — Lieutenant Nimrod Eliraz and Lieutenant Yohai Duchan — and a soldier, Staff Sergeant Itai Ron, Kharuba fought to block the terrorists at the command center door. He fought until his last bullet and was later found at the position closest to the door. According to reports, before he fell, Kharuba told the terrorists that he would never surrender. He spoke to the terrorists in Arabic, trying to convince them to leave the female lookouts alone in the name of Islam The investigation revealed the trackers and female lookouts performed their duties effectively, identifying and warning of the threats early on. However, these warnings were blatantly and systematically ignored. During the battle, Kharuba reportedly stood and told the female lookouts that it was an honor for him to die protecting them and the State of Israel. 'It was my greatest honor to defend you,' he said, according to details uncovered in the investigation. His father, Hassan, shared in an interview with Ynet that he was not surprised by the details revealed in the investigation. 'Ibrahim called us that morning. He said the situation was dire and that dozens of terrorists had reached the base. He told us he was protecting the female lookouts. In our culture, the least one can do is protect women and daughters. I know exactly the kind of man I raised — Ibrahim was a man of values who would use his own body to shield others,' he said, his pride mixed with grief. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hassan added that his son was a traditional, observant man who prayed regularly. Ibrahim came from a Bedouin family, many of whom volunteered to serve in the IDF. Hassan noted that his son spoke to the terrorists in Arabic, trying to convince them to leave the female lookouts alone in the name of Islam. 'Those who carried out the October 7 attack are a disgrace to Islam. Their behavior is despicable and unacceptable; it shames every true Muslim,' he said. Regarding the recommendation to award his son the Medal of Valor, Hassan said: 'Ibrahim was extraordinary. That morning, he asked us to take care of his wife and children. He already understood it was the end. He is deserving of the medal; he is a war hero.' The Medal of Valor was last awarded in 2007 to six soldiers who fought in the Second Lebanon War. Since the founding of the state, it has been awarded a total of 220 times. Only two soldiers have received the medal twice: Oved Ladizhinsky, who was killed by shielding a fellow soldier from a grenade explosion and saving his life, and former IDF Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyhif0gjje	2025-03-03T01:21:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/BJfkLIgAcke/BJfkLIgAcke_0_0_1177_1102_0_small.jpg
Eli Sharabi's fight for freedom	Comment: 'Eli Sharabi is no ordinary man. In fact, he truly is one of a kind' After 491 days—that's 16 months—in Hamas captivity, released hostage Eli Sharabi is finally free. But his ordeal is far from over. In his first courageous interview since his release, he recounts the horrors he endured—the relentless beatings, the psychological terror, but above all, the starvation. Sharabi, a 52-year-old man, returned from captivity weighing just 44 kilograms. His body is weak, but his spirit remains unbroken. U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly watched Sharabi’s emotional and gut-wrenching testimony on Israeli television and has invited him to the White House. Despite his fragile condition, his brother Sharon—who has fought relentlessly for his release since his abduction on October 7—says this is a critical moment for the hostages still in Gaza. And so, the two will attempt the journey to Washington. After watching the full-length interview, one thing is certain: Eli Sharabi is no ordinary man. In fact, he truly is one of a kind. He survived brutal captivity in Gaza. His wife and two daughters were murdered by Hamas. His brother Eli died in captivity. His home was destroyed. And yet, somehow, he still finds the strength—to be grateful, to speak, and to fight. Not for himself, but for those still left behind.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wfb11qsje	2025-03-03T01:16:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/SJbld8oKJl/SJbld8oKJl_0_164_1575_887_0_small.jpg
Ramadan in Gaza: A holiday overshadowed by war	Palestinian resident of Gaza: 'This year, we have no homes, no money—we have exhausted all means of life' In Gaza’s Khan Younis, residents are struggling to uphold Ramadan traditions amid the devastation of war. Markets still offer food and drinks, but the usual festive atmosphere is absent. 'Before the war, we would sit together at one table, sharing meals with neighbors, young and old. But this year, we have no homes, no money—we have exhausted all means of life,' said Palestinian resident Abu Salah Madi. Israel and Hamas are currently in a fragile ceasefire, which has resulted in the release of 33 Israeli hostages and 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli negotiators have arrived in Cairo in hopes of extending the truce, prioritizing further hostage releases. West Bank Tensions Amid Ramadan In the West Bank, Ramadan preparations are subdued. Markets that would typically be bustling ahead of the holiday are seeing fewer shoppers, as vendors cite increased security restrictions. 'In past years, the markets were packed with people, eating and drinking with ease. But now, the situation is completely different,' noted vendor Amir Amireh. Jerusalem on High Alert At Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, preparations are underway for an influx of worshippers. The Waqf has installed protective coverings in the courtyards, but tensions remain high. The site has been a frequent flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, raising concerns over potential clashes. With Ramadan beginning this weekend, both Palestinians and Israelis brace for a volatile period. Will the ceasefire hold, or is another escalation imminent? The coming days will determine the answer.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhwybmj1x	2025-03-03T01:11:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/S1xgdcNGokg/S1xgdcNGokg_0_284_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Russia foils Islamist attack against 'Jewish religious institutio...	A terrorist planning suicide bombings at a Jewish religious institution and a Moscow metro station was killed in a gunfight with Russian Federal Security Service agents; Authorities revealed he intended to join a terrorist organization in Afghanistan after carrying out the attacks The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) announced on Monday morning that it eliminated a terrorist who had planned to carry out suicide bombings at a 'Jewish religious institution' in the Moscow area as well as at a metro station in the capital. According to the Russian news agency RIA, the terrorist was killed after a gunfight, during which he opened fire at FSB agents who came to arrest him. According to Russian authorities, the terrorist was a Russian citizen but was born in one of the Central Asian countries. He allegedly had planned to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to target a Jewish religious institution in the Moscow area and one of the city's metro stations. He had conducted reconnaissance missions and acquired the necessary components for the attacks. His plan was to carry out the bombings and then travel to Afghanistan to join an international terrorist organization. During a search of the terrorist's apartment, weapons and materials used for making IEDs were found. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a video released by the FSB Monday morning, the body of the Islamist terrorist is shown along with his handgun and components for an improvised bomb. Additionally, the footage displayed messages found on the terrorist’s phone, which included instructions on how to assemble an explosive device. The RIA news agency reported that Russian security agencies have heightened their vigilance around Jewish institutions in recent months due to tensions in the Middle East and concerns over potential antisemitic attacks. Russia has been under constant threat of attacks by ISIS and other jihadist organizations. Last spring, the country experienced its deadliest attack in two decades when ISIS terrorists targeted a concert hall in the suburbs of Moscow, killing 145 people and injuring more than 180. It was the deadliest ISIS attack on European soil. Efforts to target Jewish institutions in Russia remain a constant threat, and last year Russia announced the prevention of several such attacks. For example, on March 7, 2024, Russia claimed it had thwarted an ISIS attack on a synagogue in Moscow. Three months later, in June, terrorists carried out a combined attack in Dagestan, targeting synagogues and churches. They slit the throat of a priest and killed 19 other police officers and civilians. Six terrorists were killed in a 'gunfight that lasted through the night,' while others were arrested. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhnllqi1l	2025-03-03T00:59:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/ryflGbkmjJe/ryflGbkmjJe_0_48_337_190_0_small.jpg

Ahead of Trump meeting, Netanyahu apologizes to freed hostage Eli...	Ahead of freed hostages' White House meeting with US President Donald Trump, prime minister spoke with Sharabi, whose wife, daughters and brother were killed, apologizing for the delay in contacting him and emphasizing efforts to secure his release. Sharabi, who is traveling to Washington with other freed hostages to meet U.S. officials, urged urgent action to bring home the remaining hostages, both the living and the dead Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Eli Sharabi, a survivor of Hamas captivity whose wife and two daughters were murdered on Oct. 7 and whose brother was killed while being held hostage. The conversation took place a day before Sharabi’s scheduled meeting at the White House with U.S. President Donald Trump. 'I’m sorry it took us so long,' Netanyahu told Sharabi, emphasizing the government’s efforts to secure his release. Sharabi responded: 'The other hostages must urgently be brought home.' Netanyahu told Sharabi he had tried to contact him 10 days earlier, but only now had they been able to coordinate a call. 'I welcome your return home,' Netanyahu said. 'I know that you are enduring difficult days. My wife and I would like to console you on your terrible loss – of Lianne, Noiya and Yahel, and your brother Yossi. I understand the magnitude of the loss; this is awful. I want you to know that I regret that it took us such a long time. We fought hard to get you out; your brother and the entire family fought hard. Sharon was in close contact with me the entire time..' Netanyahu added: 'I tried to speak with you about 10 days ago and I am pleased that it is happening now. I greatly appreciate the bravery with which you have told about what you endured, and it is very important that you also tell this to President Trump. I wish you a successful trip, and when you return, I would be pleased for us to meet, when it is possible. We embrace you will all our hearts.' Sharabi told Netanyahu: 'I am very happy to be home and be reunited with my family. The other hostages, certainly the living, urgently need to return home to their families. And of course, the deceased hostages, including my brother Yossi, must be brought back for burial in Israel so their families can cry over their graves. I thank you for your efforts in this direction. Sharon and I will make our efforts with President Trump, and maybe with our joint efforts we will bring this saga to a close.' Netanyahu responded: 'That is the goal. I want you to know we are not letting up, not for a moment, even as we speak.' Alongside Sharabi, several other freed hostages — including Omer Shem Tov, Iair Horn, Keith and Aviva Siegel, Doron Steinbacher, and Naama Levy — are traveling to Washington for meetings with U.S. officials, including President Trump. The visit is organized by the Hostage Families Forum and Hostage Aid Worldwide. 'The freed hostages will personally thank the Trump administration for the president’s unwavering commitment to securing the release of all hostages and will testify firsthand about the horrors of Hamas’ tunnels,' the families’ forum said in a statement. 'U.S. officials will hear directly about the urgency of bringing all hostages home immediately and in one coordinated effort.' 'Eli is overwhelmed by the response' Osnat Sharabi-Matalon, the sister of Eli and the late Yossi Sharabi, said in an interview with Ynet that Eli was surprised by the outpouring of support following his interview on the Israeli television program 'Uvda.' 'Our family, on the other hand, is not surprised. We’ve been living with this for a year and a half and understand the magnitude of the situation,' she said. Osnat noted that Eli sees the meeting with Trump as an opportunity to express his gratitude for securing his release and to stress the importance of timing. Asked whether he was surprised that the invitation came from the U.S. president rather than Netanyahu, she replied: 'I don’t think he sees it that way. He’s not surprised it was Trump and not Bibi. He’s more surprised by the warmth and support he’s received. He says, ‘I just told my story.’ He did it for Alon Ohel, who’s still there. He feels very close to him, like a father.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the meeting with Trump, she said, Eli plans to first and foremost thank the president, just as he does with everyone he meets. 'He always says thank you and gives a hug — that’s who Eli is,' she said. Additionally, he will share his story in the hope of highlighting the urgency of bringing the remaining hostages home. 'I believe that’s enough for him to understand the need to rescue those still alive,' she said. Osnat emphasized her deep concern for the other hostages still in captivity.

After surgeries, Emily Damari says scars, missing fingers symboli...	Former hostage held captive by Hamas for 471 days endured horrific conditions and severe injuries; After complex surgeries, she advocates for the immediate release of other hostages, including her friends, and expresses gratitude to world leaders for their support About a month and a half after being released from Hamas captivity, Emily Damari has completed a series of complex surgeries on her hand and leg to treat injuries sustained on October 7. Damari, who survived 471 days under horrific conditions, lost two fingers after being shot twice by Hamas terrorists and was treated in captivity with nothing more than a single expired bottle of iodine. On the morning of October 7, 28-year-old Emily was in her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza when a large number of terrorists attacked the community, murdering 62 residents and abducting 19 others. She was shot at close range in her left hand and right leg, leading to the loss of two fingers and injuries to her leg that impaired her ability to move. Before undergoing surgery at Sheba Medical Center, Emily shared her feelings with her characteristic optimism: 'I have embraced my hand, my pain and my scars entirely. To me, they symbolize freedom, hope and strength.' A photograph of Emily's bandaged hand has become an emblem of inspiration for many people worldwide. After the surgery, she said: 'The surgery on my hand and leg went much better than expected, thanks to the expertise and professionalism of the surgeons at Sheba Medical Center. I want to thank the surgeons, nurses, and staff at the hospital for the amazing care I received.' She added: 'My recovery will take time, and my hand will never fully heal, but the intense pain that accompanied me for a year and a half, due to nerve stitching during my first surgery at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, is no longer there. The large scar, caused by an open, infected wound that didn’t heal for four months due to the conditions in the tunnels where I was held, now looks much better. After recovery, with the help of physiotherapy, I hope to use my hand much better than I could before the surgery.' Mandy Damari, Emily’s mother, revealed that her daughter was 'stitched up like a pincushion' by Hamas, leaving her in severe pain in her hand and leg. Despite the severity of her injuries and the high risk of infection, Hamas provided no medical treatment other than an expired bottle of iodine. 'It’s nothing short of a miracle that she didn’t develop a life-threatening infection,' her mother said. While Emily was held in Gaza, Mandy spent months appealing to world leaders and human rights organizations to secure humanitarian and medical assistance for the hostages. In a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer last month, Mandy and Emily emphasized that, in reality, Emily received no assistance and was held in 'cruel and horrifying' conditions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite her suffering, Emily is now focusing her attention on the struggle to bring the remaining hostages home: 'Although my injuries weren’t simple, I know there are others still in captivity in worse physical and mental conditions. All hostages must come home immediately, without any further delays.' Two of the remaining hostages are Emily’s close friends from Kibbutz Kfar Aza — twin siblings Gali and Ziv Berman. During the attack, Gali rushed to Emily because she was alone, and the two were abducted together. Emily urged world leaders to keep pressuring Hamas. 'I want to thank President Trump again for securing the deal that brought me home. Please, help us bring Gali, Ziv, and all the other hostages home before it’s too late for everyone,' she said. After her release, Emily and her mother Mandy thanked the British Prime Minister for his personal support during her captivity. They revealed that Hamas held Emily in a school belonging to UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency) in Gaza, among other locations. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has already contacted UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini regarding Emily’s claims about her time in Gaza. Starmer also invited Emily and Mandy to visit 10 Downing Street on their next trip to the UK. The two are looking forward to seeing family, friends and supporters in the UK who fought for her return — including fans of Tottenham Hotspur, the football club she supports. 'After I recover from the surgeries, and after the remaining hostages are freed, I’ll be so excited to return to the UK. There are so many people I want to thank personally for helping me get my life back,' Emily said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ptw4zo1g	2025-03-02T22:28:48-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/SJERH0RZsyx/SJERH0RZsyx_0_984_1688_951_0_small.jpg
Israel believes Hamas will refuse to release more than a few host...	Senior Israeli officials say if fighting resumes it would be intense and include targeted killing of senior members of the terror group who are stealing aid but security cabinet has yet to approve a return to war Senior Israeli officials estimate that Hamas will not agree to release more than a few live hostages and the bodies of other hostages until Israel commits to ending the war. The officials who spoke to the New York Times said the stalemate in negotiations would compel Israel to decide between renewing the fighting and saving the hostages who are still alive. The officials said that the Security Cabinet has not yet approved a new offensive and that only U.S. President Donald Trump could convince Netanyahu not to renew the war. They said that if the offensive is renewed, it would be widespread and intense and would include the targeted killing of senior members of Hamas who are stealing humanitarian aid and the destruction of Hamas government sites. The mediator in the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas asked the Israeli government to wait a few days before renewing the offensive in the hopes that they would be able to reach an agreement with Hamas that would prevent further war. Israeli officials said on Sunday that they believe chances are slim, although Hamas may agree to some hostage releases. 'We are waiting to see what happens in the coming days. We will not let this drag on,' security officials said. After blocking humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza, Israel is considering further steps, including a stop to the supply of water to the Strip. However, only 19% of Gaza's water comes from Israel. 'They will manage without it and have done so in the past,' the officials said. Israel also can attack infrastructure targets from the air to damage the supply of electricity, including generators. Netanyahu thanked Trump on Sunday 'for his unwavering support for Israel.' In a video clip, referring in English to the Witkoff outline that Israel had accepted but Hamas rejected, which Israel says was proposed by Trump's special Mideast envoy. 'In Witkoff's plan, half of the hostages would be released right away and other half would be released if we reach an agreement on a permanent cease-fire. Israel has accepted this plan, I have accepted this plan, but so far Hamas has rejected it.' He said Hamas' demands were 'totally unacceptable.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We know that America and President Trump have our back,' he said. 'Hamas steals the supplies and prevents the people of Gaza from getting it. It uses these supplies to finance its terror machine, which is aimed directly at Israel and our civilians.' Netanyahu also warned that other steps would be taken if Hamas continued to hold the hostages. The Israeli officials estimated that a return to fighting was not expected in the coming week, partially because the government wants to allow the new IDF Chief of Staff to assume his position on Wednesday. Israel is also waiting for the visit of U.S. envoy Brett McGurk, who is due to arrive on Thursday and whom the officials hope may be able to advance the talks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rju0mcmijx	2025-03-02T22:19:24-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/ByE8ISsOke/ByE8ISsOke_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Houthis eye renewed attacks as damage caused by Israeli airstrike...	Amid stalled hostage negotiations, senior Houthi officials threaten missile and drone strikes against Israel if Gaza war resumes; Recent satellite images on Google Maps, however, reveal destruction at Yemen's Hodeidah port following Israeli airstrikes Senior Houthi figures have once again stated that they are preparing to resume missile and drone launches toward Israel due to the Israel-Hamas stalemate over the continuation of a hostage deal and the potential reignition of armed conflict between the sides. But they might want to check out Google Maps first, considering the current state of their port following Israeli airstrikes. Recent updates to Google Maps provide a remarkably clear view of the heavy damage to the port of Hodeidah, including its fuel facilities and petrochemical infrastructure. Satellite images vividly capture the extensive destruction inflicted on Yemen, particularly at the Hodeidah port. Israel has targeted the Houthis in Yemen five times during the ongoing conflict. The most recent strike occurred on January 10. The initial attack took place on July 20, 2023, followed by additional strikes on September 29, December 19 and December 26. The port of Hodeidah was repeatedly hit in these airstrikes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Sunday, senior Houthi official Nasser al-Din Amer issued a warning on his X account: 'Our eyes are on Gaza, our hands are on the trigger, and our missiles, drones and all military units are on high alert. The directive from our leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, is clear.' Another Houthi official, Hazem al-Assad, added that American interests could also become targets. 'If the war in Gaza resumes, we are ready for a full-scale war against U.S. interests in the region, should the United States attempt to defend Israel, support its aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza, or attack our nation.' On Friday, during his near-weekly speech, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi also issued threats, specifically referencing Israel’s decision not to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor. 'The enemy’s refusal to withdraw from Rafah represents a serious breach of the agreement,' he said. 'If the war in Gaza resumes, the entire Zionist entity, starting with Tel Aviv, will be under fire. We will intervene and provide support through various military means.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hywryazj1e	2025-03-02T22:11:12-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/ryETtSfjyx/ryETtSfjyx_0_23_964_543_0_small.jpg

Pope Francis off mechanical ventilation entirely	Pope Francis remained in stable condition and didn't need any mechanical ventilation Sunday, the Vatican said. It was a sign that he had overcome the possible complications from a respiratory crisis Friday and that his breathing function overall was improving as he recovers from pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope did continue to receive high flow supplemental oxygen after Friday's coughing episode, which sparked fears of a new lung infection. Doctors in their late Sunday update said Francis remained stable but again referred to the complexity of his overall condition and kept his prognosis at guarded, meaning he wasn't out of danger. Francis, who has been in the hospital since Feb. 14, rested, prayed in his private chapel and participated in Mass after a morning visit from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra. The content of their talks wasn't known, but even when at the Vatican, Francis meets at least weekly with them.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjzqdngijl	2025-03-02T20:00:59-08:00

Freed hostages head to White House to meet with Trump	Eli Sharabi, who lost his wife and daughters on Oct. 7; Omer Shem Tov, released from captivity last Saturday; Iair Horn, whose farewell with his captive brother filmed by Hamas; and Aviva and Keith Siegel, whose video shared by US president, will travel to Washington Five Israelis recently freed from captivity in Gaza are set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The group includes Iair Horn, whose brother remains a hostage, and Keith Siegel, an American citizen held for 484 days. Sharon Sharabi, brother of Eli Sharabi who was released after 491 days in captivity, said Sunday that Trump invited them after watching Eli’s emotional testimony in a TV interview. 'Tomorrow morning, we're flying to the White House, and the meeting will take place on Tuesday,' Sharon told Ynet. 'This is the call of the hour,' he said, stressing the importance of the meeting amid stalled negotiations for the release of remaining hostages. The freed hostages will travel to Washington on Monday aboard the private plane of billionaire philanthropist Miriam Adelson. Joining Sharabi, Siegel and Horn are Omer Shem Tov, and Siegel’s wife, Aviva, who was also held in Gaza and released in a hostage deal in November 2023. Several others will accompany them. Shem Tov was released last Saturday, while Horn was freed a week earlier. On Saturday, Hamas released a video showing Horn saying goodbye to his brother, Eitan, who remains in captivity. Their mother, Ruth Strom, said Sunday that Horn had hidden the video from the family to protect them. 'Iair didn’t tell us they filmed them... but I knew something like this would happen,' she told Ynet. The video shows the brothers embracing after 498 days in captivity. Eitan Horn has now been held for 513 days. 'There’s no time to waste,' Strom said, explaining why the family agreed to release the footage. 'Everyone needs to see it, to know, and to feel what all of our hostages are going through. Even those who are no longer alive deserve a proper burial.' After his release, Shem Tov returned home to Herzliya, where thousands of Israelis welcomed him. Supporters held signs reading, 'Welcome back, hero' and 'Omer is back.' Leaving Rabin Medical Center, Shem Tov wore the jersey of Brazil national soccer team legend Ronaldo—the same shirt he had on when he was abducted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His brother, Amit, described the moment he embraced him: 'We’re over the moon. There’s no greater happiness than this. Omer is home. It’s like he’s been born again.' For Siegel, this is not his first interaction with Trump. Last week, he sent a video message to the president, which Trump later shared on his social media platform, Truth Social. Filmed in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where Siegel was abducted on October 7, the video shows the devastation left by Hamas. 'I am now standing in front of a house in Kfar Aza, the kibbutz where I live,' Siegel said. 'You can see the enormous destruction left by Hamas in the October 7 massacre.' He urged Trump to continue efforts to secure the release of remaining hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1zjdbgs1l	2025-03-02T13:52:55-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/rylFGGGsyl/rylFGGGsyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Ukraine's Zelensky says he can salvage relationship with US	Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday he believed he could salvage his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump after their explosive meeting in the Oval Office, but that talks needed to continue behind closed doors. In an extraordinary meeting that was broadcast live on Friday, Trump accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for U.S. aid, of showing disrespect to his country and of risking World War Three, casting into doubt Washington's ongoing support for Ukraine. Zelensky, talking to reporters after a summit with European leaders in London on Sunday, said he did not think the U.S. would stop its assistance to Ukraine, because as 'leaders of the civilized world' they would not want to help Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, Zelensky said he remained prepared for any challenges that may arise.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skr00i8gjje	2025-03-02T13:27:46-08:00	
The technician accused of offering Israel's nuclear secrets to Ir...	Doron Bokobza, 29, a technician from Be'er Sheva, is accused of offering sensitive information on the Dimona nuclear reactor to Iranian intelligence; the indictment claims he sent photos, videos and data, falsely claiming access to classified sites for payment He completed the National Technician Training Program, worked as a technician at a chemical factory — and offered to sell Iran information about the Dimona nuclear reactor. Doron Bokobza, 29, a resident of Be'er Sheva and a technician by trade, is accused of initiating contact with the Islamic Republic and offering to sell its agents information, including claims that he had 'access to the Nuclear Research Center' in Dimona. The indictment filed against him accuses him of contact with a foreign agent and transferring information to the enemy. In an article published last year about students at the Technological College for Technicians in Be'er Sheva who completed the same National Technician Training Program, Bokobza was one of the interviewees. He then said: 'From the moment I graduated from the college in July 2023, I was signed to a contract as an employee in the Instrumentation and Control department of Haifa Negev Technologies. I am currently a candidate for the only position in the country as the instrumentation manager of the new ammonia facility.' On his Facebook page, Bokobza shared, among other things, a post by former national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, titled 'I Accuse,' and shared: 'I joined the struggle to save the Negev. As part of the struggle, the Barel Patrol is being established with the approval of the Israeli police, a patrol of volunteer fighters that will operate in the Negev to restore security to the residents. To establish the unit, we are conducting a crowdfunding campaign to purchase auxiliary equipment. I have taken upon myself a fundraising goal, and I would be happy if you could join. Any amount is welcome.' MK Almog Cohen of Ben-Gvir's hard right Otzma Yehudit party, who served as chairman of the Committee to Save the Negev, which Bokobza joined, claimed in response he's never heard of him. Since October 7, Bokobza has published several posts calling for the release of Noa Argamani—a former hostage abducted from the Nova music festival during the October 7 terrorist attack and later rescued in a daring operation—and her partner Avinatan Or, who is still held captive. In one of the posts, he wrote about his acquaintance with them: 'Noa Argamani, where were we eight years ago? Smiling and laughing. Where were we five years ago, on some remote mountain in Bolivia. I rented a motorcycle, and you trusted me enough to climb a steep hill and photograph you looking at the Amazon River. Ah, Noa, how hard it was for me to see your abduction with Avinatan, my friend! A man I looked up to as a savior for me. Noa and Avinatan! I’m waiting for you! Return soon, safe and sound!' Bokobza was arrested last month as part of a joint operation by Israel Police's serious crimes unit and the Shin Bet security agency after being suspected of contacting Iranian agents and carrying out missions under their direction in exchange for financial compensation. The investigation revealed that Bokobza maintained contact with Iranian intelligence agents for several months and carried out security-related missions under their guidance, including photographing sensitive sites and transferring information. Speaking to his Iranian handler, Bokobza claimed to have access to the Nuclear Research Center in Dimona and provided open-source information related to the facility. According to the indictment, Bokobza 'initiated the contact, fully aware that he was in communication with an Iranian handler and that his actions could harm national security.' Bokobza, a former bailiff, contacted Iranian operatives via Telegram, reaching out to profiles displaying Iran’s national flag. From December until his arrest in February, he maintained contact with an Iranian agent, carrying out various tasks under the agent’s direction. As part of the operation, he opened a digital wallet, which received approximately $850 in cryptocurrency deposits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In December, Bokobza messaged an Iranian agent in Hebrew, writing, 'I am Israeli, and I want to work with you.' The agent later responded in English, asking about his motives. Bokobza cited financial struggles and dissatisfaction with the government. The agent then instructed him to prove his loyalty by filming himself on the street while making a specific hand gesture. Later that day, Bokobza filmed himself driving through Be'er Sheva, making a 'V' sign with his fingers. After sending the video, the Iranian agent transferred $65 to his digital wallet. Days later, the agent instructed him to film and photograph supermarket products—dairy items, fruits, vegetables and their prices—in exchange for $130. Bokobza then sent the agent an unexpected message: 'You will not defeat us. The people of Israel live!' Shortly after, Bokobza received another message from the same Iranian-linked profile, urging him to cooperate. 'Work with us, we want to give you a lot of money. You will have a happy life without worries,' the message read. He initially deleted the message and blocked the profile but later resumed contact. In further exchanges, Bokobza falsely claimed to be an electronics engineer working at a classified facility. He sent the Iranian agent a Wikipedia screenshot detailing the Nuclear Research Center in Dimona. The agent responded with repeated messages, offering substantial financial rewards for his cooperation. Bokobza later proposed meeting the agent abroad. Bokobza sent the Iranian agent a photo of a communication cabinet, claiming it was a key component 'responsible for the heavy water.' The agent then requested an explanatory video. In exchange, Bokobza received $650 in cryptocurrency. After learning about the arrests of two IDF reservists, accused of endangering national security over similar ties to Iranian handlers, Bokobza deleted his communications with the agent and blocked the profile. He later reversed the block and messaged the agent, writing, 'Hey, sorry I blocked you, it’s just that two soldiers who worked with you were caught, so I preferred to delete everything.' In 2021, Bokobza voiced strong criticism over what he saw as the lenient treatment of convicted terrorists in Israeli prisons. 'I served in the army, I was a combat soldier—three of the best years of my life! I pay taxes, they take from my hard-earned salary! And someone who murdered, who never paid taxes, who didn’t serve in the army (at least not the IDF), gets three kilograms of meat a week of their choice, a PlayStation and a premium TV package that rivals the best of Yes [a local satellite television provider]. I’m ashamed,' he wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1npkgzi1e	2025-03-02T13:02:29-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/H13AflMsJg/H13AflMsJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Amid cease-fire end and Hamas’ refusal to extend talks, incoming IDF chief Eyal Zamir summons top commanders to Southern Command; White House backs Israel’s halt to Gaza aid, saying it negotiated 'in good faith' and will support its next steps Incoming IDF chief of staff Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir summoned on Sunday senior military officials to Southern Command for a meeting on Friday. The gathering, set to take place two days after Zamir takes over as Israel’s top military officer on Wednesday, comes as Israel prepares for a potential resumption of fighting against Hamas following stalled hostage negotiations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a halt to humanitarian aid to Gaza earlier Sunday after Hamas refused to extend the cease-fire or accept a negotiation framework proposed by U.S. mediator Steve Witkoff. Netanyahu defended the decision to cut off aid, insisting Hamas will not receive 'free meals' and that the cease-fire cannot continue without additional hostage releases. The decision, made in coordination with the United States, has drawn criticism from Hamas and Arab states, including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said Washington supports Israel’s move. 'Israel has negotiated in good faith since the start of this administration to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas terrorists. Given Hamas’ declaration that it is no longer interested in extending the cease-fire, we will support Israel’s next steps,' he said. According to Al Jazeera, Israel had proposed a cease-fire framework before halting aid in which Hamas would release five living hostages and the remains of ten others in exchange for Palestinian prisoner releases and increased humanitarian assistance. Hamas reportedly rejected the offer, insisting that no further hostage releases would take place without advancing to a second phase of negotiations, which it says must include an end to the war. Egypt sharply criticized Israel’s decision, with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty accusing it of imposing a policy of starvation. 'Humanitarian aid cannot be used as a weapon for collective punishment and starvation in Gaza,' he said at a press conference alongside European Commissioner for the Middle East Dubravka Šuica. He urged Brussels to increase pressure on Israel to uphold the cease-fire terms. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1dsxszskx	2025-03-02T12:09:36-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BkM11k6VT00Jl/BkM11k6VT00Jl_0_0_1334_750_0_small.jpg

UK's Starmer says Europe at 'crossroads in history' as leaders ag...	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rallied his European counterparts Sunday to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia's war. 'Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,' he said. Starmer's exhortation to 18 fellow leaders that they need to do the heavy lifting for their own security comes two days after U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy when President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said he wasn't grateful enough for America's support. The meeting had been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding. Starmer used the opportunity as part of his broader effort to bridge the gap between Europe and the U.S. and also salvage what had seemed like the start of a peace process before Friday's spat. Starmer said he had worked with France and Ukraine on a plan to end the war and that the group of leaders—mostly from Europe—had agreed on four things. The steps toward peace would: keep aid flowing to Kyiv and maintain economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine's hand; make sure Ukraine is at the bargaining table and any peace must ensure its sovereignty and security; continue to arm Ukraine to deter future invasion.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkqugrgo1x	2025-03-02T11:41:30-08:00

Israel among nations invited to Russia’s May 9 Parade in Moscow, along with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas; Kremlin says will not invite leaders of 'unfriendly states,' including Ukraine, Germany, France and others Russia has released its list of invited nations for its annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany. The event, a significant fixture in Russia’s political calendar, will take place in Red Square on May 9. Amid Israel’s ongoing efforts to maintain ties with Moscow, Israel has been invited to attend, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not expected to participate. Instead, Israel will be represented by its ambassador to Russia, Simona Halperin. In comments to Russian media, Halperin emphasized Israel’s historical stance, saying, 'Historical facts do not change due to geopolitical or other circumstances. In 2017, the Israeli Knesset decided that May 9 would be recognized as Victory Day.' In contrast, Russia has opted to exclude a long list of nations it deems 'unfriendly,' withholding invitations from leaders of Germany, Ukraine, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, France, Czechia and Estonia. Leaders from Australia, Andorra, the United Kingdom, San Marino, Monaco, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Japan were also not invited.

Russia jails five for 2023 anti-Israel airport riot in Dagestan	Local court sentences Dagestan residents to up to 10 years in prison for their roles in the violent October 2023 riot at Makhachkala Airport, where an anti-Israel mob stormed the terminal searching for passengers arriving from Tel Aviv Five residents of Dagestan were sentenced to prison for their roles in the violent riot targeting Israelis at Makhachkala Airport in October 2023. They received prison terms ranging from eight to 10 years. The defendants—Ramazan Abdulabakov, Ismail Amirov, Yasin Gadzhiev, Magomedali Omarov and Magomedgadzhy Chirgilaev—were found guilty of 'participating in mass riots involving violence and pogroms' and 'failing to comply with transportation safety regulations at transport infrastructure facilities.' The riot took place on October 29, 2023, amid the war in Gaza. Hundreds of rioters stormed the airport looking for passengers arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. The airport was temporarily shut down and damages exceeded 24 million rubles ($270,000). Thirty security personnel and police officers were assaulted, with 23 injured.

After ignoring alerts ahead of October 7, IDF continues to downpl...	Internal report shows 88% rise in reservist complaints in 2024 over service conditions, commander misconduct, pay issues; also details harassment of female soldiers, verbal and physical abuse and claims of political bias in dismissals The ongoing war has created significant new challenges for the IDF, and in some areas, it has struggled to address them. Among the concerns are the service conditions of reservists—many of whom left their civilian lives to defend the country—as well as those of female surveillance soldiers, whose critical role was underscored by the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack. A report released Sunday by military ombudswoman Brig. Gen. (res.) Racheli Tevet-Wiesel found that complaints from reservists surged 88% last year. In total, 6,777 complaints were filed with the ombudsman's office in 2024, an 18% increase from 2023. The report, which was submitted to the defense minister and the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, found that 55% of the complaints investigated were justified. Some complaints came from soldiers serving as lookouts, including those assigned to crucial intelligence positions. One soldier serving on the Egyptian border reported that while handling a security incident, her battalion’s deputy commander entered the command center and yelled: 'Which surveillance soldier spoke to me? She’s delusional,' and referred to her as a 'confused girl' and a 'total mess.' The complaint alleged that the officer later told her commander, 'If I were you, I’d give her two slaps.' According to the investigation, the officer had been frustrated with the soldier’s response time during the incident. He later explained that his comments were made in the heat of the moment out of concern for the troops’ safety. Following the incident, the battalion commander reprimanded him, emphasizing the need for respectful communication. The ombudsman wrote that the officer’s behavior was 'severely flawed,' adding, 'A commander must act and speak in a respectful and restrained manner toward subordinates and set a personal example, regardless of dissatisfaction with their performance.' The report noted that the officer apologized and that no further intervention was deemed necessary beyond informing his superiors. Concerns over lookout safety Since the Oct. 7 attack, which saw dozens of soldiers serving as lookouts killed and others abducted by Hamas, many female recruits have requested not to be assigned to these positions. Some conscripts, even before starting their training, refused to serve in the surveillance unit and were detained at an IDF induction center. Complaints from those held in detention described harsh and degrading treatment by officers in the recruitment unit. The ombudsman noted that most of these complaints were not fully investigated because the soldiers withdrew them after being released. However, she raised the issue with the commander of the recruitment unit at the time. Following a review, the unit decided to assign more experienced reserve officers to oversee detentions and ensure appropriate treatment. Additionally, parents of surveillance soldiers expressed concern over their daughters being stationed in border outposts, arguing that their proximity to conflict zones placed them in unnecessary danger. Parents of soldiers serving near the northern border complained that, unlike in other regions, surveillance posts in their area had not been relocated further inland for safety reasons. The division commander met with concerned parents, explaining the necessity of keeping surveillance troops near the frontlines to support field operations. He assured them that additional security and protective measures were being implemented to enhance their safety. Rise in complaints over abuse and harassment The report highlighted a sharp rise in complaints about commanders’ behavior, particularly from conscripts, who described harsh treatment and degrading language. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Some allegations involved physical violence and threats. Complaints included incidents of commanders kicking and choking soldiers, slapping a soldier in the face and making threats such as, 'I’m about to put a bullet in your head.' One soldier reported being humiliated when his head was forcibly shaved in front of others. In some cases, the military police and prosecution were involved, while in others, senior commanders addressed the issues internally. One female soldier complained that a senior noncommissioned officer insulted her, saying, 'You should dye your hair blonde because you’re stupid.' The officer later admitted to making the remark, apologized and explained that it was said in frustration over her performance. The ombudsman reprimanded him and ordered that the incident be documented in his personal file. Another complaint came from the parents of combat soldiers who said their sons' platoon commanders verbally abused them. One commander, who was later dismissed, allegedly called his troops 'traitors' and ordered them out of their tent, telling them, 'Get the hell out, you deserve this.' Another officer reportedly warned his soldiers to stay away from those he labeled 'traitors.' The involved commanders were disciplined, receiving detention as punishment. In a separate case, a team commander was reported for routinely insulting his troops, calling them 'losers,' 'weaklings' and other derogatory names. He was reprimanded by his superiors, and a discussion on appropriate leadership was held with the unit. Mistreatment over political views Among the numerous complaints from reservists, one stood out: A soldier claimed he was dismissed from his unit not for his political activism. The reservist, who had participated in anti-government protests in 2023, alleged that his company commander used a minor infraction as a pretext for his removal, primarily due to his political views. The ombudsman’s inquiry found that the official reason for the dismissal was cited as a serious disciplinary issue. However, she noted that the commander inappropriately referenced the reservist’s political affiliations during their conversation about his removal. While the investigation determined that the commander did take disciplinary action against others for similar infractions, the ombudsman stressed that political disputes should be defused early to prevent them from escalating into harmful exchanges. Reservists report issues with payment and service record The report also addressed a surge in complaints about reservist pay. Many reservists reported discrepancies in their service records that affected their compensation. The ombudsman attributed the issue to administrative overload, unit transfers and a lack of communication between military departments. Specific complaints included unpaid standby duty, incorrect records of reserve days, incomplete compensation for reservists on extended active duty and delays in reimbursement for travel expenses. The ombudsman found that failures in coordination and a lack of familiarity with regulations had contributed to these issues, which affected the financial entitlements of many reservists. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyniiszjjg	2025-03-02T08:47:58-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/B1s84U0t1e/B1s84U0t1e_0_203_2500_1408_0_small.jpg

What’s next in Gaza? Israel weighs renewed Gaza offensive amid Eg...	Israel suspends Gaza aid after Hamas rejected US-backed proposal to extension cease-fire and release hostages in phases; Netanyahu warns Israel would not allow cease-fire without hostage releases, while Egypt condemns aid cutoff and calls for renewed talks Israel’s decision to suspend humanitarian aid to Gaza and adopt a cease-fire framework drawn up by U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Wittkoff, followed failed negotiations with Hamas, according to reports in Arab media on Sunday. Al Jazeera reported that before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the aid cutoff, Israel proposed releasing five live hostages and ten bodies in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners and increased humanitarian aid. Hamas reportedly refused the offer. Behind the scenes, discussions took place between Israel and mediators, with the aid suspension reportedly coordinated with the U.S. According to the report, Israel demanded in the past 48 hours that Hamas release more hostages, both live and deceased, to extend the first phase of the deal and lay the groundwork for the second. Hamas, however, insisted it would not release additional captives without progress toward Phase II—widely understood to include an end to the war. Hamas considers these new demands a violation of the original agreement and remains committed to its initial terms. Addressing the aid suspension, Netanyahu told his Cabinet that Hamas would not receive 'free meals' and that he would not allow the cease-fire to continue without the release of more hostages. Meanwhile, Egypt strongly condemned Israel’s move, with its foreign minister accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon. 'Humanitarian aid cannot be used as a tool for collective punishment and starvation in Gaza,' said Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. Speaking alongside European Commissioner for the Middle East Dubravka Šuica at a press conference, Abdelatty called on Brussels to apply 'greater pressure' on Israel to uphold the cease-fire agreement’s terms. Netanyahu told his Cabinet that Israel’s decision to adopt Wittkoff’s proposed framework was made in full coordination with Washington. The plan calls for extending the temporary cease-fire by 50 days, through the end of Ramadan and Passover, and releasing all hostages in two phases—half at the start and half at the end—if terms for ending the war are agreed upon. Netanyahu said Wittkoff described his proposal as a 'corridor to negotiations for Phase II,' and stressed, 'Israel is ready for that.' Netanyahu dismissed claims by media analysts that Israel is violating the original cease-fire deal with Hamas, arguing that negotiations for a permanent truce were supposed to begin on the 16th day of Phase I but have not yet taken place. 'Under the original agreement, Israel is allowed to resume fighting after day 42 if it determines negotiations are ineffective,' he said, adding that this clause was backed by a side letter from the previous U.S. administration and supported by the Trump administration. Despite this, he said, 'we accepted Wittkoff’s plan because we are committed to bringing our hostages home.' However, Netanyahu said Hamas has so far rejected the framework. 'If Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately enter negotiations to implement it,' he said. He warned that Israel would not allow an indefinite cease-fire without hostage releases: 'There are no free meals. If Hamas thinks it can continue the cease-fire or enjoy Phase I conditions without returning hostages, it is gravely mistaken.' Addressing Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid to Gaza, Netanyahu accused Hamas of hijacking incoming supplies. 'Hamas is seizing all goods sent to Gaza, abusing the population, shooting at civilians trying to access aid and turning humanitarian relief into a terror budget against us. We will not tolerate this.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu also issued a veiled threat, saying, 'If Hamas remains entrenched in its position and refuses to release our hostages, there will be further consequences—which I will not elaborate on here.' Despite Netanyahu’s tough rhetoric, some Cabinet ministers said they did not get the impression Israel was eager to resume fighting, following a security briefing during the meeting. 'I don’t think Hamas is interested in fighting right now, and I don’t think we are either—not in the immediate term,' one minister told Ynet. However, ministers also noted that Hamas appeared unlikely to accept the Wittkoff framework. When asked about next steps after cutting humanitarian aid, officials indicated that electricity and water supplies to Gaza could be targeted next, but no specific decisions were detailed. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes continued in Gaza on Sunday in response to violations of the cease-fire by Hamas, the IDF said. Palestinian health officials reported four deaths from the strikes, bringing the total number of fatalities during the 42-day cease-fire to 116, according to Hamas-run health authorities. The IDF confirmed one of the strikes targeted suspects planting explosives near Israeli forces in northern Gaza, saying, 'The Air Force eliminated the suspects to neutralize the threat. The IDF will continue to act against any threat to Israeli citizens and its forces.' Palestinians also reported injuries from an airstrike on an apartment in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan neighborhood. Meanwhile, Egyptian officials, quoted by the Qatari newspaper The New Arab, said Cairo attempted to broker a compromise between Israel and Hamas. The proposal calls for extending the cease-fire by two weeks—far shorter than the 50-day extension proposed by Wittkoff and supported by Israel. In exchange, Israel would receive three living hostages and the bodies of three others. According to Egyptian sources, an Israeli delegation was expected to arrive in Cairo for talks on the proposal, though Israeli officials later denied any such plans. 'The report of an Israeli delegation traveling to Cairo today is incorrect. We have not received an Egyptian proposal,' an Israeli official said. However, a separate report by Al Jazeera was not explicitly denied. Egyptian Foreign Minister Abdelatty reiterated his condemnation of Israel’s suspension of humanitarian aid to Gaza, vowing to push forward negotiations on the next phase of the cease-fire agreement. 'All remaining commitments under the agreement must be implemented, and negotiations for Phase II must begin,' he said, while acknowledging that 'political will is needed to move forward.' Early Sunday, following the formal end of the first phase of the hostage deal, Israel halted all humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza and closed the border crossings. Netanyahu’s government approved the decision overnight amid stalled negotiations and Hamas’ refusal to accept the Wittkoff framework. Humanitarian aid had been a key pressure tool for Israel throughout the war and is particularly critical during Ramadan. However, Israeli officials view the current aid freeze as largely symbolic, noting that Hamas has stockpiled supplies after receiving 25,200 aid trucks during the cease-fire. According to Israeli estimates, the terrorist group has enough provisions to last at least four months. Water is still being supplied to Gaza’s desalination plant, officials confirmed. The Prime Minister’s Office justified the aid suspension by citing Hamas’ rejection of further hostage releases under the proposed U.S.-backed deal. 'With the end of Phase I of the hostage deal and Hamas’ refusal to accept the Wittkoff framework, which Israel agreed to, Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided to halt all aid deliveries to Gaza. Israel will not allow a cease-fire without hostage releases. If Hamas continues to refuse, there will be further consequences,' the statement read. The previously unknown Wittkoff framework, which Israel officially adopted after Netanyahu’s overnight discussions, proposes extending the cease-fire for 50 days—through the end of Ramadan and Passover. Under the plan, half of the remaining hostages in Gaza, both living and deceased, would be released at the beginning of the extension, with the rest freed on the final day if a permanent cease-fire agreement is reached. According to Israeli estimates, Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist groups currently hold 59 hostages, 35 of whom have been declared dead by Israel. Of the remaining 24, officials believe 22 are still alive. Hamas swiftly rejected the proposal. In a statement to Al Arabiya, the group said: 'Wittkoff’s plan to release half of the hostages is skewed in favor of Israel’s vision. It contradicts the Gaza cease-fire deal brokered by the U.S.' Palestinian Islamic Jihad also dismissed the proposal, accusing Netanyahu of 'choosing a policy of starvation over honoring the cease-fire agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdcpwfije	2025-03-02T08:20:36-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/ByclPibs1l/ByclPibs1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Just two days after Zelensky clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump and cut his Washington visit short, the Ukrainian leader was welcomed in London by world leaders, who hugged him in turn, and pledged their backing. Starmer said Europe needed to meet a once-in-a-generation challenge. 'Getting a good outcome for Ukraine is not just a matter of right and wrong, it is vital for the security of every nation here and many others, too,' Starmer said at the beginning of the meeting flanked by Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron. 'Today's meeting is to unite to discuss how to deliver a just and enduring peace together and to make sure Ukraine can defend and protect against any future Russian attack.'

Lawmakers vote to remove Abdolnaser Hemmati over currency’s sharp decline and soaring prices of basic goods; supporters warn removal amid US sanctions could worsen instability, while opponents say he prioritized lifting sanctions over mitigating their impact Iran's parliament voted on Sunday to remove the country's Economy Minister Abdolnaser Hemmati from office over mismanagement of the economy and a plunging national currency, state media reported. The parliament has ousted Hemmati in a no confidence vote almost eight months after President Masoud Pezeshkian appointed his cabinet. Over the eight-month period, Iran’s currency has lost close to half of its value against the U.S. dollar, according to unofficial websites, such as alanchand.com. The Iranian rial now trades at 927,000 to the U.S. dollar, against 595,500 in August of last year. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Parliamentarians opposing Hemmati argued that he had failed to prevent price increases in basic goods such as medicine, food and housing while being unable to control the foreign exchange market, state media said.

This was opposed by MPs who believe Tehran should focus on 'neutralizing' sanctions. Hemmati's supporters said it was not the right time to remove the economy minister as Iran remained under U.S. sanctions and replacing him would cause further instability, according to state media. The economy is the top challenge for Iran's ruling clerics, who fear a revival of protests by lower and middle-income communities angry at growing poverty that have erupted since 2017.

Israel mulls extending service for reserve troups as renewed war ...	As Hamas rejects a cease-fire extension, government to debate prolonging emergency reservist mobilization allowing call up of up to 400,000 troops The government will convene on Sunday to discuss extending the emergency order allowing the IDF to call up reservists against the backdrop of Hamas' refusal to extend the first phase of the hostage and cease-fire deal. The order was first approved on October 10, 2023, and has been renewed multiple times throughout the war. The proposal stated that, like 2024, the year 2025 is expected to be a year of war, with ongoing instability in various combat zones — even in areas currently under cease-fire. 'In light of the continued war and the IDF’s personnel needs, it is proposed to approve the order allowing the continued mobilization of reservists under Tzav 8 (emergency call-up) for an additional three months,' the document read. The proposed order, which would remain in effect until May, would authorize the mobilization of up to 400,000 reservists. According to the draft resolution, the measure would 'allow reservists currently on active duty to continue serving as required for combat and operational needs until their release date is determined. Additionally, it would enable the recruitment of additional reservists to replace and refresh those previously called up.' Alongside the military draft proposal, the government is also set to discuss the approval of coalition funds. On Saturday, Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf issued a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing the government of violating coalition agreements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The letter, addressed to Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs under the subject line 'Violation of Coalition Agreements,' referred to a February 23 meeting in Netanyahu’s office where Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich reportedly agreed with leaders of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism and Shas parties to allocate NIS 1 billion ($270 million) for religious institutions, including funding for exempt schools (which are not subject to state curriculum requirements) and an additional NIS 60 million ($16 million) for public institutions via the Welfare Ministry. 'Contrary to what was agreed upon, we were surprised to see that these commitments are not reflected in the budget proposal being submitted to the government,' Goldknopf wrote. Meanwhile, tensions persist over the conscription exemption law for ultra-Orthodox men, which remains unresolved. Leading rabbis are holding discussions to form a unified stance, but no consensus has been reached, prolonging the crisis. The combination of stalled budgets and the ongoing draft exemption dispute has increased friction between ultra-Orthodox parties and the prime minister’s office. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjp5wazoke	2025-03-02T04:40:11-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/06/SyHtMztZJl/SyHtMztZJl_375_330_1049_591_0_small.jpg

Breakaway Abkhazia's acting leader wins presidential election, st...	The acting leader of Abkhazia has won a presidential election in the breakaway Georgian region, state media said on Sunday, months after his predecessor was driven from office following protests over an investment deal with Russia. Acting President Badra Gunba took almost 55% of the vote in Saturday's election in the Russia-backed territory, ahead of opposition leader Adgur Ardzinba on just under 42%, Abkhazian state news agency Apsnypress reported, citing preliminary results from the electoral commission. Georgia, of which Abkhazia is recognised as being part of by all but a handful of countries, called the election 'another flagrant violation of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity'. In footage published by state media, Gunba thanked voters and said he would work to make Abkhazia 'independent, free and prosperous'.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxpjrbijx	2025-03-02T04:23:33-08:00	
Israeli charged with offering Iran ‘access’ to nuclear research s...	Authorities say engineer Doron Buchbaza, 29, initiated contact, shared publicly available details, and carried out tasks for payment in crypto over months An Israeli engineer has been indicted for allegedly initiating contact with Iranian intelligence and offering to sell classified information, including claims of access to Israel’s nuclear research facility. Doron Buchbaza, 29, a Be’er Sheva resident and engineer at Haifa Chemicals South, was charged Sunday with contacting a foreign agent and transferring information to an enemy, according to an indictment filed by state prosecutors at the Be’er Sheva District Court. He was arrested last month in a joint operation by Israeli police and the Shin Bet security agency. Investigators say Buchbaza established contact with Iranian intelligence through Telegram, messaging profiles displaying the Iranian flag. 'I am an Israeli and I want to work with you,' he wrote according to the charges. From December until his arrest in February, he allegedly carried out various tasks for his Iranian handler, including photographing sensitive sites. He also falsely presented himself as having access to the Negev Nuclear Research Center and provided publicly available details about the facility. Authorities allege Buchbaza initiated the contact, fully aware that he was engaging with Iranian intelligence operatives and that his actions could harm national security. At the request of his handler, he filmed himself making a hand gesture on a Be’er Sheva street and later took videos of supermarket prices, earning small payments in cryptocurrency. The indictment states he later escalated his activities, offering to meet his handler abroad and sending a photo of a communications rack, falsely claiming it was linked to a nuclear facility. After learning of the arrest of two Israeli IDF soldiers in the reserves accused of similar offenses, Buchbaza reportedly deleted his exchanges with the Iranian handler, only to reestablish contact later. At one point, he warned his handler of an pending Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, claiming he had inside knowledge. Shin Bet and police issued a joint warning following Buchbaza’s indictment, urging citizens not to engage with unknown foreign contacts, particularly those linked to enemy states.

'Israeli security agencies will continue to identify and thwart Iranian operations and will ensure those involved face the full extent of the law.' The case is one of several in recent months involving Israeli citizens, including reservists, allegedly recruited by Iranian intelligence in exchange for payment. Some cases have led to indictments, while others remain under investigation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1bfqrzs1x	2025-03-02T04:16:52-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/06/15/rJPMEKSdD2/rJPMEKSdD2_180_161_924_521_0_small.jpg
One wrong move could seal their fate': Hostage families speak ou...	Families shocked by developments, fear for loved ones after Israel halts humanitarian aid and goods into enclalve, warning talks deadlock risks captives' lives Hours after the first phase of the hostage deal expired, families of captives expressed growing concerns for their loved ones, fearing that stalled negotiations and escalating tensions could put them at greater risk. Their fears were amplified by Hamas’ refusal to accept a U.S.-backed framework for extending the cease-fire in exchange for the immediate release of half of the remaining hostages. The situation became even more uncertain after Israel, with U.S. backing, announced it was halting humanitarian aid to Gaza. According to Al Jazeera, the decision followed an Israeli demand for Hamas to release five living hostages and the bodies of 10 others in exchange for increased humanitarian assistance—an offer the group rejected. The announcement came as a shock to many families, who fear their loved ones could be harmed by the breakdown in negotiations. 'Everything is fragile, freigtning and dangerous' For Merav Gilboa Dalal, whose son Guy Dalal remains in captivity, the uncertainty is overwhelming. She learned about the aid suspension during a live interview with Israeli media. 'I need to process what you just told me,' she said. 'Everything is so fragile, frightening, and dangerous. This is very difficult to hear.' Her anguish was compounded by a video Hamas released a week earlier, showing her son alongside another hostage, Evyatar David, watching one of the earlier hostage releases. 'The longing for Guy, especially after that horrifying video, is unbearable,' she said. 'We hold onto hope. We know Guy will come home—that belief is what carries us through.' Dalal described her son as 'a symbol of someone abducted from a festival of peace and love' and accused Hamas of psychological torment. 'In the video, they made it seem like they were about to be released, only to take them back underground. It was meant to break them mentally. But it’s moving to see the bond formed among the captives—they are truly looking out for one another.' The uncertainty has also shaken Maccabit Meir, the aunt of kidnapped brothers Gali and Ziv Berman. 'We are in a bottomless pit. Everything is volatile, fragile. In a split second, this nightmare could take an irreversible turn for Gali, Ziv, and all the others left behind,' she said. Meir referenced testimony from former hostage Eli Sharabi, who described his captivity in a recent television interview. 'His courage, his superhuman strength—he survived and returned from hell. His testimony must be aired constantly, in the Knesset, in the media. This is the reality for everyone still held captive.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She also voiced concerns about Israel’s priorities. 'I fear that the hostages are no longer the government’s top priority. I want to believe that phase two of the deal will move forward. I want to believe negotiations will continue. I can’t even fathom a return to fighting now—it would seal their fate.' Red Cross defends role amid criticism The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has played a key role in facilitating hostage releases, has faced increasing scrutiny over its actions. 'We are a neutral and non-political organization. We interpret events based on international law,' said Gilad Grossman, the Red Cross' spokesperson in Israel. 'Our mission is to assist civilians in conflict zones.' Addressing Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid, Grossman said, 'Humanitarian aid saves lives. We have repeatedly spoken about the urgent need for it. While we are not in a position to determine whether this constitutes deliberate starvation, there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.' One of the primary criticisms against the ICRC has been its failure to secure access to the hostages, who are reportedly being held in dire conditions. 'We have not been able to reach the hostages in Gaza,' Grossman admitted. 'We have consistently declared that they must be released unconditionally. The Red Cross has been trying for more than 500 days to gain access to them, to allow them contact with their families and to provide medical care. We do not conduct these efforts publicly. But the reality is clear—we have not succeeded.' Grossman also rejected accusations that the Red Cross has equated the Israeli hostages with Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. 'At no point did we attempt to create symmetry between the two sides,' he said. 'Those who are released have rights, and their dignity must be respected, but we never equated the two situations.' Regarding Alon Ahel, an Israeli hostage reportedly suffering from a severe eye injury, Grossman was unequivocal. 'He should not be there at all. His detention is a violation of international law. We continue to work to gain access to him and the other hostages.' Since the war began, Grossman said, 'more than 140 individuals have been released through our facilitation. This is humanitarian work at the most extreme level, and we will continue until the last hostage is home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s11qdp11ske	2025-03-02T03:59:20-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/01/BkehesRlikl/BkehesRlikl_0_83_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Released hostage tried to spare family of heartrenching separatio...	Ruth Strom whose son Iair returned from captivity and his younger brother remained in Gaza says she expected their parting to be difficult, released horrific video posted by Hamas for all to see and understand what the hotages are enduring Ruth Strom, whose son Iair Horn was released from Hamas captivity while his brother Eitan remains in Gaza, said Sunday that Iair never told the family about the Hamas video showing their forced separation. The footage, released Saturday, shows the brothers embracing before Iair’s release two weeks ago, after 498 days in captivity, while Eitan remains imprisoned — now for 513 days. 'Iair didn’t tell us they filmed them. He wanted to protect us, but I knew something like this would happen. From the start, I knew they were together. I imagined their goodbye,' Strom told Ynet in an interview. When asked why the family agreed to the video’s publication, she said there was no hesitation. 'Everyone needs to see and know what our hostages are going through. They need to see that so many of them are still alive and must be brought home. There’s no time. Even those who aren’t alive deserve a proper burial so their families have a grave to visit.' She described her son’s appearance in the footage: 'I thought Eitan would be thinner, but he looks okay overall — it’s all a show. I saw his wounds from his illness, the one he had before he was taken. This is not the place for him. It’s not the place for anyone.' 'Every time they cut humanitarian aid, they take away the little that our hostages still have,' the mother said after Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid to Gaza on Sunday. 'I would have done things differently, asked for other things but what I want most is my Eitan and all the hostages home. They must do everything. This happened on their watch, they abandoned us and they must bring them all back — now.' She vowed to continue fighting for their release. 'I’m not stopping. I don’t know where I find the strength but somehow, someone is watching over me.' Strom added Iair, now back in Israel, is in good health but struggling emotionally. 'He won’t be able to heal until Eitan is here.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Hamas video features several hostages, including Iair and Eitan Horn, as well as Sagui Dekel-Chen, who was released with Iair. Two other hostages’ faces were blurred but one was identified as Nimrod Cohen by his tattoo. In the video, Eitan says: 'I’m happy my brother is being freed tomorrow but separating families is inhumane. Get everyone out. Don’t destroy our lives. I don’t even know how I’m speaking calmly right now. 'My brother is leaving and I’m staying behind, hearing that you don’t want to proceed with the next phase [of the hostage deal]. Are you insane? What have you been doing for a year and a half? How many more people have to die? Sign the deal. Stop the war, stop the death, stop destroying lives.' 'I eat and drink sometimes. I’m okay, but I’m not okay,' he added. 'Hamas is keeping me alive, but that’s enough — get me out. Get us all out. I can’t stay here. Enough. [Benjamin] Netanyahu, if you have a shred of a heart, sign the deal today.' He then turns to his brother Iair before their forced separation: 'Tell Mom, tell Dad, tell everyone to keep protesting. Don’t stop until the government signs the second phase and gets us all home. Do everything.' Iair responds: 'You’re telling me to leave my little brother here to die?' It should be noted Hamas is known to coerce hostages into making statements as part of its psychological warfare strategy against Israel. The Horn family issued a statement following the video’s release: 'Our hearts are breaking seeing Eitan in this horrific situation — watching his brother gain freedom while he remains trapped in Hamas’ hell after 512 days. You can see the despair and fear in his eyes.' 'Since Iair came home, he hasn’t stopped thinking and fighting for Eitan and the other hostages left behind. We demand that decision-makers look Eitan in the eyes and not stop the deal that has already brought dozens of hostages home. Time has run out. Bring them all back — now, in one phase.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj3v7nzije	2025-03-02T03:56:24-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/01/SyZLN4iljkl/SyZLN4iljkl_274_23_1647_928_0_small.jpg

People carrying flags come out as funeral procession makes its way to Kibbutz Kissufim; 85-year-old Shlomo Mansour taken by Hamas terrorists in handcuffs during the massacre Former Israeli hostage Shlomo Mansour was being laid to rest on Sunday following the return of his body from Gaza as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. Thousands of Israelis attended his funeral procession carrying Israeli and yellow flags symbolizing the hostages remaining in Hamas' hands. Mansour, 85, was the oldest hostage held in Gaza. He was kidnapped on October 7 from his home in Kibbutz Kissufim, when terrorists took him and handcuffed him. His wife Mazal begged for her life and managed to escape. About two weeks ago, the kibbutz announced that it had been informed by the IDF that Shlomo had been murdered on October 7 and his body taken into Gaza.

Disgraced NY governor eyes mayoral race, cheered by pro-Israel vo...	Andrew Cuomo launches a bid for mayor, directly challenging Eric Adams and positioning himself as the leading pro-Israel candidate in a race where support for the Jewish state has become a defining issue Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, has officially thrown his hat into the ring for the city’s mayoral race, marking an audacious comeback attempt three years after stepping down in disgrace. His entry not only shakes up the race against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams but also provides a potential lifeline for pro-Israel voters, who had grown increasingly uneasy about Adams’ sinking approval ratings and the alternatives in the Democratic primary. Cuomo, long known for his aggressive political style, is stepping into a field where support for Israel has become a significant dividing line. As governor, he positioned himself as a staunch ally of the Jewish state, visiting Israel three times while in office and signing an executive order in 2016 barring New York from doing business with entities that support the BDS movement. He reinforced this stance in 2019 when he ordered the World Trade Center to be illuminated in blue and white in honor of Israel’s Independence Day. More recently, he founded the 'Progressives for Israel' group, calling himself 'Shabbos goy' and explicitly challenging what he sees as a waning commitment to Israel among left-leaning Democrats. 'The Shabbos goy can do the work that benefits both the Jewish community and the non-Jewish community to speak out first and loudest against antisemitism', Cuomo said. Cuomo’s deep ties to New York politics stretch far beyond his own career. He is the son of the late Mario Cuomo, who served as governor of New York for three terms and was revered for his progressive vision and powerful oratory. His brother, Chris Cuomo, is a former CNN anchor who was fired after revelations that he advised the governmor during his sexual harassment scandal. Despite these controversies, the Cuomo name still carries significant weight in New York’s political landscape, especially among older Democratic voters who remember Mario Cuomo’s legacy fondly. By contrast, some of Cuomo’s leading opponents in the race have taken a more critical stance on Israel. Among them is NYC Comptroller Brad Lander, a progressive Jewish Democrat who has consistently voiced opposition to Israeli policies and has aligned himself with the city’s left-wing activists. Lander supported early cease-fire calls following the October 7 attacks and previously backed efforts to distance New York from corporations with ties to Israeli settlements. Another rising candidate, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, has gone even further, openly endorsing the BDS movement and leading efforts to cut state funding to charities linked to West Bank settlements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Mamdani's rhetoric following the October 7 massacre in Israel has alarmed Jewish leaders, who view his candidacy as a direct threat to the city’s traditionally strong support for the Jewish state. Other candidates include Scott Stringer, the former city comptroller whose 2021 mayoral bid was badly hindered by allegations of sexual misconduct. Stringer, a Jewish politician with deep ties to Manhattan’s Upper West Side, has tried to rebuild his reputation and remains a formidable presence in the race. Meanwhile, Brooklyn State Senator Zellnor Myrie is running as a progressive reformer, focusing on issues of racial justice and economic inequality. Though Myrie has not been as vocal as Lander or Mamdani on Israel, he has aligned himself with left-wing coalitions that have grown increasingly critical of the Jewish state. For Adams, who has consistently branded himself as a friend of Israel and a defender of the city’s Jewish population, Cuomo’s entry into the race is a serious problem. The incumbent mayor’s tenure has been marred by declining public trust, federal corruption investigations, and increasing dissatisfaction over crime and housing costs. While Adams remains popular in certain Orthodox Jewish communities that played a crucial role in his 2021 victory, his political troubles have left many in the pro-Israel camp searching for a viable alternative. Cuomo is now positioning himself as that alternative. His campaign is expected to double down on his credentials as a law-and-order moderate and a steadfast supporter of Israel. He has already secured the endorsement of Rep. Ritchie Torres, one of the most vocal pro-Israel Democrats in Congress, who framed Cuomo as a necessary counterbalance to what he calls 'radical elements' in the party. The challenge for Cuomo, however, is that his past remains a political minefield. His resignation in 2021 followed multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denies. He also faced criticism for his administration’s handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes, an issue that still lingers in the minds of many voters. Some in the Orthodox Jewish community, in particular, have not forgotten how his restrictions on religious gatherings during the pandemic disproportionately affected their neighborhoods. Yet, in a field where Adams is weakened and the alternatives include candidates with anti-Israel track records, Cuomo’s bid may resonate with voters who prioritize a strong pro-Israel stance. If he can successfully rebrand himself as the best option for the city’s sizable Jewish electorate, he may not only survive the political comeback attempt but reshape the race entirely. The battle for City Hall is now a high-stakes contest not just for New York’s future, but for the broader fight over Israel’s standing within the Democratic Party. With Cuomo in the race, the city’s pro-Israel voters may find themselves with a powerful, if controversial, champion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywhldzi1l	2025-03-01T23:29:46-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2017/06/02/7819610/7819610_1_49_980_552_0_small.jpg
Border control strike shuts down Allenby Crossing without warning	Border controllers from the Population and Immigration Authority have unexpectedly shut down the Allenby border crossing on Sunday. As a result of the surprise strike, the crossing was completely closed, halting all passenger traffic. The Israel Airports Authority issued a statement expressing its protest over the sudden strike by the Border Control Workers’ Union of the Population and Immigration Authority, which violated agreements made with them last Friday and unilaterally closed the Allenby crossing without any prior notice.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r10uiq11oje	2025-03-01T23:28:16-08:00

Israeli general dismisses rumors of imminent Egyptian military th...	Brig. Gen. Itamar Ben Chaim reassures residents living near the border with Egypt amid concerns over reported military buildup in Sinai Brig. Gen. Itamar Ben Chaim, commander of the IDF's 80th Division said there is no threat of war with Egypt. The general met with residents living near the Israeli-Egyptian border and sought to dispel concerns over unverified reports suggesting that Egypt was preparing for an attack from the Sinai Peninsula, adding that that the IDF was not making preparations for it. 'The scenario in which the Egyptian army launches an attack in this area— we are not preparing for it because we do not believe it is a realistic scenario in the immediate future,' Ben Chaim said in recordings obtained by ynet. His remarks come as the IDF investigates the sources behind widespread rumors that Egypt’s military is conducting large-scale exercises in Sinai ahead of an alleged surprise attack on Israel. Addressing these claims for the first time, Ben Chaim firmly rejected them. The 80th Division, responsible for securing Israel’s border with Sinai, operates under the constraints of the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which limits Egyptian military presence in the peninsula unless Israel grants special permission, such as for operations against ISIS or tunnel destruction near Gaza. During the meeting, one resident confronted Ben Chaim, drawing parallels to the intelligence failures exposed in recent investigations into the October 7 Hamas attack, particularly regarding gaps between enemy capabilities and intentions. Notably, Egypt has significantly bolstered its military capabilities in recent years. Ben Chaim acknowledged these concerns but emphasized the importance of Israel’s peace agreement with Egypt. 'You should take an interest in the agreement,' he said, explaining that Israel must allocate military resources across multiple fronts, including the West Bank, Lebanon, Gaza, and Jordan. 'We assess the threats we face. I do not believe that an attack, as described here, will occur in the near future, meaning in the coming years. If such a decision is made, we will know how to prepare.' Despite Ben Chaim’s reassurances, activists criticized the IDF’s approach, accusing it of ignoring a potential threat. 'The IDF is taking serious risks at the expense of residents and dismissing the clear danger before our eyes,' the group Otef Yisrael Forum, representing hundreds of residents in Israeli communities near Gaza, said in a statement. They pointed to recent remarks by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, who reportedly warned that Egypt’s posture could shift rapidly and that Israel is closely monitoring the situation. 'The military must listen to the public rather than dismiss our concerns,' the statement continued. 'Before October 7, our warnings were ignored, and we were fed false security assumptions that led to disaster. The minimum demand should be for Egypt to withdraw its forces from northern Sinai.' Rumors about a potential Egyptian military buildup, despite the peace treaty, have been spreading in recent weeks, particularly among right-wing circles and online forums, fueling unease among Israelis. Adding to the controversy, Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., Yehiel Leiter, made a rare public statement last month, accusing Egypt of violating the peace agreement. 'Egypt is building offensive military bases, and we have turned a blind eye for a long time. But this continues. It is a clear violation. This is an issue we will bring to the table in the near future,' Leiter said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A video of his remarks was swiftly removed from the internet, without confirmation or denial from Israel’s Foreign Ministry, but not before it drew criticism from Cairo. The IDF has yet to respond to the matter.

He further stated that 'halting the entry of aid means Israel has decided to starve the residents of the Gaza Strip.

In a statemnt government says move comes after Hamas refuses to accept the Witkoff framework for continuting negotiations; the decison was made in coordination with the United States ; Hamas say Israel decides to starve people of Gaza Israel on Sunday stopped the supply of humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip and closed all border crossings. The decision by the government came hours after the first phase of the cease-fire agreement with Hamas expired amid a crisis in the talks to extend it and bring about the release of more hostages held by the terror group. 'With the completion of the first phase of the hostage deal and in light of Hamas's refusal to accept the Witkoff framework for continuing negotiations—which Israel had agreed to—Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be halted,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement.

Eli Sharabi held hostage for 491 days recounts in interview the struggle of captives to survive, says was bound in chains, starved and subjected to physical violence by Hamas U.S. President Donald Trump has invited freed hostage Eli Sharabi to the White House, his brother Sharon Sharabi said Sunday. The invitation came after Trump watched an interview on Israel's Channel 12 Ovda program, in which Sharabi spoke about his captivity and his hope for the release of the remaining hostages. 'We are flying on Monday for a meeting with the president on Tuesday,' Sharon Sharabi said. 'It is the vital, present need,' he added, as cease-fire talks remain stalled and 59 hostages are still held in Gaza. Sharabi was held by Hamas for 491 days. After his release, he learned that his wife and two daughters were murdered in the Oct. 7 massacre and that his brother, Yossi, died in captivity. Sharabi was released last month along with Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami. Their condition, having lost so much weight, alarmed Israelis and prompted an angry reaction from the president and other top administration officials. 'They looked like Holocaust survivors,' Trump said. In the interview, Sharabi recalled how he and his wife chose not to resist their captors to protect their daughters. While in captivity, he was led to believe his family had survived. Only upon his release did he learn the tragic truth.

He was held alongside three other captives, including Alon Ohel, who remains in Hamas custody. Sharabi said Ohel, much younger than him, was suffering from his injuries. Their forced separation when Hamas released Sharabi was especially painful, but he promised Ohel he would fight for his freedom.

Rubio signs declaration to expedite delivery of $4 billion in mil...	Since taking office the Trump admiinistration approved nearly $12 billion in military aid to Israel; Secretary of State says using emergency authority to expedite the delivery U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday he had signed a declaration to expedite delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel. The Trump administration, which took office on January 20, has approved nearly $12 billion in major foreign military sales to Israel, Rubio said in a statement, adding that it 'will continue to use all available tools to fulfill America's long-standing commitment to Israel's security, including means to counter security threats.' Rubio said he had used emergency authority to expedite the delivery of military assistance to Israel to its Middle East ally, now in a fragile ceasefire with Hamas militants in their war in Gaza. The Pentagon said on Friday that the State Department had approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs, demolition kits and other weaponry to Israel. The administration notified Congress of those prospective weapons sales on an emergency basis, sidestepping a long-standing practice of giving the chairs and ranking members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees the opportunity to review the sale and ask for more information before making a formal notification to Congress. Friday's announcements marked the second time in recent weeks that President Donald Trump's administration has declared an emergency to quickly approve weapons sales to Israel. The Biden administration also used emergency authority to approve the sale of arms to Israel without congressional review. On Monday, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era order requiring it to report potential violations of international law involving U.S.-supplied weapons by allies, including Israel. It has also eliminated most U.S. humanitarian foreign aid. The January 19 Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement halted 15 months of fighting and paved the way for talks on ending the war, while leading to the release of 44 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel. Hours after the first phase of the agreed ceasefire was set to expire, Israel said early on Sunday it would adopt a proposal by Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods. Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, casting doubt over the second phase of the deal meant to include releases of additional hostages and prisoners as well as steps toward a permanent end of the war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyjxwdbojx	2025-03-01T20:18:27-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/SJ7EjcP19Je/SJ7EjcP19Je_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israel backs US cease-fire plan for Ramadan and Passover, accuses...	Proposal put forward by Witkoff calls for release of half remaining hostages upfront and rest if permanent truce reached; 'If Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately engage in negotiations to finalize the Witkoff framework' Israel has agreed to a cease-fire proposal put forward by Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, which calls for a temporary truce during Ramadan and Passover, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced late Saturday. Under the plan, half of the remaining hostages—both living and deceased—would be released on the first day. If negotiations lead to a permanent cease-fire, the remaining hostages would be freed by the deal’s conclusion. According to Netanyahu’s office, Witkoff proposed the framework after assessing that the gaps between Israel and Hamas remain too wide for an immediate resolution to the war and that additional time is needed for negotiations. 'While Hamas has repeatedly violated past agreements, Israel has not breached any terms,' the statement said, adding that Israel retains the right to resume military operations after 42 days if it deems negotiations ineffective. 'If Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately engage in negotiations to finalize the Witkoff framework.' Despite Israel’s agreement to the proposal, an Israeli official said the country is 'closer to resuming military action than to securing a cease-fire.' The official stressed that no truce would proceed without further hostage releases. Israel is expected to give negotiations a few more days before considering a return to combat operations, with Netanyahu’s government awaiting Witkoff’s arrival in the Middle East later in the week after a delay in his planned visit. Meanwhile, the IDF has begun preparations for a potential return to fighting, increasing readiness along the Gaza border and deploying additional forces to strategic locations. The IDF is also preparing for a renewed ground offensive, with combat divisions training for urban warfare against Hamas’ remaining infrastructure, including tunnels, explosive-laden streets and fortified strongholds. Military officials have cautioned the government that any renewed offensive would need to be conducted with constraints, given intelligence indicating that dozens of Israeli hostages remain in specific areas of Gaza. Both sides, according to analysts, have entered a tense standoff over who will make the next move—whether negotiations will resume or hostilities will reignite.

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told Qatar’s Al-Araby network that 'there is currently no negotiation regarding a second phase, and Israel bears full responsibility.' He accused Israel of seeking to recover hostages while maintaining the option to resume attacks on Gaza and of 'evading a commitment to ending the war and fully withdrawing from the Strip.'

Israel strengthens ties with Russia in bid to curb Turkish influe...	Jerusalem deepening security coordination with Moscow while working to curb Turkish influence in post-Assad Syria; amid rising tensions, Netanyahu authorizes military action against jihadist forces and urges Moscow to pressure Hamas for hostage talks As tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky escalated to unprecedented levels on Friday, Israel is quietly reassessing its own strategic partnerships. Ynet has learned that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dispatched his military secretary, Maj. Gen. Roman Gofman, to Moscow in recent days for a series of security and diplomatic meetings aimed at strengthening cooperation while safeguarding Israel’s strategic interests. Gofman, who returned from Moscow on Friday, is considered one of Netanyahu’s closest advisors—particularly given the prime minister’s strained relations with outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, whom Netanyahu has threatened to dismiss. Gofman has also been sent on similar secret missions to other locations in recent weeks. Israel’s stance on Syria is becoming increasingly clear: it prefers Russian influence over Turkey’s expanding foothold and is actively working to curb Ankara’s involvement. One key objective of the Moscow meetings was to urge Russia to pressure Hamas—through intermediaries—to advance negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages. Among those still held captive in Gaza is Maxim Herkin, a dual Israeli-Russian citizen. Israel is also deeply concerned about hostile actors consolidating power in post-Assad Syria. Netanyahu has already ramped up pressure, publicly demanding the demilitarization of southern Syria. According to Reuters, Israel is urging the U.S. to ensure Syria remains 'weak,' including by allowing Russia to maintain its military bases there—effectively countering Turkey’s efforts to forge a security alliance with Syria’s new ruling power. Israel seeks to block Turkish-Syrian military pact Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to host Syria’s new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, leader of the jihadist rebel factions that toppled Assad. Their discussions are set to focus on establishing Turkish military bases, training Syria’s reconstituted armed forces, and securing the country’s airspace. Israel views these developments as a direct threat and is working to thwart them, preferring Russian dominance in Syria over Turkish influence. During an IDF officers’ graduation ceremony last week, Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s military presence in key areas of Lebanon and Syria. 'We demand the full demilitarization of southern Syria from forces of the new regime. We will also not tolerate any threats to the Druze population in southern Syria,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu also declared that Israeli forces would remain stationed at Mount Hermon and the buffer zone for an indefinite period to safeguard Israeli communities and deter emerging threats. 'We will not allow forces of HTS [Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the now-defunct jihadist group led by Sharaa] or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' he said. Within 24 hours of Netanyahu’s remarks, the IDF launched airstrikes on Syrian military positions in Syria. Defense Minister Israel Katz later confirmed the strikes, saying: 'The Air Force struck forcefully in southern Syria as part of our new policy to demilitarize the region.' He added, 'Our message is clear: We will not allow southern Syria to turn into another southern Lebanon. We will not jeopardize our citizens’ security.' Despite its security coordination with Moscow, Israel harbors no illusions about the Kremlin’s allegiances. Russia maintains a strategic alliance with Iran, including backing Tehran’s civilian nuclear program, and has recently adopted a pro-Hamas stance. Since October 7, Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to condemn Hamas for its attack on Israel, instead blaming Israel’s settlement policies and later accusing Jerusalem of committing 'massacres against Palestinians.' Meanwhile, Israel has refrained from offering full support to Ukraine, despite Ukrainian President Zelensky’s vocal backing of Israel following the Hamas onslaught. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyzr6ybj1g	2025-03-01T11:40:40-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/01/SJ8amTlike/SJ8amTlike_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel warns Syria against attacking Druze as tensions simmer nea...	Netanyahu and Katz warn Syrian regime against attacking minority as fighting rages in Jaramana, vowing IDF action if Druze harmed; Israel delivers aid to Druze in Quneitra Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a rare warning to the Syrian government on Saturday, vowing to retaliate if it harms Druze residents in the city of Jaramana, about five miles from Damascus. 'We will not allow the extremist Islamist regime in Syria to harm the Druze. If the regime harms them, it will face consequences from us,' Netanyahu and Katz said in a joint statement. The two leaders said they had instructed the IDF to prepare and deliver a strong warning to Damascus. 'We are committed to our Druze brothers in Israel and will do everything necessary to protect their relatives in Syria,' they added. Jaramana, a mixed Druze-Christian city near Damascus, is in a vulnerable position. Unlike the Druze stronghold of Sweida in southern Syria—where the community is more independent and armed—the Druze of Jaramana lack the ability to defend themselves. Israel has closely monitored the situation, concerned that Syria’s new leadership could test the Druze population’s standing, making it a red line for Jerusalem. Earlier on Saturday, Syrian reports indicated that the IDF had facilitated the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Druze village of Khadr in Syria’s Quneitra province. The aid, organized by Israel’s Druze religious council, was partially delivered, with more expected to follow. The packages are designated for villages near the Israeli border, with additional shipments planned for other areas. Meanwhile, Syrian reports detailed clashes between security forces and Druze groups in Jaramana. According to Arab media, Syria’s General Intelligence Directorate launched a security operation in the area after one of its operatives was killed by armed men. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition group, reported multiple incidents in the city, including an attack on a vehicle carrying Druze civilians, leaving several wounded. The circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hussam al-Tahan, head of Damascus’ rural security administration, a government body, claimed that security officers were attacked when they tried to enter Jaramana. 'They were stopped at a checkpoint manned by the Jaramana Shield group and were denied entry with their weapons. After handing over their weapons, they were beaten, humiliated and fired upon. One officer was killed instantly, and another was wounded and taken by the checkpoint personnel,' he alleged. Syrian officials have reportedly given Jaramana’s armed groups five days to surrender their weapons and remove the checkpoints. Al Jazeera reported that mediation efforts have begun between Jaramana residents and Syrian security services 'to contain the tensions.' A local resident, Rabih Manzar, told the Qatari network, 'We are Arab Syrians, loyal to our country and we did not ask for protection from anyone. The Syrian government will respond to Netanyahu—we will not allow ourselves to be used.' Israel’s diplomatic moves in Moscow As tensions in Syria mount, Netanyahu has dispatched his military secretary, Maj. Gen. Roman Gofman, to Moscow for a series of high-level security and diplomatic meetings. One of Israel’s key concerns is Turkey’s growing influence in Syria. Israel has taken a clear stance, favoring Russian interests over Turkish influence in the region. The meetings in Moscow were also aimed at urging Russia to pressure Hamas, through intermediaries, to advance negotiations for a hostage release deal. One of the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, Maxim Herkin, holds Russian citizenship. Against the backdrop of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s ousting and Israel’s push to demilitarize southern Syria, Jerusalem has been pressing the United States to ensure Syria remains 'weak,' in part by allowing Russia to maintain its military presence there. According to a Reuters report citing four sources familiar with the discussions, Israel is seeking to counter Turkey’s influence over Syria’s new ruling forces. The report also noted that while jihadist groups led by Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa—who played a role in Assad’s downfall—are lobbying the U.S. to lift sanctions against them, Israel has communicated its concerns about emerging threats in Syria to American officials. Three U.S. sources told Reuters that Israel views Turkey’s close ties with Syria’s ruling factions as problematic. Other sources confirmed that Israel has conveyed its stance in meetings and official documents. However, it remains unclear whether the Trump administration supports Israel’s position, as Washington has largely remained silent on the matter. According to the sources, some U.S. officials were surprised when Israel framed Russia’s continued military presence in Syria in a positive light. 'Turkey, as a NATO member, would be a better guarantor of Israel’s security,' some officials reportedly argued. However, Israeli representatives at the meeting firmly rejected that notion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1c8p1bjke	2025-03-01T11:23:37-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/BJmudgIS1x/BJmudgIS1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Jewish power at the polls: Inside the Zionist election	American Zionist Movement Executive Director Herbert Block explains the upcoming World Zionist Congress elections American Zionist Movement Executive Director Herbert Block defines Zionism as the Jewish people’s right to self-determination 'and to have our national homeland in our ancestral land.' The word 'Zionism' has been under attack for decades. Following the October 7 massacre and the ongoing war, the anti-Zionist movement has become increasingly vocal. Many Jews, especially on college campuses, are now hesitant to openly identify as Zionists due to rising hostility. However, in an interview with the ILTV News Podcast, Block made it clear that Zionism is here to stay. 'You can’t take Zionism out of our people, our tradition,' Block said. 'Jews around the world, for millennia, have been talking about Zion.' This year, Zionism will take center stage in Jewish discourse for another reason: the upcoming World Zionist Congress elections. These elections determine Zionist Jewish leadership worldwide and influence priorities and funding allocations for the next five years. For those unfamiliar with the process, it can seem complex. Block helped break it down on the podcast. He leads AZM, the umbrella Zionist federation in the United States and the American arm of the World Zionist Organization. Under AZM’s umbrella are 46 national Jewish organizations, and nearly 40 countries have similar Zionist organizations. The World Zionist Organization (WZO) is one of the Jewish people’s legacy institutions. Founded by Theodor Herzl, it organized the first Zionist Congress in Basel in 1897. Today, it works alongside Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael, the Jewish Agency, and Keren Hayesod—three institutions considered the 'national institutions of Israel.' Together, they bridge the connection between Israel and Jews in the Diaspora. The World Zionist Congress serves as the parliament of the Jewish people, with members elected globally. Unlike many Jewish organizations, representation in the Congress is not based on financial contributions. Instead, it is a 'grassroots convening of representatives of Jewish communities, both in Israel and around the world,' Block explained. 'It’s what was formed by Herzl. And now, this year in October, we’ll meet for the 39th Zionist Congress, following in Herzl’s footsteps.' Watch previous ILTV News Podcasts: Delegates gather every five years to set the agenda and direction for these national institutions. These organizations existed before Israel’s founding and remain integral to Herzl’s vision—keeping Jews in Israel and the Diaspora connected and advancing the Zionist cause. They continue to support Jewish communities worldwide, promote Zionist and Jewish education, and fund various initiatives that impact Jews across the globe. Voting for the slates that will be represented in the World Zionist Congress opens in March. Five years ago, 14 parties ran in the elections. This year, in the wake of October 7, that number has risen to 21. 'We're hopeful there will be a greater turnout this time,' Block told ILTV. In the last election, around 125,000 voters participated in North America, despite millions of eligible Jewish voters over the age of 18. 'We're hoping that among affiliated Jews, there will be a greater turnout.' Block stressed the importance of voting, as these national institutions allocate more than a billion dollars annually. Delegates play a key role in determining how those funds are distributed. 'To be represented and have your priorities reflected, voting is essential,' he said. 'This election is an opportunity for people to stand up, unite around Zionism, and connect to the community,' Block emphasized. 'I’m a Zionist, and that’s what this election is about—affirming your Zionism and representing your views on the Zionist movement. We’re all bound together as a Jewish people.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjyorkj5yx	2025-03-01T09:04:20-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/SJuLwyjqJe/SJuLwyjqJe_0_161_2500_1408_0_small.jpg
Could the US push for Zelensky’s ouster? Ukraine’s future uncerta...	After White House thrashing, Ukrainian leader travels to London for talks on military aid and possible cease-fire; Moscow seizes on fallout, describing 'war obsessed' Zelensky's visit to Washington as 'diplomatic failure' In a symbolic move, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky flew to London on Saturday, just hours after his heated and public confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House. Zelensky is set to meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will lead a special summit with European leaders to discuss the ongoing war. The talks will focus not only on continued military and economic aid for Ukraine but also on whether European nations would be willing, as part of a potential cease-fire agreement, to deploy troops to Ukraine to monitor and enforce a truce if one is reached. Amid tensions with the White House following Trump’s sharp criticism during their Oval Office meeting, Zelensky issued a statement emphasizing Ukraine’s gratitude toward the U.S. 'We are very grateful to the United States for all the support,' Zelensky wrote. 'I’m thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and American people. Ukrainians have always appreciated this support, especially during these three years of full-scale invasion. America’s help has been vital in helping us survive, and I want to acknowledge that.' Despite what he described as 'tough dialogue,' Zelensky insisted that Ukraine and the U.S. remain strategic partners. '[W]e need to be honest and direct with each other to truly understand our shared goals,' he wrote. 'It’s crucial for us to have President Trump’s support. He wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do. We are the ones living this war in Ukraine. It’s a fight for our freedom, for our very survival... We’re talking about just and lasting peace—freedom, justice, and human rights for everyone.' Zelensky cast doubt on the viability of a cease-fire with Russian President Vladimir Putin, arguing that temporary truces had repeatedly failed. 'He has broken ceasefires 25 times over the last ten years. A real peace is the only solution,' he said. He reaffirmed Ukraine’s willingness to sign a minerals agreement, calling it 'the first step toward security guarantees,' but stressed that such a move alone would not be enough. 'A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine,' he warned. Zelensky also sought to reassure Ukrainians about continued U.S. support. 'We’ve been fighting for 3 years, and Ukrainian people need to know that America is on our side,' he said. However, the extent to which relations between Zelensky and Trump can recover remains uncertain. A senior U.S. official told CNN that relations with Ukraine appear 'irreparable' if Zelensky remains in office. Putin has long pushed for Zelensky's removal, arguing he is not a legitimate leader. This week, Putin reiterated his position in an interview, calling Zelensky 'toxic' to Ukrainian society and its military, claiming he would lose if elections were held. Putin appears to be leveraging Ukraine’s prolonged state of martial law—which has postponed elections—to deepen divisions between Kyiv’s leadership and the Ukrainian public. There is growing speculation that the U.S., possibly influenced by Russia, may now be considering moves to replace Zelensky with a more Moscow- and Trump-friendly figure. Such a leader, analysts suggest, would be more open to signing a mineral rights agreement with the U.S. and agreeing to a cease-fire—terms Zelensky has opposed without firm American security guarantees. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite strong European backing for Zelensky, as seen in multiple public statements of support from EU and NATO leaders, his position remains precarious. The escalating rift between Kyiv and Washington benefits Russia, which sees it as an opportunity to weaken U.S.-European unity and NATO’s cohesion. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described Zelensky’s visit to Washington as a 'diplomatic failure,' claiming he had rejected peace efforts and was 'obsessed with continuing the war.' Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev reacted even more aggressively, mocking Zelensky’s tense White House meeting with Trump. 'A brutal slap down in the Oval Office. Trump told the cocaine clown the truth to his face for the first time: the Kiev regime is playing with World War III. And the insolent pig got a strong slap from the owners of the pigsty,' he wrote on his Telegram account. 'This is helpful. But not enough—we need to stop military aid to the Nazi machine.' Kremlin-aligned analysts expressed satisfaction with Trump’s tough stance on Zelensky, repeatedly highlighting the deepening rift between the Trump administration and the Ukrainian leader. They noted that the U.S.-Ukraine fallout is also straining Washington’s relations with European allies, further serving Moscow’s strategic interests. The future of U.S.-Ukraine relations now hinges on whether Trump and Zelensky can repair their fractured ties. If not, direct negotiations between Washington and Moscow may accelerate, potentially leading to U.S. pressure on Ukraine to accept a cease-fire on unfavorable terms. Some analysts believe Washington may also push for Zelensky’s resignation, but such a move would be seen as a major victory for Russia. Whether Zelensky would consider stepping down remains highly uncertain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjsybpxs1l	2025-03-01T09:03:14-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/BJO111t1jkx/BJO111t1jkx_0_0_1879_1058_0_small.jpg

Turkey and Iran trade barbs over Syria, Israel and regional influ...	Turkish top diplomat slams Iran’s costly interventions in Syria and Iraq; Tehran fires back, accusing Ankara of ignoring US and Israeli influence while defending its role in 'supporting Palestinian resistance' and 'regional stability' Diplomatic tensions between Turkey and Iran have escalated in recent days, with officials from both countries trading accusations over regional policies, particularly regarding Syria. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Iran’s foreign policy in an interview with Al Jazeera, claiming Tehran has paid a 'very heavy price' to maintain its influence in Iraq and Syria. Fidan argued that Iran’s approach has become a burden on both its regime and the wider region, saying the cost of its interventions far outweighs any gains. Regarding Syria, Fidan called on regional powers to develop relations with Damascus 'without the foundations of control and acquisition.' However, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently met with Syria’s new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, to discuss a security alliance that would include establishing Turkish air bases in central Syria and training the restructured Syrian military. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei responded sharply to Fidan’s remarks, accusing Turkey of 'turning a blind eye to the hidden American and Israeli hands influencing regional developments.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a post on X, Baqaei called Fidan’s comments 'a major mistake' and agreed that the region must be freed from any country’s dominance—whether Arab, Turkish, Kurdish or Iranian. However, he questioned why Turkey omitted Israel from this equation. Baqaei accused Israel of 'reoccupying the entire Golan Heights and significant parts of Syria' following the collapse of the Assad regime, claiming Israel now 'controls the country's most vital water resources.' He further alleged that Israel had 'carried out widespread attacks on Syrian military and defense infrastructure, destroying more than 90% of it, including key research centers.' Despite its growing presence across the Middle East through proxy forces, Baqaei denied that Iran has pursued regional ambitions over the past five decades. Instead, he framed Iran’s involvement as supporting 'the Palestinian people in their struggle against occupation and aggression, while preventing Israeli dominance in the region.' 'Today, the Palestinian issue is more alive than ever, and Israel is more despised than ever,' Baqaei said. 'Iran has always supported the resistance while standing firmly against unlawful behavior and terrorism. We were the first to fight ISIS, the first to oppose the coup attempt against Turkey in 2016 and among the first to welcome the disarmament of the PKK, seeing it as a step toward Turkey’s security.' Baqaei concluded by emphasizing Iran’s consistency in its policies, contrasting it with what he suggested was Turkey’s shifting alliances. 'We stand firm in our positions and do not change our approach from one day to the next,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhsrnxjkg	2025-03-01T08:26:08-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/rJr6trdS1e/rJr6trdS1e_0_100_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
We didn't come to Jerusalem to evict people from their homes'	Jewish-American developer Gary Barnett paid NIS 750M for 130 acres of Greek Orthodox Church land in Jerusalem’s Rehavia and Talbiya; in an exclusive interview, he shares his journey from a poor childhood in a family of 12 to leading a top NYC real estate firm 'We paid a lot of money for this land, and we're not going to give it away for free,' says Gary Barnett, the Jewish-American developer behind the controversial real estate deal described as the biggest in Jerusalem in the last 100 years. A year ago, Barnett completed the massive acquisition for no less than 750 million shekels, purchasing 130 acres in the heart of Jerusalem—land previously owned by the Greek Orthodox Church. However, since then, he has encountered challenges that cast doubt on the feasibility of his massive project. Barnett’s main obstacle is opposition from many of the tenants living on the land, who refuse to reach an agreement that would allow large-scale urban renewal projects, including the construction of thousands of new housing units. The vast area in Rehavia, Talbiya and Nayot neighborhoods includes some of the most central and expensive streets in the city. It currently holds around 900 housing units, well-known hotels such as the Inbal, Prima and Dan Panorama hotels, public buildings including part of the Great Synagogue and the Israel Museum, open spaces, and over 12 plots designated for development. Despite skepticism from the real estate sector regarding Barnett's ability to execute his ambitious plan, he asserts in the interview that he has no regrets about the deal, for which he spent hundreds of millions of his own money. 'I’ve been involved in many complicated and challenging deals in America,' he says. 'Extell, my company, is among the top five development firms in the U.S. We have built in Boston, Chicago, and Miami, and we have a major project in Park City, Utah. We are developing a massive ski and resort site, which is an extremely complex deal. We had to merge over 20 transactions to create the site and secure permits worth billions of dollars.' 'Something big and creative' Barnett, 69, was born on New York's Lower East Side to a father who was a rabbi and a teacher and a mother who was also an educator. He grew up in New York and in the nearby city of Monsey as one of 12 children. 'My father was born in Europe before the war and spent three years in Israel in the 1930s,' he shares. 'My mother was born in America but also spent several years in Israel in the 1930s. We were a large, poor family. I got married and moved to Belgium, where we lived for 12 years. My wife became ill and passed away after a three-year battle. 'I remarried, and when I returned to America, I was already in real estate. I managed my business from Belgium for a few years and was also involved in the diamond trade, but when I moved back to the U.S., I shifted entirely to real estate, starting with acquisitions and later moving into development.' Why did you decide to invest in Israel? 'My family and I love Israel deeply, and I have visited many times. Most of my children (Barnett has eight) studied in Israel for at least a year. Over the years, people kept asking me, ‘Why don’t you build there?’ and I never really found the right project for me. But of course, it was always a dream — to build and own something in Israel. 'When this opportunity came, it seemed big and creative enough for me to get involved. Beyond urban renewal, we also own land where important institutions like the Israel Museum and the Great Synagogue are located, and we want to help secure their long-term status. I truly believe this initiative will bring good for everyone, but it requires goodwill from all sides,' he says, referring to the Jewish National Fund (JNF), the Jerusalem Municipality, and the opposing residents. Residents claim they have become hostages in their homes. 'Naturally, people are skeptical. I understand why residents—those who live in the apartments, not investors—are initially distrustful. Many have had bad experiences with empty promises. But we have a 30-year history of successful deals and keeping our word. 'When I started my career in 1994, we had a similar situation in America. We bought a building on Manhattan’s Upper West Side during the longest rent strike in New York history—nine or 13 years. The tenants, who were politically active and savvy, had stopped paying rent because the landlord neglected the building. My partners and I saw the potential in the property, met with the tenant leader, and reached an agreement. We renovated the building, increased rents and never had any legal disputes afterward. 'One of the tenants was a rabbi with ten children. He paid $273 per month for a ten-room, 400-square-meter apartment. The court ruled we could increase his rent to $1,500, still an extremely low price for that space in Manhattan. Of course, he couldn't afford it, but we didn’t evict him. Instead, we bought him a house in Monsey, and he moved there. It was a very happy ending. Later, we renovated his old apartment and rented it for $20,000 a month. 'Bottom line, we did not come to Jerusalem to evict people from their homes. In any case, there are 25 years left on the lease, so there’s no immediate threat. We came to Israel with goodwill, and we believe our plan is a win-win for everyone.' 'There are those stirring the pot' Barnett’s acquisition was finalized in January 2023 with the seller, the Jerusalem-based Ben David family’s company, Nayot Komemiyut. The land was originally leased by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to the Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) in the 1950s for up to 99 years (until 2052), with an option to extend. The KKL subleased the land to tenants. In 2016, Nayot Komemiyut purchased the land rights from the church, continued leasing to the KKL, and even offered tenants the chance to purchase full ownership of their homes. Some deals have been completed, including the sale of Villa Sherover, President Hotel, and other apartments. Two years ago, Barnett, along with several Jewish-American investors, acquired the land. To manage it, he established Extell Israel, which he controls. This company has no corporate affiliation with Extell Development in the U.S., one of New York’s top three real estate firms with multi-billion-dollar holdings. Barnett faces a complex real estate puzzle. The land leases expire in 25 years, raising concerns among tenants who don’t own their apartments. Barnett does not intend to renew leases, aiming instead to push forward an urban renewal plan. He offers tenants a choice: purchase ownership for a reduced price or extend their lease until 2100 without payment. However, many tenants oppose the deal, fearing high taxation costs. Some also criticize the limited 12.5-square-meter expansion he proposes for their new apartments, arguing that larger additions are approved in similar projects. The objections forced him to submit a new, improved proposal to the residents last November. Barnett’s initial proposal to the residents offered them ownership of their apartments in exchange for a payment based on different tiers: Approximately 3,000 shekels per square meter (about 300,000 shekels for a 100-square-meter apartment) for residents who owned the property before 2019. Around 5,000 shekels per square meter for those who own the apartment as a secondary property, such as foreign residents. Approximately 6,000 shekels per square meter for those renting out the apartment as an income-generating property. Around 9,000 shekels per square meter for those who purchased the property from 2019 onward. Barnett defines the latter as speculators, arguing that those who bought after 2019 acquired the properties at significantly lower prices compared to market rates. 'Less than 50% of the apartment owners actually live in them, meaning about half of the leaseholders are investors,' Barnett says. 'Some inherited the apartments and rent them out, but most are investors who, just like us, want to achieve financial success. The value of these apartments decreases every year. 'For those living in them, it might not matter much — they will stay for another 25 years, and whatever happens, happens. But what happens if they need to sell? The residents can either extend their lease or obtain full ownership. Clearly, ownership is the better option.' Extell claims that only 7% of the residents are the original leaseholders of the apartments and that 25% purchased them between 2000 and 2010 at a price 10%-20% below market value. After that, according to the company, the price was already 20%-40% below market rates. The company also asserts that about 25% of the leaseholders are not Israeli citizens. The improved offer In November, Extell improved its offer to the residents, presenting two options: Ownership of the apartments or Lease extension until the year 2100 at no cost. Additionally, the payment required for ownership was reduced. The new model is tiered: First tier: Longtime residents who have lived in the apartments since before 2019. Those opting for ownership can forgo a 12.5-square-meter expansion under the redevelopment plan and receive ownership for free. If they want the extra space, they will pay 2,000 shekels per square meter. Those who choose to extend the lease will receive the additional space at no cost, but without ownership. Second tier: Residents who do not live in the apartment and rent it out. If they choose ownership and want the 12.5-square-meter expansion, they will pay 4,000 shekels per square meter. Third tier: Residents who purchased the apartment after 2019. If they choose ownership and want the 12.5-square-meter expansion, they will pay 6,000 shekels per square meter. According to calculations by Extell, a 100-square-meter apartment in Talbiya is currently valued at approximately 2.95 million shekels under leasehold status. Transferring it to ownership would increase its value to 4.85 million shekels. After the redevelopment, the apartment would become a new 112.5-square-meter unit valued at approximately 7.87 million shekels. The company claims this deal would significantly increase the value of the apartments for residents. However, many remain opposed to the offer, partly due to concerns about high tax costs when purchasing ownership. Real estate appraiser Kobi Bir, an expert on church-owned lands, explains that church-owned lands pose challenges even for lease extension: 'On lands owned by the Israel Land Authority (ILA), lease renewal is almost automatic at a cost of 5.5% of the land’s value. However, on church-owned lands, the situation is different: renewal fees apply not only to the land but also to the buildings on it, and they are full lease fees—not the symbolic 5.5% charge. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) would have to pay the landowners a much higher amount than it can collect from residents, creating a significant financial gap and taxation issues. A lease renewal transaction is considered a real estate transaction for tax purposes. Since the renewal is based on the market value and not a symbolic lease fee, the tax on the renewal will be at full market value.' From Barnett’s perspective, if he manages to reach an agreement with all 900 residents, and they all pay at least the minimum amount instead of opting for lease extension, the total revenue from the ownership transfers alone would be around 180 million shekels, even before advancing the urban renewal project, which would include selling hundreds of new apartments at market prices. Why does the new offer include an expansion of only 12.5 square meters per apartment, rather than a larger increase, as seen in similar projects? Will there also be balconies? 'Unlike a regular urban renewal project where residents bring the land and apartments into the deal while the developer handles the redevelopment, this situation is different,' Barnett explains. 'Moreover, our offer provides a significant discount on ownership compared to market prices, granting residents a substantial financial benefit. Regarding balconies, where feasible from a planning perspective, we will certainly include them, but this depends on final approvals from the local planning and building committee.' Can residents receive an official commitment from KKL-JNF and the Israel Tax Authority that the project can proceed in order to gain their trust? 'An official commitment depends on receiving formal agreements from KKL-JNF and the Tax Authority. We are in discussions with the relevant parties and examining the possibility of obtaining such approval. 'It's important to understand that while the contracts grant KKL-JNF the right to extend the leases for additional years, the cost of extension will be determined based on market value—not just for the land but also for the buildings on it, along with undeveloped land value. This cost will be based on projected market values in 2050, when the current leases expire.' 'Not all residents have the funds to pay,' Barnett acknowledges. 'Like the rabbi in New York, we understand that. Therefore, if a resident cannot afford the payment, they will only need to pay when they sell the property or transfer it to their heirs. We never intended to pressure people who cannot afford it. We didn’t come to Jerusalem to cause trouble. Those who think our offer isn’t good enough simply don’t understand it.' He also claims: 'Some people are stirring the pot, arguing that they shouldn’t have to pay anything for ownership. But we paid about 800 million shekels for the land (750 million for the deal plus additional taxes). The Israeli government practically gave away its land for free, so some people seem to think we should do the same. We know that one of the residents’ lawyers represents a client who wants to push his own redevelopment project on these lands.' Opposition to the proposed law In July, coalition and opposition lawmakers advanced the 'Fair Leasehold' bill, which applies to church-owned and Christian monastic lands. It would grant tenants the right of first refusal to purchase their apartments and extend their leases for another 50 years at 5.5% of the land's pre-development value. If passed, this law would significantly delay Barnett’s ability to proceed with urban renewal on the lands he purchased. Real estate appraiser Bir adds that church-owned lands have become a diplomatic issue: 'Attempts to resolve the problem through legislation, such as the Fair Leasehold bill, faced strong opposition from the churches, even leading to the temporary closure of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as a protest. The churches argue that such legislation would harm their ability to sell land in the future.' During his visit to Israel in November, Barnett did not hide his opposition to the bill, stating in the interview: 'I told the residents: if you think the Knesset will pass a law that will take our land away, it will end in 10-15 years of legal battles, and your properties will only lose value. And then, don’t expect anyone to negotiate with you.' 'Extell's position,' says Barnett, 'is that the proposed law in its current form is far from providing a fair and balanced solution. In fact, it disproportionately infringes on private property, interferes with freedom of contracts, and could potentially harm the certainty required for investors in Israel. Beyond that, as I understand it, it may also harm churches in Israel and relations with the Christian world. 'In fact,' he adds, 'a comparison between the proposed law and Extell's current proposal reveals that, in many ways, our offer is better. It grants ownership to some tenants without payment, and to others at a very low price, close to what they would be required to pay under the proposed law. It is correct and far preferable for all parties to reach agreements rather than engage in lengthy legislative processes and legal petitions, which will only prolong the existing uncertainty unnecessarily.' Does your proposal address tax aspects? 'Yes. The company is working in collaboration with expert tax advisors to minimize the exposure of lessees and the company to unnecessary taxation within the framework of the project. As explained to the lessees, the proposal is subject to obtaining relevant tax exemptions, within the framework of urban renewal and in general.' Will the tenants be able to receive ownership immediately? 'The transfer of ownership is expected to occur at the time of evacuation from the apartment, ensuring that all parties are secured. If the tenant is required to pay for the ownership, they will do so only then, and not a moment earlier.' Throughout the interview, Barnett repeatedly shifts the responsibility to the Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and the Jerusalem Municipality, clarifying that they must assist the company in advancing the deal due to their public responsibility for the overall solution. 'In all our discussions with the KKL and the Jerusalem Municipality, we were told that we must offer the tenants a very good deal,' he says. 'We need the KKL and the municipality to support the deal, but practically, there is still no cooperation. We need to hold further discussions. It is clear that if they tell the public that they should receive more, it will ruin it for us, and they have the power to do that. But based on what they have told us in the past, it's hard for me to see them not agreeing. They still need to move from the theoretical stage to the practical stage, but we recognize that they want to resolve the issue.' Do you think the KKL will renew the lease? 'If the KKL renews, it will effectively agree irreversibly to pay hundreds of millions annually. If it passes this on to the tenants, it will be very unsuccessful for them, and if not, it involves providing subsidies of hundreds of millions annually to tenants, instead of using these funds for other purposes that the KKL promotes. 'In light of the attractive offer on the table, where the tenants will receive ownership, not a lease, without any payment from the KKL, it's hard for me to imagine the KKL passing on a win-win opportunity. We have now seen a very good response from many more tenants saying, 'Okay, this is what we've been waiting for,'' claims Barnett. 'Resolving the issue' Alongside the many objections from tenants who have not yet agreed to the deal, there are those who would like to move forward with Extell. 'I have an investment apartment in the best place in Jerusalem, and I know that when we get older, I want to live in the Talbiya neighborhood with my wife,' says an investor from the central region, who asked to remain anonymous. 'We purchased the apartment in August 2023, just before the war, and we understood that we were entering into lease agreements until 2052. I told myself that this must be resolved because what will happen in 25 years? Will people be evicted from their homes? Just when we saw that Extell had purchased the lands, I understood their financial strength and capabilities. 'I saw their projects in New York, and I told myself that if such a body comes to a place like Jerusalem, it will probably do serious work there. I assumed they didn't pay 750 million shekels for lands to wait until 2052 to do something with them. 'We bought with the understanding that the new landowners would upgrade the entire complex. You don't need to be a real estate person to see the buildings around and understand the potential of new structures. From meetings we held with Extell and with Gary himself, we were impressed that there is an intention to promote respectable projects. 'I understand the opponents, who are afraid and don't want to be suckers, but I say: I hold a property under lease for another 25 years. If someone offers me a reasonable offer with a reasonable addition to get ownership and a better apartment - I'm happy. 'I know that it's possible to get an addition of more than 12.5 square meters; there are contractors here who offer tenants an addition of 25 square meters per apartment, and I agree that one shouldn't agree to a deal hastily, but they forget that the situation here is not normal; the apartment is not ours, and they are offering us ownership of it.' In the residents' protest headquarters, they are less happy. The headquarters stated: 'Gary Barnett and his group continue to intimidate the tenants, threatening that they will be evicted from their homes if they do not agree to Barnett's draconian and unilateral terms, while applying heavy pressure on elderly people and foreign residents through mailboxes, email, and phone continuously. The state and the KKL must end this saga and the loss of control over vast areas in the heart of Jerusalem by quickly completing the legislation and exercising the KKL's right to extend the lease without the need to dip into the public pocket. This is also the simple solution for the KKL, due to complex contractual obligations, including full compensation and lease periods crossing the year 2052 for some lessees. 'Extell is trying to divide and conquer between lessees, to create conflicts between buildings and complexes, and to ride on the tenants' rights on the way to obtaining the coveted approvals from the KKL, the Jerusalem Municipality, and the Knesset, approvals that it is light-years away from receiving. 'The Fair Lease Law currently being promoted was passed in a similar version in the British Parliament and other countries and was approved by the European Court of Human Rights as proportionate and just. The law is supposed to regulate the issue, including tax issues, in a way that preserves the tenants' rights and does not allow any land speculator to do with them as they please. 'This whole situation was born in sin, without the tenants' knowledge and behind their backs. Signing with Barnett and Extell is a clear own goal and a very problematic tax event, and therefore the vast majority of tenants do not succumb to his intimidation campaign about long legal proceedings and eviction.' The Jerusalem Municipality stated: 'The mayor is monitoring developments on this issue with concern. Although this is not a municipal matter, it is of great importance to a large segment of the city's public. The mayor has clarified that the issue should be resolved at the national level, through legislation or other arrangements, provided that this does not come at the expense of the leaseholders. |'He has informed the developer and the leaseholders that the Jerusalem Municipality will not permit the advancement of plans within its jurisdiction on church lands until the matter is settled. When such a settlement is on the table, the municipality will take the necessary steps to assist. Ultimately, these are leaseholders who have acted honestly and in good faith and deserve protection and assistance.' KKL-JNF declined to specify their position regarding the deal and only stated: 'KKL-JNF was not and is not a party to the transaction for the sale of rights to the Jerusalem Lands Company (Extell Israel), nor did it receive any notification of the intention to carry it out. 'However, recently there has been dialogue between company representatives and KKL-JNF professionals. In this context, KKL-JNF clarified its position regarding its rights, including its right to extend the lease period. Additionally, although KKL-JNF is not the entity representing the sub-lessees and residents, it places great importance on protecting their rights and acts accordingly.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sj2xiu2q1l	2025-03-01T07:56:18-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/yk14237976/yk14237976_0_50_919_518_0_small.jpg

A quiet leader': How one courageous IDF officer saved 17 soldier...	CPT Eden Nimri heroically fought terrorists during Nahal Oz base massacre, saving 17 soldiers before being killed; her family, presented with her team’s charred logbook, treasures records of her professionalism, warnings to commanders and her ultimate sacrifice On October 4, 2023, Team Nimri, led by Captain Eden Nimri, arrived at the Nahal Oz base from the northern sector to replace the 'Sky Rider' unit, which had gone home for the holiday. Three days later, Eden was killed in a heroic battle against terrorists who infiltrated the base during the October 7 massacre. Team Nimri always carried an operations logbook, meticulously documenting every activity. The logbook, which was in the command room that was completely burned during the massacre, miraculously survived and was recently presented to Eden’s family. Inside, they found details about her final days and her professional conduct leading up to the attack. Originally, Eden was set to become an exceptional athlete due to her swimming talent, but as her enlistment approached, she decided to pursue meaningful military service. After dropping out of the pilot training course, she was assigned to the 'Sky Rider' unit, part of the Artillery Corps. Soldiers in this unit work alongside ground forces, operating a small UAV called the 'Skylark,' used for intelligence gathering, directing forces, artillery fire and other purposes. Eden underwent a year of training and served as a combat soldier at the Nahal Oz base. 'A brilliant girl with incredible abilities,' her mother, Sharon, proudly recalls. Eden eventually became an officer and served in the northern sector. Occasionally, she and her team were sent to replace soldiers in the southern sector, as they were during the Yom Kippur holiday in 2023. They arrived at the Nahal Oz base, a place Eden knew well from her previous service. 'The base looked abandoned, neglected and desolate,' Sharon recounts from a family visit to Eden. 'Eden told us about the barrier erected against tunnels, the mounds of dirt and the fence. She felt safe and protected. They were sold stories that put them at ease. But Eden, who had fought in Operation Guardian of the Walls, knew the enemy all too well.' A year earlier, Eden had arrived at the Nahal Oz base with four female soldiers under her command. During their time in the sector, they were not required to carry out any operations. 'Eden was told there was no operational necessity,' Sharon explains. 'She was concerned that her soldiers' readiness was deteriorating. She warned her commanders every day, raising the problematic situation to everyone who needed to know, but no one listened. They dismissed her concerns.' On October 7, just days after arriving at the base, Eden heroically fought off terrorists, enabling the female soldiers to escape from the fortified shelter, where she was ultimately killed. She saved the lives of 17 soldiers, including lookout soldiers who were kidnapped and later released. 'They woke up to the sounds of gunfire, and Eden immediately grabbed her weapon and led the girls to a shelter where soldiers she didn’t even know were hiding, as gunfire and explosions rang out,' Sharon recounts. 'At 7:15 a.m, she managed to message us that everything was okay. Six minutes later, she informed her company, Team Nimri has taken command of the shelter.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Eden heard the terrorists approaching and didn’t flinch. She kept firing to draw their attention and allow the girls to escape, even as the terrorists started throwing grenades into the shelter. The last person to see Eden said she was crouched with her weapon, continuing to return fire. She was a fighter and a commander until the very end—that’s who she was. Even in pajamas, without her officer insignia, she was fully committed to her role and tried to save as many lives as she could, even though everyone there had effectively been sentenced to death.' Just two days later, Eden was supposed to begin a new role at Mitzpe Ramon, serving as the acting Operations Officer for her unit. 'We had already planned her farewell from the team and the base, and we wanted to accompany her transition to her new post,' Sharon says. 'A beautiful girl, full of light, who loved life and was loved in return, until that tragic Saturday. She did everything with courage and humility. Her commanders describe her as a quiet leader.' The release of the lookout soldiers deeply moved Eden’s family. 'We hoped for this moment. They were there and witnessed Eden in her final moments. We are eager to meet them, to hear about that day through their eyes. They even spoke about her in the Hamas tunnels to other captives who were later released. They didn’t even know her name, but it was important to them to share her act of heroism.' Ahead of Tu Bishvat, a senior military officer visited the family. After presenting them with a tree to plant and dried fruits, he revealed for the first time the operations logbook of Team Nimri. 'I was very surprised to see the logbook, which was completely charred but whose contents were preserved,' Sharon recalls. The family was even more astonished to discover that the last entry in the logbook was dated October 3. 'The logbook is full of daily reports from Eden and her team. In the northern sector, they operated around the clock, 24/7. Everything was documented and written. But the entries stop on October 3. From the moment the team arrived at Nahal Oz, nothing was written, meaning there was no activity.' The family has requested to keep the logbook, which survived the devastation of the command room, as a final memento. 'Through the logbook, you can see Eden,' Sharon concludes. 'Her pursuit of excellence, her professionalism and her attention to detail. She understood the responsibility placed on her and the significance of her role. It proves to me what I already know—how meaningful she was in her life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1clgnjcjg	2025-03-01T07:21:52-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/HyFYGnVM9yg/HyFYGnVM9yg_16_77_1214_684_0_small.jpg
Hamas releases video of freed hostage Iair Horn and his brother E...	Terror group releases clip showing brothers alongside other hostages in what appears to be their final moments together before Iair’s release Hamas released a video Saturday showing freed Israeli hostage Iair Horn alongside his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity, in what appears to be their final moments together before Iair’s release. The footage also shows another former hostage, agui Dekel-Chen, who was freed along with Iair. At the request of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the video or any part of it will only be published with the family's approval. Iair Horn, who was held by Hamas for 489 days, spoke publicly for the first time on Wednesday at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, just hours after the funeral of the Bibas family, whose bodies were returned from Gaza last week. 'I was kidnapped on October 7, and after 498 days, I was released from Hamas captivity,' he said. 'I want to thank all those advocating and working to bring the hostages home. Your efforts matter—the fact that I am standing here today proves that.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Horn, visibly emotional, emphasized that his freedom remains incomplete as long as others are still in captivity. 'I am standing here, but 63 hostages are not—among them my younger brother, Eitan Horn. Until he and the others return, I will not truly be here. Maybe my body, but not my soul,' he said. Fighting back tears, Horn described his time in captivity and the stark contrast to life outside. 'This is the first time in 498 days that I have stood under the sun for this long. I didn’t have the privilege of breathing fresh air. While we are here, enjoying the sun—or taking it for granted—there are hostages still struggling to breathe.' He urged immediate action for a second phase of the hostage deal. 'There is no time. A second phase must be signed to bring them all back now. I stand before you knowing exactly what they are going through. The hostages don’t have time—we must bring them home now.

Military intelligence probe reveals Hamas plans to assassinate 60...	Results of the investigation by the intelligence force show Hamas planned its massacre for 2022 and then during Passover of 2023 and did not consider Israel's internal strife over judicial legislation in determining when to strike After the IDF completed its investigations into failings of the military leading to and during the Hamas massacre of October 7, new information was revealed including Hamas's plan to kill 600 people in the Negev desert town of Ofakim. Raad Saad, the first of the Hamas operations commander that Israel attempted to assassinate during the war, was the one who devised the plan to infiltrate Israel above ground, avoiding the use of tunnels after an underground barrier was built by Israel. Based on his plans, Battalions of the elite Nukhba forces were established, including a reserve force for each. Intelligence gathered in Gaza during the offensive last year, revealed a trove of intelligence. The plan that was first devised in 2017, included live streaming of the incursions into border communities and IDF positions, subterfuge and control of strategic and symbolic locations such as police stations and the intention to reach cities in the South including Beer Sheva, Ashdod and Ashkelon. The plan for Ofakim called for the murder of at least 600 civilians. During the massacre, 33 of the city's residents were murdered. The planned attack during scrapped when IDF chief stayed overnight at the border Review of the intelligence showed that the anti-government protests that broke out over the attempted legislation to weaken Israel's judicial branch, were not a consideration of Hamas, when it decided on the timing of the massacre. Israeli intelligence missed two earlier dates when Hamas planned to launch the attack, one during the previous government and the other during the Passover holiday in 2023. Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi attended a Seder meal with troops at the time and stayed at the base overnight. The intelligence analysts believe Hamas postponed their planned massacre both times in the last moment choosing to improve their forces capabilities. 'Hamas understood that they are only 85% prepared at the end of 2022 and during part of 2023. We found in one of the operatives files a record of the original date for attack,' the military intelligence probe said. 'We discovered that 2022 was considered a year of great opportunities.' The military intelligence research department that was supposed to issue strategic alerts of war, missed at least 10 signs in the two years preceding the war. In one case they misinterpreted a Hamas produced television series that included scenes that were later played out in the massacre. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was later killed in an Israeli strike, praised the program that showed how the terror group intended to infiltrate into Israel. Israel's worse case scenario unlike the reality Israel prepared a worse case scenario that included an invasion of some 70 terrorists from four to eight locations and activated its plan of response just nine minutes after the massacre began. But in reality the first wave of the attack included 1,175 terrorists while the IDF had 671 soldiers only to respond. The military's command bunger that was activated soon after the start of the Hamas assault only knew about 55% of the events occurring on the ground which prevented an accurate picture of events and confusion while the Gaza division collapsed. Where was the Air Force According to the military probe, the first drone attack was at 7:15 am and prevented terrorists from entering Netiv Haasara. At 7:55 am the first fighter jet strike targeted a tunnel near the border moshav to stop terrorists from infiltrating underground. At 8:02 am a helicopter gunship first fired at terrorists near Kibbutz Re'im and at 8:10 wounded were evacuated by chopper. At 8:47 am, special forces were flown in to join the fighting along the border and in the communities. The Hamas massacre began after a day of preparations that started around mid-day on Friday, without being detected by the IDF or the Shin Bet. The terrorists came in three waves with 5,500 armed men who proceeded to carry their planned murder, rape and abductions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy542kxoke	2025-03-01T04:51:37-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/HJeY7F9n5ke/HJeY7F9n5ke_0_678_851_479_0_small.jpg

Israel advocating for Russian presence in Syria to counter growin...	Israeli officials urge the United States to allow Russians to keep military presence after demanding demilitarized zone south of Damascus preventing Islamist regime forces from taking positions on the Israeli border Israel wants Russian forces to remain in Syria in the wake of the fall of the Assad regime and after it announced its demand for a demilitarized zone south of the capital Damascus. Israeli officials have been pressuring the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to ensure that Syria is weakened by allowing the Russians to hold on to their bases there in order to curb Turkish influence over the new Syrian rulers, according to Reuters, citing four sources. Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement that that IDF troops would remain on the ground in Syria, sparked protests and drew condemnation from Damascus calling for an immediate pullback of Israeli forces from Syrian land. On Saturday, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group declared an immediate ceasefire heeding jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan's call on the PKK to lay down its arms and dissolve and a move that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's government and the opposition pro-Kurdish DEM party voiced support for. Ending the insurgency would facilitate efforts by Syria's new regime to assert greater sway over areas in northern Syria controlled by Kurdish forces. Since Assad's fall, Turkey has repeatedly demanded that the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the YPG militia disarm, warning of military action otherwise. However, the SDF said that while Ocalan's call was positive, it did not apply to them. Israel communicated its views to top U.S. officials during meetings in Washington in February and subsequent meetings in Israel with U.S. Congressional representatives, three U.S. sources and another person familiar with the contacts said. The main points were also circulated to some senior U.S. officials in an Israeli 'white paper', two of the sources said. 'Israel's big fear is that Turkey comes in and protects this new Syrian Islamist order, which then ends up being a base for Hamas and other militants,' said Aron Lund, a fellow at U.S.-based think-tank Century International.

Free world 'seeking new leader,' after Trump turns back on Ukrain...	Without mentioning the U.S. president by name most Western leaders say they stand by Ukraine against Russian aggression; division of the West makes us all weaker and favors those who would like to see the decline of our civilization, Italy's Meloni says Most European leaders came out in support of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after the unprecedented confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday that included accusations, reprimands and the rolling of eyes, and all in plain sight of the entire world, and his reported subsequent removal from the White House. Vice-President of the European Commission Kaja Kallas said clearly that the free world needs a new leader. Zelensky left without signing a deal to allow the U.S. access to his countries untapped minerals including future earnings. In an interview with Fox he later said the administration could be more on Ukraine's side. 'You’re either going to make a deal, or we’re out,' Trump angrily told Zelensky in the Oval Office. 'And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s gonna be pretty, but you’ll fight it out. You don’t have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position, but you’re not acting at all thankful, and that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing,' the American president said. 'It is very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after. It is important for people in Ukraine to know that they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country, in every corner of the world,' the Ukrainian president said on a post on Saturday. Without specifically calling Trump out by name, Europe's leaders were quick to express their support for Ukraine and its leaders. 'No one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine! That is why we are jointly seeking the path to a lasting and just peace. Ukraine can rely on Germany, and on Europe,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. French president Macron agreed. 'Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people. I think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago, and to continue to do so, we, that is the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others,' he said. 'We must thank all those who have helped and respect those who have been fighting since the beginning.

'With drones and satellites, these locations are meaningless,' he said. Aoun said he was in contact with French and American mediators to pressure Israel to withdraw its forces. 'If the American administration, until now, did not pressure Israel to leave Lebanese territory, it means either that there is no desire to do so or that it is waiting for the appropriate time, I don't know,' he said but added that relations with the United States were necessary because of their position in the world. Aoun was named president after the war between Israel and Hezbollah ended and after Hezbollah's leaders, including Hassan Nasrallah were assassinated. said that his country was tired of war. 'In all honesty Lebanon is tired. The Lebanese are tired of others fighting their wars on our land. We deserve economic and political recovery,' he said.

'If we are talking about sovereignty, our perception is that decisions about war and peace will be limited to the state and that bearing arms will be limited to the state. Lebanon was committed to UN resolution 1701, Aoun said. adding he hoped to end military confrontations and resolve them diplomatically. 'We as military men, however, always think of the worse. The worse is a military conflict and that depends on the decision of the state.' Aoun said he hopes to ensure relations based on mutual respect with all countries, including Iran. 'This is not about the relations of a country with one group of politicians or Lebanese. Iran's friendship must be with all Lebanese,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s10gvugjkl	2025-03-01T00:51:31-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/S1902S6Lkg/S1902S6Lkg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Hamas rejects Israel's 'formulation' of extending first Gaza ceas...	Terror group says it would not release more hostages until negotiations for the second phase of the deal proceed including an end to the war and a withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza Hamas said on Saturday that it rejected Israel's 'formulation' of extending the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, on the day the first stage of the deal was set to expire. The group's spokesperson Hazem Qassem also told Al-Araby TV there were no current talks for a second ceasefire phase in Gaza with the group. He said Israel wanted to release more hostages along with the possibility to renew attacks on the Gaza Strip and was avoiding its commitment to end the war and withdraw its forces. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned senior ministers and security officials to consultations late on Friday after Hamas refused to discuss an extension to the first phase of the cease-fire deal and insisted that talks begin on the second phase that includes and end to the war. The consultations were held after the delegation sent to Cairo for negotiations returned without any progress made. Egyptian sources told Reuters that Israel was attempting to extend the first phase by 42 days, so that three hostages would be released each week in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. An Israeli official confirmed that that was Israel's intention. This is the first Saturday that no hostages are being released. There are currently 59 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel believes 22 of them are alive. An Israeli official told CNN on Friday that there was no desire in Israel to return to the war but 'there is a desire to go along with the US, hand in hand with the US.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: ' There is an understanding in Israel that [U.S. President Donald] Trump wants a more regional settlement. So that obviously doesn’t mean that the war will start again right away,' the official said but added that Netanyahu wants to bring more live hostages out of Gaza without committing to ending the war and moving on to phase two of the deal. 'The second phase means a declaration that the war has ended. That will never happen. Israel will maintain as much ambiguity as possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyjvsseo1e	2025-03-01T00:06:04-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/HJWIIDFP5Jx/HJWIIDFP5Jx_0_0_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Oron Shaul rescue: The covert operation that almost collapsed the...	Just two days before the first phase of the cease-fire deal in Gaza, intelligence reveals Shaul held above ground, near civilians requiring a tough choice: launch a mission or risk the hostage deal Israel’s Shin Bet and IDF faced a nerve-wracking dilemma in January after receiving precise intelligence on the location of the body of Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, a Golani Brigade soldier killed in the 2014 Gaza war. Since then, Hamas had held his remains. On one hand, this was a rare opportunity to bring him home for burial, offering some solace to his grieving family. On the other, a ceasefire was set to begin in two days, along with the release of the first three hostages. A failed recovery operation could jeopardize international mediation efforts, reignite fighting, and endanger other captives. What should they do? In a joint decision, the Shin Bet and Southern Command authorized the mission in two phases. The first, within the limits of what can be publicly disclosed, aimed to establish optimal conditions for the extraction deep inside Gaza. Special forces along with infantry troops and the Armored Corps participated. Secrecy was so tight that many support units were unaware of the target’s identity. The second phase—the actual recovery—took place more than 24 hours later, in the overnight hours between Saturday and Sunday, just before the ceasefire took effect. The rescue team was comprised Shin Bet operatives and Shayetet 13 commandos. Shaul’s body was not buried but kept above ground, near civilian areas, adding to the risks. Hours before reaching the site, an IDF tank providing security detected a suspected terrorist. Tracking him led to the discovery of three additional Hamas operatives near the location of Shaul’s remains. Again, a dilemma emerged: attacking could alert Hamas and bring reinforcements, while ignoring the threat could endanger the rescuers. After much deliberation, the Air Force was called in, eliminating all four militants. The IDF held its breath, hoping the strike wouldn’t compromise the mission. Maj. (res.) D., an operations officer in the 188th Brigade and one of the planners, monitored the mission from the command center. Yet, even he didn’t know the identity of the target until the operation began. 'The intelligence came in during combat. I assume the urgency of the ceasefire led to mistakes that provided this intelligence,' he told Ynet. 'The most tense moments were before reaching the body. Early on, we didn’t know if there would be terrorists in the building. We didn’t even know for sure if the body was there or what condition it would be in. We didn’t know what tools or how many people would be needed to retrieve it. It was an ongoing uncertainty until the full picture became clear, from the moment of recovery to securing the evacuation point. In our command center, there was total silence—everyone’s eyes were on the screen.' By Sunday morning, a sigh of relief echoed from Southern Command to IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. Shaul’s body had been recovered, the mission was executed without casualties, and after arrival in Israel and a positive identification, his family was finally notified—10.5 years after his capture. Defense officials said that Hamas was unaware of the operation, which went smoothly. 'We knew we had done something significant—we brought him home,' D. said. 'This mission was a peak moment for all of us, after everything we had been through.' S., a Shin Bet official involved in the operation said that since the war began, a massive amount of intelligence was received and prossessed and detainees interrogated. 'A key part of our job was simply organizing all that information—piecing together a complex puzzle. For this moment, all the effort was worth it.' Learning About Your Brother From WhatsApp Oron Shaul, 21, from Poria, was killed between July 19 and 20, 2014, about two weeks into Operation Protective Edge in Gaza. He was part of a Golani force inside an armored personnel carrier (APC) that was struck by Hamas anti-tank fire in Shuja'iyya. The bodies of six of his comrades were recovered and declared dead two days later. Although Hamas claimed Shaul was captured, he was initially classified as missing in action. Only on July 25 did the IDF officially determine, based on battlefield evidence, that he had been killed, designating him a fallen soldier whose burial place was unknown. Before that, Shaul’s family first learned about the incident through a WhatsApp message. the war in 2014 was Israel’s first major military campaign in the smartphone era, where instant messaging apps spread real-time information—often tragically accurate—at an uncontrollable pace. This was the case when a message titled 'APC Incident with Casualties' reached Oron’s brother, Aviram Shaul. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For a decade, the Shaul family fought to bring him home. At one point, his mother Zehava and brothers Aviram and Ofek petitioned the Supreme Court, alleging that the IDF was withholding information and demanding access to documents related to Oron’s fate. Their request was denied. His father, Herzl Shaul, passed away in 2016 without witnessing the mission’s conclusion. The formal reclassification of Oron Shaul as a 'captured fallen soldier' only came after the October 7 Hamas attack. 'The IDF finally admitted how absurd it was to say ‘burial place unknown,’' Aviram told Ynet. 'For years, we fought to change that designation. We even went to the Supreme Court and lost. To me, it was hypocrisy. The only thing that changed was that now there were more fallen soldiers held by Hamas. But Oron had clearly been taken—his vest and helmet were found in a tunnel in Gaza. There was no escaping the truth. The IDF’s refusal to acknowledge it was inexplicable.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hylbs4li1x	2025-02-28T23:12:04-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/11/21/9610964/9610964_0_0_980_981_0_small.jpg
A heartfelt journal of a severely wounded Golani officer	After sustaining life threatening injuries in his lungs, face and hands, a Golani officer document road to recovery in journal; says his daughters were constantly on his mind: 'I told myself, ‘Survive for them'' 'After more than ten minutes in the air, Vitaly leaned close to my ear and whispered that we were on our way to Tel Aviv, to Sourasky Medical Center. Inside, I felt the first hint of relief. My mind and emotions were deeply consumed by the event, but that whisper—Tel Aviv, Sourasky—was profoundly powerful to me. It represented a sharp transition from the harsh realities of the battlefield to the place where my greatest joy came into the world: Sourasky, the hospital where my children were born.' There’s something magnetic about B., in the way he writes and speaks. It’s as though he carries an internal fire for action and creation—one that, not so long ago, also resonated through the strings of his beloved guitar. Today, due to his injury, he can no longer play the guitar but instead plays the piano (with remarkable skill) at Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. As part of his rehabilitation, B. decided to document his journey in what he calls his 'injury journal.' He explains that it’s not a form of emotional therapy but rather a personal document he plans to one day pass on to his children when they ask, 'What did Dad do in the war?' B., who was severely injured in Lebanon, sees writing his journal as a tribute to his family. 'My words are heartfelt, and this journal is my way of honoring my wife and children.' When it came time to sit down and share his story, B. hesitated. A 35-year-old Tel Aviv resident and finance manager at a high-tech company, B. wasn’t sure he wanted to talk about the heroic events in which he saved himself and another soldier from a burning shelter that was hit by a drone on October 8, near a northern border outpost. 'During that moment, I stared death in the face, and it gave me a minute to think about everything. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind, but one of them was that I hadn’t left any message for my family. No words for my children to explain why Dad had been gone for so long on reserve duty, in case I didn’t make it. My family gave me the drive to survive, and now this is my way of giving back to them—by telling the story. Beyond that, it helps me in my recovery. Writing feels like a form of meditation.' Like so many reservists in their thirties, the war upended B.’s life without warning. Since the fighting began, he has spent dozens of days on the northern border across three rounds of reserve duty. On October 7, the Hamas attack found him with his family at his parents’ home in Ma’ale Adumim. 'It was my wife who woke me up and showed me that infamous image of the pickup truck in Sderot. At first, I didn’t know if it was real, but then the air raid siren went off. I ran to the synagogue to bring the kids, who were with my parents, and when I got back, the phone rang. As a sergeant in the 769th Battalion, I knew I was being called up. I quickly packed my things and drove to the meeting point.' B. completed two full rounds in the tense north, just before the situation escalated. He received his third reserve duty call-up while on a family vacation in Thailand—a trip he had organized to briefly escape the situation. 'I knew it might happen. We had been prepared for it, and when the call came, I didn’t tell my wife immediately. I waited until we were on the plane to drop that ‘bombshell.’ It wasn’t an easy conversation. We were on our way back from Thailand, and I had to tell the mother of my two children that I was returning to the hell of real war.' In his journal, B. describes the moment like this: 'I felt a strange mix of excitement and dread about entering Lebanon.' B. arrived at the northern base immediately after Rosh Hashanah. Three days later, he sustained a severe injury. 'I suppose it was the quickest way to get back to Tel Aviv,' he jokes, his dark humor surfacing as he recalls the incident. 'I didn’t plan for this to happen. In fact, I was thrilled at the prospect of entering Lebanon. There was this internal excitement mixed with pride. Even when I was in Thailand and heard about what the country had done to Hezbollah, I felt proud—proud of our ability to return to high levels of cunning and strategy. I wanted to be there, to be part of it.' On the morning of October 8, 2024, exactly one year and one day after the war began, B. was severely wounded at a base near the Lebanese border. 'It was the quietest morning we’d had. I woke up at five to help secure some forces. By seven, I looked at the sky and thought to myself how wonderful it was to hear that silence. I was in the operations room when it all began. Out of nowhere, drones started falling on the base. I ran to the shelter to prepare equipment with another soldier, and suddenly, a drone hit one of the base’s structures near the shelter, causing a massive explosion.' The blast trapped B. and the other soldier inside the shelter, which caught fire. 'Flames and smoke created a wall, and we knew no one could come in to rescue us. The heat was unbearable, and we couldn’t even see the short distance to the door. Outside, I could hear shouting and bullets whizzing by. Later, I learned the fire had ignited the ammunition. Inside, all I knew was that we were in a major event.' Seconds into the incident, B. realized the severity of the situation. 'It was clear no one could get to us, and that this would be a painful and fiery end. We couldn’t even exchange words—the rising heat drove us to silence. At one point, I hugged my friend and told him I loved him. I hoped I’d pass out, but I couldn’t. Suddenly, my child’s face appeared in my mind. I couldn’t believe this was how it was going to end.' Through the thick black smoke, B. spotted a ray of sunlight piercing through. Together with his friend, he decided to run through the fire to save themselves. 'We just looked at each other and said, ‘Let’s run.’' B. was the first to make contact with the flames during what became the run of his life—a mere seven meters. 'We had to move obstacles out of the way, which caused burns on our hands, but I didn’t care. We made it out and reached another shelter, where I collapsed on the floor. At that moment, I realized I was in serious trouble; I couldn’t breathe. The pain in my body was excruciating, and from that point on, I could only take shallow sips of air until I was evacuated. It was terrifying. Later, I learned I had sustained lung injuries from the blast and inhaled toxic gases.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the minutes before his evacuation, B.’s thoughts were with his daughters. 'I told myself, ‘Survive for them. Don’t make things harder for the others handling the situation.’ I felt surrounded by the country’s bravest lions, and this is a good time to thank them. It’s always reassuring to know you’re in the company of lions.' When B. arrived at the hospital, he could barely whisper due to his injuries. Yet when asked to inform his partner of his condition, he hesitated. 'I thought it was too much for me to handle. I sat there for ten minutes because I couldn’t remember her number. In the end, I managed. I didn’t know what to say, but when she heard my voice, she started crying. Then I passed the phone to the casualty officer.' Weeks later, B. decided to take on the task of writing his injury journal. It serves as both a record of what he endured over the past year and a half and as part of his occupational therapy to rehabilitate his hands, which suffered severe burns. 'I write at least three or four times a week. At first, because of the pain, I could only write for a few minutes at a time. I’d write, then rest, and then write again. Over time, I’ve been able to extend those periods. Now, I can sometimes write for half an hour or even an hour.' So far, B. has documented everything leading up to his injury. He plans to continue writing about his hospitalization—when he wasn’t sure he’d survive—and his rehabilitation. He approaches the process with minimal self-censorship and takes pride in his progress. 'My words are heartfelt and unfiltered. There are things I don’t want to remember, so they don’t make it in. My focus is on my children and what I want them to read someday. I want them to know what we endured as a family during this war—what all reservist families endured, whether injured or not. Writing helps me with my hands, and I’ve even started drawing to improve my dexterity. I’ve returned to playing the piano. Above all, I want to return to reserve duty. It has to be something that suits my limitations, but I want to keep contributing. I was an integral part of Israel’s security, and I want to continue being one.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hjh55u39ye	2025-02-28T22:34:46-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/ry04tQsYJg/ry04tQsYJg_1_75_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Illinois jury convicts man in hate crime murder of Palestinian Am...	Joseph Czuba, 73, faces life in prison when he is sentenced in May for a murder that prosecutors said was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred An Illinois jury on Friday found a man guilty of murder and hate crime charges for an October 2023 stabbing that killed a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy and severely wounded his mother, according to court documents. Joseph Czuba, 73, faces life in prison when he is sentenced in May for a murder that prosecutors said was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. It took place just days after Hamas militants carried out an October 7, 2023 attack inside Israel. The murder of the boy, Wadee Alfayoumi, and the attack on his mother, Hanan Shaheen, was one of the earliest and worst hate crime incidents in the U.S. since the start of the Israel-Gaza war. Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch (18-cm) serrated blade, authorities said. Shaheen suffered multiple stab wounds in the attack that occurred in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Chicago. During the trial this week, Shaheen testified that Czuba told her 'you, as a Muslim, must die'. Michael Fitzgerald, prosecutor at Will County State's Attorney's Office, presented a 911 call's recording in the trial. 'The landlord is killing me and my baby,' Shaheen is heard saying on the audio. Czuba had earlier pleaded not guilty and did not testify during the trial that started on Tuesday. Other U.S. incidents raising alarm over anti-Arab bias include the attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian American girl in Texas, the stabbing of a Palestinian American man in Texas, the beating of a Muslim man in New York, a violent mob attack on pro-Palestinian protesters in California and a Florida shooting of two Israeli visitors whom a suspect mistook to be Palestinians.

The group said it hoped Ankara would release Ocalan, held in near total isolation since 1999, so he can lead a process of disarmament, adding that the necessary political and democratic conditions need to be established for the process to succeed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryishmesjg	2025-02-28T21:01:39-08:00

Cairo talks focus on extending ceasefire amid fragile hostage neg...	Israel attempts to secure additional hostage releases before Saturday, but chances appear slim as discussions with Hamas on extending the deal terms have only just begun Negotiations regarding the continuation of the hostage deal have been ongoing in Cairo since Thursday. According to Egyptian sources who spoke to Reuters, Israel is attempting to extend the first phase by 42 days, meaning Hamas would release three hostages each week in exchange for prisoners released from Israeli jails. Sources in Cairo added Hamas does not agree to this and wishes to proceed to Phase B as originally agreed, which would bring the war to an end. An Israeli source confirmed only that 'the goal is indeed to extend Phase A.' Israel’s aim was to secure the release of additional hostages by Saturday, but sources familiar with the details say the chances of achieving results in the near term are 'low,' as negotiations on the terms for the continuation have just begun. If there is no additional release on Saturday, it will mark the first weekend during Donald Trump’s presidency in which no hostages have been released—after 42 days and despite his strong threats against Hamas. Over the course of the deal, 33 hostages have been released in nine stages, 25 alive and eight deceased. Hamas—and Arab media outlets—are accusing Israel of being unwilling to proceed to Phase B. Today, the organization officially announced the completion of the final stage of the deal and stated that they have fulfilled all of their obligations under it. In a statement identical to one released on Thursday, Hamas called on the international community to 'apply pressure' on Israel to move forward with Phase B 'without any delay or evasion.' On Thursday, Hamas spokesperson Abd al-Latif al-Qanou stated that the terror organization is 'ready to extend Phase A or merge the two phases, but only in accordance with our red lines.' This morning, sources in the organization told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that whether Phase A is extended or Phase B begins, they will demand that Israel release 'more prisoners' in exchange for the remaining hostages in Gaza. According to the sources, who referred to the remaining hostages as 'military' even though not all are soldiers, 'the criteria will be 'different' from what was agreed upon in the past, as the price must be proportional.' This suggests that the terror organization may demand the release of 150 prisoners or more for each hostage. Meanwhile, Israel has announced that it will not withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor, receiving backing from Trump, who stated that he would accept any decision by Israel since Hamas has not responded to the ultimatum to return all hostages at once. If hostages are not released soon, it is expected that fighting will resume, with Defense Minister Israel Katz warning that Hamas is 'planning attacks on soldiers and communities.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As efforts to extend the ceasefire continue in Cairo, media outlets in Gaza reported on Friday that IDF carried out a drone strike in central Rafah, killing one Palestinian. At the same time, relatives of freed hostage Liri Albag held a celebration in her honor. During the event—before raising a toast—she said: 'There are still 59 hostages that I want to bring back; they are my family. I want to say that although I’ve returned home, I won’t feel complete until everyone is back.' Shir Siegel speaks in Shokeda Forest Shir, daughter of freed hostage Keith Siegel, visited the Gaza border area on Friday for the first time since October 7. 'If you had asked me a year and a half ago if there was a chance I would stand here and speak about hostages—I would have laughed,' Shir said at an event supporting local businesses, marking Family Day in Shokeda Forest. 'No one believed such a day would come, where so many people would be talking about hostages. Honestly, until my dad returned, I didn’t really believe it either—it felt like a nightmare, not reality.' She continued: 'Not far from here, my parents and my best friend were kidnapped. This is a place I have a love-hate relationship with—love for the landscape, the people, the community, and hate because of the fear, the race to the bomb shelter. I’m used to bad things happening here, but I didn’t realize just how horrific the situation had become. Since then, I’ve been on a tumultuous journey of anxiety and fear, disappointment with those who were supposed to take responsibility, and the realization that the responsibility is on all of us. A journey of pleading, of hugs and connections, which taught us so much.' 'We went through hell, but today I want to talk about the good. Every day in captivity, my dad asked the hostages to name one thing they could be grateful for. He returned to his faith and would pray and give thanks for what little they had. In hell, small acts of gratitude lit up days of darkness and silence. One of the first questions he asked when he got home was, 'What can I do to bring everyone back?' We leave no one behind—these are values of mutual responsibility, the redemption of captives, and the faith that we must never give up on any of our brothers and sisters.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by1xxlkiye	2025-02-28T12:29:01-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/rkXqjHT5kl/rkXqjHT5kl_0_299_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Explosive argument erupts between Trump, Zelensky in Oval Office ...	You’re running low on soldiers,' Trump told Zelensky during their heated White House meeting, accusing the Ukrainian president of ingratitude and disrespect; The tense exchange over peace negotiations and mineral agreements dissolved into accusations, with Trump declaring, 'I think we’ve seen enough' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had high expectations for his meeting with his American counterpart, Donald Trump, at the White House, emphasizing in the past the importance of meeting before Trump’s discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it seems that Ukrainian hopes for a shift in the Trump administration’s approach toward Ukraine were completely dashed on Friday evening. The diplomatic summit surrounding the mineral agreement turned into a loud exchange of accusations and harsh, disparaging remarks, culminating in Zelensky effectively being shown the door at the White House. Trump has recently displayed a hostile attitude toward Zelensky, even referring to him as a 'dictator.' Although the two exchanged a handshake upon Zelensky’s arrival in Washington, tensions quickly escalated, and the strained relationship between the two leaders came to the surface. 'You’re either going to make a deal, or we’re out,' Trump angrily told Zelensky. 'And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s gonna be pretty, but you’ll fight it out. You don’t have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position, but you’re not acting at all thankful, and that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing.' Trump added, 'Your country is in big trouble. Your people are dying. You’re running low on soldiers. Listen, you’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing if you could get a ceasefire right now. I tell you, you’d take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed. Of course, we want to stop the war, but I’m saying you don’t want a ceasefire, do you?' At the height of the argument, the two began speaking over each other, and Trump used the moment to take a jab at his predecessor, Joe Biden: 'That wasn’t with me. That was with a guy named Biden, who was not a smart person. That was, excuse me, that was with Obama who gave you sheets, and I gave you javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets, and Trump gave javelins.' Zelensky retorted dismissively, 'In three days—I’ve heard that from Putin.' Trump responded, 'It’s going to be very hard to do business like this. I'd just say thank you.' During the argument, Trump also said, 'You’re not showing any gratitude at all. That’s not nice. I’ll be honest—it’s not nice.' He further mocked Zelensky in a dismissive tone, saying, 'Then you’ll say, ‘I don’t want a ceasefire, I don’t want a ceasefire! I want to go and I want this.’' Shortly thereafter, Trump addressed the media: 'I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think? Uh, this is gonna be great television, I will say that.' Following the meeting, Trump posted an official statement on his X account (formerly Twitter): 'We had a significant meeting at the White House. I recognized that Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved because he believes our involvement gives him a huge advantage in negotiations. I don’t want an advantage—I want peace. He demonstrated disrespect toward the United States in the Oval Office. He can return when he’s ready for peace.' U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who was also present at the meeting, likewise accused Zelensky of disrespect. Zelensky responded, 'I signed a ceasefire in 2019, but Putin violated it and launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine in 2022. What diplomacy are you talking about, J.D.?' Vance replied, 'I think it’s disrespectful of you to come into the Oval Office and try to debate this in front of the American media.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: This difficult meeting came despite a relatively positive statement from Zelensky beforehand, in which he claimed he 'thought Trump was on their side.' The Ukrainian president demanded that Trump 'not compromise with a murderer,' referring, of course, to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who started the war with Ukraine. The mineral agreement discussed in recent days would allow the United States access to Ukrainian minerals but does not provide a security guarantee in return, a disappointment for Ukraine. Trump, however, argues that American business involvement would provide a form of security guarantee. Zelensky had hoped to use the meeting with Trump and his visit to Washington to bolster American support, which has shifted since the change in administration. Under President Biden, Ukraine received billions of dollars in weapons and ammunition from the United States. Trump, on the other hand, seeks to reclaim the funds provided as support to Ukraine and bring an end to the war while strengthening U.S.-Russia relations. 'I hope to be remembered as the one who brought peace,' Trump said, praising Ukrainian soldiers for their bravery. The American president made it clear to his Ukrainian counterpart that 'the United States wants to bring the war to an end and invest the funds in other priorities like rebuilding efforts.' Before the meeting, Trump told the media that a ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and Russia was close and described the upcoming mineral deal as very fair. According to the agreement, Ukraine would transfer 50% of the revenues from government-owned minerals to a reconstruction fund jointly managed by American and Ukrainian ownership. The agreement, however, does not specify exactly how these funds will be used. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjjshf1skl	2025-02-28T10:02:33-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/H1r11eF1jke/H1r11eF1jke_0_120_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Keith Siegel on captivity: 'living with shortness of breath, ches...	Keith Siegel described horrific conditions during his Hamas captivity, including being held in tunnels and moved 33 times; Meeting with Minister of Housing and Construction Yitzhak Goldknopf, Siegel emphasized the urgent need to rescue remaining hostages and shared his recovery journey Keith Siegel, a survivor of captivity, shared his experiences during his time as a hostage held by Hamas in a meeting with Minister of Housing and Construction Yitzhak Goldknopf. Keith revealed that he was held at times with his wife, as well as with other hostages, and was transferred to different locations no fewer than 33 times, including two tunnels and two schools in the Gaza Strip. Keith recounted that during the abduction on the day of the massacre, 'We went through three vehicles. They kidnapped us from our home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza using my car, and when we entered Gaza, they transferred us to a local vehicle, and after some time, they transferred us again. They also placed a bag over our heads so we couldn’t see. I don’t know how long it lasted, but from there, we arrived at a house, and from it, we descended into a tunnel. We were kept in that tunnel for three days. After that, we came out for a period of two or three weeks, and then we were taken back into a tunnel again.' Keith described the second tunnel where he was held as 'particularly deep—they told us it was 40 meters underground. We had to walk 15 steps to get to the bathroom, which had no air. It was like living with shortness of breath, chest pain, and pressure. They left us there alone from about 5:00 PM until 8:00 AM the next morning. If something had happened to us, there was no one to talk to. They told us, 'If there's a problem, go to the stairs and call for us to come.' One night, while I was with my wife, another hostage with us wasn’t feeling well and needed medication. 'We went and shouted at them, but no one came until we gave up. We returned, and only the next morning did the terrorists arrive. Even getting out of that tunnel was an ordeal. Part of the way, we climbed improvised stairs, and at another part, we crawled to the exit. We emerged from the tunnel miraculously, after all three of us were exhausted and dehydrated. We received very little water and food.' Keith also shared that he was transferred between no fewer than 33 locations during his captivity, including two schools, and was held with other hostages, including one young hostage. 'I remember all 33 dates; that’s how many times they moved us,' Keith said, noting that he could identify the locations and even name the terrorists. The meeting with Goldknopf took place last week and was organized by media figure Israel Cohen, who works to connect hostage families with the ultra-Orthodox community. During the meeting, the minister said to Keith: 'It was important for me to meet you and hear about the horrors you experienced at the hands of the despicable terrorists in Gaza. My thoughts are constantly with the hostages who remain in captivity after the conclusion of this phase of the deal. As I’ve done so far, I will continue to support any deal. Your descriptions reinforce what we already knew—that this is a matter of saving lives and the utmost necessity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier on Thursday, Keith and his wife Aviva, who was released during the first hostage deal, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara. Their daughter Shir, who became a prominent figure in the fight for the hostages' release, also participated in the meeting. Netanyahu’s office stated that Keith 'wanted to thank the Prime Minister for his efforts to secure his release and that of other hostages.' Additionally, Shir and Aviva 'also expressed their gratitude to the Prime Minister’s wife, Sara, for her work on behalf of the hostages’ release.' During what was described as a warm meeting, the Prime Minister and his wife told the Siegel family that 'together with all of Israel, they are deeply moved to see Keith back home.' Netanyahu said that he had promised Aviva and Shir that Keith would return home and was happy that this promise had been fulfilled. Sara added that the hostages were freed thanks to the courage, bravery, and sacrifice of the soldiers in battle. She also noted that she 'personally witnesses the extraordinary efforts the Prime Minister is making for the sacred mission of bringing back all of our hostages.' Keith shared with them the hardships he endured in captivity, his struggles, and the process of recovery since his return. 'For me, the story isn’t over. While I’ve returned, the responsibility lies with me and with you to bring everyone back. Our friends are still there, and it’s hard for me to return knowing they remain. I know you’re doing a lot—keep showing courage and leadership,' he told them. The Prime Minister responded, 'I am constantly working to secure the release of the remaining hostages. I will not give up on anyone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry6e28js1x	2025-02-28T07:04:36-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/BJbbnKVA5Jx/BJbbnKVA5Jx_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

Israeli Navy foiled Hamas infiltration by sea on Oct. 7, but dead...	IDF probe finds Navy forces quickly repelled Hamas' amphibious attack, eliminating most infiltrators; failure to stop all terrorists allowed 16 to reach Zikim beach and murder 17 people On October 7, the battle at sea ended in less than an hour thanks to a swift response from IDF Navy forces, even though no reinforcements were sent to the coastline overnight, even after warning signs emerged. The Navy had even been instructed not to raise its alert level, yet still managed to eliminate about half of the Hamas terrorists who attempted to infiltrate by sea. However, those who did make it ashore murdered 17 people at Zikim beach, near the Gaza border. As part of the IDF’s core investigations into the failures of October 7, released Thursday for the first time since the attack, the military reviewed the Navy’s response. The investigation found that the rapid reaction of the Ashdod-based 916th Flotilla, which was on routine patrol off the Gaza coast that morning, was key in quickly ending the battle. The IDF’s Southern Command and the Gaza Division had not issued warnings about unusual activity the night before the massacre and the Navy also did not reinforce its presence despite signs of an impending attack. However, the commander of the Navy’s elite unit did arrive at the Ashdod base overnight and an additional patrol boat was placed on standby for rapid deployment. The decision was made after a late-night update from Gaza Division commander Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld to the Ashdod base commander regarding suspicious signals. Despite this, the navy was explicitly ordered not to increase its alert level. 'Do not conduct unusual activity at sea so that Hamas does not realize we are watching them more closely tonight due to the warning signs,' the directive said. Timeline of the attack At 6:29 a.m., the Navy’s surveillance detected hundreds of large Palestinian fishing boats along the coast, under whose cover Hamas naval commandos launched their attack. Four minutes later, at 6:33 a.m., the Ashdod naval base declared a confirmed terror attack from the sea, issuing an alert equivalent to the IDF’s highest-level ground incursion protocol. At 6:37 a.m., the Navy requested that Israeli police evacuate Zikim beach and called on the Gaza Division to send infantry forces to secure the shore, in case some of the terrorists managed to breach Israel’s defenses. However, in a disturbing incident that has yet to be explained by Southern Command, an infantry force deployed to the area failed to engage the Hamas squad that landed at Zikim beach. Instead, the soldiers lay on the ground about 100 meters (330 feet) away and later retreated. The terrorists then seized their open-top vehicle and drove toward nearby Kibbutz Zikim. A Navy lookout, noticing the failure to stop the terrorists, took the initiative and called the Zikim security chief, warning him about the incoming threat. The security chief managed to mobilize the local emergency alert squad, which intercepted and killed the terrorists before they could reach the kibbutz. In total, the navy destroyed five of the seven Hamas boats at sea, killing 22 out of the 38 terrorists who attempted an amphibious invasion. However, 16 terrorists successfully made it ashore. Navy officers acknowledge shortcomings 'The forces responded quickly and decisively but our weapons weren’t lethal enough,' navy officers admitted in the investigation. 'In one instance, a commander hesitated for a full minute before opening fire on an enemy boat due to restrictive engagement rules that have been in place since 2014’s Operation Protective Edge.' 'We failed in our mission to defend Israel from the sea,' The report concluded. 'We were not prepared for such a large-scale surprise attack — only for a more limited infiltration scenario.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkvjewr9ye	2025-02-28T04:41:51-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/10/SJzORGRhR/SJzORGRhR_2_43_802_452_0_small.jpg

Syrian media reports Israeli forces searching homes collected information on residents before firing warning shots when locals gathered around them; shortly after, demonstrators near Damascus protest Israeli control in border region Israeli forces entered the Syrian village of Rafeed, south of Quneitra, on Friday morning, searching several homes before withdrawing after clashes with residents, the IDF said. According to the military, dozens of Syrians gathered in front of the soldiers during the searches, prompting troops to fire warning shots into the air to disperse the crowd before leaving the area. Syrian media claimed the soldiers were not only conducting searches but also 'gathering information on residents' in the village. Shortly after the incident, dozens of people gathered in the city of Douma, near Damascus, to protest what they called 'ongoing Israeli violations in southern Syria.' Demonstrators carried signs opposing Israeli control in the border region, with messages proclaiming 'the Syrian people are united.' The protests come days after Israeli airstrikes targeted multiple sites in Syria, attacks for which Israel took responsibility. Some demonstrators reportedly called on Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa to 'strike Tel Aviv' in response. On Monday, protests erupted across Syria following remarks by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called for 'the complete demilitarization of southern Syria from the new regime's forces' and vowed to protect the country’s Druze population. 'We will not tolerate any threat against the Druze community in southern Syria,' Netanyahu said, adding that Israeli forces would remain stationed 'in the Mount Hermon area and the buffer zone indefinitely.'

Israel wants to extend first phase of Gaza truce by six weeks, Eg...	An Israeli delegation in Cairo aims to negotiate to extend the first phase of the Gaza cease-fire deal by an additional 42 days, two Egyptian security sources said on Friday. Hamas opposes the extension and insists on proceeding to the second phase of the deal as originally agreed, the sources told Reuters. The second phase is meant to include steps leading to a permanent end to the war. The first phase of the cease-fire is set to end on Saturday, and the warring parties have yet to clarify what will happen if no agreement is reached by then. Egypt and Qatar are mediating the talks, with U.S. support. In a statement on Friday, the Palestinian terrorist group urged the international community to press Israel to immediately enter the second phase without any delay. Two Israeli government officials had told Reuters that Israel was seeking to extend the initial phase, with Hamas freeing three hostages each week in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjkgvvjj1g	2025-02-28T04:15:45-08:00	
Begin’s unpublished writings to be released on 33rd anniversary o...	In newly revealed 65-page document, former prime minister warns Israel must remain strong to deter its enemies and calls for an independent judiciary free from government pressure A collection of previously unseen documents, letters and articles written by former Prime Minister Menachem Begin will be made public next week, coinciding with the 33rd anniversary of his death. Among the handwritten papers is a document outlining Begin’s views on human rights, the need for a constitution and the tension between the judiciary and the legislature. In 1952, Begin wrote a 65-page paper titled A Personal View, A National View and Basic Principles. Due to austerity measures in the young state of Israel, he drafted it on discarded rolls of paper from a printing press. 'There is no justice without courts,' Begin wrote. 'Justices are but flesh and blood and may make mistakes, be bribed or afraid, but the determinative role of the court in our society is not the human weaknesses of any particular judge but the ‘psychological position’ given to that institution and those who sit in judgment.' He argued that both the judiciary and authorities must uphold the courts’ complete independence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Herzl Makov, CEO of the Menachem Begin Heritage Center, described the documents as a reflection of Begin’s political philosophy and humility. 'It is a sharp political analysis that distills Begin’s liberal-national worldview,' he said. In the writings, Begin also addressed Israel’s territorial aspirations and the necessity of national might. He warned that Israel’s security depended on its power. 'Anyone with eyes in his head knows that when we are strong, we will not be attacked by the Arabs, even without signed agreements. And if we are weak, our Arab enemies will rise to destroy us, even if such agreements are forged in diplomacy.' Begin criticized Israel’s early leaders for conceding historical lands, lamenting that they agreed to establish the state without key biblical sites within its borders. 'National leaders were found willing to sign, in the name of the people of Israel, that Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem, Jericho, Nablus and all the good land east of the Jordan would not be ours. Is there a national-historic crime equal to this?' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkukk7jj1g	2025-02-28T03:41:06-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/BkTacJyi1e/BkTacJyi1e_3_0_852_479_0_small.jpg

Former IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus says U.S. leaders have been specifically emphasizing that all remaining Israeli hostages, including four Americans, should be returned immediately The U.S. administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has relayed the message that if they were in charge in Israel, they would 'do things differently,' according to former IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus. He said U.S. leaders have been specifically emphasizing that all remaining Israeli hostages, including four Americans, should be returned immediately—'not that it would be a deal that would take a lot of time to implement, but to return the Israeli hostages together and to do it quickly.' Conricus added that he believes this will be an important angle in the ongoing hostage-for-ceasefire negotiations taking place in Cairo.

Pre-military academy honors fallen soldier Regev Amar	Russell Robinson: 'To be able to participate, open something so quickly, and see so many young people… you feel the energy of tomorrow here' Fifty students, parents, and supporters gathered in Kibbutz Sde Nehemia, near the Lebanese border, to unveil new signs and renovated buildings at a pre-military academy where students sleep, learn, and spend time. The academy is named after Staff Sergeant Regev Amar and is located on the kibbutz where he was raised. Amar was killed in battle while defending Kibbutz Kissufim on October 7. His family sought to honor his memory by educating the next generation in his name. The Upper Galilee Leadership Institute established the new pre-military program in Amar’s honor, with the support of donors like JNF-USA. Thanks to hundreds of thousands of shekels in donations, students from across Israel who are about to enlist now have access to this unique program. 'In honor of Regev, who lost his life trying to protect our Jewish nation, his mother Gilanit had a dream—this is something he would have wanted,' said Russell Robinson, CEO of Jewish National Fund-USA. 'To be able to participate, open something so quickly, and see so many young people… you feel the energy of tomorrow here.' 'He was really an inspiration for all of us,' added Amos Moshe, a friend of Amar's. 'Everyone remembers him. After October 7, after Regev died, the whole kibbutz changed. Everything became a memorial. It’s hard, but it’s also very emotional to create so many memories of one true friend—everyone knew him. That’s why the whole kibbutz came together today.' Amar’s friends and family were in tears as the ceremony took place. The program officially opened its doors in August.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjhgvq1sye	2025-02-28T03:12:21-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/SJcxdQkoyl/SJcxdQkoyl_0_0_734_418_0_small.jpg
Annexation debate: Will Israeli sovereignty bring security or glo...	Annexation would force Israel to choose between two difficult paths: denying Palestinians citizenship and becoming an apartheid state or granting them equal rights and risking the country's Jewish majority and national identity,' says Dan Perry It's been nearly four weeks since former U.S. President Donald Trump said he'd soon reveal his stance on the issue of enacting Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. If he gives the go-ahead, what would that mean for Israel, the Palestinians, and the wider region? Would this move strengthen security and stability—or trigger a global backlash? And why are Christian conservatives and U.S. Republicans rallying behind it? These were the questions debated this week on ILTV's Insider. Dan Perry, former chief editor of the Associated Press (AP) for the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean, warned that Israel should not annex the entire West Bank 'because the long-term costs would outweigh any short-term gains in sovereignty or security. ' Malkah Fleisher, an influencer and settler, took the opposite view. The co-founder of B'yadaim Shelanu, a women's security initiative in Judea and Samaria, said failing to enact sovereignty has 'only earned international contempt and local Arab derision. We have gained nothing from the lie of a two-state solution and from giving land away to a foreign entity.' According to Perry, annexation would force Israel to choose between two difficult paths: denying Palestinians citizenship and becoming an apartheid state or granting them equal rights and risking the country's Jewish majority and national identity. Today, nearly three million Palestinians live in Judea and Samaria, primarily in Areas A and B, which are under Palestinian Authority control. In the same region, approximately 465,000 Jews reside in Area C. Inside Israel's pre-1967 borders, known as inside the 'Green Line,' including Jerusalem, there are 7.2 million Jews and two million Arabs. Perry argued that neither scenario is sustainable for Israel. However, if annexation moves forward, he believes Israel would likely sacrifice its democratic character. 'It would create a system where two populations live under one authority but with vastly different rights,' he said. The result, he warned, 'would erode Israel's moral standing, risk a major outbreak of violence, and gradually invite global pariah status, which would crush Israel's export-driven economy.' But Fleisher disagrees. She told ILTV that it should be clear to everyone that the Oslo doctrine has been a 'colossal failure.' 'The areas that have been given over to the control of the Palestinian Authority have become jihadist and Judenrein,' Fleisher said. 'October 7 is all the proof any logical Israeli should need that when Israel loses control over parts of its land and allows jihadists to take over; it is a recipe for attacks against us.' She argued that the IDF has repeatedly emphasized the need to prepare for another large-scale attack originating from Judea and Samaria. 'With huge Hamas strongholds like Hebron being left to their own devices to strengthen and reinforce terrorist ideology, including its cynical brainwashing of its children, we are leaving ourselves vulnerable to an attack at any time,' Fleisher contended. 'Israel taking control of these areas, forcing out terrorist hegemony, ripping out jihadist educational curriculum, and expelling anti-Israel elements, we are providing security that has eluded Israel throughout its history.' Watch previous issues of ILTV Insider: Is Israel Winning This War, Or Just Prolonging The Inevitable? Is Trump’s Gaza Strategy a Diplomatic Breakthrough or a Disaster? Should Israel Consider a Nuclear Strike on Iran? Fleisher also emphasized Judea and Samaria's deep historical and religious significance to the Jewish people. She noted that many key landmarks—such as the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, and the site of the first Tabernacle in Shiloh—are located there. In her view, the real question is not whether Israel should enact sovereignty but what the status of non-Jews would be in the newly annexed territory. 'The question is not whether Israel should govern [this territory], but what the status is of other peoples living in our land,' Fleisher said. 'We cannot allow the difficulty of this question to undermine the truth and the rationality of the Jewish people holding on to its land.' Perry, however, argued that if Trump does greenlight some form of annexation, Israel's far-right leaders would likely choose to annex Area C—where most Jewish communities are already located—rather than the entire West Bank. While this would leave disconnected Palestinian enclaves under Palestinian Authority control, he said it would carry fewer risks than full annexation. Fleisher rejected that idea as well. She said that being 'generous' by '[our] willingness to gift [the land] to a terror state as a way of seeming moderate and praiseworthy in the eyes of the international community, in reality, [has] only earned international contempt and local Arab derision.' She added, 'We have gained nothing from the lie of a two-state solution and from giving land away to a foreign entity.' On the other hand, Perry warned that fully annexing the West Bank would be disastrous for Israel's diplomatic relations, economic stability, and security. 'Such a move would mark a dramatic departure from decades of international consensus supporting a two-state solution,' he told ILTV. 'Europe, Israel's largest trading partner, could impose severe economic sanctions, undermining Israel's prosperity. Diplomatic isolation would be swift, with countries worldwide condemning the annexation as a violation of international law.' He added that the decision would also threaten Israel's security ties with neighboring countries. 'It would also risk diplomatic and security ties with neighboring countries like Jordan and Egypt and end the prospects for wider peace in the region,' Perry continued. 'Both nations would face domestic pressure to sever peace agreements with Israel, potentially destabilizing regional security—and it would end prospects for wider peace.' Moreover, he argued that such a move would make Israel a partisan issue in the United States, alienating young liberal Americans, including many American Jews. He said Israel's challenge is not choosing between democracy and Judaism but balancing both. 'Israel should never be tempted to think that theocracy or suicidal ultranationalist fantasies are somehow more Jewish,' he said. Fleisher balked at this idea. Instead, she told ILTV that the world is shifting 'back to healthy nationalism and common sense,' and many countries are looking to Israel for courage, strength, and honesty. 'The American president and administration and the American people are strongly behind us, maybe more vociferously than ever before, as they too fight to rectify the takeover of broken progressive ideas and practices that have been leading their country down the wrong path,' Fleisher said. 'India, Argentina, Hungary, Poland, and more have shown interest in and solidarity with a strong Israel – not to mention Saudi Arabia.' According to Fleisher, when Israel stands firm in its beliefs, it earns respect. But when it succumbs to international pressure, its weakness becomes a tool for its enemies. She argued that the Trump administration has taken a 'stronger and prouder' nationalist stance on Israel than Israel itself has and that Israel's democratic values should not be mistaken for being identical to those of the United States. 'Israel is first and foremost a nation-state and a defensive one at that,' Fleisher said. 'Democracy is a value, but it is not above Judaism or the Jewish people. It has in it beautiful principles that Israel cares about, but it was meant to be a system that helped Israel enhance and actualize itself, not destroy itself.' Perry strongly disagreed. 'Israel was founded as both a Jewish and democratic state, and ultimately, its long-term security and prosperity depend on remaining both,' he argued. 'Annexation threatens this delicate balance because it would wipe out the Jews' demographic majority. That, then, is the irony: annexation, while motivated by religious Jewish fanaticism, does not make the country more but less Jewish in any way that is rooted in actual life in the real world.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk15pgyj1e	2025-02-28T02:36:22-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/16/r1fUqXyVdR/r1fUqXyVdR_1_166_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Minute by minute, the orders issued in response to 1st wave of Oc...	Probe finds IDF HQ failed to produce an accurate situational assessment in the critical early hours and the Operations Directorate was unable to break through the system’s constraints that morning Of all the IDF’s core investigations into the failures of October 7, the easiest was the review of the military’s Operations Directorate. This unit, based in the IDF’s underground command center, directs forces in both routine and emergency situations. Unlike other investigations that relied on commanders’ recollections — after months of combat in Gaza and Lebanon — this facility is monitored and recorded 24/7. At the time, the division was led by Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder, who was later appointed head of the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate (MID), replacing Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, who resigned over his role in the failures. The military’s supervising command post, activated within minutes that morning in the IDF’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv, is responsible for allocating and overseeing forces. The investigation found that until 6:29 a.m. on October 7, operations in the Gaza Division were proceeding as normal. At the time, 671 soldiers were stationed in the area, distributed among 14 companies in four regional security battalions. The report concluded that, given the chaos of the attack and the fact that a large-scale invasion was never considered a realistic threat, the deployment of forces was reasonable. Many commanders and soldiers rushed to the battlefield of their own accord. 'The General Staff’s operations center failed to produce an accurate situational assessment in the critical early hours and the Operations Directorate was unable to break through the system’s constraints that morning,' the report read. 'It was a catastrophic event with no outstanding performances or real-time feedback. There was also difficulty assessing the readiness of command posts in the Gaza Division.' However, the investigation also found that 'the decisions made in the first hours were reasonable, though in some locations, forces were not fully utilized. There were also gaps in the Air Force’s firepower deployment, particularly using fighter jets. While force mobilization aligned with readiness protocols, oversight of troop deployment was inadequate.' Fighting with no intelligence The investigation was conducted without cooperation from the Shin Bet and Israel Police, due to both security restrictions and a deliberate decision to prevent coordination of testimonies in the event of a future state commission of inquiry. 'We fought an entire day without intelligence,' IDF Southern Command officers said in the report, noting that the MID failed to detect thousands of terrorist phone and radio signals inside Israel. 'Even if we had 100 fighter jets that morning, we wouldn’t have known what to do with them because we weren’t prepared for this scenario,' one officer said. 'We had no pre-planned aerial attack strategy for even 10% of what took place. 'In the first 24 hours, we carried out 500 strikes in Gaza but the first dedicated attack cell wasn’t set up until 8:30 a.m. because it consisted of reservists who were still at home.' Southern Command chief’s mistakes According to the Southern Command’s internal review, IDF forces — despite being vastly outnumbered — managed to kill about 600 terrorists that morning. Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, who led the Southern Command, had correctly ordered the activation of the 'Parash Pleshet' protocol — an alert for hostile infiltration — but the scale of the attack far exceeded expectations. Soldiers guarding the Gaza border were operating under standard pre-dawn readiness procedures, with additional troops positioned outside at sunrise. Fourteen tanks were manned in the area that morning but one of the Gaza Division’s emergency reserve battalions was away on a training exercise in the Golan Heights, causing significant delays in reinforcements. Finkelman later told investigators that he had to 'reinvent' his forces that morning to respond to an unimaginable scenario. The key decisions he made included: - Prioritizing civilian rescue, rapidly flooding the area with troops despite the risks and lack of coordination. - Dividing the Gaza Division into three new divisions to regain command over forces. - Sealing the border with airstrikes — though belatedly. Finkelman also identified five critical mistakes he made: - Placing too much weight on immediate threats the night before the invasion, despite warning signs. - Failing to gather additional intelligence on both enemy movements and IDF force deployment. - Not initiating a cross-command discussion on closing the border fence, which could have enabled an airstrike an hour and a half earlier. - Not providing sufficient reinforcements to southern Gaza border communities that day. - Failing to establish a faster and safer civilian evacuation plan. Looking back, Finkelman, like many other senior officers, concluded that under no circumstances should terrorist organizations be allowed to establish and grow along Israel’s borders. Command failures on the ground The review of battlefield conduct found no significant cases of soldiers avoiding combat or deserting under fire. However, some IDF officials criticized the decision of Northern Gaza Brigade Commander Col. Haim Cohen to oversee the battle from the operations center rather than the field. His counterpart, Southern Brigade Commander Col. Asaf Hamami, was killed in combat and his body remains in Hamas captivity. Despite the criticism, Cohen’s presence in the command center allowed him to maintain some control over the situation. The human cost The toll of October 7 was devastating. According to IDF data, 1,320 people were murdered or killed that day, including 457 security forces personnel and first responders. Another 251 people were kidnapped to Gaza and thousands were wounded. Minute by minute In total, 5,500 terrorists entered Israel, carrying out a campaign of conquest, mass murder, rape and abduction in the western Negev. They breached 114 openings in the border fence, infiltrating through 59 routes with the aid of 57 drones, six paragliders, seven boats and a massive barrage of 3,889 rockets and mortars throughout the day. The timeline of orders issued by the Operations Directorate, alongside the Southern Command’s investigative chronology, reveals the extent of the chaos that day — and how the IDF was unaware, in real time, of the scale of the massacres unfolding in the kibbutzim and at the Nova music festival: 6:29–7:00 a.m. – The first wave of 1,175 Hamas terrorists, mostly from the elite Nukhba forces, infiltrates southern Israel under cover of a 1,400-rocket and mortar barrage. Their initial targets include IDF outposts, the Gaza Division headquarters, an intelligence base near Urim, the Sderot police station, key intersections and major roads — aiming to secure control over the western Negev. 6:31 a.m. – The IDF’s supervising command post is activated in the IDF’s underground headquarters in Tel Aviv. At the same time, immediate readiness protocols for the Air Force and elite emergency units are enacted. 6:35 a.m. – The Air Force is ordered to deploy additional fighter jet crews beyond its standard readiness level. 6:38 a.m. – The Gaza Division activates 'Parash Pleshet,' its highest-level infiltration alert, assuming the attack involves around 70 terrorists from four to eight locations. Over the next 14 minutes, the Operations Directorate gradually deploys all available reserve ground forces to the southern region. 6:45 a.m. – The first report of a ground incursion from northern Gaza reaches IDF headquarters. 7:00 a.m. – Southern Command are now aware of 15 terror incidents occurring simultaneously along the border. The General Staff opens a dedicated attack coordination center to manage airstrikes from the headquarters. 7:00–9:00 a.m. – A second wave of approximately 600 Nukhba terrorists joins the invasion, under cover of 937 additional rocket and mortar strikes, mostly targeting Israeli communities near the border. 7:05 a.m. – The IDF chief of staff’s military secretary sends an internal WhatsApp message to the Operations Directorate group, independently declaring: 'We are at war.' 7:13 a.m. – The security coordinator of the Nova music festival reports to the IDF that 90% of attendees have been evacuated. 7:14 a.m. – The Air Force conducts its first drone strike against terrorists near Netiv HaAsara. 7:26 a.m. – Officer updates IDF headquarters: 'A breach at the Erez Crossing has resulted in two hostages being taken. There is ongoing combat in Sderot. The division is requesting deployment of every available combat unit to the southern region.' A senior officer at IDF headquarters responds: 'Every IDF unit has been ordered to join you. Open routes for them and direct them where needed. We have activated troops from training bases.' 7:28 a.m. – Brig. Gen. Shlomi Binder, head of the Operations Directorate, orders a full-scale military mobilization. An emergency deployment order is issued to send massive reinforcements to the western Negev. 7:30 a.m. – Units from the 80th Division, responsible for the Egyptian border, arrive from the south to assist. Under the command of the Paran Brigade, a team of female tank operators prevents two Nukhba battalions from seizing communities in the Kerem Shalom area. 7:55 a.m. – The first fighter jet strike targets a Hamas tunnel near Netiv HaAsara. 7:58 a.m. – Fromer Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif calls on Gaza residents via local media: 'Go and storm Israel. There is no border fence.' At that moment, the dramatic decision is made — to be officially executed an hour later — to seal the breached border at all costs using airstrikes. 8:00 a.m. – Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman urgently requests additional reinforcements. IDF headquarters decides that two-thirds of the West Bank Division’s security forces will abandon their positions and be rushed south. 8:17 a.m. – The IDF establishes a command center dedicated to managing the hostage crisis. 8:29 a.m. – Investigators later determine that at this stage, only 55% of active terror incidents in the Gaza border communities were being reported to IDF headquarters, further complicating the situational assessment. 8:30 a.m. – Southern Command activates 'Damocles’ Sword,' an operation targeting Hamas’ command and control centers in Gaza to disrupt the ongoing invasion. 8:42 a.m. – The supervising command center orders the air force to target Hamas headquarters and leadership figures. 9:23 a.m. – The Gaza Division is effectively overrun as Nukhba forces besiege its main command center near Kibbutz Re’im. The IDF decided to dispatch division and brigade commanders across the region, assigning each to oversee a major town or community that Hamas had seized, including Ofakim, Netivot, Sderot and Be’er Sheva. 9:40 a.m. – Southern Command and the Air Force order an aerial lockdown of the breached border, authorizing fighter jets to kill anyone moving within a kilometer (0.6 miles) of the fence. The bombing begins but does not fully halt the infiltration. 10:00 a.m. – By this hour, IDF headquarters is receiving reports on 61% of ongoing terror incidents in the southern region. 10:40 a.m. – A bottleneck of military forces is identified in Sderot, where troops have gathered after seeing viral footage of terrorists in pickup trucks. The supervising post orders them to disperse to active combat zones. 12:00 p.m. – The attack reaches its peak as thousands more Hamas terrorists exploit still-open breaches in the border. By this point, approximately 5,500 terrorists have flooded into southern Israel. 1:00 p.m. – The Hamas assault is largely halted, and the IDF begins establishing a new defensive line. By 5:00 p.m., Southern Command announces that operational control over the western Negev has been restored, roads are secured and the last remaining terrorist strongholds are encircled. That night, special forces tracked and eliminated the terrorist cell that had advanced the farthest — between Sde Teiman and Be’er Sheva. The last terrorist inside Israel was killed three days later between Zikim and Ashkelon. Three weeks after the attack, the 162nd Division withdrew from the region to prepare for the IDF’s ground operation in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkehxlcqyx	2025-02-27T20:45:33-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/H1qSpmRqkx/H1qSpmRqkx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

To understand intelligence failure that led to October 7, it is enough to examine the evening and night before attack; IDF probe shows how those few hours encapsulates the entire flawed intelligence assessment; 'The border was so quiet that I had nothing to write in my daily report' To understand the intelligence failure that led to the October 7 disaster, it is enough to examine the evening and night before the Hamas attack. According to IDF investigators, that period encapsulated the entire flawed intelligence assessment. No fewer than five warning signs were received by Military Intelligence (Aman) and the Southern Command in those hours, including dozens of SIM cards from mobile phones that were activated in Gaza, suspicious movements in Hamas’ rocket deployment, and other unclear indicators. Despite this, intelligence officials found plausible explanations for each warning, primarily arguing that similar incidents had occurred in the weeks, months and years preceding the war. These findings were outlined in an IDF investigation into the night before the massacre, published Thursday as part of the military’s core inquiries. Meanwhile, the establishment of a state commission of inquiry remains nowhere in sight. Despite the grave failures and numerous mistakes uncovered, no personal conclusions have been drawn, and Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has left disciplinary measures and command decisions to his successor, Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the investigation, signs of Hamas activity were attributed to the organization's general concerns and an assessment that stemmed from an Israeli cabinet meeting the previous week. Leaked details from that meeting suggested that Israel was considering assassinating senior Hamas figures in Gaza in response to terror plots emanating from the Strip targeting the West Bank, particularly in the area of Huwara. Systemic intelligence failures Southern Command planned to respond to these signs the following day by increasing aerial surveillance. However, the accumulation of warning signs did not even lead to the lowest level of intelligence alert. As a result, after a joint nighttime assessment, Southern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Chief of Staff Halevi decided not to raise the alert or readiness levels of the 671 soldiers stationed with the Gaza Division for the Simchat Torah holiday. On October 7, 157 of them were killed in battle. Throughout the summer of 2023, Hamas organized violent riots along the Gaza border on Fridays. However, on Friday, October 6, the border was unusually quiet, which only reinforced a sense of complacency. Some commanders even brought their children to spend the holiday with them on base. When a heightened alert was eventually issued, senior combat commanders at the brigade level were recalled, but battalion commanders on weekend leave were allowed to remain on break. 'The border was so quiet that I had nothing to write in my daily report,' a duty intelligence officer told investigators. Other commanders also testified that they took advantage of the rare calm to leave the area for the first time after many tense weekends along the border. The investigation found that the primary intelligence failures that night stemmed from the lack of a structured intelligence assessment. Instead, officials relied on entrenched assumptions to explain away the warning signs, preventing any alert about potential terrorist activity. Additionally, excessive emphasis was placed on protecting intelligence sources at the expense of increasing troop readiness. The abundance of information also blurred the lines of responsibility between intelligence-gathering units and analysis teams, affecting the operational-intelligence discourse. The report further revealed that a culture of remote work, using encrypted communication systems, led intelligence centers to act more as intermediaries than as proactive analysts. Unit 8200’s deafening failure One of the most critical failures that night was the reluctance to expose intelligence-gathering methods, such as surveillance techniques. As in many previous cases, this led to a decision not to inform soldiers and commanders of warning signs — though they did not reach the threshold of an official attack alert — so that Hamas, which monitors Israeli movements, would not realize its covert activities had been detected. However, according to the IDF’s probe, there were also numerous 'reassuring' signs that night. Some of the warning signals were perceived as 'fragments of understanding,' meaning not all relevant personnel were exposed to them. Senior officials in Military Intelligence, Southern Command, and even Air Force officers — who were asked to prepare two surveillance drones and raise the alert level of air defense units — only received partial information. The nighttime assessments were primarily conducted by three General Staff members: Chief of Staff Halevi, Southern Command Chief Finkelman, and Operations Directorate Head Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk. Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar was not briefed at all. Military Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva was informed but did not participate in the nighttime situation assessment. The events of those hours expose a fundamental failure in Unit 8200’s intelligence-gathering efforts. For years, the unit primarily focused on tracking senior Hamas leaders. As a deliberate policy, there was no active surveillance of lower-ranking commanders or operatives, let alone the hundreds of communication devices that were activated that night and throughout October 7. 'There was no geolocation data from Military Intelligence — not even on October 7 — despite thousands of terrorists’ phones and radios operating for hours inside Israel,' the investigation stated. 'We were deaf and blind on both sides of October 7, even on Friday afternoon, when Hamas began preparing for the invasion — from dozens of operatives initially briefed on the plan, to hundreds by Friday evening, and to thousands of Gazans overnight. One captured terrorist even said during interrogation that he had time to say goodbye to his family over the phone and call his commander in Gaza to report that he was returning because he had forgotten his RPG.' The investigation concluded: 'Enhanced preparedness could have been achieved without compromising intelligence sources. There was no negligence that night, but there was a rigid mindset — no one understood or declared it a time-sensitive event requiring immediate action. If a single authority had had the full picture that night, it is likely an alert would have been issued. That night, the IDF had a rare opportunity to correct years of flawed assumptions — and perhaps at least disrupt the invasion.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1zianrq1l	2025-02-27T13:23:07-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/20/SJb70czHye/SJb70czHye_0_0_853_481_0_small.jpg
BBC apologizes for Gaza documentary, citing 'serious flaws'	Spokesperson says network not informed about familial ties of 13-year-old boy featured in Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone, later discovered to be son of senior Hamas official The BBC issued a formal apology for its documentary on Gaza, 'Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone,' admitting to 'serious flaws' in its production. The network stated that it has no plans to broadcast the film again in its current form or make it available on iPlayer. The documentary, produced by Hoyo Films for the BBC, has sparked significant controversy. In its statement, the BBC acknowledged that both the production company and the network made 'unacceptable mistakes.' The BBC took full responsibility for the errors and their impact on the corporation's reputation, expressing regret and apologizing for the situation. Hoyo Films, which produced the documentary, defended the film’s goal, saying it aimed to amplify voices that had not been adequately represented during the war, ensuring they were portrayed 'with dignity and respect.' The company stated it is fully cooperating with the BBC to determine where mistakes were made. A BBC spokesperson added that the network had not been informed ahead of time about the familial ties of a 13-year-old boy featured in the documentary, later discovered to be the son of a senior Hamas official. The BBC had questioned Hoyo Films multiple times during production about possible connections between the boy's family and Hamas, but the company admitted after the broadcast that they were aware the boy's father was a Deputy Agriculture Minister in the Hamas-led Gaza government. The BBC called it a failure on its part for not uncovering the information before the broadcast. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Furthermore, Hoyo Films informed the BBC that it had paid the boy's mother a 'limited sum of money' for his narration in the documentary, through his sister's bank account. While the production company assured the BBC that no payments were made to Hamas members or affiliates, the BBC is now requesting additional confirmation and will conduct a full audit of the documentary’s budget, including a review of Hoyo Films' financial records. The BBC also stated that the issue has 'damaged' public trust in its journalism, with the Director-General requesting that the handling of public complaints be expedited. The BBC’s Editorial Complaints Unit, which operates separately from its news division, will review the situation, and a comprehensive fact-finding inquiry is set to take place. This review will assess whether any editorial guidelines were violated and determine if disciplinary actions are warranted. In a separate statement, the BBC’s board acknowledged that the documentary's subject matter was a legitimate area for journalistic exploration. However, the board emphasized that nothing is more important than trust and transparency in its work. While it recognized that mistakes can occur, it concluded that the errors in this case were serious and damaging to the BBC's reputation. 'We have no plans to broadcast the program again in its current form or return it to iPlayer and will make a further assessment once the work of the Editorial Complaints Unit is complete,' the BBC spokesperson said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyau5ucqyl	2025-02-27T13:09:49-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/HylaktDV5ke/HylaktDV5ke_0_0_2250_1267_0_small.jpg
AG orders criminal probe into Netanyahu's office over ties to Qat...	Attorney General calls for criminal investigation into prime minister's advisers over alleged ties to Qatar, including a PR campaign promoting the Gulf state; probe, led by Shin Bet and Israel Police, raises concerns about foreign influence Israel’s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara announced on Thursday that her office will launch an investigation into connections between officials in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office and individuals linked to Qatar. According to Baharav-Miara, during a discussion attended by the state attorney, the head of the Israel Police’s Investigations and Intelligence Division, and Shin Bet professionals, information was presented regarding ties between individuals operating within the Prime Minister’s Office and entities associated with Qatar. The probe will be conducted by the Shin Bet and the police. Authorities believe the suspicions against the Prime Minister’s Office officials involve abuse of power and actions taken while in a conflict of interest. The case involves three of Netanyahu’s associates: Eli Feldstein, his spokesman, who was previously investigated in a classified documents leak case; and advisers Yonatan Orich and Yisrael Einhorn, who are also suspects in that case. Einhorn has been abroad since the scandal broke. The decision marks an escalation, shifting the case from a security review to a criminal investigation.

The campaign focused on Qatar’s role in hostage deal negotiations, with Feldstein arranging interviews with Qatari officials and disseminating their messages. This took place while Qatar mediated regional talks, despite Netanyahu’s criticism of the Gulf state for 'serving Hamas.' Orich and Einhorn allegedly provided PR consulting to Qatar, including a 2022 campaign ahead of the FIFA World Cup, aimed at portraying Qatar — a known funder of terrorism — as a legitimate supporter of regional peace. Einhorn’s firm, Perception, partnered with another company, Coyote, co-owned by retired Brig. Gen. Eli Ben-Meir, a former IDF intelligence official now leading an investigation into the October 7 attacks. All individuals involved have denied the allegations. Netanyahu called the probe a 'witch hunt' against him and his team, while opposition leader Yair Lapid warned of 'an Arab state’s infiltration into the Prime Minister’s Office.' 'Netanyahu’s closest aides received large sums of money. This isn’t just corruption — it’s a dangerous threat to national security,' Lapid added. Qatar, one of the world’s wealthiest nations and a key Hamas funder, has long used its financial influence to gain leverage globally. Reports of payments to Netanyahu’s associates have raised concerns about similar efforts in Israel. Netanyahu has denied any influence from the payments, claiming funds sent to Gaza were for humanitarian purposes, not Hamas. The Shin Bet remains the sole body authorized to investigate the matter, with Lapid stressing: 'The suspects cannot fire the Shin Bet chief to control the probe.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjltjhcc1g	2025-02-27T12:18:32-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/r1rAKDiFJe/r1rAKDiFJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Former hostage Gadi Mozes, 80, tells Netanyahu: 'Every day is cri...	In first public statement since release, 80-year-old emphasizes urgency to continue hostage releases, saying: 'Every moment counts, I was freed after 482 days — by sheer luck, I made it out alive' Less than a month after his release from captivity in Gaza, 80-year-old Gadi Mozes from Kibbutz Nir Oz issued his first public statement Thursday, addressing the Israeli public and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a recorded message. 'I was there, and I suffered. I witnessed the horrors our people endure in captivity,' Moses said. 'Mr. Prime Minister, every day is critical — critical to the survival of our remaining hostages, critical to our ability to bring our fallen home for burial in Israel.' Mozes was freed in the first phase of the hostage deal after 482 days in captivity. He was held alone by Islamic Jihad, as was Arbel Yehoud, who was released with him. In the same exchange, IDF lookout Agam Berger was freed from a separate location. Even before reuniting with his family, Mozes vowed upon his release: 'I will do everything in my power to help rebuild Nir Oz.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At the start of his statement, Mozes expressed gratitude to the thousands who protest daily to raise awareness and push for the swift return of the remaining hostages. 'I was there for 482 days and suffered. I saw firsthand the horrors our people endure,' he said. Emphasizing the urgency of their release, Mozes added: 'Every moment counts. I was freed after 482 days—by sheer luck, I made it out alive. But with each passing day, those still held are at greater risk. I suffered there, I suffered greatly—mentally and physically, facing relentless abuse.' Mozes also referenced the recent confirmations of hostages' deaths. 'Just days ago, we mourned my dear Oded, Ariel, Kfir, and Shiri. Today, we learned that Itzik, Shlomo, Ohad and Tzachi are also no longer with us.' Concluding his message, Mozes extended his support to IDF soldiers, expressed condolences to bereaved families, and wished a swift recovery to the wounded. 'These brave individuals risked their lives to save me, my fellow hostages, and our entire people,' he said. He pledged to 'join the fight for the release of every last hostage and dedicate himself to rebuilding Nir Oz, transforming it from a devastated landscape into a thriving community once again.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycf004a5ke	2025-02-27T12:09:35-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/ryxUCUXAc1x/ryxUCUXAc1x_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

IDF's Hashmonaim Brigade - first all-Haredi combat unit - is swor...	In unusual scene for military event, audience separated by gender with partition; Instead of military band music, religious songs blast from speakers Dozens of soldiers from the newly established Hashmonaim Brigade, the IDF’s first ultra-Orthodox combat unit, gathered Thursday afternoon at the Maccabees' Tombs in Modiin for the unit's inaugural swearing-in ceremony. The soldiers, who received their unit insignia earlier this week, participated in a ceremony known as a 'declaration' rather than an 'oath' to align with the religious principles of the soldiers, who avoid oaths for religious reasons. The ceremony was tailored to the lifestyle of the recruits and reflected the atmosphere the brigade strives to maintain. In an unusual scene for a military event, the audience was separated by gender with a partition. Instead of the usual military band music, speakers played religious songs performed solely by male singers. Rabbi Moshe Korkus, the brigade’s rabbi, offered his blessings to the soldiers. 'Each one of you continues the way of the Maccabees, holding in one hand a sword and shield, and in the other hand declaring, 'Who is for God, come to me.'' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The ceremony included elements that deviate from standard military protocol. One officer even led a 'Siyum Masechet,' a prayer and blessing traditionally recited after completing the study of a section of the Talmud. The soldiers studied the tractate 'Megillah' during their scheduled study times and marked their completion of it during the event. Prior to singing 'Hatikvah' (the national anthem), they also sang 'Mimkomcha Malkeinu Tofiah,' a prayer traditionally sung on Shabbat in synagogues. 'Unusual in the community, natural to the soul' Some of the soldiers participated in the ceremony without their families, who oppose their enlistment, but others shared with excitement how meaningful the ceremony was, a moment they had never experienced before. Gideon Shushan, whose son enlisted in the brigade, told Ynet: 'We are very proud of him and of all of them. We are proud of our sons studying in yeshivas, and of our sons serving in the army.' Asked if the enlistment was unusual for their community, Shushan said: 'It’s unusual in our community, but natural to our soul. Being part of the fight in a war — there is nothing more Jewish than that. We are very proud of him and of all those who support and serve.' When asked about the reactions they received to his son’s enlistment, he replied: 'The reactions in our town of Beit Shemesh have been all positive. Our rabbi supports it, and the community supports it. We all support both our sons and daughters who study in yeshivas and seminaries, and we are also proud of those who serve in the army, with God's help.' Mike, a relative of another soldier in the brigade, expressed his pride. 'Despite all the questions and criticism about the army, we are very proud of Moshe for enlisting, for completing the course, and for participating in defending the homeland,' he said. When asked if he ever thought something like this could happen two or three years ago, he responded: 'Honestly, I didn’t think this was the path he would choose in life. But he’s doing it, and in the end I think it’s a good thing.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhq00gc9ke	2025-02-27T11:02:24-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/H1dqMxC9ke/H1dqMxC9ke_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Israel releases terrorist in hostage deal because of his high med...	Kazem Zawahreh, who took part in deadly shooting attack near Maale Adumim, was hospitalized in a vegetative state, said to have cost state nearly $2 million annually As part of the hostage deal, Israel overnight released Kazem Zawahreh, a Palestinian terrorist who carried out the deadly shooting attack on Highway 1 near Maale Adumim in February last year. Zawahreh, along with two other assailants, opened fire on vehicles stuck in traffic, killing Matan Malmalyah and wounding six others. He was shot in the head at the scene by armed civilians and has been in a vegetative state ever since, hospitalized under guard at Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center. His care reportedly cost Israel approximately 6 million shekels ($1.6 million) over the past year. Zawahreh had lost all ability to speak or move, except for minimal eye movement, and required dialysis twice a week. Security officials revealed that his monthly hospitalization expenses, including medical care and security, amounted to roughly 500,000 shekels ($135,000). Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Acting National Security Minister Haim Katz recently discussed Zawahreh’s case in a security assessment and pushed to include him in the list of prisoners to be released under the deal. Defense officials said the decision was made in part due to the high financial burden of his continued hospitalization, which diverted resources from law enforcement and national security efforts. 'This step aims to reduce budgetary strain, especially given the complex security situation,' a security official said. Overnight, after a year in critical medical condition, Zawahreh was released and transferred to Palestinian Authority-controlled territory in a Magen David Adom intensive care ambulance as part of the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skhober5yl	2025-02-27T10:55:51-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/22/HJ4iBtVn6/HJ4iBtVn6_0_0_959_540_0_small.jpg
Israel lifts ban on European far-right parties, cites changes in ...	Jerusalem removes sanctions on France's National Rally, Sweden Democrats and Spain's VOX; maintains restrictions on Germany's AfD and Austria's Freedom Party Israel has decided to lift its diplomatic ban on three far-right European political parties, including France's National Rally, Sweden's Sweden Democrats, and Spain's VOX, while maintaining its embargo on Austria's Freedom Party and Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD), which secured strong results in recent elections. Foreign Minister Eli Cohen directed his office and Israeli embassies in France, Sweden and Spain to engage with these far-right parties, noting that the move was based on a thorough review of their positions on Israel, antisemitism and Holocaust denial. 'We are examining how these parties behave today,' Cohen said in a meeting with Jewish community leaders and pro-Israel organizations in Belgium. 'We do not want to isolate ourselves from potential allies in Europe, but we also do not want to legitimize neo-Nazi movements.' Cohen emphasized that Israel's decision-making process involves a detailed assessment of each party's stance on critical issues such as antisemitism, support for Israel, and their position on Jewish traditions like circumcision and kosher slaughter. He also pointed out that some of these parties have problematic historical roots, but Israel is focusing on their current actions and whether they are distancing themselves from any antisemitic rhetoric. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regarding the continued ban on the AfD and Austria's Freedom Party, Israeli officials explained that it was not a random decision but based on specific criteria. They stated that, while Israel has traditionally viewed these parties with skepticism, they are closely monitoring whether they are taking effective measures to distance themselves from antisemitic elements. 'It’s about updating and reassessing based on their actions,' one senior official said. While the Sweden Democrats have Nazi roots, Israeli officials acknowledged that the party has evolved, with changes in both its leadership's rhetoric and internal policies. In contrast, the AfD and the Freedom Party's efforts to distance themselves from problematic elements regarding antisemitism have been deemed insufficient, officials said. 'We want to see how they treat Jewish life and Israel, and we will make our decisions accordingly,' the official added. Israeli officials also stressed the importance of dialogue with Jewish community leaders in these countries, ensuring that decisions regarding the relationship with these parties will be based on real-time developments rather than historical precedents. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1fwlxa9yx	2025-02-27T10:52:41-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2017/04/25/7739392/7739392_0_150_1300_732_0_small.jpg
This is how Hamas’ deception led to Israel’s October 7 intelligen...	IDF investigation uncovers how Hamas’ strategic deception and Israeli intelligence failures paved the way for the devastating October 7 attack; report highlights systemic gaps, missed warnings and a false sense of security that left Israel unprepared The IDF's investigation into the failures surrounding a devastating Hamas attack over a year ago, published on Thursday, revealed systemic intelligence lapses and strategic deception by the terror group. The report, part of the IDF’s core reviews, highlights that former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar believed success hinged on total surprise, a strategy solidified after he and his officials, Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif, consolidated control over Gaza in early 2017. Despite severe shortcomings, no personal accountability has been enforced, with responsibility for dismissals deferred to incoming Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir. The investigation found that Hamas’ strategic deception intensified in the years leading up to the attack. While publicly seeking a cease-fire, Hamas secretly prepared to breach the IDF's Gaza Division. Military intelligence failed to recognize this dual strategy. Hamas also established a general headquarters for the first time after the 2014 Operation Protective Edge, with Raad Saad developing the 'Jericho Wall' invasion plan in response to Israel’s underground border barrier construction. The plan, which reached Israeli intelligence in 2018, was dismissed as unrealistic. By 2019, Hamas had formed elite Nukhba battalions, with reserves completed that year. Intelligence gathered during operations last year revealed that the invasion plan, dating back to 2017, included live broadcasts from captured kibbutzim, symbolic siege of strategic sites and aims to reach cities like Be’er Sheva and Ashkelon. The plan initially targeted the murder of 600 civilians in Ofakim; 33 were murdered there on October 7. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the plan for two years, as Hamas diverted resources to pandemic management, further lulling Israel into complacency. Intelligence failures were compounded by missed warning signs, including a Hamas-produced TV series, 'The Free Fist,' which depicted scenes eerily similar to the October 7 attack. 'Hamas knew they were 85% operationally ready by the end of 2022,' the investigation revealed. 'We later learned that Hamas saw 2022 as the year of great opportunities.' Sinwar’s strategic decision to withdraw most Hamas forces to southern Gaza preserved the terror group’s military wing and weapons stockpiles, anticipating Israel’s overwhelming response. The move proved successful, with Hamas recovering to over 10,000 terrorists by October 6, 2023. In the month before the attack, Hamas revived border protests as a deception tactic, while the 24 hours preceding the invasion saw complete quiet, and was not flagged by intelligence as suspicious. The investigation concluded that the core failure lay in the growing gap between perceived and actual realities. 'The Military Intelligence Directorate (MID) did not help decision-makers realize that their approach was wrong,' the report read. 'It was a classic intelligence failure, the kind books were written about after Pearl Harbor, Barbarossa and Yom Kippur.' The Research Division’s flawed methods and organizational culture created biases, with a false sense of superiority and transparency over the enemy. 'Israel saw Hamas as a pragmatic movement with whom it could do business,' the report noted. 'The MID underestimated Hamas, focusing more on its rocket system.' The investigation criticized the lack of skepticism within the MID, which sought explanations to fit prevailing narratives rather than challenging them. 'An illusion of certainty was created,' the report stated. 'A false sense of intelligence superiority.' The report also highlighted gaps in understanding Hamas’ culture and language, crucial for research professionalism. 'They preferred harmony and synchronization within the MID, without debates,' it noted. 'The research approach argued that there is a need to distinguish between the enemy's capabilities and its intentions.' The investigation called for broad systemic changes within the MID, beyond replacing senior officials or establishing new units. Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder, the MID’s new chief, has adopted recommendations to revise warning models and expand intelligence-gathering units. 'The corrections will not take place through replacing one senior official,' the report warned. 'A broad change is needed within the MID.' Binder concluded that the IDF’s intelligence system exacerbated biases and professional gaps, with no adequate military research on Hamas despite its classification as a military force. 'The deep understanding of the enemy eroded,' he said, 'and the mistakes were rooted in perceptions — one of the oldest mistakes made in intelligence.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkd8rnrqkl	2025-02-27T10:34:28-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/H1j1r1C9ke/H1j1r1C9ke_4_0_852_479_0_small.jpg

Heroism of murdered hostage Ori Danino revealed by fellow captive...	Rabbi Elchanan Danino, father of killed hostage Ori Danino, talks about his son’s extraordinary bravery during his captivity with Hamas told to him by ex-hostage Eliya Cohen Rabbi Elchanan Danino, father of hostage Ori Danino, who was murdered in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, spoke with former hostage Eliya Cohen and learned remarkable details about his son’s bravery. According to Cohen, who was held captive alongside him, Ori fought his kidnappers on October 7 and worked to help his fellow hostages. In an interview with Ynet, Danino shared what he learned from Cohen. 'He told us that Ori got out of the car and hid in a bush. When a terrorist grabbed him, he punched him so hard that he was badly injured. Even inside the vehicle, during the abduction, Ori fought the terrorists hand-to-hand,' his father said. According to Danino, the terrorist was so injured that he was unable to identify who had hurt him, even 50 days later. 'They searched for the one who hit and wounded the terrorist for 50 days in the tunnels,' he said. Cohen also told him that, while in captivity, Ori 'didn’t even acknowledge the terrorists’ weapons' and focused on helping his wounded comrades. 'He didn’t care that they were armed. They only gave Hersh (Goldberg-Polin) medical treatment because of him after three days.' Danino described his son as fearless. 'He was a soldier and we always knew Ori had no fear. Eliya told us that Ori told him: ‘I’m not sure I’ll make it out.’ He was completely mission-driven. Ori told me: ‘Dad, if there’s a war, I’ll be the first to fight.’ In the end, he helped save three hostages — Omer Shem Tov, Mia and Itay Regev.' Despite always knowing his son was courageous, Danino admitted: 'I would have run away in that situation. Ori’s siblings constantly say that, even today, he wouldn’t have acted any differently. One of his former girlfriends called me today and said that‘Ori always told me his greatest honor would be to die for his country.’' Ori enlisted in the Givati Brigade’s ultra-Orthodox battalion in 2018 and was later recruited into its elite reconnaissance unit. At one point, he was transferred to the 202nd Battalion under the command of Lt. Almog Rotem, to whom he remained closely attached. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Ori was a fighter,' his father said. 'We were blessed that he saved three people from the Jewish people. It’s an honor and a source of comfort. But it’s a deep wound for his siblings. Their big brother is suddenly gone — it’s not easy.' According to Cohen, Ori never left Hersh’s side in captivity. 'He was a unifying force in the tunnels. He refused to eat meat or chicken there and recited the Jewish prayer for meals loud at every meal. 'He seemed to know exactly what he was doing at every moment. His awareness in life was incredible. His love for others wasn’t new to us — he always helped the elderly and the poor. He would help complete strangers.' Danino stressed that Ori was one of many heroes: 'Let’s not forget — there are hundreds, even thousands of heroes in this story. We thought this generation was ‘only about technology,’ but they have incredible strength — like Aner Shapira. Which of us adults would do something like that?' Shapiro threw back at Hamas terrorists seven grenades thrown into the shelter near the Nova festival that has been come to be known as the 'shelter of death,' saving many lives. 'This is what our leaders should be learning,' he added. 'Aner and Ori did it without being ordered to — they risked and sacrificed themselves. There’s no shortage of heroes in this war. The gap between the leadership and the soldiers who gave everything is enormous. At the very least, our leaders should strive to be like them, but instead, it seems like they go out of their way not to be.' Ori Danino was executed by Hamas terrorists in late August, along with hostages Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Carmel Gat. At the time, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated: 'They were kidnapped on October 7 and murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2tfx05kl	2025-02-27T09:59:47-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/HJyDWJRckl/HJyDWJRckl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

In comments during an online briefing, Abdi - commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces - said Ocalan's call applied only to the PKK and was 'not related to us in Syria'.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b167mma51l	2025-02-27T08:40:57-08:00	
IDF October 7 Investigation finds Hamas exploited intelligence ga...	Military releases investigation into the failures leading up to and during the October 7 Hamas attack, says surprise and operational collapse on October 7 were more severe than those of the 1973 Yom Kippur War; no senior officials have been dismissed and calls for an independent inquiry remain blocked For the first time since October 7, and after months of delays, the IDF on Thursday released its core investigations into Hamas' attack — while a state commission of inquiry remains nowhere in sight. Despite the grave failures uncovered, the investigation does not assign personal responsibility to any individual, leaving disciplinary actions and dismissals to outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi’s successor, Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir. Total surprise The IDF’s October 7 investigative conclusions, while largely unsurprising, paint a grim picture. One key finding highlights the extent of the army’s intelligence failure: the surprise and operational collapse on October 7 were more severe than those of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Unlike in 1973, when Israel had prior warnings of a possible Arab attack, debated whether to call up reserves and saw signals of impending war, no such indications were identified this time. 'There was no one who saw or detected any sign of this event in advance, not even at the lowest intelligence level,' one of the central investigations found. 'The surprise was total — situational and fundamental — against a strategic deception that lasted years, an operational deception leading up to the attack and a tactical deception throughout the night before the invasion.' No discussion was ever held about calling up reserves. The military acknowledged that Hamas successfully employed deception at multiple levels, leading Israel into a deadly trap, including by manipulating its 'Jericho Wall' defense concept — a dossier detailing a possible Hamas attack against Israel. Investigative reports also confirm a that, in a classified General Staff meeting on July 27, 2022, then-Operations Division head Brig. Gen. Yaron Finkelman — who was the IDF’s Southern Command chief on October 7 — ordered preparations for war with Hamas based on the 'Jericho Wall' plans. However, no action was taken. Deception and missed warnings During that 2022 discussion, Finkelman concluded that Hamas could only achieve surprise through a deception operation disguised as a military drill or by misinterpreting its own heightened readiness as an Israeli threat. In a report from November 2023, investigative journalist Ronen Bergman reported that Finkelman himself fell victim to the very deception tactics he had warned about in the early hours of October 7. In a phone assessment at 3:00 a.m. that day, he repeated the same two mistaken assumptions regarding Hamas’ increased alert level. Hamas initially planned to launch its invasion during the Jewish High Holidays in 2022 and again on Passover in 2023, while the IDF chief was stationed at the Kissufim base for the night — unaware of the plans. Hamas ultimately postponed the attack to improve its elite Nukhba forces' readiness. Halevi first heard about the 'Jericho Wall' report only two weeks after the war began, despite having served in key intelligence and operational roles — including as Military Intelligence Directorate chief, Southern Command chief and deputy chief of staff — over the past decade. The investigation also suggests that Hezbollah refrained from joining the war due to a misunderstanding in its coordination with Hamas in July 2023. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Failures in intelligence and defense strategy Halevi insisted on launching IDF probes at the start of the war despite opposition from some military leaders, who feared it would lead to finger-pointing while soldiers were still fighting in Gaza. Delays caused by the war’s expansion to Lebanon, Iran and Yemen, as well as political disputes over responsibility, slowed the process. Now, the military has concluded 18 General Staff-level investigations. Four core reports have been presented to the public, focusing on Israel’s flawed perception of Hamas before October 7, intelligence failures at all levels — particularly the lack of strategic and tactical warnings — the critical hours leading up to the attack and the collapse of the IDF’s Gaza Division. According to the findings, Israel’s long-standing policy of differentiating between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority strengthened the terrorist organization, including through the flow of Qatari cash into Gaza and humanitarian concessions. Israel chose a 'conflict management' approach that sought to maintain the status quo, based on the mistaken belief that Hamas neither wanted nor was preparing for a large-scale war. This assumption was built on deterrence and cease-fire agreements, but Hamas used deception tactics to reinforce it. 'In hindsight, this was a grave mistake,' the report read. The threat of a surprise large-scale attack was not considered a plausible scenario, as intelligence assessments assumed Hamas would not launch a war without warning. The underlying belief was that Israel held military superiority, Hamas was a secondary threat and Military Intelligence 'knew everything.' Operational collapse on October 7 The massive above- and below-ground border defenses Israel built along Gaza created a false sense of security, forcing Hamas to develop alternative invasion tactics that bypassed tunnels. Confidence in the border barrier led to a reduction in troop deployment along the border. The investigation found that on October 7 the IDF’s conflict-management strategy collapsed, as did the assumption that enemy attacks could be contained along the border fence. 'The concept was deeply entrenched — there was no systematic effort to challenge it,' the report read. Before the war, IDF Southern Command assessed that the worst-case scenario would be an infiltration of about 70 terrorists from two locations. In reality, around 5,000 terrorists breached the border, murdering more than 1,160 people in a single day. Three months before the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to shift its focus to Iran, Hezbollah and the West Bank while de-escalating the Gaza front. Decision-making failures at the highest levels Despite at least 10 warning signs in the two years before the war, IDF intelligence failed to reassess its assumptions. 'We read the signals but we didn’t see what they actually said. There was a false sense of security,' IDF officials admitted. However, the investigation did not find evidence of negligence or dereliction of duty among intelligence officers. The intelligence division lacked a critical approach, failing to challenge its own assumptions. Analysts focused on Hamas’ intentions rather than its capabilities and lacked sufficient understanding of radical Islam. Military Intelligence officers also showed long-standing organizational failures in questioning strategic assessments, even after October 7. Two officers were deemed unfit for their roles. Hamas, the investigation found, had been systematically preparing for war since 2016. The 2021 Gaza conflict bolstered its confidence, reinforcing its belief that Israel was weak and that total 'liberation' was achievable. By July 2023, Hamas had developed an integrated war plan, coordinated with Hezbollah and Iran, aimed at Israel’s destruction. Failures in military response Although signs of an imminent attack were present the night before October 7 — such as increased rocket launch indications and Hamas militants disappearing into tunnels — these were not recognized as serious warnings. Intelligence was passed via WhatsApp messages from the Shin Bet to IDF intelligence but was not properly escalated. In the crucial early hours of October 7, IDF forces remained in routine security positions, with no reinforcement of troops. The Gaza Division collapsed within hours, but this was not immediately understood by military leaders, delaying an effective response. The failure to comprehend the scale of the attack in real-time resulted in critical decision-making gaps. The Israeli Air Force was also unprepared for an invasion of this scale. While its forces were on routine alert, it had no contingency plan for repelling a massive ground assault. Despite numerous intelligence and operational failures, no senior officers have been dismissed. Calls for external investigations blocked Despite demands from IDF leaders, political figures and the Israeli public, Netanyahu has blocked efforts to establish an independent state commission of inquiry into the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Unlike past wars, no external military investigation has been authorized, apart from a partial review by Israel’s state comptroller. Some senior officers consulted lawyers before giving testimony to investigators. Halevi himself chose not to do so and was reportedly disappointed to see legal influence in some officers' responses. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s100p00zr9yl	2025-02-27T08:40:13-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/S1uHq565Je/S1uHq565Je_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Cyprus failed to probe British teen’s claim she was gang-raped by...	ECHR admonishes Cypriot authorities for failing to determine whether woman — 18 at time of alleged rape — had ever consented to having sex with some of the suspects Cyprus’ law enforcement authorities failed to live up to their obligation to thoroughly and effectively investigate a British teenager’s claims that she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis while on a 2019 vacation in a popular resort town, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday. In its ruling, the court placed particular weight on the failure of the authorities to determine whether the woman — who was 18 at the time of the alleged rape — had ever consented to having sex with some of the suspects. According to the ruling, the woman had told authorities she rejected the suggestion of having sex with multiple partners. However, the suspects persisted in entering the hotel room where the alleged rape took place, disregarding her pleas for them to leave. Even though the woman was having sex with an Israeli friend of the suspects in that hotel room at the time, the court said investigators didn’t establish whether the suspects had secured her consent. According to testimony, some of them only assumed they would because of her previous behavior. Flaws in the investigation The court said investigators appeared not to take into account the woman’s capacity to consent in light of testimony that she had consumed alcohol prior to the alleged rape and that traces of cocaine were found in her urine. Moreover, police and investigators took the suspects’ statements that no rape had taken place 'at face value' despite testimony that her Israeli partner 'said he would arrange for his friends to have sex' with her. This compounded what the court described as a series of flaws in the initial state of the investigation, from a limited search of physical evidence such as fingerprints in the hotel room to failure to track down potential suspects or witnesses. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The court observes that the present case reveals certain biases concerning women in Cyprus which impeded the effective protection of the applicant’s rights as a victim of gender-based violence and which, if not reversed, run the risk of creating a background of impunity, discouraging victims’ trust in the criminal justice system, despite the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework,' the ruling said. No legal representation and prejudiced proceedings The July 2019 case made headlines in Cyprus, Britain and Israel when all 12 suspects were released without charge after the woman retracted her rape claims. The Cyprus attorney-general opted not to pursue legal proceedings against the suspects, while the woman was subsequently found guilty on a charge of public mischief and sentenced to a four-month suspended jail term. In the lower court ruling, the judge said the woman didn’t tell the truth and tried to deceive the court with 'evasive' statements. He said the woman had admitted to investigators that she made up the claims because she was 'ashamed' after finding out that some of the Israelis had videoed her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend on their cellphones. In 2022, the Cyprus Supreme Court overturned the woman’s conviction, citing among other reasons that she didn’t have a lawyer present when police repeatedly questioned her and that the lower court misconstrued evidence, prejudicing proceedings against her. The ECHR ruling said that, given the conditions of the woman’s questioning by police, 'there is force in her argument' that the 'long and repeated interviews' prompted her to retract her rape allegations. The court awarded the woman 20,000 euros ($20,850) in damages and another 5,000 euros ($5,210) for legal costs. Justice Abroad Director Michael Polak, who represented the woman both in Cyprus and at the ECHR, called the ruling a 'landmark decision for victims of sexual violence.' 'This ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of sexual violence must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjh5c11ac1e	2025-02-27T08:16:15-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/05/SJ1ohz3eT/SJ1ohz3eT_0_228_2955_1664_0_small.jpg

ICC prosecutor's office says Palestinian probe continues with urg...	The International Criminal Court will urgently continue its investigation into crimes committed in Palestinian territories, or by Palestinians, the prosecutor's office said on Thursday, despite the withdrawal of an arrest warrant for a Hamas leader. The ICC said on Wednesday that judges had withdrawn an arrest warrant for Ibrahim al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, following credible reports of his death. Deif had been wanted for atrocities committed during Hamas' October 2023 attack on southern Israeli communities that triggered the war in Gaza. He had been accused by prosecutors of mass killing, rape and hostage taking. He was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year, but militant group Hamas only confirmed his death in late January. On Thursday, the prosecutor's office said the probe continued and it would not hesitate to seek arrest warrants for other suspects 'if and when it considers that the threshold of a realistic prospect of conviction has been met'. 'Addressing the situation as an urgent priority, the office is conducting an active investigation, and advances multiple and interconnected additional lines of inquiry,' it said in an e-mail.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryn0hecckg	2025-02-27T05:55:56-08:00

'I am making a call for the laying down of arms, and I take on the historical responsibility of this call,' Ocalan said in a letter made public by DEM party members.

Defense minister warns terror group using cease-fire to rebuild forces, relocate operatives and stockpile weapons; reveals Hamas had planned attacks in West Bank before October 7 Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday that intelligence gathered during the cease-fire indicated Hamas was planning attacks on soldiers and communities. His remarks followed reports that Hamas had relocated thousands of operatives from southern to northern Gaza, rebuilding its battalions, tunnels, rocket stockpiles and drone capabilities. Katz stressed that the cease-fire was not due to a lack of munitions or troop exhaustion but solely to facilitate the return of hostages. 'This is our top priority, our duty and our mutual responsibility,' he said at a conference of regional council leaders. He emphasized that Israel was maintaining a buffer zone in Gaza, including military outposts beyond Israeli lines, and would not permit arms smuggling through humanitarian aid. 'If we had withdrawn from the Philadelphi Corridor, within these 42 days, it would have been flooded with weapons,' he warned. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: With the first phase of the hostage deal completed—returning 25 living hostages and eight deceased—Katz said continued pressure was necessary to compel Hamas to release the remaining captives. 'The best way forward is for Hamas to know that the IDF is ready to resume combat,' he said, reiterating that 'Hamas will not remain in control of Gaza, militarily or politically.' Katz also discussed efforts to facilitate voluntary emigration from Gaza. 'I am rapidly advancing a voluntary migration initiative, enabling those who wish to leave Gaza to do so via Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport,' he said. Addressing threats in the West Bank, Katz revealed that Hamas had planned attacks there before October 7 and that Iranian-backed weapons and funding had fueled growing terrorist activity. 'The refugee camps are the core of terrorism in the West Bank,' he said, instructing the IDF to continue operations in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Regarding Israel's northern border, Katz said that Israeli forces would remain in strategic outposts in Lebanon indefinitely, with U.S. approval. He also reaffirmed that Israel would maintain its military presence in the buffer zone along the Syrian border indefinitely, citing security concerns. 'It was clear to me and the prime minister that we needed to secure the buffer zone, and our policy is to remain there—at the peak of Mount Hermon and other strategic positions—for an unlimited period,' he said. Addressing Syria's new Islamist leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda and ISIS member, Katz dismissed him as unreliable. 'He swapped his robes for suits and speaks well, but we do not trust him—we trust only the IDF,' he said. Katz reiterated Israel’s demand for the demilitarization of southern Syria and confirmed that the IDF struck Syrian regime positions earlier in the week. 'Two days ago, we hit the first attempt by the new regime to man positions and outposts,' he said. 'We will not allow violations of the demilitarization agreement in southern Syria, nor will we permit the emergence of new threats in the area.' Katz concluded by emphasizing a broader security doctrine: 'Israel cannot allow extremist organizations to operate along its borders—whether in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria or the West Bank. This is our policy, and we will enforce it.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxxhppqje	2025-02-27T02:55:35-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/Hyj118gP5kg/Hyj118gP5kg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

'We will not allow Hamas terrorists to once again roam our borders with trucks and rifles, nor will we let them rearm through smuggling,' the official stated. The announcement came as the first phase of the agreement was completed, with the release of 33 hostages—including eight who were returned deceased. Fifty-nine hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza after 510 days. On Thursday morning, Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanua said the group was willing to extend the first phase of the deal or merge it with the second phase, 'in accordance with our red lines.' He specified that these conditions included a full Israeli withdrawal, an end to the war and reconstruction efforts in Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: With the return of the four deceased hostages to Israel, the first phase of the deal has officially concluded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to hold consultations Thursday on the next steps and discuss whether to send a negotiating delegation for the second phase of talks. Netanyahu previously committed that if a delegation were dispatched, the Cabinet would first hold a debate on its mandate, but such a discussion has yet to take place. Instead, deliberations have shifted to Hamas’ alleged violations of the agreement, which Netanyahu cited in his decision to halt the release of additional Palestinian prisoners. It remains unclear when and where negotiations for the second phase will begin, though estimates suggest they may take place next week in Cairo or Doha. U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to visit the region early next week, including a stop in Israel, with expectations that his visit will help jumpstart discussions on the next stage of the deal. The IDF was initially expected to begin its withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor on Saturday, with a full exit completed by March 9. However, the Israeli official’s remarks confirm that the pullout will not happen. Throughout the first phase of the agreement, the Philadelphi Corridor—considered a key element of the deal—was a subject of extensive debate. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had listed Israel’s presence there as one of his 'red lines' for Netanyahu, threatening to collapse the government in the case of an Israeli withdrawal from the 8.7-mile stretch of land. Some analysts had suspected Israel never intended to withdraw and that the move was tied to the second phase of the deal, which remains highly uncertain. A security official acknowledged Wednesday that the Philadelphi Corridor was a 'complex issue' and that 'there is significant uncertainty surrounding the expected withdrawal.' The most immediate consequence of Israel remaining in the corridor is that negotiations for the second phase of the hostage release deal are unlikely to progress. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ehuaa91x	2025-02-27T02:22:36-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/ryfoOKZ97yx/ryfoOKZ97yx_0_107_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Petah Tikva man charged with spying for Iran	Daniel Kitov, 26, charged with contacting foreign agent and receiving payment for tasks, including spraying graffiti and photographing military sites and the Shin Bet director's home for money The Shin Bet and Israel Police reported Thursday that an indictment was filed against Daniel Kitov, 26, from Petah Tikva, for spying and carrying out tasks on behalf of Iran. According to the statement, Kitov was instructed to photograph the home of Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar and suggested photographing the home of National Unity party leader Benny Gantz. The statement noted that Kitov was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of carrying out various tasks on behalf of a hostile foreign entity. A Shin Bet investigation, conducted alongside the Tel Aviv District Police’s Central Unit, found that Kitov had been in contact with an Iranian operative for months, carrying out dozens of acts of graffiti vandalism in Petah Tikva and Rosh Ha’ayin in exchange for payment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In one of the messages Kitov received, he was instructed: 'Make it big, nice, good, and high quality.' Another message read: 'We have tasks like burning Netanyahu’s picture and filming it.' Kitov responded, 'I can only do graffiti. What should I write? And how much do you pay?' The agent replied: 'Graffiti—$40. Posting flyers—$2 per flyer. Burning Netanyahu’s picture—$50. You need to write ‘Bibi is a dictator.’' The investigation found that Kitov was instructed to photograph the home of Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar and several military bases. He was also asked if he knew any Israeli Air Force pilots. While he did not complete these tasks, he independently offered to photograph the home of MK Gantz, though that, too, was never carried out. Authorities determined that Kitov was aware he had been in contact with an Iranian handler, partly based on media reports and his own online searches on the topic. The indictment, filed in the Lod District Court, charges him with contact with a foreign agent. The graffiti Kitov sprayed included the phrases 'Conquerors of Khaybar' and 'Children of Ruhollah.' The term 'Ruhollah' is commonly associated with religious and nationalist figures in Shiite Islam, while 'Conquerors of Khaybar' has been used in anti-Jewish contexts, primarily by Islamist groups. Kitov was caught in the act, and investigators found he had received $7,000 for his activities. The Iranian agents he communicated with used the aliases 'Mike' and 'Roni Bar.' The Shin Bet and police warned that 'intelligence and terrorist elements continue their efforts to recruit Israelis for security and terrorist missions within Israel. These actors attempt to recruit Israelis through social media, and we caution citizens and residents of Israel against engaging with foreign agents or carrying out missions on their behalf.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk4qx2ackl	2025-02-27T01:37:27-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/BJG6u5pcyx/BJG6u5pcyx_0_130_1170_659_0_small.jpg

Israel-Hamas cease-fire talks: interim deal, renewed fighting or ...	Israel readies a delegation for hostage deal talks, but Trump envoy warns of Middle East volatility; Hamas demands a higher price for additional hostage releases without ending the war, while uncertainty looms over the Philadelphi Corridor withdrawal deadline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to decide how to proceed with the hostage deal, as the first phase has concluded. The proposed framework includes two additional phases: a second phase involving a permanent cease-fire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza—where it currently remains only in the buffer zone and along the Philadelphi Corridor. The third phase entails long-term reconstruction of Gaza, during which the remains of fallen hostages would also be returned. Negotiations on the terms of the second phase were supposed to begin on the 16th day of the cease-fire—February 4—but have yet to start officially. However, talks are ongoing with the mediation of Qatar, Egypt and Trump's regional envoy, Steve Witkoff. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, who is in the U.S. and was appointed by Netanyahu to lead the negotiations instead of the heads of the Mossad and Shin Bet, has been in discussions with Witkoff over the past week. Israel is preparing to send a delegation to discuss the next steps, but it has yet to be determined whether talks will be held in Cairo or Doha. Israel is also waiting for Witkoff’s visit, which was postponed this week. Sources in Israel were informed that he plans to arrive next week, but he made it clear that his visit will depend on progress in the negotiations. Possible scenarios and the Philadelphi Corridor hurdle 'If negotiations progress positively enough—this is an initial stage where we set certain boundaries, outline what we want to discuss, and define the outcomes we expect… if everything goes well, I might be able to arrive on Sunday to finalize and implement the agreement,' Witkoff said at an American Jewish Committee conference. He expressed optimism but remained cautious: 'We've had many discussions and people are listening—but that doesn’t mean it will happen. The Middle East is a very chaotic place.' Israel now stands at a crossroads with three main options: resuming hostilities, moving to Phase II or extending Phase I with additional hostage releases. Decision-makers in Jerusalem favor extending Phase I, which could also temporarily defuse political obstacles for Netanyahu, particularly the threat from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to quit the coalition if the war ends. A security official described this scenario as an 'interim deal' that could lead to the release of additional hostages. 'We will try to prolong the cease-fire. Hamas does not want the fighting to resume—it is not in their interest,' he said. Under this scenario, Israel is expected to demand the release of captive fathers still in Hamas' hands, as well as hostages believed to be wounded or ill based on information from captivity survivors. Witkoff hinted at this possibility, saying that advancing Phase II alongside the 'release of additional hostages' is a 'real option.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas has not ruled out extending Phase I but has signaled that it will demand a higher price for each hostage—requiring new negotiations over prisoner-to-hostage release ratios. Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk, in an interview this week, expressed regret over the October 7 massacre due to the devastation it has brought upon Gaza. Speaking to The New York Times, he said that if Phase I is extended, Hamas will demand significantly more prisoners in exchange for each hostage—500 to 1,000 terrorists per hostage—viewing all remaining captives as soldiers. Israel also anticipates that Hamas will seek an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. A further complication in this scenario is a clause in the current agreement requiring Israel to begin withdrawing from the Philadelphi Corridor by this Saturday—the 42nd day of the cease-fire—and to complete the withdrawal by day 50. This is one of the 'red lines' Smotrich has set for Netanyahu. Some believe Israel has no intention of pulling out of Philadelphi, as the withdrawal constitutes part of Phase II, which is unlikely to be agreed upon. The security official addressing the matter called it a 'complex issue' and noted 'significant uncertainty regarding the expected withdrawal.' The second option: Progressing to Phase II Moving to Phase II appears highly unlikely at this stage. Israel insists on achieving all of its war objectives, including dismantling Hamas' military and governing capabilities. Israeli officials have made it clear that in any negotiations for Phase II, Hamas would be required to disarm, demilitarize Gaza entirely and exile its leadership—following the Beirut 1982 model whereby Israel exiled the leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization to Tunisia following its invasion of Lebanon. 'If Hamas agrees—great, the war can end,' an Israeli official said. However, the likelihood of Hamas accepting these terms is extremely low. The group has signaled a willingness—at least on paper—to relinquish control over the future governance of Gaza. However, Israel has made clear that it will not tolerate Hamas ruling from behind the scenes in a 'Hezbollah model' akin to southern Lebanon. If Hamas refuses, and Phase I is not extended, the only remaining option is resuming military operations. 'If Hamas refuses, Israel will achieve its objectives through intense fighting,' the security official asserted. 'This will be combat under a new chief of staff, with weapons and munitions received after the lifting of arms embargoes and with unprecedented U.S. support—which also wants to see Hamas destroyed. The fighting will be intense, and we will eliminate Hamas’ military and governing capabilities, including how humanitarian aid is handled. What was before will not be what happens now. The fighting will be different and so will the humanitarian aspect.' A senior Israeli official added: 'Hamas will have to choose between three options—Phase II under Israeli terms, extending Phase I with additional hostage releases or a return to war.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1hfpq69kg	2025-02-27T01:07:39-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/Hyy8hLc5kx/Hyy8hLc5kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
What is the key to bringing Israeli families back to the peripher...	Tal Basechess says the gap between Israel’s periphery and its center has widened over the past 16 months of war The gap between Israel’s periphery and its center has widened over the past 16 months of war, according to Tal Basechess, CEO of the Israel Association of Community Centers. To help people successfully return to their homes, several new programs are being implemented through the Community Centers in collaboration with the government and philanthropists. For example, additional support is now available for students who need extra help transitioning back to school. Instead of just checking in upon their return, the centers will now provide ongoing online support to ensure students succeed. Basechess spoke to ILTV on the sidelines of the B'Sheva Jerusalem Conference on Monday. Watch other interviews from the B'Sheva conference: Smotrich: If Hamas doesn't return hostages, Israel will seize Gazan land He emphasized that financial incentives alone will not be enough to bring people back to the periphery after the war. A combination of improved transportation, infrastructure, and education will be essential. Equally important, he noted, is ensuring that local community centers remain operational, offering after-school activities for children and spaces for families to come together.

20 years after Jews left Gush Katif, will they return to Gaza?	For 77 years, Israel has sought peace with the Palestinians through withdrawals and removals, but each attempt has led to more conflict In 2005, Israel forcibly evacuated around 10,000 residents from Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip. The hope? Peace. Many believed that withdrawing from Gaza would pave the way for harmony with the Palestinians and, perhaps, even lay the foundation for a future Palestinian state. Instead, Israel was met with relentless rocket fire, terror attacks, and, ultimately, the October 7 massacre—where Gazan terrorists and civilians brutally murdered 1,200 Jews. Now, U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed a plan that could allow Jews to return to Gaza. Other proposals from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and regional players are also emerging. Many doubt Trump’s vision will materialize, but one thing is clear: former Gush Katif residents say that Israel cannot return to the status quo. 'Ever since Donald Trump announced his plan, I can’t get it out of my mind,' Dror Vanunu, who served as Gush Katif’s spokesperson during the 2005 disengagement, said. Standing outside the Gush Katif Heritage Center in Nitzan, Vanunu’s eyes were distant, lost in memory. He recalled how, in 2005, thousands of journalists from around the world descended upon Gush Katif. At the time, there was an illusion, he said—that expelling Jews from the 21 flourishing communities would bring peace, that Gaza would become another Singapore, that its shores would rival the French Riviera, and that 'everything would be awesome.' 'They believed this was just a conflict over territory,' Vanunu said. 'They thought that if the Israelis left everything we built over 35 years, there would be peace. But we knew that once you take us out of Gush Katif, there would be much more terrorism. We used to say Gush Katif was like the pin in the dam of terrorism. Once you pull it out, there will be massive terrorism.' Two years after Israel’s withdrawal, under pressure from the U.S. administration, the Palestinians held elections. The people voted Hamas into power. Within months, the newly elected leadership was throwing its Fatah rivals off rooftops and further radicalizing the enclave. In the years that followed, conflict after conflict erupted—major clashes in 2014 and 2021—culminating in the Hamas-led massacre of 2023. Instead of expelling the terrorists, they expelled the victims of terror. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I think that after 20 years, most Israelis now realize expelling the Jews from Gush Katif was a terrible mistake,' Vanunu said. 'Instead of expelling the terrorists, they expelled the victims of terror.' Vanunu sees Trump’s proposal as the answer. Because what you have is, instead of punishing the victims, you need to punish the terrorists. The only solution is destruction and rebuilding it again—this time, in a different way. It’s a brave solution. 'Because what you have is, instead of punishing the victims, you need to punish the terrorists,' he said. Gaza, he argued, is like biblical Sodom, with its vast underground terror tunnels. 'The only solution is destruction and rebuilding it again—this time, in a different way. It’s a brave solution.' Building a dream For 19 years, Laurence Beziz called Gush Katif home. An immigrant from France who also lived in Los Angeles, she saw her life there as part of something greater—a pioneering effort to build the state of Israel. She and her husband arrived with nothing. Together, they built one of Israel’s most successful farms. 'Life was less about what you wanted for yourself and more about what you wanted for the community,' Beziz recently recalled. 'You looked at yourself as part of something larger. It was not about how much furniture you had or what your house was like, but what you could do for the country,' she said. During those years, she and her husband were young, energetic, and driven by dreams. 'We had a lot of dreams, and basically, I can say that all of them came true,' Beziz said. When former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon first spoke of the disengagement, the Jewish residents of Gush Katif couldn’t believe it. The government had invested heavily in schools, infrastructure, and services, and the communities were thriving. 'It seemed impossible to destroy all of it,' Beziz said. Moreover, the government was unprepared. Beziz recalled the chaos of August 15, 2005—the first and central day of the disengagement. 'There was a lot of chaos. A lot of people leaving, some refusing to leave, soldiers coming in, policemen everywhere,' she said. She lost more than 10 acres of greenhouses, wiping away years of hard work. But more than that, she lost her dreams. 'Gush Katif is still very much anchored in us,' Beziz said. 'Coming to Israel and feeling like pioneers—that connection between the land, ourselves, and building a community—that’s powerful. It’s a part of you. Looking back at my life, it was a great achievement.' She added, 'The way that we were uprooted from this land—it’s something we cannot forget. It was done in a way that didn’t respect all we built.' A history of Jewish presence in Gaza Jews have been present in the Gaza region since ancient times. According to the Torah, the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac spent time there. Genesis 20:1 describes Abraham as settling in Gerar, a city within Gaza. Later, during a famine, Isaac considered traveling to Egypt, but God instructed him to stay in Gerar, saying: 'Dwell in this land, and I will be with you, and I will bless you; for to you and your descendants I will give all these lands' (Genesis 26:3). It was in Gaza that God reaffirmed His covenant, promising the Jewish people their inheritance in the Land of Israel. For centuries, Jews lived in Gaza—only to be repeatedly expelled. The Romans forced them out, followed by the Crusaders, Napoleon, the Ottoman Turks, the British in 1929, and the Egyptians in 1948. So when Israel reclaimed Gaza in the 1967 Six-Day War, it seemed natural for Jews to return and rebuild.'These were left-wing leaders at the time,' Vanunu said, 'but they understood there had to be a presence in Gush Katif. They believed that if you want to protect the southern part of Israel, you must have communities [in Gaza], not just army bases.' Of the 21 Jewish communities in Gaza, about 70% were religious or traditional, while the rest were secular. Most relied on agriculture. For 36 years, Gush Katif thrived, producing large quantities of peppers, tomatoes, flowers, and other crops for Israel and beyond. Vanunu, like Beziz, recalled that residents never believed the disengagement would happen. But as the reality set in, they launched an 18-month campaign to stop it. 'We went all over the country,' Vanunu said. 'We kept telling people it would be a disaster for Israel.' But in the end, he said, it became clear that even if most of the Knesset opposed the plan, Sharon would find a way to push it through. And that’s exactly what happened. A Life Built and LostVanunu remembers Gush Katif as a place with a 'special atmosphere,' a thriving community where life felt meaningful and connected to the land. He and his wife lived there for 11 years with their three children; now they have six. In December 2003, after years of waiting, they finally received the permits to build their home. Construction began immediately. But in June 2004, the government announced its decision to disengage from Gaza. 'My wife and I didn’t know what to do,' Vanunu recalled. 'We were hesitating, but in the end, we decided to move forward. We completed the home about five months before the expulsion. We loved it.' Beyond their home, they loved Gush Katif—the beaches, the farms, the greenhouses, and the vibrant flowers and plants.'Gush Katif was a miracle,' Vanunu said. 'When the Jews arrived, the Arabs asked what they planned to do with the land since it was just dunes. The Jews said agriculture. The Arabs said there was no chance—it was the desert. But the pioneers told them, ‘Don’t worry, you’ll see. This area will flourish.’ And it happened.' He added, 'We were able to make the desert heaven.' With Trump’s plan on the table, Vanunu has already considered whether he would return, saying, 'There is a good chance' he would despite everything he lost. After being forced out of Gaza, Vanunu lived in a hotel for six months, then in a caravan for nearly a decade before finally moving into a permanent home in Nitsan. Many families had it even harder—some waited 18 years to resettle. 'There was compensation,' he said, 'but it was very low compared to what we lost. Many families, despite receiving compensation, were not able to rebuild their lives.' For nearly 77 years, Israel has tried again and again to find solutions with the Palestinians, Vanunu said—whether by removing Jewish communities, withdrawing from hilltops, or even relinquishing entire cities. But each time, the result has been the opposite of peace. 'Gaza became Sodom,' he said. Now, for the first time in years, he feels a glimmer of hope that things might change. Beziz shares that hope, though cautiously. What matters most to her is that Israel and the world remember Gush Katif—not just as a painful chapter but as proof that Israel can rebuild and thrive even after the most challenging times. While not everyone managed to reclaim their lives, as Vanunu described, most of the 10,000 people who were evicted from Gush Katif in 2004 have since moved forward. 'Gush Katif is the Israel story—the Jewish story through the ages,' Beziz said. 'We can have a crisis, we can know trauma. But we can cope. We can make things better.'

With keffiyehs, masks and drums, Pro-Palestinian mob takes over B...	For hours, pro-Palestinian students block hallways and dean's office in administration building of Columbia University's women's college; staff member assaulted by protesters and required hospital treatment, school says More than 50 pro-Palestinian students at Columbia University stormed an administrative building at Barnard College, the university's women's college, late Wednesday night, staging a sit-in blocking the office of Dean Laura Rosenbury for several hours. The students, wearing keffiyehs and masks, carried drums, flags and signs reading 'Free Palestine,' demanding the reinstatement of two students suspended for distributing anti-Zionist flyers during classes, as well as the cancellation of disciplinary actions against students for pro-Palestinian activities. They also called for Barnard to divest funds and publicly condemn Israel’s military actions in Gaza. During the demonstration, a staff member was allegedly assaulted by protesters and required hospital treatment, according to Robin Levine, Barnard’s vice president for strategic communications. Protesters also spray-painted graffiti on building walls with messages such as 'Barnard expels students' and 'F–k Barnard.' Levine said that protesters had also encouraged other people to come on campus without identification. The administration offered to meet with the students if they removed their masks, but protesters refused. The protesters declared they would continue 'until our demands are met,' blocking hallways, drumming and distributing pro-Palestinian leaflets. Some reportedly shoved security personnel upon entering the building. The students eventually agreed to leave only after Barnard officials promised negotiations beginning Thursday afternoon to consider their demands for amnesty for all students they claim were suspended due to pro-Palestinian actions or speech. Barnard College President Laura Rosenbury later issued a statement confirming that the protest had ended: 'Tonight, a small group of masked protesters attempted to undermine Barnard's core values of respect, inclusion, and academic excellence. Thanks to the efforts of our staff and faculty, the protesters have now left Milbank Hall without further incident. But let us be clear: their disregard for the safety of our community remains completely unacceptable.' Brian Cohen, director of Columbia's Hillel student group, condemned the protest, saying it disrupted classes, led to violence against staff, and undermined the rights of Jewish students to study without fear of harassment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Columbia University issued a response stating that the disruption was unacceptable, but emphasized that the matter fell under Barnard College’s jurisdiction. Outside the building, police set up mobile units, including a bus designated for mass arrests. Pro-Israel students said a planned counter-demonstration would proceed Thursday. Israeli professor Shai Davidai, who has become a prominent critic of the university’s handling of such protests, urged supporters to join the counter-rally, writing online: 'Angry about the images coming out of @BarnardCollege? Join me tomorrow to demand consequences. Don’t confuse our non-violence with submissiveness.' The incident echoed a similar protest in April 2024, when pro-Palestinian students occupied Columbia's Hamilton Hall, leading to mass arrests after the university called in New York City police. The university president at that time, Minouche Shafik, later faced heavy criticism and resigned in August 2024, partly due to backlash over her handling of the demonstrations. Her successor, Katrina Armstrong, publicly apologized to pro-Palestinian students for their treatment by university and police officials. Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing the cancellation of visas for foreign students considered 'Hamas supporters,' enabling their deportation. The order pledges to 'investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist and anti-American colleges and universities' and instructs government agencies to identify and utilize all available legal tools against antisemitic attackers and harassers within 60 days. In an explanatory note accompanying the order, Trump warned: 'To all foreign residents who joined pro-jihadist demonstrations—we will find you and deport you.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmkk96qje	2025-02-26T23:25:25-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/rJgHvdTcke/rJgHvdTcke_1_108_603_340_0_small.jpg

Ending the war would hand Hamas a victory, says Israeli security ...	Gilad Kabilo, an Israeli political and security advisor, explained that Hamas’s core strategy was to stop the war by taking hostages If Israel ends the war against Hamas in Gaza, the terrorist organization would be seen as the victor, according to Gilad Kabilo, an Israeli political and security advisor. He told ILTV News that the world is already witnessing this in the humiliating parades Hamas has staged with hostages. 'Suddenly, Hamas militants found their uniforms and are showing up in their masks and with their guns as Hamas militants and not as civilians as they've been fighting,' Kabilo said. He explained that Hamas’s core strategy was to stop the war by taking hostages. The idea that Hamas will eventually release all the hostages contradicts its fundamental strategy of using them as leverage for its survival. 'The general idea right now is to divide between either continuing and extending phase one—meaning the same prices, the same cadence, the same keys that we've been seeing—or to go to a new deal called phase two,' Kabilo said. 'The issue here is going to be the timing and the prices, which is more of the micro-technical. But on a larger level, is it going to be an end to the war? Something, in my opinion, that Israel cannot live with, but that for Hamas, is the core issue.'

Remains of hostages Itzik Elgarat, Ohad Yahalomi and Shlomo Manso...	After 510 days in captivity, Kibbutz Nir Oz confirms Yahalomi and Elgart murdered in Hamas captivity; Kibbutz Kissufim announces identification of Shlomo Mansour, the oldest hostage taken on October 7; their coffins, along with that of Tzachi Idan, returned from Gaza overnight Kibbutz Nir Oz announced Thursday morning that Itzik Elgarat and Ohad Yahalomi, who were abducted from their homes during the October 7 Hamas-led attack, were murdered in captivity in Gaza. The family of Shlomo Mansour was also informed that his remains were identified at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. The coffins of the three hostages were transferred to Israel overnight, along with the remains of hostage Tsachi Idan, whose identification has yet to be officially confirmed. The hostages had been held in Gaza for 510 days before their remains were recovered. Itzik Elgarat - remembered for his laughter and big heart Residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz described Itzik Elgarat, who was abducted at age 68, as a beloved figure in their community. 'We will remember him for his laughter, his big heart and his unwavering willingness to help anyone in need,' they said. 'For years, he served the kibbutz with dedication as a groundskeeper and was responsible for plumbing, gas and steam maintenance. He was an integral part of the social fabric, loved spending time at the local pub, hosting friends and connecting generations. His passion for soccer and backgammon was well known, and he was a star of local games—always with a smile and good spirit.' Elgarat is survived by two children, a brother and two sisters. Elgarat was abducted from the safe room of his home during the October 7 attack. Before being taken, he was wounded by gunfire and called his brother, Danny, for help. Danny guided him on how to apply a tourniquet, but their conversation was abruptly cut off. For a long time, his fate remained unknown, until it was confirmed that he had been taken alive despite his injuries. Elgarat had previously lived in Denmark, where his children reside, before returning to Israel several years ago. His brother, Danny, became a prominent voice in the fight to bring the hostages home, regularly attending protests, giving media interviews and speaking at Knesset committees. This week, in a session of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, he asserted that his brother did not die due to military pressure but rather succumbed to starvation in captivity. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'My brother was not killed by an Air Force strike—my brother starved to death. He simply starved,' Danny said. 'They could have brought him out. In November, there was a deal, but they gave up on all the elderly and went to war instead. Now, all those elderly hostages are buried. They are all dead. Who will take responsibility for this? Who will answer for the decision to leave them there?' he asked the attendees. 'We warned, we pleaded, we said time was their oxygen.' Ohad Yahalomi - devoted family man and nature conservationist The kibbutz also paid tribute to Ohad Yahalomi, who was murdered in Hamas captivity at age 50, describing him as 'a devoted and loving family man, a sports enthusiast and an avid hiker who knew every trail and landmark in the desert he cherished.' 'For years, he worked at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, dedicating his life to protecting nature,' the kibbutz statement continued. 'His deep love for the desert led him to co-publish a scorpion field guide and take part in educational initiatives within the Bedouin community. We will always remember him as a man of values, full of compassion, who loved both people and the land.' Yahalomi is survived by his wife, three young children, extended family and many friends. The Yahalomi family was abducted in its entirety during the October 7 attack. Ohad’s wife, Bat Sheva, and their two young daughters were taken on one motorcycle, while their son, Eitan, was placed on another. Ohad, who was left behind injured, was later seized as well. As the kidnappers neared the Gaza border, the terrorist transporting Bat Sheva and her daughters panicked and fell off the bike. Seizing the moment, she managed to escape with the girls. However, the captors continued into Gaza with Ohad and Eitan. Eitan endured 52 days in captivity—16 of them alone—before being released. Yahalomi, a dedicated ranger at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, remained missing for months. 'We have no information about him,' Bat Sheva said in an earlier interview. 'That’s the worst part—living on shaky ground, with no certainty. It’s gut-wrenching.' 'I can’t begin to imagine what this time is doing to the hostages,' she continued. 'Every day adds another unbearable weight of despair. We were in that hell for just one day, feeling like no one was coming to save us. What must they be feeling?' Shlomo Manour - the grandfather to everyone Hadassah Lazar, Shlomo Mansour's sister, confirmed that the family had been notified of the official identification of his remains at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. 'None of this should have happened,' she said. 'It is heartbreaking that in our own country, we are forced to take solace in receiving a body to bury.' She added, 'I am filled with rage over what happened. I don’t know if this is truly a form of comfort—I am just full of anger. Now, we all owe him an apology. As a child, he survived the Farhud pogrom, and now, in his old age, he could not survive the catastrophe that befell us on October 7. He was a man of rare character.' Kibbutz Kissufim, from which Mansour was abducted during the October 7 attack, paid tribute to him, describing him as 'a beloved and cherished figure.' 'For us, Shlomo was the heart of our community—the grandfather to everyone,' the kibbutz said in a statement. 'Always with a warm smile, never forgetting a single birthday, always calling to say 'mazal tov.' He had a rare gift of making each person feel like they were the center of his world, through his warmth, kindness and selfless presence. His memory will stay with us forever. May his soul be bound in the bond of life. May his memory be a blessing.' Hamas handed over the remains of four hostages overnight. The coffins were transferred to the Red Cross shortly after midnight and were delivered to Israeli forces inside Gaza about an hour later. In accordance with Israel’s demands, Hamas reportedly refrained from transferring the hostages' remains in a public display. Around 5 a.m., a convoy carrying the coffins arrived at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. Dozens of people awaited their arrival throughout the night, holding Israeli flags, yellow flags and banners of Hapoel Tel Aviv—the soccer team supported by Tsachi Idan, one of the victims. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ievyaq1g	2025-02-26T21:48:50-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/r1M4kYT5Jg/r1M4kYT5Jg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
1 in 3 Israeli families lives in poverty, says NGO	In Israel, thousands go to bed hungry—this charity is making sure they don’t have to For many, Passover and Purim are holidays filled with family, fun, and food. But today in Israel, thousands of families go to bed hungry. 'One in three families is living under the poverty line in Israel, and we are here to help,' said Shimona Geffen of Yad Ezra v’Shulamit. That’s where Yad Ezra v’Shulamit steps in. Established in 1988, the organization provides 12,000 food baskets every week, ensuring no one is left behind. 'We want to make sure that everyone's needs are met and they receive everything they need for the week,' Geffen explained. The process is simple: anyone in need can apply for a food basket, and the organization will do everything possible to ensure their needs are met. 'Once we receive the application form, we then verify that these people need food for various means,' Geffen said. Operating nationwide, Yad Ezra v’Shulamit makes sure help reaches every corner of Israel, no matter where people live. 'We have 15 trucks that deliver food to 93 distribution points across Israel,' Geffen continued. Their mission extends beyond food. They provide clothing, school supplies, wedding support, and more—offering a safety net for those in need. 'We are the lifeline to many families across Israel,' Geffen emphasized. Their impact has been so significant that they have received government recognition. 'Recently, we were recognized by the Knesset for delivering the most amount of food every single week,' Geffen noted. But the demand only grows during the holidays. 'We don’t just stop there. We don’t just stop at weekly food baskets. For the holidays, we deliver over 60,000 food baskets, and this number is obviously determined by what we get in,' Geffen said. This article was written in collaboration with Yad Ezra v'Shulamit.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkppek69ye	2025-02-26T21:28:30-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/H1b18YT9yx/H1b18YT9yx_0_104_1024_577_0_small.jpg

A group of about 50 pro-Palestinian students at Columbia University stormed the administration building of Barnard College, the university’s women’s college, on Wednesday, blocking access to the office of Dean Laura Rosenbury. The protesters demanded the reinstatement of two students suspended for distributing anti-Zionist flyers in classrooms, which disrupted lectures. 'We will continue disrupting until our demands are met. Free Palestine,' the demonstrators chanted, according to witnesses. The protesters also spray-painted anti-institution graffiti on the building's walls.

Elgarat, 68 at the time of his abduction, moved to Nir Oz to join his brother Danny and became a beloved member of the community. He served for years as the kibbutz's groundskeeper and infrastructure manager. 'He was an integral part of our social fabric, known for his love of soccer, backgammon and bringing people together,' the kibbutz said in a statement.

Mount Hermon to reopen after year-long closure	After nearly a year and a half of closure due to the wars in Gaza and the north, the resort will finally reopen to visitors next week on March 4 Good news for Israeli snow lovers. The Mount Hermon Ski Resort has announced its reopening date. After nearly a year and a half of closure due to the wars in Gaza and the north, the resort will finally reopen to visitors next week on March 4th, according to the management team. However, the reopening is still pending final approval from the IDF, as the site has been designated a closed military zone under the Northern Command since last year. For now, the site will be open to visitors only, with no skiing due to significant war damage to the infrastructure, including direct hits on two ski lifts. Repair efforts are still underway. Visitors will have access to a cable car ride, an extreme sledding attraction, and children’s snow sledding.

Coffins taken to Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to determine cause of death; IDF and Israel Police special forces escort the convy while Isarelis come out holding flags to honor the hostages coming home Tzachi Idan, Itzik Elgert, Shlomo Mansour and 1 other dead hostage were en route to the Institute of Forensic Medicine early on Thrusday . They were returned to Israel on Wednesday after they were released by Hamas ending the first phase of the cease-fire agreement. The convoy was escorted by IDF and Israel Police special forces. A military honor guard received them at Kerem Shalom where preliminary forensic examinations were made to enable a positive identification. Chief military Rabbi, Brigadier General Rabbi Eyal Krim held a small religious ceremony upon their arrival. The families of the hostages were notified that their loved ones were to return and will get final confirmation after the forensic examination to determine the cuse of death is complete. Isarelis came out in the late night hours, carrying flags to honor the hostages as they made their way to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. 'We will honor those who were abducted and deserted,' they said. Many of those people, residents of the communities near the border, neighbors of those who were abducted. 'This has not been an easy day, Nahal Oz secretary Matan Weize said of his neighbor and freind Tzachi Idan. 'We've held on to hope until the last moment. But it was important to us to be here to pay respect as the convoy passes.' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on behalf of the family of Tzachi Idan, who was kidnapped on October 7 from his home in Nahal Oz: 'Our family received with great sadness the announcement from Hamas that our beloved Tzachi is no longer alive and his body will be returned to Israel during the night. We are all still waiting for the long-awaited certainty, which we will be able to receive only after he arrives in Israel and all the necessary tests are conducted by the authorized authorities of the state, while maintaining the privacy of Tzachi and his family.' 'Since Tzachi was kidnapped on his feet, we have received several signs of life, and in the previous deal in November last year, Tzachi was alive and expected to be released. We are grateful for the great love and support we receive from the citizens of Israel, the media and the Nahal Oz community. In these difficult times, we ask that our privacy be respected. We will update later after receiving details from authorized officials of the State of Israel,' the statement from the family also said. Tzachi Idan, 50, was kidnapped from his home in Nahal Oz, after terrorists who broke in and murdered his oldest daughter, Maayan. Their home became a sort of terrorist headquarters, where they gathered other families from the kibbutz. From there, they handcuffed and took Tzachi and Omri Miran, and Yehudit and Natalie Raanan, who have since been released. Tzachi worked in high-tech, was married to Gali for 18 years, and the two are parents of four: the late Maayan, 15.5-year-old Sharon, who was with her aunt in Tel Aviv on Oct. 7, 12-year-old Yael, and 10-year-old Shahar. His family and friends say that he was 'passionate about soccer and a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv' Danny Elgert said his brother was sacrificed on the alter of politics. In a poem he wrote to his brother Danny said he was defeated in his fight to bring his brother home alive, the total victory was over him, he said aluding to the declarations of Prime Minister Benjamin Netayahu and others in his government that the war will be faught until total victory is achieved. 'We are very sad, we feel very bad, but right now we are focused on one thing - and that is to bring Itzik home, to Nir Oz, and there to give him all the respect he deserves,' he told ynet earlier. 'Enough time has passed and we need to face reality. If some mistake was made, which I find hard to believe, then we will be surprised. Right now we just feel great sadness,' he said. Elgert said that the family heard from hostages who were returned in the first deal two months after October 7, and later from Sagui Dekel Chen and Yarden Bibas that Itzik had been alive when he was kidnapped and that by April his condition had deteriorated and his life was in danger. Itzik, 69, was kidnapped on the day of the massacre from his home. He had been wounded by gunfire earlier and called his brother Danny to ask for help. Danny explained to him how to place a tourniquet, and then their conversation was interrupted. For a long time his condition was unknown, until it became clear that he had been kidnapped alive despite his injuries. Itzik had previously lived in Denmark, where his children live, and returned to Israel a few years ago. Shlomo Mansour, 85, was the oldest hostage held in Gaza. He was kidnapped on October 7 from his home in Kibbutz Kissufim, when terrorists took him and handcuffed him. His wife Mazal begged for her life and managed to escape. About two weeks ago, the kibbutz announced that it had been informed by the IDF that Shlomo had been murdered on October 7 and his body taken in to Gaza. He is survived by five children and 12 grandchildren. 'In accordance with Israel's demands, an agreement was reached with the mediators: our four fallen hostages will be returned tonight as part of Phase I, in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies,' the Prime Minister's office said earlier. Earlier, a police source told Ynet that preparations are also being made in Israel to return the hostages' bodies. Violations from day one Negotiations for the next phase of the deal have been taking place all week in the U.S. between President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and the head of the negotiating team, government minister Ron Dermer. Internal discussions and processes have taken place within Israel. Israel plans to send a delegation as soon as the current phase is completed. At the moment it is not clear whether the delegation will arrive in Doha or Cairo, but as soon as the bodies are transferred Israel will be ready to send a team. Senior Israeli officials said that, over the past month, Israel has warned the mediators not to turn a blind eye to Hamas' violations. During talks in Doha, and later in Cairo, Israel made it clear that it views Hamas' violations as serious. These violations include Hamas' decision to disrupt the implementation of the agreement when a cabinet discussion on Phase II began and the decision not to hold the previous meeting. In talks in Cairo, Israel made it clear that the debasing and humiliating handover ceremonies are unacceptable, both in terms of the danger to the hostages as in the case with with Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, and also in the manner in which the degrading ceremonies are performed. Israel specifically warned against such degrading ceremonies with the dead hostages. And although the message was conveyed and received, Hamas held shocking ceremony with the offins of the Bibas family and Oded Lipshitz, and in addition they transferred a Gazan body to Israel, instead of that of Shiri Bibas. Israel was also outraged by Hamas' shocking act last Saturday of bringing Guy Gilboa Dalal and Aviatar David to the release ceremony of Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert and Eliya Cohen. 'We warned against this and we will not tolerate this as the next attack,' said an Israeli official. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bbomfesaw	2025-02-26T17:22:27-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/Sy3CoSa5Jl/Sy3CoSa5Jl_1_39_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The BBC censored Gazans remarks in controversial documentary: Ins...	BBC accused of mistranslating anti-Jewish rhetoric in 'Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone' documentary, sparking allegations of bias and whitewashing The BBC has been accused of 'whitewashing' participants’ views in its controversial Gaza documentary by mistranslating references to 'the Jews' and omitting praise of 'jihad.' An investigation by The Telegraph found that on at least five occasions, the words Yahud or Yahudy —Arabic for 'Jew' or 'Jews'— were changed to 'Israel' or 'Israeli forces' in subtitles, or removed entirely. In one instance, an interviewee praised Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar for his 'jihad against the Jews,' but the BBC translated it as 'fighting Israeli forces.' The broadcaster also faces pressure to clarify whether taxpayer money was given to Hamas during the production of 'Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.' Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said counter-terror police should investigate if funds were transferred. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has also raised concerns with BBC director-general Tim Davie. 'It is essential that the BBC maintains the highest standards of reporting,' she said, adding that she expects to be informed of the findings of the broadcaster’s internal investigation. The documentary, originally promoted as an 'unflinching' look at life in Gaza, was removed from iPlayer after it emerged that one of its main participants was the son of a Hamas minister. New translations by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (CAMERA) have raised further questions about the BBC’s handling of the film. In one scene, a Gazan woman fleeing an area under attack says: 'The Jews invaded our [area].' The BBC subtitles quoted her as saying: 'The Israeli army invaded our area.' In another, a boy says: 'The Jews came, they destroyed us, Hamas and the Jews.' The subtitles rendered this as: 'The Israelis destroyed everything, and so did Hamas.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During a distressing moment where a doctor amputates a child’s arm, the subtitles quote him saying: 'Look what the Israelis are doing to the children of Gaza.' However, the word 'Israeli' was not actually used, according to CAMERA. A young girl watching Iranian missiles in the sky during the Islamic Republic’s attack on Israel in October 2023 is quoted in the subtitles as saying: 'We’re used to seeing flashes of lightning in the sky. But now it’s real missiles.' However, CAMERA’s translation states she actually said: 'At first, when we would see these [flashes], they would be flares, by the way. From the Jews. But now they turned out to be [real] missiles.' In another mistranslation, a woman discussing the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks is quoted as saying it was the 'first time we invaded Israel.' However, she actually said: 'We were invading the Jews for the first time.' Later, a Palestinian woman showing footage of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is quoted as saying he was 'prepared for battle,' but CAMERA’s translation states she actually said he was 'ready for jihad.' Another subtitle quotes her as saying Sinwar was 'fighting and resisting Israeli forces,' but the actual translation, per CAMERA, is: 'He was engaging in resistance and jihad against the Jews.' Alex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, accused the BBC of 'sanitizing' views about Sinwar and presenting a 'more acceptable version for a Western audience.' 'This whitewashing keeps viewers ill-informed about Hamas and promotes sympathy for their deadly ideology,' he said. 'It signifies the institutional failure behind the BBC’s reporting of the Israel-Hamas conflict.' Orly Goldschmidt, a spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in the UK, called the mistranslations 'intentional' and a 'sinister and misleading policy.' She said the changes 'excuse racism' and 'do not allow viewers to see how children, and Palestinians at large, have been taught to hate ‘Jews’ from a very young age.' She also criticized the omission of 'jihad,' arguing that it 'downplays the threat of terrorism that Israelis face daily.' 'The issue goes beyond one documentary,' she added. 'It reflects a serious and systematic problem at the BBC regarding its anti-Israel bias.' The BBC did not comment on the latest concerns but referred to previous findings by its editorial standards committee, which had not upheld complaints regarding the translation of the word Yahud. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjjj2ba5yx	2025-02-26T13:24:51-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/SkZs0Yu39Jg/SkZs0Yu39Jg_0_0_767_427_0_small.jpg
71 serving life sentences, Shalit deal releasees and convicted ki...	After a five-day delay due to Hamas violations and its macabre ceremonies, Israel is set to release more than 600 Palestinian prisoners; Of these, 457 will be sent to Gaza, including many arrested after the October 7 massacre As part of the release last week of six living hostages, Israel is expected to free 620 Palestinian prisoners, whose release was postponed due to Hamas violations in the previous round, when the bodies of four hostages were returned. Among those to be released, 71 were sentenced to life terms, while 60 others received lengthy prison sentences. A total of 97 prisoners will be deported outside Palestinian territories, five will be released to East Jerusalem, 37 to the West Bank, and 457 to the Gaza Strip. Additionally, 105 prisoners will be released with 24 hours' worth of medication, and five will be transferred by ambulance. The release also includes 47 prisoners who were re-arrested after being freed in the 2011 Shalit deal, as well as 445 Gazans who were detained following the October 7 attack. Following Hamas' controversial 'ceremony' in which it transferred the remains of hostages Oded Lifshitz, Ariel Bibas, and his infant brother Kfir, as well as an unrelated Palestinian woman’s body instead of Shiri Bibas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced a decision to delay the release of 620 prisoners 'until the next hostages are freed and without further acts of desecration.' The prisoners were originally slated for release following the handover of six living hostages on Saturday. However, even after being loaded onto transport vehicles, they were returned to prison. Subsequent understandings led to the decision to transfer four dead hostages without a public ceremony. > Among those to be deported is Nael Barghouti, convicted of murdering Israeli bus driver Mordechai Yekuel in 1978. Barghouti was initially freed in the Shalit deal but later re-arrested for violating his release terms. Another notable prisoner is Salama Qatawi, who led Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails over the past four years. Jailed in 2009 for activities with Hamas’ military wing, he was sentenced to 15 years. Also being released is Bilal Abu Ghanem, sentenced to three life terms for the 2015 attack on Jerusalem’s Bus 78, which killed Chaim Haviv, Alon Govberg and Richard Lakin. Another prisoner set to be freed is Khalil Jabarin Abu Hamid, who murdered Ari Fuld in 2018 at the entrance to a shopping center in Gush Etzion. He was sentenced to life in prison. Also released will be Omar al-Zaben, who was convicted on multiple counts related to deadly attacks, sentenced to 27 life terms plus 25 years, and imprisoned for more than 19 years. A senior figure in Hamas' military wing, he was found responsible for multiple attacks that killed 27 Israelis. This phase of the prisoner release, which was postponed, includes three veteran prisoners who will all be deported outside Palestinian territories. Alongside Barghouti, Samer Mahroun will be released after serving 38 years for the 1986 murder of a yeshiva student in Jerusalem, and Alaa al-Din al-Bazian, who served 42 years for involvement in various attacks, including the 2014 abduction and murder of Israeli teenagers Naftali Frenkel, Gil-Ad Shaer, and Eyal Yifrah. On Thursday, Israeli ministers voted on a last-minute swap in which seven prisoners originally slated for deportation chose to remain in prison, and seven others were selected in their place, four of whom are now designated for expulsion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1xodz65kg	2025-02-26T12:54:00-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/B1eUXtRpKkx/B1eUXtRpKkx_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Michael Rapaport on Bibas family tragedy: 'Devastating, heartbrea...	Actor, comedian and outspoken Israel supporter says coffins' should serve as wake-up call to the world; condemns captors’ actions as 'disgusting, demonic' Actor and comedian Michael Rapaport has long been an outspoken supporter of Israel, unafraid to share his views on social media. In an interview Wednesday, he reflected on the funeral of the Bibas family—mother Shiri and her two children, Ariel and Kfir — whose deaths in captivity in Gaza shocked and devastated many around the world. 'May their memory be a revolution,' Rapaport said. 'Their story touched everyone, and obviously, this is not the ending we wanted. It’s a horrific, heartbreaking loss. I can’t even begin to imagine what their family is going through.' The Bibas family was among the hostages taken to Gaza during the October 7 attack. After months of uncertainty about their fate, it was revealed that they had been killed by their captors in Gaza. Their bodies were returned last week for burial. Rapaport said that the images from their funeral procession, particularly the sight of their small coffins, may have finally awakened some people to the brutality of those responsible.

'Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iranian regime — they’ve never hidden their intentions. Their only goal is to terrorize, to kill Jews, to destroy Israel. It’s not a secret. They say it openly, and their actions prove it. What happened to the Bibas family—how they were treated, how they were paraded around — it was disgusting, demonic. I hope and pray the world is finally seeing them for what they are.' Rapaport, who has used his platform to call for the release of Israeli hostages, said he is determined to keep speaking out. 'The world must not forget them,' he said. 'America must not forget them. There are still five Americans in captivity, along with so many others. Every single one of them must be freed — immediately.' The comedian, known for his passionate and often unfiltered commentary, said that, despite the criticism he receives online, most of the responses in recent weeks have been supportive. 'Social media is fake, but I feel like the vast majority stand with Israel,' he said. 'Of course, there are the lunatics, the provocateurs, and the fake accounts. But overall, I believe most people understand the truth of what’s happening.' For Rapaport, his advocacy is deeply personal. 'There was never a choice — I stand with my people, and I always will,' he said. 'The pain I feel is nothing compared to what the Bibas family’s relatives are going through, what the hostage families are going through, what the soldiers fighting in the IDF are facing. I try to take myself out of the equation and keep fighting for them as long as I can,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byw2jdh91g	2025-02-26T12:17:20-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/rJDTnwn9Jg/rJDTnwn9Jg_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF presents investigation into October 7 massacre at Kfar Aza: '...	Investigation into massacre at Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where 64 were killed and 19 kidnapped, presented to community; Families express disappointment: 'Military says there was a 'failure,' apologized, but there was nothing we didn't already know' An IDF investigation into the October 7 massacre in Kibbutz Kfar Aza was presented to the community on Wednesday. The kibbutz was overtaken by Hamas terrorists during the terror attack, resulting in the murder of 64 members and the abduction of 19 others. IDF representatives emphasized at the start of the briefing that the army failed to respond in time, taking hours to arrive at the kibbutz. Brig. Gen. Rafi Milo, head of the Home Front Command, participated in the presentation. 'There was a huge gap between how we perceived Hamas strategically and the reality. That was the concept,' he acknowledged. Hundreds of community members attended the briefing, which was held at Kibbutz Ruhama in the Sha'ar HaNegev region, where Kfar Aza residents are temporarily housed. Among the attendees was hostage survivor Amit Soussana. Kfar Aza officials issued a statement following the presentation, describing the IDF’s investigation as 'shocking, difficult, and a further testament to the fact that Kibbutz Kfar Aza was overtaken on the cursed morning of October 7 by hundreds of terrorists, and its residents were abandoned. For hours, community members cried for help and fought almost alone, showing heroism and camaraderie against hundreds of murderers. The local defense team fought valiantly without any soldiers entering the kibbutz until late morning. Even when soldiers did arrive, it was without control or command.' The statement continued: 'Sixty-four members of our community were murdered, 19 were abducted from their homes, and dozens of buildings were burned or severely damaged. This is an unimaginable failure of the IDF’s command and defense apparatus. The investigation is thorough, but to the critical question of where was the IDF — there is no real answer.' The community emphasized that Israel has a moral obligation to bring home its members twin brothers Gali and Ziv Berman, and all the other hostages. It also called for ensuring that all security and physical conditions are met for the rehabilitation of Kfar Aza. 'We will forever remember and honor the soldiers and security personnel who arrived, fought with determination, and sacrificed their lives for us,' according to a statement from the community. Before the full investigation was presented, a general overview was given to the bereaved families from the kibbutz. Several of them, present at the meeting with Milo, shared that there was significant tension in the room and that the families left dissatisfied with the answers provided. 'There was nothing in the investigation,' they said, 'They said it was an ‘intelligence failure,’ which is all we've been hearing for a year and a half. There was nothing new. They didn’t focus on the data. They just apologized from start to finish.' One bereaved family member added: 'Grieving parents were in tears. He (Milo) took responsibility, which we don’t accept, claiming he regretted not going to fight that day. Why would he, as head of the Home Front Command, go fight? He said the main problem was that we became addicted to intelligence — and the intelligence said there were no irregularities.' Another family criticized the investigation, claiming it described events 'as if they were in an alternate world — and we weren’t there.' Earlier this month, Ynet reported new revelations about the massacre. The IDF’s investigation, which will be published Thursday and has already been shared with communities in the Gaza border area, reveals a number of failures during the October 7 attack in Kfar Aza. According to the investigation, in at least one instance, an IDF soldier mistakenly killed a civilian who had been abducted with his vehicle. The soldiers believed the individual was a terrorist and opened fire. The victim’s family was recently updated on the findings but had initially suspected friendly fire. The investigation outlines a series of failures, including delays in the forces’ arrival at the kibbutz and a failure to enter and engage Hamas terrorists, as the soldiers waited for further orders. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The investigation also revealed that, after some soldiers entered the kibbutz and cleared areas of Hamas fighters, they did not secure the area and left. It later emerged that terrorists returned to the kibbutz and continued their killing, abduction and destruction. Additionally, the evacuation of civilians, many of whom had gathered at the gas station outside the kibbutz, was not documented, which prevented forces from understanding who was still inside their homes and hindered further combat. Another mistake in judgment was the decision to evacuate civilians to the gas station, which turned out to be a poor choice, as additional terrorists were present in the area. The soldiers assigned to protect civilians inside the station did not conduct external defense operations. The decision to evacuate kibbutz residents by bus on Route 232 toward the Sha'ar Hanegev Junction was also questioned, as the buses were unprotected and the area was still under attack. Fortunately, the buses were able to travel safely, despite the ongoing fighting. The investigation also highlighted failures in handling the bodies of civilians, local defense team members, and security forces. The IDF and emergency services evacuated bodies to collection points in the kibbutz without documenting the location or circumstances of the deaths, which could have provided critical information for investigation and for the victims’ families. Despite these findings, the kibbutz emphasized that 'the forces that did eventually enter fought like lions, some knowing they wouldn’t survive. IDF soldiers saved lives in Kfar Aza, and they rescued civilians from their homes despite everything.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwxr02q1e	2025-02-26T11:31:18-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/29/Byp3JKBnv6/Byp3JKBnv6_0_179_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Trump addresses Phase II of hostage deal, says decision on cease-...	Trump says next steps in hostage deal depend on Israel, expresses concern over returned bodies; 'They think they're doing us a favor by sending us bodies' U.S. President Donald Trump commented Wednesday on the transition to Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage return deal, stating that the decision regarding the continuation of the deal and the cease-fire in Gaza lies with Israel. 'This is a decision that needs to be made by Israel, by Bibi. Israel has to make this decision,' Trump said during a press briefing at the White House when asked about potential progress in the ongoing negotiations. Trump expressed disappointment at the recent return of four bodies of victims, emphasizing the tragedy of young lives lost. 'These are young people. Young people don’t die,' Trump remarked. 'They think they're doing us a favor by sending us bodies.' He described one particularly disturbing account, recounting how how hostage Emily Damari was injured after trying to shield herself from a bullet, which blew off part of her hand. 'This is a vicious group of people, and Israel’s going to have to decide what they’re doing,' Trump added. The president continued, highlighting the emotional toll on families who have lost loved ones. 'I’ve spoken to a lot of parents and people involved. They want those bodies almost as much, if not more, than they want their son or daughter. It’s incredible the level of importance they place on bringing back the bodies,' he said, noting the emotional depth of families requesting their deceased loved ones' remains. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump further remarked on the condition of some victims, comparing them to survivors of concentration camps. 'The first group that came in two weeks ago looked like they just got out of a concentration camp. The next group that came in wasn't in as bad a shape, but Israel's going to have to make a decision,' he said. Trump stressed that while Phase 1 of the deal is concluding, it remains a sad situation as bodies continue to be returned. As the discussions around the hostage deal continue, Trump’s remarks underscore the complex decisions ahead for Israel regarding the future of the cease-fire and the ongoing hostage negotiations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skcmtjpqke	2025-02-26T11:10:01-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/HyrP1RhcJg/HyrP1RhcJg_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

White House bars AP, Reuters and other media from covering Trump ...	The White House on Wednesday denied reporters from Reuters and other news organizations access to President Donald Trump's first cabinet meeting in keeping with the administration's new policy regarding media coverage. The White House denied access to an Associated Press photographer and three reporters from Reuters, HuffPost and Der Tagesspiegel, a German newspaper. TV crews from ABC and Newsmax, along with correspondents from Axios, the Blaze, Bloomberg News and NPR were permitted to cover the event. On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced the White House would determine which media outlets would cover the president in smaller spaces such as the Oval Office. The White House Correspondents' Association has traditionally coordinated the rotation of the presidential press pool. Reuters, an international wire service, has participated in the pool for decades. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that while traditional media organizations would still be permitted to cover Trump on a day-to-day basis, the administration plans to change who participates in smaller spaces. The pool system, administered by the WHCA, allowed select television, radio, wire, print and photojournalists to cover events and share their reporting with the broader media.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjackepcjg	2025-02-26T10:49:00-08:00	
Sagui Dekel-Chen's wife shares first photos together at home	Avital Dekel-Chen posts pictures on her Instagram account following her husband's recent release from Hamas captivity; 'we're home, starting fresh' Avital Dekel-Chen, wife of Sagui Dekel-Chen who was freed from Hamas captivity in the hostage deal, shared their first photos together at home on Tuesday, writing: 'We're home, starting fresh.' Sharing a photo of a sunset, she added, 'I watched these sunsets for over a year — if you look far enough, you see Gaza. That’s how I communicated with Sagui all this time. I would stand on the balcony, look far and send him strength. Today, I stand here again, still seeing Gaza — but this time, Sagui is beside me.' Two days before his release, Sagui learned that Avital and their daughters had survived Hamas' attack on October 7 for the first time. 'You're my hero,' Avital told him during their first hug. Sagui responded: 'You're heroes, you kept me going.' Avital asked: 'Do you remember what you called her?' referring to their third daughter, born after his abduction. 'Mazal,' Sagui said. 'That's her name,' Avital confirmed. 'Mazal?' he asked in surprise. 'Her name is Shahar Mazal,' Avital said. 'Perfect, what a name,' Sagui responded. His aunt, Gilat Fish, told Ynet that Sagui learned to play chess to pass the time and delivered messages from hostages still held in Gaza while in captivity. 'He knew nothing about the situation in Israel, his family or what was happening, whether he was underground or above ground,' she said. Like other hostages, he also learned Arabic during his time in captivity. Sagui, who was released on February 15, spoke by phone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week for over 10 minutes. He told Netanyahu that only the release of all hostages would bring a true victory. The conversation was described as positive, with Netanyahu saying he was committed to bringing everyone home. Sagui urged him to set politics aside and act solely on professional considerations, saying he had believed this was how Israel was operating throughout his captivity. He also told Netanyahu he understood the prime minister had yet to visit Kibbutz Nir Oz, where a quarter of the residents were killed or kidnapped in the October 7 attack. He invited Netanyahu to tour the kibbutz with him to see the devastation firsthand.

Three generations of Shiri Bibas' family were murdered	On October 7, Hamas terrorists set fire to the home of Shiri Bibas' parents, the Silbermans; initially declared missing, their remains were discovered three weeks later, confirming they were murdered inside their house; 'Watch over us, my five angels,' pleaded Shiri’s sister, Dana Silberman-Seaton, the family's sole survivor Shiri Bibas' sister, Dana Silberman-Seaton, the sole surviving member of the immediate Silberman family, delivered a heartbreaking eulogy during the funeral of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, recalling life with her younger sister. The Silberman-Bibas family has endured a tragedy spanning three generations. Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir — who were returned alongside the body of fellow hostage Oded Lifshitz, buried the day before — were not the only victims. On October 7, Hamas also murdered Shiri’s parents, Margit and Yossi Silberman, in their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Yossi Silberman was born in Argentina in 1956 and was one of the founders of Kibbutz Kramim near Dimona, where he met his wife, Margit, who was originally from Peru. The couple later moved to Nir Oz, where they raised their two daughters, Dana and Shiri. While Dana relocated to her husband’s moshav, just a 15-minute drive away, Shiri remained in the kibbutz. Yossi worked in agriculture and later as a mechanic in the kibbutz’s garage. He had a passion for painting and spent years teaching art. Margit, a beloved educator, was considered one of the kibbutz’s most cherished kindergarten teachers, helping to raise generations of children. On October 7, Hamas terrorists set fire to the Silbermans’ home. Initially declared missing, their remains were discovered three weeks later, confirming they had been murdered inside their house. Margit was 63; Yossi was 67. Dana Silberman-Seaton, who lost both her parents and later her sister’s entire family, had hosted them at her home in Moshav Yesha the night before the massacre. The following morning, as Hamas launched its assault, Dana and her own family barricaded themselves in a safe room while fierce battles raged outside. At Wednesday’s funeral, Dana eulogized her sister and nephew, recalling the childhood nickname she gave Shiri — 'Baz' (Hebrew for 'falcon'). Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Shiri and I grew up in a home filled with love, compassion and understanding. Our parents raised us to be strong women, to love others and to respect those who are different from us,' Dana said. 'As kids, I was the annoying older sister, and Shiri was always the sweet, innocent one. When we picked up our kids from daycare, we would always go straight to our parents’ house. The moment we walked through the door, our parents would rush to hug and kiss their grandchildren. Shiri and I would just look at each other and say, ‘I guess we’re not really needed here.’ That was the kind of love they had for their grandkids — an incredible, special kind of love.' Addressing her lost family, Dana added: 'Please, watch over us from above — you, my five angels who belong only to me. Baz, hug Mom and Dad tight for me and take care of them. Please send us strength to wipe out the evil in this world so that only good remains.' 'I promise you, as I promised Mom and Dad, that the monsters beyond the fence will not succeed. They will not break us. They will not defeat us. In fact, they have already failed — because we have united, because we have grown stronger, because we are unbreakable. They have lost. 'I hope that, wherever you are, you are together, wrapped in Mom's and Dad’s embrace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bynp002351g	2025-02-26T09:03:54-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/r1Vbmu3qJg/r1Vbmu3qJg_48_37_456_257_0_small.jpg
Partisan gap in Americans' opinions of Israel reaches record high	US partisan views of Israel reach a record 50-point gap, with Republicans overwhelmingly favorable and Democrats' ratings plummeting, according to a new Gallup poll; Opinions of the Palestinian territories also show significant shifts The partisan divide in Americans' views of Israel has reached an all-time high, with 83% of Republicans holding a favorable opinion, compared to just 33% of Democrats. Among independents, 48% view Israel positively. Overall, 54% of Americans rate Israel favorably, a significant drop from previous years, according to a new Gallup poll released on Wednesday. The 50-point gap between Republicans and Democrats on Israel shatters the previous record of 30 points set last year, reflecting a sharp 14-point decline in Democrats' favorable views. This widening divide is nearly three times larger than the 18-point average difference between the two parties from 2001 to 2023. Democrats' increasingly negative opinion of Israel is largely attributed to their opposition to the country’s actions during the Israel-Hamas war. The shift also coincides with former President Donald Trump’s strong support of Israel, including a recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In addition to Israel, there are sharp partisan divides in opinions of other countries. Republicans view Russia and Saudi Arabia more positively than Democrats, while Democrats rate Panama, France, India and Germany more favorably. The opinions of political independents on Israel have also deteriorated since the war began in 2023. This year marks the first time that any political group has had a majority unfavorable view of Israel, with 60% of Democrats and 44% of independents expressing negative opinions. As a result, Israel’s favorability rating among Americans has dropped to 54%, its lowest point since January 2000. The last time the country received worse ratings was in February 1992, when just 48% of Americans viewed Israel positively. The all-time low was 45% favorable in 1989. Meanwhile, the favorable rating for the Palestinian Territories has increased to 32%, significantly higher than the 18% registered last year for the 'Palestinian Authority.' While it remains unclear if the increase is due to more positive views of the Palestinian people, perhaps as a result of the cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war or the loss of thousands of Palestinian lives in the conflict, or if it is simply due to a change in the wording of the question, it represents a shift in public opinion. This rating is nominally higher than any previous rating for the 'Palestinian Authority,' although not significantly different from the 30% measured in 2021. All party groups rate the Palestinian Territories more positively than they did the Palestinian Authority last year, with increases ranging from 13% to 19%. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjfpzt29jx	2025-02-26T08:49:11-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/08/H1HwCk7JJl/H1HwCk7JJl_0_0_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Murdered at age 4: Teddy bears, and a drawing from a friend place...	Yoav bid farewell to his best friend from Kibbutz Nir Oz, Ariel Bibas, writing in a drawing placed on Ariel’s grave 'I am sad'; His mother recently shared the questions her son has asked since Ariel was kidnapped — and described the moment she had to explain to him that his friend would not be coming back Ariel Bibas, the 4-year-old who was murdered in Hamas captivity, had a close friend in Kibbutz Nir Oz named Yoav Avital. Since Ariel was kidnapped at the age of 3, Yoav never stopped believing in and waiting for his friend’s return. On Wednesday, a simple drawing was placed on Ariel’s grave alongside teddy bears and flowers. In it, little Yoav wrote: 'Died at age 4' and 'I am sad.' Ariel was buried alongside his mother, Shiri, and his infant brother, Kfir, who were murdered in captivity by the terrorists holding them. Yoav’s mother, Yamit, recently shared how her son experienced the tragedy of his friend’s abduction and murder. 'I want to tell you a bit about the thoughts and questions from my children's perspective,' she wrote. 'Ariel Bibas was my youngest son Yoav’s friend. They grew up together from infancy. When the first hostage deal was announced, with each group of released captives, he kept asking about Ariel and Kfir —when would it be their turn to come back? 'From time to time, Yoav would ask me if I knew what was happening with Ariel and Kfir, telling me how much he missed them and worried about them. He even asked to write a letter for Ariel and give it to his kindergarten teacher, Mali, so she could pass it on when he returned. He told me what to write: 'Ariel, I want to draw you Batman and all the flying heroes so you’ll feel like flying over Gaza. And fight the bad guys with a bow and arrow. Then you’ll come back to us and be with us in kindergarten. I hope you buy yourself sweets and a cape. I miss you.’ 'A few weeks later, realizing Ariel still hadn’t returned, Yoav asked to send a message on the radio, hoping Ariel would hear it and find strength to come home. Every so often, he asked if Ariel and Kfir had a kindergarten in Gaza if they were allowed to play in the sand and run outside like they did in the kibbutz. 'Last Purim, Yoav wanted to keep his Batman costume for Ariel, ‘because he’ll be back any day now.’ And when he didn’t return, Yoav decided to wear it himself — to fly off and rescue him. 'In the past six weeks, we explained the hostage deal and its details to our children. When Yoav heard the news, he jumped with joy — Ariel would be home soon. Unfortunately, we also had to tell them that some of those returning would not be alive. That was Yoav’s biggest fear. He immediately asked, ‘So Ariel is dead? He’s not coming back?’ I told him we didn’t know yet. That same day, he began to say goodbye in his own way. Through tears, he said, ‘My heart hurts. It feels heavy. I can’t stop thinking about him.’ 'But we still had hope, and we waited like everyone else. 'Every Saturday, my children asked if Ariel was coming home this time. But each time, only older hostages returned. Then came the questions: ‘Where are Ariel, Kfir and Shiri? They’re the smallest ones — why aren’t they being released first? Shiri is a woman — shouldn’t she be freed before the men?’ Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Yoav said, ‘Maybe they love Ariel so much there because he’s funny and mischievous, and that’s why the terrorists don’t want to let him go.’ 'Last Tuesday, when the list of hostages returning alive was published, we understood we had to prepare our children. When the final news arrived, the questions came, innocent children’s questions: '‘What? Why? How did he die? How could they do that? Why would they kill them? But they didn’t do anything to them. He was only 5, younger than me, and Kfir was just a baby…’ 'And then came their thoughts: ‘If he’s coming back in a coffin, that means he’s standing inside it. So that means he’s still alive.’ '‘But how does he fit in a coffin lying down? He’s still alive, Mom, you didn’t understand it right.’ '‘If Ariel is a fallen hero, that means he’s flying in space. He can’t be dead.’ 'And then the suggestions: ‘But in Israel, there are really smart people, right, Mom? Maybe they can invent a special potion with ingredients that can bring Ariel and Kfir back to life. It will have a bit of Batman’s two knives, fire, speed and a cape so he can fly fast to Gaza. There, the knives will cut open the bottle quickly, the potion will spill on him, and he’ll be able to come back. Simple.’' Yamit continued: 'Sadly, I had to explain that the dead cannot come back to life. And he answered me, ‘But I miss him. Can I see him just one more time?’ With tear-filled eyes, all I could tell him was that he could see Ariel in his dreams — hug him tight, play superheroes, splash together in the pool, explore bugs and plants, tell him how he’s doing, and hear how Ariel is doing too.' 'Shiri, my dear, I want to believe that just as you wrapped your arms around Ariel and Kfir during the abduction, you held them close until the very last moment. You will always remain in my memory as a lioness of a mother. 'Your story was meant to end differently. We all wished for a happy ending. But now that we have certainty, knowing you are no longer suffering and that you are home, on Israeli soil, we ask you to rest in peace — the peace you so deserve. We will stay with our longing. And from that longing, we will grow again.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r111u112hcyx	2025-02-26T08:18:42-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/r1KZKYh5ke/r1KZKYh5ke_223_0_1051_591_0_small.jpg
Kfar Aza calls IDF investigation findings into October 7 'shaking...	The Kfar Aza community said after the presentation of the IDF investigation into the October 7 massacre that it was 'shaking and difficult. For long hours, community members cried out for help and fought almost alone, and even when the brave soldiers entered to fight, it was without control and without command.' They added that 'the investigation is comprehensive and in-depth, but there is really no answer to the essential question of where the IDF was.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxyoahckl	2025-02-26T08:11:10-08:00

This is according to a new survey by the Gallup Institute, which annually examines the attitudes of the American public toward various countries around the world. The decline in support is mainly attributed to the growing criticism among Democrats and independents following the war in the Gaza Strip, and for the first time a majority of voters from one party hold a negative position towards Israel: 60% of Democrats expressed an unsympathetic opinion toward the country.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwza3h9ye	2025-02-26T07:11:28-08:00

Bodies of 4 hostages to be returned tonight as hundreds of Palest...	The final release for Phase I: The 4 remaining hostages set to be returned in Phase I of the cease-fire deal will be brought to Israel late on Wednesday night; Hamas has provided the names and Israeli officials are informing the families; Khan Younis is preparing to receive hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, whose release has been delayed by several days The four remaining hostages set to be returned in Phase 1 of the cease-fire and hostage-return deal will arrive in Israel late on Wednesday night in the final round of the current phase; the release of the bodies is scheduled for 11:00 p.m. At the same time, the Palestinian prisoners whose release has been delayed since Saturday will be handed over. Hamas published the names of the four hostages, but all of the names have not yet been made public in Israel. So far the family of Tzachi Idan, who was kidnapped alive, has announced that his body will be returned on Wednesday night. Israel confirmed Wednesday afternoon what was first reported by the Qatari Al Jazeera network regarding the release of the four hostages and the handover of the prisoners. An Israeli official later confirmed the report. Earlier, a police source told Ynet that preparations are also being made in Israel to return the hostages' bodies. The Hamas Prisoners' Office said that 'preparations are beginning at the European Hospital in Khan Younis to receive the prisoners released as part of the seventh round of the exchange deal, as they are expected to arrive between 10:00 p.m. and midnight.' This is how it will work The release of the dead hostages is supposed to be taken care of without a handover ceremony, with Egyptian involvement and mediation. According to the agreement, Hamas was to hand over to Israel a list of the names of the four dead hostages that will be returned - something it has already done. After that, the coffins will be delivered to Egypt via the Red Cross. At the same time and in a phased manner, Israel will release terrorists according to a specific outline that has been agreed upon. The outline will be carried out with Egyptian involvement and Egyptian supervision that will ensure that Israel receives the dead and releases the terrorists according to the progress of the process. Israel made it clear earlier that, until there is a final identification of the bodies, the last group of terrorists will not be released. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We will not release all the terrorists until we have a final identification and our people are handed over to us,' said a senior Israeli official. Once Israel verifies that the hostages are in Egyptian hands, a gradual process of releasing the terrorists will begin. The release will be done in several stages that could last a few hours in total. Initially, a specific group of terrorists will be released, then Israel will drive additional terrorists south toward the Kerem Shalom crossing. In the meantime, Israel will verify that the bodies are actually those of the kidnapped Israeli hostages. 'At any given moment, Israel has terrorists in its hands until they are finally identified,' a senior Israeli official emphasized. Violations from day one Negotiations for the next phase of the deal have been taking place all week in the U.S. between President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and the head of the negotiating team, government minister Ron Dermer. Internal discussions and processes have taken place within Israel. Israel plans to send a delegation as soon as the current phase is completed. At the moment it is not clear whether the delegation will arrive in Doha or Cairo, but as soon as the bodies are transferred Israel will be ready to send a team. Senior Israeli officials emphasized that, over the past month, Israel has warned the mediators not to turn a blind eye to Hamas' violations. During talks in Doha, and later in Cairo, Israel made it clear that it views Hamas' violations as serious. These violations include Hamas' decision to disrupt the implementation of the agreement when a cabinet discussion on Phase II began and the decision not to hold the previous meeting. In talks in Cairo, Israel made it clear that the debasing and humiliating handover ceremonies are unacceptable, both in terms of the danger to the hostages as in the case with with Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, and also in the manner in which the degrading ceremonies are performed. Israel specifically warned against such degrading ceremonies with the dead hostages. And although the message was conveyed and received, Hamas held shocking ceremony with the offins of the Bibas family and Oded Lipshitz, and in addition they transferred a Gazan body to Israel, instead of that of Shiri Bibas. Israel was also outraged by Hamas' shocking act last Saturday of bringing Guy Gilboa Dalal and Aviatar David to the release ceremony of Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert and Eliya Cohen. 'We warned against this and we will not tolerate this as the next attack,' said an Israeli official. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkzkbhncyl	2025-02-26T06:54:35-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/SkJxGIfcEq1g/SkJxGIfcEq1g_0_116_1280_720_0_small.jpg

MK Rothman: Sovereignty over Judea and Samaria ‘depends on us’	MK Simcha Rothman: ‘We have to make this loud and clear that we want sovereignty’ Israel is closer than ever to enacting sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, but 'it depends on us, here in Israel,' according to MK Simcha Rothman. Speaking to ILTV News on the sidelines of the B'Sheva Jerusalem Conference on Monday, Rothman said he believes former U.S. President Donald Trump would support sovereignty. However, he emphasized that the most Trump and his administration would do is to say, 'you do whatever you want.' 'We have to make this loud and clear that we want sovereignty, that we are working towards sovereignty, and we are willing to do what it takes,' Rothman said. Watch: Could Israel Permanently Seize Gazan Land? Exclusive interview with Minister Bezalel Smotrich He dismissed concerns that annexing the biblical heartland would trigger World War III or lead to significant sanctions against Israel. As precedent, he pointed to past fears that an international backlash would follow the U.S. Embassy’s move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem—yet no such crisis occurred. He also cited the U.S. recognition of the Golan Heights and the fact that Jews now pray openly on the Temple Mount, despite it contradicting the status quo. 'I think the world today understands who we are dealing with,' Rothman said. 'People understand that Israel is fighting the good fight, and they want to join us.'

Mother who fatally stabbed son declared psychotic, faces psychiat...	Prosecutors request acquittal of Sigal Itskovitch for murder of her 6-year-old son Liam after psychiatric evaluations determined she was experiencing a psychotic episode at the time; may face 25-year psychiatric commitment Prosecutors on Wednesday requested that the Tel Aviv District Court acquit Sigal Itskovitch, 33, of murdering her 6-year-old son Liam, citing psychiatric evaluations that determined she was in the midst of a psychotic episode at the time of the crime. Instead of a prison sentence, the prosecution asked the court to commit Itskovitch to a psychiatric hospital for 25 years. The court is expected to announce its decision on Sunday. During the hearing, Itskovitch admitted to the facts in the indictment, describing her erratic behavior on the day of the killing. 'I changed clothes, went out with an ax toward the mall, chased a passerby, struck a Mercedes car hood with the ax, confronted a guard, stripped and performed obscene gestures,' she said. The judge questioned why authorities had not intervened earlier, noting a 2019 incident when Itskovitch climbed onto a roof with Liam, then a baby, and asked if the murder could have been prevented. The prosecutor did not provide an answer. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The murder took place in July of last year, when Liam’s body was found in the family’s Herzliya home, along with the family dog, Buffy, who was also killed. According to the indictment, 'Liam suffered at least 15 slash wounds to his body, arms and face as a result of his mother's stabbings.' The indictment further detailed that Itskovitch repeatedly stabbed her son with an 8-inch kitchen knife 'until the knife broke.' After stabbing her son in the bathroom, she moved to the living room, where the injured family dog was howling in pain from earlier stabbings. Fearing the neighbors might hear the howls, she stabbed the dog dozens of additional times. She then walked toward a nearby mall, frightening passersby and attempting to attack a security guard before being arrested. The boy’s grandmother later discovered the crime scene. During her interrogation, Itskovitch confessed to the horrific acts and expressed remorse. When asked why she killed her son, she said: 'I don’t know what happened to me. Maybe a demon possessed me. I was in a frenzy; everything went black before my eyes, and a voice told me to do it. I stabbed them quickly—my son and the dog—grabbed the ax, and left the house without knowing what I was doing. I ran into the street, completely confused, until they stopped me.' Throughout the legal proceedings, defense attorneys argued that Itskovitch was in a severely disturbed mental state, but the prosecution initially pursued a harsh sentence. The case shifted when psychiatric evaluations confirmed her diminished responsibility. Itskovitch claimed she had experienced hallucinations, including conversations with aliens and beliefs of being abducted by a spaceship. Legal experts say the court’s ruling could set a precedent for cases involving claims of mental incapacity. Liam’s father, Doron Hess, who was not home at the time, described the moment he realized what had happened, recalling how he collapsed upon seeing a search and rescue vehicle. He pointed at the vehicle and asked a police officer, 'Is it Sigal?' The officer replied, 'No,' prompting Hess to realize the truth and collapse to the ground. 'There was a pickup truck on the path,' Hess said. 'They sat me in the trunk, and an investigator took my statement on the spot. They also took my cell phone. They told me I didn't have to hand it over, but I did. To this day, they still have it, along with the computer, smartwatch and passport. That’s the procedure.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syjvdd35yx	2025-02-26T06:07:18-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/SybbUMUn91x/SybbUMUn91x_0_246_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Freed terrorist faces charges for traffic offenses during release...	Police charges freed Hamas terrorist Ashraf Zghair and two relatives for reckless driving during his release celebration in Kafr Aqab Israel Police on Wednesday filed charges against Hamas terrorist Ashraf Zghair, 46, and two of his relatives. The three are accused of recklessness, failing to wear seat belts and partially hanging out of a moving vehicle while celebrating Zghair’s release in Kafr Aqab, north of Jerusalem. The indictment was filed as Israel mourned hostages murdered in Hamas captivity, including Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas. According to the charges, Zghair was released from prison on January 25 as part of the hostage deal's second handover. He had been imprisoned since 2002, serving six life sentences for transporting the terrorist who carried out a bus bombing in Tel Aviv, which killed six people and wounded 84. Following his release, a reception was held for Zghair in Kafr Aqab, attended by locals and family members. The celebration included Hamas flag-waving, live gunfire, slowed traffic and cheers for the freed terrorist.

'By doing so, they posed a real danger to their own safety and lives, in clear violation of the law, while recklessly waving to the crowd gathered on the road,' the police said in a statement. Days later, security forces arrested 12 suspects involved in the incident. A search uncovered Hamas flags, banners, fireworks, an airsoft gun, a large sum of money and other items. After concluding the investigation and gathering sufficient evidence, prosecutors filed the indictment Monday morning at the Jerusalem Traffic Court. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry8snq3ckg	2025-02-26T05:49:50-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/SJqtbD2qyg/SJqtbD2qyg_245_90_462_261_0_small.jpg

Shalom Avitan, 39, was arrested last March at a hotel in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and later charged with unauthorized trafficking and possession of firearms, while a married Malaysian couple was charged with supplying him the weapons. Authorities said Avitan claimed to be in Malaysia to hunt down another Israeli citizen over a family dispute.

Avitan arrived from the United Arab Emirates on March 12 last year traveling on a French passport, officials said. He was detained by police at a Kuala Lumpur hotel with the bag of weapons on March 27 and produced an Israeli passport when questioned, they added. On Wednesday, the Kuala Lumpur sessions court accepted Avitan's guilty plea and ordered his seven-year sentence to run from the date of his arrest on March 28 last year, his lawyer, Naran Singh, told Reuters. Avitan will serve his sentence in the Kajang prison on the outskirts of the capital, the lawyer added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjrw7ch5yl	2025-02-26T05:14:28-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/HkTXmD3qyg/HkTXmD3qyg_0_22_700_395_0_small.jpg
Iran’s weakness won’t last—should Israel act now?	British-Israeli analyst and writer Jonathan Spyer: 'Israel is leaning toward decisive action to try to bring down the regime in the Islamic Republic of Iran' Iran and its proxies have taken serious blows, but 'their weakness is a perishable asset,' according to British-Israeli analyst and writer Jonathan Spyer. In an interview on the ILTV News Podcast, Spyer said Israel has not managed to eliminate any of the threats surrounding it—Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, or Iran itself. 'Every day that passes, they’re going to be getting stronger,' he warned. Spyer explained that Israel’s current military strategy is not unlike previous approaches, often referred to as 'mowing the lawn.' The idea is to weaken the enemy, watch it regain strength, and then strike again. However, he believes there is growing recognition that this cycle cannot continue. Israel, he said, may soon need to strike at the source—Iran—to put an end to regional terrorism. 'Israel is leaning toward decisive action to try to bring down the regime in the Islamic Republic of Iran, in the belief that, and I think it's an accurate belief that, at the end of the day, it is Iranian strength and Iranian assistance which enables these other fronts to maintain themselves,' Spyer said. He added that Israel sees a 'window of opportunity' for a decisive strike on Iran’s nuclear capabilities in the coming year. If Israel does not act, that window could close as Iran strengthens its defenses, likely with advanced air defense systems from Russia. Meanwhile, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other Iranian-backed forces will have time to replenish and fortify. 'There’s a moment now where, if Israel is bold, it can try to fundamentally change the equation,' he said. Watch these previous ILTV News Podcasts: The Secret Behind Israel’s Dominance in AI Innovation William Daroff: If 40% of Gazans Want Out, Why Not Let Them Leave? Why the world can’t ignore Iran’s nuclear ambitions any longer The Hamas War: A Shifting Strategy Spyer noted that Israel entered the war in Gaza with two clear goals: to return the hostages and to destroy Hamas militarily and politically. However, he argued that Israel has not pursued both objectives with the same intensity. 'Israel has been trying to fight Hamas militarily, but it has not, in fact, been trying to replace Hamas politically,' he said. 'And the reason for that, I think, is because none of the potential goals, which are the ones I outlined earlier, are really acceptable to various parts of either Israel itself or its allies.' As a result, Israel has opted for a wait-and-see approach. 'The response of the government of Israel has been to kind of kick the can down the road,' Spyer added. He acknowledged that Israel has demonstrated impressive military capabilities, such as the recent 'beeper attack' against Hezbollah. However, its inability to establish an alternative to Hamas in Gaza presents a major challenge. Spyer also pointed to a fundamental intelligence failure regarding Hamas before October 7. While Israel had prepared for threats from Hezbollah and other enemies, it severely underestimated Hamas’s capabilities. 'Israel was blind, willfully blind, prior to October 7 as a result of a massive intelligence failure on the strategic level,' he said, 'which then, of course, leads down, as such things do, to additional failures and weaknesses on the tactical level.' A Crossroads in the War Now, Israel faces a critical decision. Negotiations are underway for a second phase of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff has said could go through. However, the deal would require Israel to withdraw further from Gaza—while Hamas remains in control. Spyer is skeptical about the deal’s prospects, saying there is a 'very large question mark' over whether it will progress as Witkoff expects. 'Throughout the war, the government of Israel has had two contradictory aims, one of which is to ensure the release of all the hostages, and the second is the destruction of the Hamas authority, of Hamas political and military power in Gaza,' Spyer explained. 'These two goals are, of course, contradictory, because it's not, in fact, possible to negotiate with anybody and at the same time seek to destroy them. It just doesn't work in real life.' He believes the contradiction is coming to a head now, as phase two of negotiations demands Israeli concessions. 'I think that the government of Israel and Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu are reluctant to reach that point,' Spyer said. 'Maybe they would like to keep kicking the can down the road, or maybe they want to get down to pursuing the war regardless of the remaining presence of 25 hostages. It’s not clear.' His own stance? End the negotiations and finish the war. 'Israel's enemies have got used to Israel [negotiating], and we know that that can have very tragic results,' Spyer concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfugck5jg	2025-02-26T04:33:37-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/ByUeu5nc1l/ByUeu5nc1l_0_83_801_451_0_small.jpg

I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you': Yarden Bibas delivers heartbr...	Released hostage mourns wife Shiri and sons Ariel and Kfir, murdered in Gaza captivity, in emotional ceremony: 'Watch over me so I don’t sink into darkness' Yarden Bibas, whose wife Shiri and young sons Ariel and Kfir were murdered in Hamas captivity, delivered an emotional eulogy Wednesday, speaking of his profound grief and the shattered dreams of his family. Read the full eulogy below: 'Mi amor, I remember the first time I called you Mi Amor. It was early in our relationship, and you told me to call you that only if I was absolutely sure I loved you—not to say it lightly. So, I didn’t say it right away because I didn’t want you to think I was rushing to say I love you. But Shiri, I’ll tell you now—I already loved you then when I first said Mi Amor. Shiri, I love you, and I will always love you! Shiri, you are everything to me! You are the best wife and mother, Shiri, you are my best friend. Mishmish, who will help me make decisions now? How am I supposed to make decisions without you? Do you remember our last decision? In the shelter, I asked you, Do we fight or surrender? You said, We fight, so I fought. Shiri, I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you. If only I had known what was going to happen, I wouldn’t have fired a shot. I think about everything we shared, and there are so many good memories. I remember the births of Ariel and Kfir. I remember the days we would sit at home or in a café, just the two of us, talking about everything. It was so much fun—I miss that, and I miss you so much. Your presence is deeply missed. I want to tell you about everything happening in the world and here in Israel. Shiri, everyone knows us and loves us—you wouldn’t believe how surreal this madness is. Shiri, people tell me they will always be by my side, but they are not you. So please, stay close to me and don’t go far. Shiri, this is the closest I’ve been to you since October 7, and I can’t kiss or hug you—that breaks me. Shiri, please watch over me… Protect me from bad decisions. Protect me from harm. Protect me from myself. Protect me so I don’t sink into darkness. Mishmish, I love you! Chuki, You made me a father. You made us a family. You taught me what really matters in life and what responsibility means. The day you were born, I grew up in an instant because of you. You taught me so much about myself, and I want to say thank you. So, thank you, my love. Ariel, I hope you are not angry at me for not being able to protect you properly, for not being there for you. I hope you know that I thought about you every single day, every single minute. I hope you are enjoying yourself in heaven. I’m sure you’re making all the angels laugh with your jokes and impressions. I hope there are lots of butterflies for you to watch, just like you did on our picnics. Chuki, be careful when you come down from your cloud—don’t step on Tony… Teach Kfir all your impressions, and make everyone laugh up there. Ariel, I love you the most in the world, always in the world—just like you used to say to us. Pupik, I never thought our family could be any more perfect—and then you came along and made it even more perfect. I remember your birth. I remember that in the middle of labor, the midwife suddenly stopped, and we panicked—we were afraid something was wrong. But it was just so she could tell us that we had another redhead. Mom and I laughed and cheered. You brought even more light and happiness into our little home. You came with your sweet, infectious laughter, and I was hooked instantly! It was impossible not to snuggle you all the time. Kfir, I’m sorry I didn’t protect you better, but I need you to know that I love you so much, and I miss you terribly! I miss holding you close and hearing your giggles. I miss our morning playtime when Mom would ask me to watch you before I left for work. I loved those little moments so much, and I miss them now more than ever. Kfir, I love you the most in the world, always in the world! I have so much more to tell you, but I will keep it for when we are alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk8iiuh5je	2025-02-26T02:26:44-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/rkxIl0035Je/rkxIl0035Je_0_0_552_314_0_small.jpg

'Luli [Ariel], how I miss you — your shyness, your playfulness, your sweetness, your smile. Kfir, I will never have a replacement for the time I didn’t get to have with you. We had no time at all. I didn’t even get to buy you a first birthday gift. 'There’s no meaning to apologies before the failures are investigated and those responsible are held accountable.

NY governor calls out CUNY for ‘divisive’ Palestinian Studies job...	Kathy Hochul orders removal of Hunter College job listing for Palestinian Studies professor, citing concerns that its language—referencing 'settler colonialism' and 'genocide'—promoted antisemitic theories; CUNY complies Following a wave of controversy, New York Governor Kathy Hochul has ordered the City University of New York (CUNY) to remove a job listing for a Palestinian Studies professorship at Hunter College, citing concerns that its content could promote antisemitic theories. The job posting, which was advertised on Hunter College’s website, sought a scholar specializing in topics such as 'settler colonialism, genocide, human rights, apartheid, migration, climate and infrastructure devastation.' Critics argued that the language echoed longstanding accusations against Israel and framed the Jewish state as a perpetrator of crimes against humanity, turning an academic position into a platform for anti-Israel advocacy. Hochul, responding to mounting pressure from Jewish organizations and pro-Israel groups, issued a statement instructing CUNY to immediately retract the posting and conduct a thorough review of the role. 'I have directed CUNY to remove the job listing and to ensure that no antisemitic theories are promoted in the classroom,' Hochul stated. The move comes amid ongoing scrutiny of CUNY’s handling of antisemitism on its campuses. An independent investigation commissioned by Hochul last year revealed a 'disturbing' rise in antisemitic incidents, including harassment of Jewish students, glorification of Hamas, and a lack of administrative intervention. The findings fueled existing concerns about the university system’s response to anti-Israel activism, particularly following Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Jewish watchdog groups and former CUNY officials were quick to condemn the job listing, characterizing it as a taxpayer-funded endorsement of anti-Israel rhetoric. Hunter College issued a statement attempting to defuse the controversy, asserting that the institution 'has zero tolerance for hate of any kind' and that its faculty are expected to engage in rigorous academic debate rather than promote any single ideology. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: CUNY later confirmed that the job listing had been removed from the website following the governor’s directive. 'We unequivocally agree with the governor’s decision,' a CUNY spokesperson said, adding that the wording of the posting was 'divisive, polarizing, and inappropriate.' However, critics remained unconvinced, pointing to what they see as a pattern of anti-Israel bias within CUNY’s faculty and student organizations. The controversy surrounding the job posting follows other high-profile incidents at CUNY that have drawn accusations of institutional antisemitism. Earlier this year, CUNY’s faculty union, the Professional Staff Congress, passed a resolution in support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel — a decision it later overturned following backlash. Similarly, past commencement ceremonies at CUNY Law School have featured speakers delivering inflammatory remarks against Israel and the United States, adding to the university’s growing reputation as a battleground for ideological disputes over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The broader implications of this controversy extend to state funding for CUNY. Hochul’s executive budget proposal includes $2.25 billion in operational funding for the university system, along with $1.8 billion allocated for capital improvements. The backlash over Hunter College’s hiring decision has sparked debate over whether taxpayer dollars should be used to fund what critics describe as 'state-sponsored antisemitism.' ' The Governor has continued to strongly condemn all forms of antisemitism and has made clear that hateful rhetoric of any kind has no place at CUNY or anywhere in New York State,' stated Hochul's office. CUNY, for now, has publicly aligned itself with Hochul’s directive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ynld3cyg	2025-02-26T01:31:22-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/05/22/B1TnYIwPc/B1TnYIwPc_27_0_2134_1201_0_small.jpg
