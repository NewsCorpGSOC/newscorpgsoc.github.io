At least 25 killed as Russian, Syrian jets intensify bombing of S...	The Syrian army and its ally Russia say they target the hideouts of insurgent groups and deny attacking civilians; army also says it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days At least 25 people were killed in northwestern Syria in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia, the Syrian opposition-run rescue service known as the White Helmets said early on Monday. Russian and Syrian jets struck the rebel-held city of Idlib in northern Syria on Sunday, military sources said, as President Bashar al-Assad vowed to crush insurgents who had swept into the city of Aleppo. The army also said it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days. Residents said one attack hit a crowded residential area in the center of Idlib, the largest city in a rebel enclave near the Turkish border where around four million people live in makeshift tents and dwellings. At least seven people were killed and dozens injured, according to rescuers at the scene. The Syrian army and its ally Russia say they target the hideouts of insurgent groups and deny attacking civilians. Ten children were among the dead in the air strikes in and around Idlib and other targets in rebel-held territory near Aleppo on Sunday, according the White Helmets. The total death toll from Syrian and Russian strikes since Nov. 27 had climbed to 56, including 20 children, the group added in a statement on X. The insurgents are a coalition of Turkey-backed mainstream secular armed groups along with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group that has been designated a terrorist outfit by the U.S., Russia, Turkey and other states. Russian war bloggers reported on Sunday that Moscow had dismissed Sergei Kisel, the general in charge of its forces in Syria, after insurgents swept into Aleppo. Reuters has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry. In a joint statement, the United States, France, Germany, and Britain urged 'de-escalation by all parties and the protection of civilians and infrastructure to prevent further displacement and disruption of humanitarian access'. Leaving Aleppo Inside Aleppo city, streets were mostly empty and many shops were closed on Sunday as scared residents stayed at home. There was still a heavy flow of civilians leaving the city, witnesses and residents said. Rebel fighters waving the opposition flag drove through the city, Yusuf Khatib, a resident, told Reuters by phone. Some rebels took up positions on street intersections, he added. Ahmad Tutenji, a merchant in the affluent New Aleppo neighborhood, said he was surprised how quickly the army left. 'I am shocked at how they fled and abandoned us.' Abdullah al Halabi, a pensioner whose neighborhood was bombed near the central area of Qasr al Baladi, said people were terrified they would see a repeat of the Russian-led bombing that killed thousands of people before driving out rebels a decade ago. Syrian troops who had withdrawn from the city were now regrouping and reinforcements were also being sent to help in the counter-attack, army sources said. Aleppo had been firmly held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war's major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country's largest city. Rebels said on Sunday they had pushed further south of Aleppo city and captured the town of Khansir in an attempt to cut the army's main supply route to Aleppo city. Rebel sources said they had also captured Sheikh Najjar estate, one of the country's major industrial zones. Reuters could not independently confirm the battlefield accounts. The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end. Most heavy fighting halted years ago after Iran-backed militias and Russian air power helped Assad win control of all major cities. A lack of that manpower contributed to the speedy retreat of Syrian army forces in recent days, according to two army sources.

Are Jews still making Aliyah despite the war?	Eilon Gilad: People 'want to take part in re-establishing Israel and making sure that we have a good place to be' Israel can expect an even stronger wave of Aliyah now that the war is winding down, according to Eilon Gilad, the CEO of Belong, the first-ever private company promoting immigration to Israel. Speaking to ILTV News on Sunday alongside new immigrant Jessica Scalisi, Gilad said the work of his organization has become 'urgent' due to this new wave. 'People want to be a part' of the State of Israel, he told ILTV. 'They want to take part in re-establishing Israel and making sure that we have a good place to be.' In September, the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration reported that nearly 30,000 made Aliyah since war broke out, mostly from Western countries. The data also showed that since the start of the war, there was a significant increase in people inquiring about moving to the country. Scalisi, who moved to the country five years ago, said she could not have anticipated the recent security escalation. Despite the war, she still feels 'Israel is the best place in the world to be.' She added that it is no coincidence Israel became the Start-Up Nation, attributing this to the 'can-do' attitude of its people, which enables everyone to find their mission and purpose both in the country and globally. 'We saw how every Aliyah wave during [the country’s] history just made Israel stronger and better,' Scalisi said. 'This diversity of people coming from around the world is really what's so unique and makes us so strong.'

Where were Douglas Murray and Kevin Spacey on Sunday?	Two superstars show solidarity with Israel's south during visit to Kfar Aza British author and political commentator Douglas Murray, celebrated for his steadfast defense of Israel and critiques of radical ideologies, has been visiting Israel since last week. Over the weekend, Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey also arrived in Israel. On Sunday, the duo toured sites impacted by the October 7 Hamas attacks, including Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Kfar Aza was one of the hardest hit communities in southern Israel. More than 70 Hamas operatives attacked the kibbutz, murdering dozens of people and taking 19 others hostage. Murray's visit highlights his unwavering dedication to combating antisemitism and championing democratic values.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjnld5qqkg	2024-12-01T17:16:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/rJgOKvq5Xyx/rJgOKvq5Xyx_0_166_1599_901_0_small.jpg

Behind the scenes of hostage negotiations: Cautious Israeli optim...	A proposed 60-day cease-fire is at the center of hostage negotiations, and while there is cautious optimism in Israel – bolstered by the Lebanon agreement and the upcoming U.S. leadership transition – Hamas remains resolute; 'If Hamas consents to symbolic exile, a deal could move forward. A diplomatic narrative will likely be crafted to justify ending the conflict' Israeli official says As reports surface of efforts to restart negotiations under U.S. pressure, cautious optimism is growing in Israel about a potential hostage deal. Four main factors are fueling this sentiment: The cease-fire model in Lebanon, which could influence Gaza; Hamas’ isolation and fears that the IDF will bolster its forces in Gaza after completing operations in Lebanon; Support from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for outgoing President Joe Biden’s initiative; and General war fatigue on all sides. In a shift from his previous statements, Trump has expressed a desire to see a hostage deal finalized before he returns to the White House on January 20. He has reportedly conveyed a message to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urging Israel to end the conflict before the U.S. administration transitions. The negotiations are being spearheaded by the United States, with mediation from Qatar and Egypt. Despite Qatar’s earlier announcement of suspending its involvement, it remains a key player. The current proposal includes a 60-day cease-fire, with a limited Israeli presence in the Philadelphi Corridor. A source familiar with the negotiations noted that the challenge lies more with Israel than Hamas. A senior Israeli official suggested that a symbolic exile of some Hamas leaders from Gaza could enable progress. However, the official warned that Netanyahu would not allow a scenario that visually portrays Hamas regaining control of Gaza. Another Israeli official, privy to the discussions, said the deal would likely involve a 'diplomatic spin' to justify halting the war. The source added that Hamas is unlikely to compromise unless it secures guarantees for post-war reconstruction. 'This is a dynamic time. There’s potential for expanded possibilities, and we are evaluating the situation and acting accordingly,' the official said. Meanwhile, Netanyahu convened a meeting of senior ministers and negotiation team leaders to assess progress, raising speculation about developments behind the scenes. However, it is still too early to determine whether these efforts will culminate in a deal. Hamas and Israeli leaders weigh in Despite Israel's cautious optimism, Hamas leaders remain firm in their demands: A cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza, guarantees for reconstruction, and an influx of humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, Fatah officials involved in talks with Hamas and Islamic Jihad about a post-conflict governance framework reported 'tentative progress' in Hamas’ willingness to establish a joint administration for Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed hope for an agreement. 'There are negotiations taking place behind the scenes, and it can be done. Now is the opportunity to bring about a meaningful change that will lead to a deal to free the hostages,' Herzog said during a meeting with the family of Edan Alexander, an American Israeli hostage whose spoke in a video released by Hamas on Saturday. 'Now is the time to bring meaningful change and achieve a hostage deal,' he said. 'We are negotiating with a bitter and cruel enemy whose sole purpose in releasing this video was to try to break our spirit. On the contrary – I believe this video has strengthened us.' Herzog reiterated his appeal to the international community: 'My call to the entire world, to Israel’s leadership, and to all mediators is this: the time is now. We want Edan home. We want everyone home urgently. We cry out for this every single day – now is the time to act.' Edan’s mother, Yael Alexander, shared her anguish and determination. 'This has been a sleepless night. Edan – his voice and the video replaying endlessly. You can see in the video that Edan is going through hell. His eyes are crying out, full of sorrow, but it gave me so much strength – Edan strengthened us with his call to us. 'We released this video so that everyone can see – Edan is alive, and many other hostages are alive. It’s time to act and free them,' she said. In New York, Edan’s father, Adi Alexander, gathered with hundreds of activists in New York's Central Park to call on current U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump to act and bring about a deal for the release of all 101 hostages still held in Gaza. 'Edan's words in the video haunt me: 'Every day here feels like eternity.' No father should hear their child plead for their life like that,' Adi Alexander told the crowd. 'Edan believes in the strength of the U.S., and so do I, but strength means nothing if it is not combined with action.' 'I stand here after seeing my son alive for the first time in over a year. It did give us a glimmer of hope, but it also reignited the urgency of our plea: Time is running out. President Biden, President-elect Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu - I call on you all to act.

Fragment from Yemeni missile falls in Jerusalem-area playground	A missile fragment launched from Yemen by the Houthis struck a playground in Tzur Hadassah, near Jerusalem; Residents say this is the fourth time there was a fall and no siren was activated, citing a similar incident in September when debris landed nearby Residents of Tzur Hadassah woke Sunday morning to the news that a fragment from a Houthi missile fired from Yemen had landed in a local playground. According to residents, this marks the fourth time the community near Jerusalem has experienced such incidents without a warning siren being activated. While some residents heard sirens from nearby Beit Shemesh, others only learned about the incident when the local council issued a statement. 'At 6:40 a.m., interception sounds were heard,' the council reported. 'A missile launched from Yemen was successfully intercepted without casualties or direct hits. Although the launch and interception occurred outside our area, a fragment fell in the Keshet playground. Damage to the fence and grass was minimal and is being addressed. Authorities, including Home Front Command representatives, are onsite, and updates will follow as needed.' David, a Tzur Hadassah resident, expressed frustration with the incident. 'This is the third or even fourth time fragments have fallen here without warning. We’ve seen them land in football fields, private gardens and on roads. We can’t rely on luck forever. While some nearby sirens can be heard faintly, the fact that no alarms go off in our community is unacceptable. I raised the issue with the council head this morning, but it’s unclear if it’s up to them or Home Front Command.' A similar event occurred on September 28, when large missile fragments landed on Route 375 near Tzur Hadassah and a nearby sports field after an interception, also without triggering sirens. 'Our luck will eventually run out,' one resident warned. In response to the recurring incidents, local council head Tomer Moskowitz met Sunday with Col. Yigal Dahan, the commander overseeing Tzur Hadassah for the Home Front Command, and his team. Moskowitz reiterated the need to expand the warning system to prevent unannounced missile fragments from falling in the area. Dahan assured that the issue is under review by senior officials in both the Home Front Command and the Air Force, expressing hope for a resolution soon.

Israeli intelligence agency casts a net for whalers	The operations of Black Cube, a private intelligence agency, often fly under the radar; However, it recently exposed a case of governmental corruption that may save the lives of whales; The revelation of suspected corruption between a former Icelandic minister and a businessman, aimed at renewing whale hunting permits, has caused a political uproar in Iceland and derailed the plan The private intelligence agency Black Cube, founded by Dan Zorella and Dr. Avi Yanus, is staffed by former members of Israel's intelligence services and Israel’s illustrious foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad. Its most recent operation has shaken Icelandic politics. The firm has exposed intelligence implicating Jón Gunnarsson, a former minister holding Iceland's transportation, justice, and interior portfolios. And this time, their spying could end up saving countless whales. Espionage meets conservation On November 11, Gunnarsson posted on Facebook a lengthy post detailing how a Swiss businessman expressed interest in buying Icelandic real estate and quickly established rapport with Gunnarson’s son, Gunnar Bergmann. After two months of interaction and negotiations, they met for dinner at a Reykjavik hotel. There, the Swiss businessman turned the conversation to Jón Gunnarsson’s alleged involvement in renewing whale hunting permits to Iceland’s sole whaling company for another five years. Unbeknownst to Gunnar, the Swiss businessman recorded the conversations, which were released to Icelandic media. The tapes revealed plans to grant an exclusive whale hunting license to the company Hvalur and its owner, Kristján Loftsson, a prominent Icelandic whaling magnate. According to media in Iceland, it appears that Black Cube orchestrated the interactions, leveraging Gunnár's connections, recording incriminating evidence, and obtaining audio-visual proof of corruption and collusion between business magnate Loftsson and the senior politician Gunnarsson. A battle over whaling licenses The controversy mirrors another in 2009, when Iceland’s government renewed whale hunting licenses during an economic crisis. Once again, a transitional government following a coalition collapse sought to reauthorize whaling, despite public opposition, potentially tying the hands of the next administration, which had planned to curb or fully ban the practice. Gunnarsson, a staunch supporter of whaling, was appointed to serve as a special advisor to the ministry responsible for issuing these licenses and advanced related legislative processes. While Gunnarsson has long advocated for whaling, he denies involvement in the scandal and insists he wields no influence over licensing decisions. The population of whales, which can live over 80 years, has been decimated by brutal hunting methods involving explosive harpoons. These techniques have led to prolonged suffering and ecological damage, reinforcing the urgent need to end whaling. Iceland is one of only three countries in the world that still permits the practice. Government shake-up Following Black Cube’s revelations, interim Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson removed Gunnarsson from any government position related to whale hunting licenses. However, critics note that Benediktsson, who as agriculture minister appointed Gunnarsson, shares ties with the whaling industry. In June 2023, Iceland’s Green Party-led coalition suspended whaling licenses. Gunnarsson and his party protested vehemently, citing significant economic losses for Hvalur and the Icelandic economy. The coalition collapse in October set elections for November 30, creating a political vacuum exploited by the whaling industry. The scandal has revealed intricate quid-pro-quo relationships between politicians and business interests, highlighting glaring conflicts of interest. Dismissing all accusations against him, Gunnarsson has decried media sensationalism, questioning the legality of the recordings and evidence. 'After 18 years in politics, you develop a thick skin for scandals,' he told an Icelandic newspaper. However, he expressed outrage over his children being dragged into the affair. Black Cube's strategy After its controversial role in disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein's legal defense, Black Cube restructured, establishing an advisory committee to vet cases. 'Clients are categorized as red (off-limits), green (acceptable), or yellow (economically viable but sensitive),' explains Giora Eiland, one of 5 to 6 advisors on the committee. The advisory board holds veto power over cases, ensuring ethical scrutiny. Black Cube 'takes a single pro-bono case annually, and though the Iceland case wasn't that, we were incentivized by its human-interest aspect,' said Giora Eiland, one of the five or six consultants who sit on the company's advisory committee and hold absolute veto rights over any deal. Months ago, Icelandic and international environmental groups approached the firm to investigate suspected political-business corruption. 'And then we did what we do as a company in all projects,' explains Eiland. 'An in-depth and thorough open source investigation online, human-centric research into friends, family members, colleagues and look for exposure. Once we find it, we awake one of our cover companies, and deploy an operative fluent in the objects’ language and eliciting the intelligence of the object. Here, we knew it was Gunnar, who has a lot of self confidence and a tendency to want to impress you.' Black Cube’s swift operation was extremely successful. Gunnar was quick to divulge his family's deep ties to whaling politics and business, the deal closed between his father and the businessman, and how his family will be one the main beneficiaries of this ordeal. The intelligence exploded in Icelandic media, halting all whale hunting license discussions. 'It's a good feeling,' Eiland reflects. 'It was a successful operation, and no one in Iceland will be talking about whale hunting licenses for a while.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymrqb5xyx	2024-12-01T12:22:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/yk14157864/yk14157864_0_42_1127_634_0_small.jpg
IDF forces Iranian plane suspected of carrying Hezbollah weapons ...	As part of enforcing the cease-fire agreement, the Israeli Air Force ordered an Iranian Mahan Air plane - suspected of carrying weapons for Hezbollah and destined for Syria - to turn around as fighter jets circled nearby, and the plane complied, returning east The IDF ordered an Iranian plane suspected of carrying weapons for Hezbollah and scheduled to land in Syria, to turn around and head eastward, according to a report on Sunday. The Israeli Air Force led the operation against the Iranian plane, with the key difference being the location – Syria, not Lebanon. Israeli fighter jets circled near the Iranian aircraft, in a threatening posture indicating they would shoot it down. A 'letter of assurances,' part of the cease-fire agreement with Lebanon, stated that 'the U.S. is committed to working with Israel to counter Iran's destabilizing activities in Lebanon, including preventing the transfer of weapons, proxies and other materials from Iranian territory.' Meanwhile, the IDF continued operating in Lebanon, citing 'actions that threatened Israel and violated the cease-fire agreement.' According to the IDF, paratroopers from the 98th Brigade identified armed terrorists near a church in southern Lebanon, which Hezbollah had used as a terrorist infrastructure. The soldiers fired and eliminated them. The slain terrorists were involved in ground defense, anti-tank and artillery operations in the region and had participated in fighting while using the church. After eliminating the terrorists, the IDF searched the area around the church and found a weapons cache in a pit.

Trump picks his in-law Massad Boulos to serve as adviser on Arab,...	Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman and Trump adviser, has deep ties in the Middle East and U.S. Arab communities; His new role may shape Trump's policy, drawing on connections across Lebanon's political spectrum and efforts to engage Arab American voters U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday said Lebanese American businessman Massad Boulos would serve as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Trump announced the appointment on Truth Social. Boulos, the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany, met repeatedly with Arab American and Muslim leaders during the election campaign. It is the second time in recent days that Trump chose the father-in-law of one of his children to serve in his administration. On Saturday, Trump said he had picked his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, real estate mogul Charles Kushner, to serve as U.S. ambassador to France. In recent months, Boulos campaigned for Trump to drum up Lebanese and Arab American support, even as the U.S.-backed Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon. It is the second time in recent days that Trump chose the father-in-law of one of his children to serve in his administration Boulos has powerful roots in both countries. His father and grandfather were both figures in Lebanese politics and his father-in-law was a key funder of the Free Patriotic Movement, a Christian party aligned with Hezbollah. His son Michael and Tiffany Trump were married in an elaborate ceremony at Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago Club in November 2022, after getting engaged in the White House Rose Garden during Trump's first term. Boulos has been in touch with interlocutors across Lebanon's multipolar political world, three sources who spoke to him in recent months say, a rare feat in Lebanon, where decades-old rivalries between factions run deep. Particularly notable is his ability to maintain relations with Hezbollah, they say. The Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim party has a large number of seats in Lebanon's parliament and ministers in the government. Boulos is a friend of Suleiman Frangieh, a Christian ally of Hezbollah and its candidate for Lebanon's presidency. He is also in touch with the Lebanese Forces Party, a vehemently anti-Hezbollah Christian faction, the sources say and has ties to independent lawmakers. Aron Lund, fellow at the Century Foundation think tank, said Boulos was well placed to influence Trump's Middle East policy after playing a small but significant role in expanding Trump's appeal to Arab American and Muslim voters during the campaign. 'Boulos' Lebanese political past gives no real indication of a geostrategic or even national vision, but it demonstrates ambition and a set of political allies that will stand out in Trump's circle like a sore thumb,' Lund wrote. Michigan win Boulos, a billionaire with extensive business ties in Nigeria, was born in Lebanon, but moved to Texas as a teenager, where he attended the University of Houston, earned a law degree, and became a U.S. citizen. His son and Trump's daughter, whose mother is Trump's second wife, Marla Maples, met on the Greek island of Mykonos, at actor Lindsay Lohan's club, People Magazine reported in 2022. Trump's election win in Michigan came in part because of Boulos' help flipping some of the 300,000 Arab Americans and Muslims in the state who overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020 but opposed Biden's policies in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon, Trump campaign officials and supporters told Reuters. 'Boulos played a big role in the outreach to Muslim voters,' said Rabiul Chowdhury, co-founder of Muslims for Trump. Beginning in September, the Trump campaign held weekly meetings in person and via Zoom with dozens of Arab American and Muslim civic leaders and business executives. Boulos spent weeks on the ground in Michigan, Pennsylvania, is, and other states with big Arab American and Muslim populations, assuring audiences in private lunches and dinners that tapped own connections to Lebanese American businessmen that Trump was committed to ending the wars in the Middle East. The Trump campaign spent tens of millions of dollars on the effort to mobilize Arab American and Muslim voters, Boulos told Reuters in an interview shortly after the election. Trump won endorsements from Muslim imams and the Muslim mayor of Hamtramck, another town near Detroit with a large Arab American population, as well as the large Bangladeshi community, and courted Iraqi Americans, Albanian Americans, and others. While the events on the ground in Lebanon played a factor, the economy did too. And conservative Arabs and Muslims were concerned about what they saw as the Democrats' far-left ideology,' including support of transgender rights, Boulos said. Boulos met with members of the 150,000-strong Albanian community in Michigan. Political ambitions? The new role could offer Boulos the kind of political clout he could not achieve in Lebanon. He had a brief run for Lebanon's parliament in 2018 alongside pro-Hezbollah candidates, but since then he has not consistently aligned himself with any particular party, sources in Lebanon said. He hails from a Greek Orthodox family. In Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, that would cap his chances at a senior role in government at the level of deputy speaker of parliament. The post of president - the highest Christian role in the country - is reserved for Maronite Catholics. While he used to travel to Lebanon frequently, one of the sources said he has not visited in the last four years. Some people in Lebanon were hopeful about the prospects of having a friendly face in Trump's inner circle even before the announcement on Sunday.

Right-wing families of hostages oppose Netanyahu: 'Waiting for a ...	Relatives of hostages from the Tikva (Hope) Forum, who had previously supported the government's stance, are now voicing dissatisfaction; 'The offensive military operations at the start of the war have dwindled to almost nothing' they say Families of hostages represented by the Tikva (Hope) Forum have expressed mounting frustration and disappointment over the lack of progress in efforts to secure their loved ones' release, according to a report on Sunday. 'Three months have passed since we repeatedly appealed to the prime minister, yet our calls have gone unanswered. Three months of deafening silence,' they said. At a forum meeting, the families voiced their growing discontent, adopting a sharper tone in their criticism of Netanyahu's leadership. 'We stand here in unbearable pain, crying out for our loved ones, who are enduring the worst captivity - living in uncertainty, in darkness and without a shred of hope,' said one family member. Participants emphasized their belief that the government has abandoned the issue. 'There is no coherent plan, no vision and no clear answer to the most basic question: How do we bring our loved ones home?' they said. One relative of a hostage criticized the decline in military operations since the war's outset: 'The initial offensive momentum has diminished to almost nothing. There’s no pressure on Gaza, no new initiatives, and no leadership providing a clear direction. Meanwhile, we hear of no progress on the diplomatic front. Time is slipping away, and the hostages remain forgotten.' Another family member called for immediate action. 'We demand a decisive decision and an immediate strategy. The government must present both the public and the families of the hostages with a concrete plan for their release. Waiting for a miracle or relying on international political shifts is not a strategy. We demand an urgent meeting with the prime minister to hear how he intends to bring our loved ones home. Time is running out, and every passing day leaves our loved ones at the mercy of their captors.'

Despite cease-fire, Houthi rockets keep threatening Israel, expos...	While north remains quiet, alarms in central Israel warning of missile launch from Yemen are a reminder that other fronts remain active, and Israel lacks an exit strategy; Iran’s proxies in Yemen and Iraq may be keeping a lower profile, but their threats persist, while in Israel disappointment grows over international coalition’s reluctance to adopt tougher stance The alarms that blared Sunday morning across central Israel served as a stark reminder that, despite the cease-fire in Lebanon and a significant drop in rocket alerts, the war is far from over. Multiple fronts remain active, each presenting its own challenges. A ballistic missile launched from Yemen on Sunday during what had been a rare quiet day underscored a troubling reality – Israel lacks a comprehensive strategy to address these ongoing threats. For nearly 14 months, attempts to create such a strategy have stalled. Hopes now rest on the end of the Gaza war to bring stability to other fronts, though this remains uncertain. Criticism within Israel has also grown regarding the perceived inaction of the U.S. and the international coalition. Despite severe disruptions to shipping routes and Egypt’s economy, American efforts have been limited to intercepting drones and targeting weapons depots, leaving many questioning the West’s ability to confront these escalating threats. The missile attack from Yemen was a clear message from Iran’s regional proxies: As long as the fighting in Gaza continues, so will their attacks on Israel. Iran appears to have no interest in fully de-escalating, and the ongoing strikes from Yemen and Iraq may compel Israel to take more decisive action. This could include pressuring the U.S., where an administration change looms next month, to intensify its military efforts in the region. In a recorded statement last week before the Israeli Cabinet approved the Lebanon cease-fire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the broader regional challenges. 'In Yemen, we struck the Houthis’ Hodeidah port with force – something the international coalition had not done before. In Iraq, we have successfully thwarted numerous drone attacks, but challenges remain,' he said. Netanyahu also targeted the 'head of the octopus' – Iran. 'We’ve destroyed significant parts of their air defense systems, missile production capabilities, and elements of their nuclear program. Preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is my top priority. It’s crucial for Israel’s security and future,' he declared. Over the weekend, the IDF reported intercepting two drones approaching from the east before they entered Israeli airspace. However, the origins of the launches remain unconfirmed. Despite the cease-fire in Lebanon, the region is far from calm. Syrian rebels launched a surprise attack against the Assad regime, and Iranian-backed militias continue to insist their operations will persist. These groups, initially aligning their actions as 'support for Gaza,' have made it clear they do not plan to cease fire soon. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of Yemen’s Houthis, gave his first speech since the cease-fire last Thursday. Calling Lebanon’s 'victory' over Israeli aggression a historic triumph, he emphasized: 'We will not abandon Gaza. We will continue our operations on all fronts.' His comments were followed by nationwide protests organized by Houthi supporters. Pro-Iran militias in Iraq also distanced themselves from the Lebanon cease-fire, with groups like Kata’ib Hezbollah declaring that the cessation of fighting by Hezbollah would not impact their commitment to the Palestinian cause. They even vowed to escalate their attacks if Israel does not halt its actions in Gaza. Reports from Iraqi and international media suggest tensions between Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ al-Sudani and the militias are growing, partly due to the risk of Israeli retaliation. Notably, while attacks from Yemen and intercepted drones persist, claims of responsibility from the Houthis and other militias have been less frequent, a marked shift from the daily announcements seen earlier in the conflict. Analysts suggest this is a strategic move to avoid provoking a larger Israeli response now that the Lebanese front has quieted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Danny Citrinowicz, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies and a former head of the Iran branch in military intelligence, several factors are driving the militias’ reduced visibility. These include fears of an Israeli focus on their activities post-Lebanon, escalating internal conflicts in Iraq, and U.S. pressure on Baghdad. However, Citrinowicz warns this does not mean the militias will stop. 'They aim to maintain a low profile, enough to show loyalty to the Palestinian cause without risking large-scale Israeli retaliation,' he explained. The Houthis officially claimed responsibility for Sunday’s missile attack, boasting that they had targeted a 'vital site near Jaffa' with their hypersonic Palestine-2 ballistic missile. For Israel, the growing threats from these fronts underscore the urgent need for a unified strategy before the situation spirals further out of control. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryowkqcm1g	2024-12-01T09:28:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/Hk1111CKOGye/Hk1111CKOGye_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Sunday night's discussion will also focus on developments in Syria, and the possibility of reaching a deal after cease-fire in north; National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says video of American Israeli hostage Edan Alexander is a 'cruel reminder of Hamas' brutality' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a special discussion Sunday evening devoted to the dramatic developments in Syria and to the issue of the hostages, following statements that now, after the cease-fire in the north, a deal for the hostages can be reached. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan made similar statements but admitted in an interview that 'We are not there yet.' In an interview with CBS' 'Meet the Press' on Sunday, Sullivan referred to the psychological terror video released by Hamas of American Israeli hostage Edan Alexander. 'That video was a cruel reminder of Hamas' brutality and of the fact that they are holding so many hostages from so many countries, including American citizens, including Americans like Edan. And we are doing everything we can to get those hostages home safely to their families,' he said. According to Sullivan in an interview with 'Face the Nation,' also on Sunday morning, 'I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They’re feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a cease-fire deal, and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them till the end. They’re feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a cease-fire and hostage deal.' 'And we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt, to try to bring that about. In the coming days, conversations will be happening, even this very day, to try to make that happen as soon as possible,' he also said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'If the world can come together to increase the pressure on Hamas, we can finally break through, get a deal in place, get a ceasefire, get a surge of humanitarian assistance, and crucially, get those hostages, including those Americans, home safely to their families.' 'I can't predict whether it's going to happen. What I can say is, there has been progress. There have been steps forward. There is a renewed sense that this is possible, but we've been here before where we thought we were close, it didn't pan out. And so I'm not going to get ahead of myself or make any predictions or provide false hope. What I will say is, we're driving at this with everything we've got. We think we have a chance, but we won't rest until we get it done,' her added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bko5cg97kx	2024-12-01T08:37:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/19/HkxqPyjPXA/HkxqPyjPXA_0_302_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Rebels have captured Assad's palace in Aleppo; Syrian president s...	Two Iraqi militias loyal to Iran are considering deploying forces to Syria, framing their potential involvement as vital to protecting the 'resistance axis'; A militia spokesperson warned that Syria’s instability could spill into Iraq, justifying urgent action The rebels in Syria announced Sunday afternoon that they had taken over President Bashar Assad's palace in the city of Aleppo, which they occupied over the weekend for the first time since the beginning of the civil war. Assad himself promised in the afternoon to fight back and declared that 'terror only understands the language of power, and we will break it with it.' Sources in the Syrian army claim that the Syrian forces that were expelled from Aleppo over the weekend are now reorganizing and preparing for a counter-attack to regain control of the city. It is the first time since the Syrian Civil War erupted in 2011 that Bashar al-Assad’s regime has lost its grip on Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. The Syrian opposition confirmed this dramatic shift on Sunday afternoon, marking a critical turning point in the conflict. Reports indicate the rebels, spearheading a surprise offensive against Assad’s forces, have seized key military installations in the city, including the military academy and other southern military colleges. Meanwhile, pro-Iranian militias in Iraq are reportedly contemplating intervention in Syria to bolster Assad’s regime as his grip on the region falters. The rebels’ sudden and coordinated assault began last Wednesday and coincided with the implementation of the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – a Sunni jihadist group that had been largely confined to Idlib province in northwest Syria – rebels rapidly advanced into the neighboring Aleppo region, capturing swaths of territory. Assad’s forces were unable to hold their positions, and by Saturday reports emerged that Aleppo was no longer under regime control. In recent years, Assad’s regime appeared to have stabilized, thanks to the backing of Russia and Iran, leaving rebel activity largely subdued. The Aleppo offensive marks the largest operation by anti-Assad forces in four years, raising international concerns, particularly in Israel, over the potential for non-conventional weapons to fall into jihadist hands. Over the past five days of intense fighting in northwest Syria, more than 300 people, including dozens of civilians, have reportedly been killed. By midday Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition monitoring group, confirmed Aleppo had fallen out of Assad’s control. Rami Abdul Rahman, the group’s director, told AFP the rebels now control almost the entire city, aside from a few Kurdish-held neighborhoods. 'This is the first time since the war began in 2011 that Assad has completely lost control of Aleppo,' he emphasized. Rebel sources later claimed that, in addition to capturing the military academy, they had also seized a Russian air defense system. Turkey’s concerns and Kurdish movements Regional actors are already recalibrating in response to the power shift. Iran, Assad’s staunch ally, has decried the rebel offensive as part of what it described as a 'Zionist-American satanic plot' to destabilize the region. On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi traveled to Damascus in a show of solidarity, proclaiming Tehran’s unwavering support for the Syrian government. 'The Syrian army will once again defeat these terrorists, as it has in the past,' he declared before departing for Syria. Meanwhile, reports from the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby al-Jadeed suggest that two pro-Iranian Iraqi militias are deliberating whether to intervene in Syria to assist Assad in reclaiming Aleppo. A spokesperson for Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada ('Masters of Martyrs Battalion'), one of the militias, alleged that 'what is happening in Syria with American and Israeli backing is the second phase of the siege on Hezbollah in Lebanon.' He warned that the developments in Syria would inevitably spill over into Iraq, justifying potential intervention. 'We have fought for years in Syria, not to defend the regime, but to protect the resistance axis and the vital supply line connecting Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and Syria,' he explained. While no definitive decision has been made, militia representatives hinted that deployment could occur within days if deemed necessary. Turkey, another key stakeholder in northern Syria, is closely monitoring the situation. For years, Ankara has backed certain rebel factions against Assad, but its primary concern remains the strengthening of Kurdish groups near its border. Turkish security officials claimed on Sunday that rebel forces aligned with Ankara had thwarted an attempt by Kurdish militias to establish a corridor linking Kurdish-controlled areas in northeastern Syria to Tel Rifaat, an area northwest of Aleppo with strategic significance. Turkish sources alleged that Kurdish factions, including the PKK and YPG – both viewed as terrorist organizations by Ankara – sought to exploit the vacuum created by Assad’s retreat. Turkey views such moves as a direct threat to its national security. Assad’s allies downplay losses As the rebels consolidate their gains, Assad’s media apparatus has worked to downplay the significance of the developments. Lebanon’s Al-Mayadeen network, which is closely affiliated with Hezbollah, reported on Sunday that the Syrian army had already reclaimed several towns in northern Hama province. The network also dismissed claims that rebels had captured villages in the region. Meanwhile, Syria’s Ministry of Defense has urged citizens to rely exclusively on official channels for updates, underscoring the regime’s attempt to maintain a narrative of control. A civil war that reshaped the region The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011 as part of the broader Arab Spring uprisings, has left an indelible mark on the Middle East. The conflict erupted following anti-Assad protests in the southern city of Daraa, which were met with a brutal crackdown by the regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: By 2015, Assad’s control had dwindled to a fraction of the country, and his government appeared on the verge of collapse. However, a decisive intervention by Russia, coupled with support from Iranian militias and Hezbollah, enabled Assad to regain control over most of Syria. In recent years, fighting has subsided. Rebels were largely confined to the Idlib region, and Assad’s grip on power seemed unshakable. Yet the Aleppo offensive has rekindled fears of renewed instability. The conflict has exacted a devastating toll, with over half a million people killed and millions displaced, many of whom have sought refuge abroad. Despite Assad’s apparent resurgence, the latest developments underscore that Syria’s war is far from over, and the balance of power remains precarious. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjoaeatmje	2024-12-01T06:24:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/By3W00st7Jg/By3W00st7Jg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
US will not return nuclear weapons to Ukraine	The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday. Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he leaves office. 'That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not (giving them) nuclear capability,' he told ABC. Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkapag5qke	2024-12-01T06:17:06-08:00

German Navy successfully tests Israeli BlueWhale Drone Sub as Bal...	After a recent case of suspected Russian sabotage against internet cables in the Baltic Sea, the German Navy concluded testing the BlueWhale, an unmanned Israeli submarine that could help it protect critical undersea infrastructure The German Navy recently concluded a two-week evaluation of the BlueWhale autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), a cutting-edge system developed by the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). The evaluation was conducted in the Baltic Sea by a 5.5-ton submarine equipped with a telescopic mast with radar and electro-optic systems. The AUV can perform complex tasks for several weeks, identify sea and land targets, and transmit data to command posts worldwide. The trials also highlight the growing defense partnership between Israel and Germany. BlueWhale’s evaluation follows other high-profile collaborations, including the recent Arrow missile air defense system deal, which reflects the strategic alignment between the two nations in addressing mutual security challenges. The German Navy partnered with IAI and ATLAS Elektronik for the trials, and the NATO Centre of Excellence for Operations supported the integration of the BlueWhale into the German Navy’s framework. The test comes after undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea were physically cut, an act suspected of Russia-led sabotage. On November 18, two undersea telecommunications cables were severed, disrupting communications between Finland, Germany, Lithuania and Sweden. The incidents have raised concerns, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius labeled them 'sabotage.' In light of this suspected undersea cable sabotage, the BlueWhale is reportedly strengthening the German Navy’s objectives. With its advanced monitoring capabilities and autonomy to operate for extended periods, the unmanned Israeli submarine can provide a critical tool for monitoring and protecting vital undersea infrastructure. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Germany’s defense policy has changed substantially; the government has planned to modernize its forces and meet NATO’s defense spending target of 2% of GDP. The country’s updated defense strategies, outlined in the 'German Navy Objectives for 2035 and Beyond,' reason that with the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, the Baltic Sea must be integrated into NATO’s maritime security, a move that puts them in potential conflict with Russia. The German Navy’s efforts to strengthen its capacity in the Baltic Sea are a significant challenge for Russia, as the area is critical for Moscow’s ambitions. A more robust German naval presence – bolstered by advanced technologies like the BlueWhale and increased NATO coordination – undermines Russia’s ability to project power and operate covertly in the region. Such an enhanced military presence counters Russia’s hybrid threats, including cyber and physical sabotage, hallmarks of Putin’s tactics. IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy said in a statement that 'in addition to its intelligence-gathering capabilities, the BlueWhale system excels in detecting other submarines and covertly mapping mines on the seabed, using its advanced sonar systems, and is an important part of IAI’s range of maritime solutions, which include the protection of Economic Exclusion Zones, defensive and offensive system suites for marine vessels, and the management of the arena in which autonomous vessels are operating.' Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent conflict have been catalysts for German military spending, leading to substantial enhancements in military spending, reforms, a more proactive role in the defense of Europe, and support for NATO. However, Germany’s acquisition of Israeli defensive systems doesn’t put Israel on a collision course with Russia. Kobi Michael, a researcher at INSS and the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, said that 'as long as Israel doesn’t supply Ukraine with weapons and mainly offensive weapons, I do not think that Russia can say something, especially when Russia supplies weapon to Hezbollah and aerial defense systems to Iran.' Similarly, Jeremy Issacharoff, Israel’s former ambassador to Germany, said that: 'Over the last decades, the Israel-Germany relationship has evolved into one of Israel’s most important strategic partnerships –second only to the United States. It’s remarkable considering diplomatic relations only began in 1965.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While the Holocaust remains an ever-present historical factor between Israel and Germany, the relationship has matured into one of trust and cooperation, especially in defense and intelligence, the former ambassador highlighted. 'These deals weren’t about historical guilt – they were based on Germany’s recognition of Israeli technology as the best fit for their defense needs. Moreover, high-level visits between Israeli and German leaders increased significantly. This wasn’t just Germany supporting Israel; it was Israel committing to Germany’s security as well,' Issacharoff added. -This article is written by Nathan Klabin and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rydy00eq71e	2024-12-01T06:13:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/05/08/r1C9ko8Nn/r1C9ko8Nn_0_0_825_525_0_small.jpg

Gaza cease-fire talks could advance, Saar, Herzog say as Hamas of...	Foreign Minister says there is new flexibility on both sides; Herzog says negotiations taking place behind the scene; Qatari outlet says Egyptian proposal gives Israel broad role to survey Rafah crossing after Hamas hints agreement to gradual IDF withdrawal Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said there are indications that cease-fire talks with Hamas may move forward and that there may be more flexibility on both sides to reach a deal in Gaza. Saar spoke at a conference held by the Israel Hayom. 'I think we will know in the coming days,' he said. 'The basic principle is that Hamas cannot rule over Gaza, but we are committed to advancing the release of hostages,' he said. President Issac Herzog said there were negotiations currently behind the scenes and there was now a chance to bring the hostages home. Herzog met with the family of Edan Alexander who was seen in a psychological warfare video posted by Hamas on Saturday, calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. president-elect Donald Trump to bring about his release and that of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. 'Now is the time,' Herzog said. 'My call is to the entire world, the leadership in Israel and all the countries mediating in the negotiations.' Earlier, the Saudi owned UK-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper cited Palestinian sources who said Hamas was more willing to discuss a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza after a similar deal was agreed in the war between Israel and Hezbollah. The sources said a delegation of Hamas officials that were visiting Cairo to meet with Egyptian intelligence chief Major General Hassan Rashad were in fact already involved in a new round of talks with Egyptian and American mediation and were discussing the governing of Gaza after the war. According to the sources, Hamas would agree to the Palestinian Authority control of the Rafah border crossing to Egypt in exchange for the return of displaced Gazans to their homes in the northern part of the Strip. Hamas was also willing to agree to a committee rule over the Strip, the Palestinian sources told the paper. That suggested was raised in the past and included a commission of professionals that would administer Gaza under the auspices of the PA and take responsibility over the distribution of humanitarian aid and prepare a plan for the rebuilding that would be required after the destruction caused by the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had repeatedly rejected any role played by the PA in post-war Gaza. The Qatari based Al Arabi Al Jadeed reported on a different Egyptian proposal being discussed. According to the report a committee of regional mediating countries would be established to oversee a 60-day transitional period like that one agreed on in the cease-fire deal with Hezbollah. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Egyptian proposal, the report said includes a broad role for Israel in overseeing the Rafah crossing, using surveillance equipment at every stage of the crossing process – in exchange for large amounts of aid being delivered into the Strip. According to the paper, Israel and Egypt remain in disagreement over security arrangements along the Philadelphi Corridor. 'Egypt rejects Israel's unilateral steps taken there, including positioning surveillance cameras positioned to see into the Sinai desert,' the report said. According to the outlet, Israel has begun building observation towers along the narrow corridor and has installed cameras and other advanced surveillance equipment. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjmpkakm1g	2024-12-01T03:54:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/HkNy116tX1g/HkNy116tX1g_0_132_1280_720_0_small.jpg

F*ck Israel, nobody likes you': Jewish students accosted on Lond...	A London school bus carrying Jewish students was targeted by teens hurling stones and shouting slurs, including 'F*** Israel'; Police are investigating the incident as a potential hate crime, calling the attack 'completely unacceptable' A bus carrying Jewish students on their way home from school was attacked by a group of teenagers who threw stones at the vehicle while shouting, 'F*** Israel.' London police confirmed to the Daily Mail that officers are investigating the incident as a 'potential hate crime.' The students involved attend the Jewish Free School (JFS) in Kenton, North London. An eyewitness told the Jewish Chronicle that when the buses stopped last Wednesday on Edgware Road, a large group of teenagers from another school began throwing large stones at one of the buses. Following the attack, four teenagers boarded one of the buses, hurling curses and making antisemitic remarks toward the Jewish students. The eyewitness reported that the attackers insulted the Jewish children: 'They were also swearing at us, saying, 'F*ck Israel, nobody likes you. F*ck off you b*tches.' A Jewish bystander who witnessed the incident said that some students fled the bus while others ducked for cover. 'They were completely terrified,' he said. He also noted that the attackers filmed the incident on their phones. According to the Daily Mail, the substitute bus driver did not report the incident immediately. Instead, it was a parent of one of the affected children who contacted the police. The London Metropolitan Police stated: 'Officers in Barnet are investigating a potential hate crime after a school bus was targeted on High Street, Edgware. Stones were thrown at the bus before a group of other students got on and made antisemitic remarks towards those on board. Officers from the safer transport team have spoken to the victims involved, as well as their parents, and enquiries are ongoing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Lorraine Busby-McVey, Borough Commander for Barnet’s neighborhood policing team, described the incident as deeply concerning: 'This was a distressing incident for those on the bus and the behavior of the individuals responsible is completely unacceptable. There is no place for hate crime either here or across the rest of London, and a thorough investigation is underway.' Despite the seriousness of the incident, no arrests have been made so far. Transport for London (TfL) also addressed the attack in a statement: 'We are deeply concerned to hear about this incident and fully support the police investigation. No-one should ever have to fear or experience abuse when using our network.' The statement continued, 'We take a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of hate crime, and work with the police to pursue anyone who is abusive to our customers or staff. Alongside the bus operator, Uno, we are supporting the police with their investigation and are supplying footage from the CCTV cameras, which all buses are equipped with. We encourage anyone who experienced or witnessed this incident to contact the police.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r14xb6tmke	2024-12-01T02:57:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/02/14/S100JIJtTi/S100JIJtTi_0_0_1000_667_0_small.jpg

Watch: Russian police storm Moscow gay nightclubs	Local law enforcement carry out government-instructed crackdown on 'LGBTQ+ propaganda' after supreme court bans movement in country Russian police raided several bars and nightclubs across Moscow on Saturday as part of the government’s crackdown on 'LGBTQ+ propaganda,' state media reported. Smartphones, laptops and video cameras were seized, while clubgoers had their documents inspected by officers, Russia’s Tass news agency said, citing sources in law enforcement. The raids come exactly a year since Russia’s Supreme Court ruled that the 'LGBTQ+ movement' should be banned as an 'extremist organization.' Its decision followed a decades-long crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has touted 'traditional family values' as a cornerstone of his quarter-century in power. Footage shared on social media appeared to show partygoers being ordered by police to lie on the floor as officers moved through Moscow’s Arma nightclub. The capital’s Mono bar was also targeted, Russian media reported. In a post on Telegram on Saturday, the club’s management didn’t directly reference an incident with law enforcement, but wrote, 'Friends, we’re so sorry that what happened, happened. They didn’t find anything forbidden. We live in such times, but life must go on.' Police also detained the head of the 'Men Travel' tour agency on Saturday under anti-LGBT laws, Tass reported. The news agency said that the 48-year-old was suspected of preparing a trip for 'the supporters of nontraditional sexual values' to visit Egypt over Russia’s New Year’s holidays. The raids mirror the concerns of Russian activists who warned that Moscow’s designation of the 'LGBTQ+ movement' as 'extremist' — despite it not being an official entity — could see Russian authorities crack down at will on groups or individuals. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Other recent laws have also served to put pressure on those that the Russian government believes aren’t in line with the country’s 'traditional values.'

The Kremlin leader also approved legislation that outlaws the spread of material that encourages people not to have children. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkd5x6fmjg	2024-12-01T02:30:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/SJDXgsKm1l/SJDXgsKm1l_0_13_248_139_0_small.jpg

PM open to encouraging Palestinian migration from Gaza, minister ...	Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says working to convince Netanyahu; says establishing settlements in Gaza is a good idea but is not enough Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was beginning to show willingness to promoting Palestinian migration out of Gaza. Speaking in an interview with Army Radio, Ben-Gvir said the idea of Jewish settlements in Gaza was a welcomed one. 'After all we must remember that this could be the greatest punishment for what was done to us on Oct. 7,' he said. 'The only times we have won over our enemies was when we took territory from them. Conquering Gaza is definitely an idea, but I must admit it would not be enough for me. I want to encourage migration and I think Palestinians should be able to leave willingly to 'their countries.' He said he saw on television a man in Gaza begging to be allowed to leave. 'I think there are many like him. I am working hard to convince the prime minister that this should happen and am beginning to see some openness. I hope he will eventually understand that is the only way,' Ben-Gvir said.

Assad's nightmare: Meet Tahrir al-Sham leader, Abu Mohammad al-Ju...	North western Syria is now entirely out of President Assad's control, mostly to the efforts of a Sunni coalition known as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, a Salafist Jihadi organization headed by Abu Mohammad al-Julani, an elusive figure who broke contact with both ISIS and Al Qaeda to take his group in a new direction When discussing the Syrian 'rebels' currently engaged in combat against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and its supporters, the reference is to a diverse array of groups with varying allegiances, many of which have evolved over the prolonged civil war. Among these, Jabhat al-Nusra, initially established during the early stages of the conflict as al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, played a prominent role in the fight against Assad. Over time, the group demonstrated its ability to control territory and later rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham in 2016, claiming to sever ties with al-Qaeda. In 2017, it merged with other factions to form Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), now a coalition of Sunni rebel groups. On Saturday, the Syrian newspaper Al-Watan, citing 'special sources' from Idlib, reported that 'a central headquarters of Jabhat al-Nusra in Idlib was attacked, with indications that al-Julani was inside the building.' According to the report, the targeted site was heavily secured, with strict measures in place preventing civilians and even members of the organization from approaching. It remains unclear whether al-Julani was killed in the attack. Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (loosely translated as 'The Organization for the Liberation of the Levant'), known internationally by its acronym HTS, is currently the leading faction fighting against the Syrian regime and pro-Iranian militias. Exploiting the weaknesses of the Shiite-Iranian axis, HTS has rapidly expanded its territorial control, capturing numerous villages in the Idlib, Aleppo, and Hama regions in coordination with other opposition forces. The current military commander of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, previously served as the Emir of Jabhat al-Nusra from 2012 to 2016. His real identity remains a subject of speculation, with some sources identifying him as Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa and others as Osama al-Wahdi. Reports about his life are contradictory, adding to his enigmatic reputation. According to Arab media, al-Julani was born in either 1981 or 1982 in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, and grew up in the Idlib region. He initially studied medicine but dropped out and joined al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2003 following President Bush's invasion, where he became close to the infamous Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the group’s leader. After the latter's assassination in 2006, al-Julani relocated to Lebanon but later returned to Iraq, where he was detained by U.S. forces and released in 2008. Following his release, al-Julani resumed his activities with the 'Islamic State of Iraq' under Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In August 2011, amid protests against Assad, al-Julani was sent by al-Qaeda to Syria to establish a branch of the organization. In 2012, he founded Jabhat al-Nusra, calling on Syrians to wage jihad against the Assad regime. However, al-Julani later rejected an attempt by al-Baghdadi to merge the Islamic State of Iraq with Jabhat al-Nusra, instead pledging exclusive allegiance to Ayman Al-Zawahiri, then-head of al-Qaeda, who himself was assassinated in a US strike in late of July of 2022. Over time, Jabhat al-Nusra emerged as one of the most powerful armed factions in Syria. The group seized control of Idlib in northwestern Syria, imposing strict governance on the local population. Critics accuse al-Julani of building an economic empire at the expense of civilians, benefiting from revenues from border crossings, control over oil companies, and dominance in agriculture and trade. In recent months, protests have erupted in the Idlib region, with demonstrators demanding al-Julani’s resignation. In 2016, Jabhat al-Nusra rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, claiming to distance itself from al-Qaeda. The following year, it merged with other groups to form Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. Despite these changes, the United States and the United Nations continue to classify HTS as a terrorist organization. Al-Julani has drawn ideological distinctions between Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State, stating, 'We reject the caliphate they declare and view it as illegitimate because it was established on invalid foundations.' HTS, which has taken the lead in the current surprise offensive against Assad’s forces, has long been criticized for its extremist activities. Al-Julani and HTS were early on responsible for deadly bombings, vowed to attack Western forces, confiscated property from religious minorities, and deployed a 'religious police' to enforce conservative dress codes for women. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Professor Eyal Zisser, a prominent Middle East expert from Tel Aviv University, emphasized in an interview with Ynet that Assad’s regime is currently in a weakened state. The loss of Aleppo to the rebels, Zisser noted, represents a significant blow due to the city’s size and economic importance. He explained that Assad now relies heavily on the support of his allies but warned that airstrikes alone would not suffice to repel the rebels: 'If the Russians, Iranians, and Hezbollah do not come to his aid, this could create very negative momentum for Assad. Ultimately, he could find himself confined to Damascus.' Regarding the implications for Israel, Zisser argued, 'This conflict is beyond our scope. Israel should avoid direct involvement in a war in another country. Instead, we should seize the opportunity to strike at Iranian, Hezbollah, and Shiite militia forces operating in Syria.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hklcaqfqje	2024-12-01T00:55:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/BJJ38yFmJg/BJJ38yFmJg_0_0_1024_576_0_small.jpg

Trump nominates fierce critic of FBI, as new chief	Kashyap Patel, a known Trump loyalist who served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Defense during Trump’s first term; in a recent interview he called on the bureau HQ to be dismantled, turned into deep state museum On Saturday night, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Kashyap (Kash) Patel, who previously served as Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Defense during Trump’s first term, will be appointed as the next FBI Director. Trump made the announcement on his social media platform, Truth Social. According to Trump, 'Kash is an excellent lawyer, investigator, and an ‘America First’ fighter who has dedicated his career to exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people. He played a crucial role in exposing the Russian hoax and stands as a defender of truth, accountability, and the constitution.' The president-elect further stated, 'Kash did outstanding work during my first term, where he served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Defense, Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council. Kash has also participated in over 60 jury trials.' Trump added, 'This FBI will put an end to America’s growing crime epidemic, dismantle immigrant criminal gangs, and combat the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking along the border. Kash will work under our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to restore loyalty, courage, and integrity to the FBI.' CNN reported that Patel has been highly critical of the FBI in the past. In a podcast interview in September, Patel called for dismantling the agency’s Washington headquarters and turning it into a 'Deep State museum.' He also mocked the FBI during an interview on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' in relation to the search warrant executed in 2022 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, which had led to charges against the president-elect for retaining classified documents. A judge later dismissed the charges against Trump. Patel has publicly praised Israel's intelligence capabilities on numerous occasions and has called for the United States to stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with Israel, which he described as 'our number one ally.' Following the 'pager' operation in Lebanon, he told Fox News, 'What the Israelis did was genius. Hamas is looking at what they did, and they are surely trembling.

'I’ve worked with Israeli intelligence services for years,' Patel shared. 'This is part of a multi-system approach, a strategy of thinking one, two, even seven steps ahead.

He added, 'Israel’s capabilities are extraordinary, but they cannot defeat Iran alone—it’s too big a machine. We need to stand shoulder to shoulder, side by side with Israel against Iran. And when Trump returns to power, we will shut down the machine that funnels money to Iran. We won’t have hostages in the hands of Hamas, Iran, or Hezbollah. America needs to wake up and prioritize Israel. We need to end this war, bring Israeli and American hostages home, and stand with our number one ally—and that’s exactly what Trump will do.'

Hamas willing to discuss gradual IDF withdrawal from Gaza, report	Saudi owned UK-based outlet cites Palestinian sources who say the terror group is also willing to allow PA control of Rafah border crossing in exchange for return of Gazans to the north of the Strip Hamas was more willing to agree a cease-fire deal that would include a gradual withdrawal of IDF troops from the Gaza Strip, ahead of a new round of talks with Egyptian and American mediators, the UK based Saudi owned, Asharq al-Awsat reported on Sunday citing Palestinian sources. Hamas had previously demanded a complete withdrawal from the Strip and an end to the war before agreeing to a deal that would release hostages held in Gaza since the Oct. 7 massacre. The terror group was reportedly also willing to allow the Palestinian Authority (PA) to assume responsibility for the Rafah border crossing to Egypt in exchange for the return of displaced Gazans to their homes in the northern areas of the Strip. The Biden administration was seeking to advance a deal before the new Trump presidency begins late in January 2025. President-elect Donald Trump appears interested in a deal as well after he received the Israeli assessment that half of the 101 hostages were still alive. Hamas in an act of psychological warfare on Saturday, posted a video of American hostage, Edan Alexander, who serves in the IDF, appealing to Trump to work for his and the other hostages' release. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said repeatedly that Israel would agree to a cease-fire in the war against Hamas in Gaza, but not to the end of the war. After the Hamas video appeared, Netanyahu said Israel was working to bring all the hostages, home.

Syrian president vows to retaliate for rebel offensive, with Russ...	Islamist extremists opposing Assad regime overpower Syrian military in key points in north of country Syrian president Bashar al-Assad vowed to defeat the insurgent offensive launched against his military forces in the Idlib province in northern Syria. According to a report in the state news agency SANA, Assad spoke with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed and said his troops 'continue to defend its territorial integrity against all terrorists and their supporters and is capable, with the help of its allies, of defeating and eliminating them — no matter how severe their terrorist attacks.' SANA reported that bin Zayed affirmed Abu Dhabi’s support for Syria. The militias launched a surprise assault against Assad’s regime last Wednesday, marking the biggest military push taken by the militant force in the country in four years. The rebels reportedly took advantage of the weakened state of Assad's allies in the civil war, especially Hezbollah — which had suffered significant blows from Israel before the two sides agreed to a cease-fire. Reports indicate that Assad's forces were caught off guard by the rebels, who launched their attack from their last major stronghold in Idlib Province in northwestern Syria. The surprise offensive began last Wednesday, coinciding with the enactment of a cease-fire in Lebanon. The assault was being led by several rebel factions, spearheaded by the jihadist group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and in coordination with Turkish-backed rebel forces. Fighting erupted within Aleppo on Friday, Syria’s second-largest city and a strategic and symbolic stronghold. Reports suggested the rebels had taken control of most of the city by Friday. This marks a dramatic and highly symbolic victory for the rebels. Aleppo, a city with a history spanning thousands of years and home to 2.3 million people before the war, was the rebels' main stronghold in the previous decade. They captured it in 2012 but were forced to retreat in 2016 following a brutal bombardment campaign by Assad's forces and the Russian air force, which flattened large parts of the city. On Saturday, reports emerged that the rebels had also seized Aleppo's international airport. In dramatic footage, rebels were seen celebrating in the city’s streets, including near its historic citadel, removing regime symbols and Assad posters. It appears their advance has faced little significant resistance so far, with Syrian officials admitting Assad’s forces had retreated from several areas. Assad’s government officially declared a 'reorganization' of its forces to prepare for a counteroffensive to reclaim lost territory. Alongside the main offensive on Aleppo, the rebels have completed their capture of all of Idlib Province — most of which was already under their control — and pushed south toward Hama. Although Assad's forces denied reports of a retreat from the area, the rebels appeared to have made advances. Russia has intervened to support Assad with a series of airstrikes conducted by its fighter jets operating from Latakia. Russian aircraft bombed Aleppo for the first time since 2016. The clashes have so far claimed over 327 lives, primarily from Assad’s forces and the rebels, though the toll includes dozens of civilians. In his first response to the surprise attack, Assad vowed that Syria is capable of defeating the rebels. According to the Syrian state news agency SANA, Assad spoke with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed, stressing that 'Syria continues to defend its territorial integrity against all terrorists and their supporters and is capable, with the help of its allies, of defeating and eliminating them — no matter how severe their terrorist attacks.' The statement added that bin Zayed affirmed Abu Dhabi’s support for Syria. Should Israel be concerned? The main global concern of the attack is the potential for renewed chaos in Syria after years of apparent stabilization and Assad's reintegration into the Arab world. Renewed instability could empower extremist groups like the Islamic State. In Europe, where the effects of the massive migrant crisis from the peak of the Syrian civil war are still felt, leaders are particularly wary of facing another wave of refugees. Israel is closely monitoring developments, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu holding an unusual discussion on the matter back on Friday. Ynet’s Military and security correspondent Ron Ben-Yishai noted that in the short term, the situation might actually benefit Israel's security. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Assad, weakened and losing control, is unlikely to provoke confrontations with Israel and will probably exercise caution regarding Iranian efforts to deliver aid to Hezbollah through Syrian territory.

What is the cost of immigration to Israel and how best to prepare...	Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong the first private company that offers guidance and assistance for new immigrants, recommends learning Hebrew ahead of move New immigrants to Israel face many challenges when they decide on the move, some are financial and others involve assimilating successfully to the job market. Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong, the first private company set up to provide guidance and assistance to new immigrants explains how to make Aliya easier. 'It is important to learn Hebrew while abroad,' he says. 'It’s no secret that our enemies wish for the eradication of the State of Israel, and they do this even outside the borders of the battlefield,' says Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong. 'Our enemies are using psychological warfare in an attempt to break our spirit and make us run away from here. Our answer must be decisive - we must encourage and bring waves of immigration to Israel. The equation is simple: if they want us to leave Israel, we will do the exact opposite - we will bring more Jews and create a wave of Aliyah that will strengthen Israeli society.' In April 2024, about six months after the outbreak of the war, the first impact company that encourages Aliyah and assists in integration was launched- Belong. The company, owned by entrepreneur and businessman Gilad Ramot, is the first private organization in Israel that encourages Aliyah. The company’s goal is to improve the Aliyah and Integration process in Israeli society. Is it financially feasible? Belong believes so. Through an agent, the company offers: • Assistance in handling the process, exercising rights, and using them. • The integration process, managing Israeli bureaucracy, exhausting the rights they deserve, integrating into the labor market, and overcoming the challenges of culture and language. 'We build communities to ensure that everyone who comes to Israel feels they belong, and even provide a concierge service to those who want to facilitate their integration into daily life in Israel,' says Gilad. What are the significant obstacles that the Olim face? 'Finding a job. It may take time for Olim to find a suitable job in Israel, especially if they don’t speak Hebrew. The job market is reserved only for significant incomes. Sometimes, you also need to complete your education or undergo professional training in required adaptions to the Israeli labor market. Also, linguistic differences can be a barrier in various jobs. However, there are many jobs in Israel where a foreign language as a mother tongue may actually be a significant advantage.' In addition to the cost of plane tickets, there are also shipping costs: Furniture, personal equipment, etc., which can amount to even 5,000 dollars - depending on the amount of luggage. The average rent in Israel is very expensive and stands at about NIS 4,500 per month (about $1,300), compared to the average rent in the US, which is estimated at about $1,200. The average rent in Europe is even lower at $900. Of course, these are general numbers that vary according to the location of the apartment, its size, and the year of construction, but they certainly give a general picture of the cost of living in Israel.

US blames Assad's reliance on Russia, Iran for loss of Aleppo con...	White House National Security Council spokesperson says U.S. had nothing to do with the Hayat Tahir Al Shams (HTS) offensive; Russia vows support for Damascus regime The United States on Saturday said Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad lost control of Aleppo because of his reliance on Russia and Iran. Syria's 'reliance on Russia and Iran,' along with its refusal to move forward with a 2015 peace process outlined by the UN Security Council, 'created the conditions now unfolding,' National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement. 'At the same time, the United States has nothing to do with this offensive, which is led by Hay'at Tahir al-Sham (HTS), a designated terrorist organization.' The Syrian army said on Saturday dozens of its soldiers had been killed in a major attack led by Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels who swept into the city of Aleppo, forcing the army to redeploy in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air force had carried out strikes on Syrian rebels in support of the country's army, Russian news agencies reported. The strikes followed what was the boldest rebel assault for years in a civil war where front lines had largely been frozen since 2020. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, once known as the Nusra Front, is designated a terrorist group by the U.S., Russia, Turkey and other states. Assad is a close Moscow ally. In Washington, the White House National Security Council said it was closely monitoring the situation and had been in contact with regional capitals over the last 48 hours. The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end, although most major fighting halted years ago after Iran and Russia helped Assad's government win control of most land and all major cities. Aleppo had been firmly held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war's major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country's largest city. 'I am a son of Aleppo, and was displaced from it eight years ago, in 2016. Thank God we just returned. It is an indescribable feeling,' said Ali Jumaa, a rebel fighter, in television footage filmed inside the city. Acknowledging the rebel advance, the Syrian army command said insurgents had entered much of Aleppo. After the army said it was preparing a counterattack, airstrikes targeted rebel gatherings and convoys in the city, the pro-Damascus newspaper al-Watan reported. One strike caused casualties in Aleppo's Basel square, a resident told Reuters. Images filmed on Saturday showed people posing for photos on a toppled statue of Bassil al-Assad, late brother of the president. Fighters zipped around the city in trucks and milled around in the streets. A man waved a Syrian opposition flag as he stood near Aleppo's historic citadel. The Syrian military command said militants had attacked in large numbers and from multiple directions, prompting 'our armed forces to carry out a redeployment operation aimed at strengthening the defense lines in order to absorb the attack, preserve the lives of civilians and soldiers'. The rebels also took control of Aleppo airport, according to a statement by their operations room and a security source. Two rebel sources also said the insurgents had captured the city of Maraat al Numan in Idlib province, bringing all of that area under their control. The fighting revives the long-simmering Syrian conflict as the wider region is roiled by wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where a truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday. With Assad backed by Russia and Iran, and Turkey supporting some of the rebels in the northwest where it maintains troops, the offensive has brought into focus the conflict's knotted geopolitics. Fighting in the northwest had largely abated since Turkey and Russia reached a de-escalation agreement in 2020. Russian, Turkish ministers talk Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, discussing the situation in Syria, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday. 'Both sides expressed serious concerns at the dangerous development of the situation,' the ministry said. They agreed it was necessary to coordinate joint actions to stabilize the situation in the country. Turkish security officials had said on Thursday that Ankara had prevented operations which opposition groups wanted to organize, in order to avoid further tensions in the region. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Lavrov in a phone call that the rebel attacks were part of an Israeli-U.S. plan to destabilize the region, Iranian state media said. The Syrian Civil Defense, a rescue service operating in opposition-held parts of Syria, said in a post on X that Syrian government and Russian aircraft carried out airstrikes on residential neighborhoods in rebel-held Idlib, killing four civilians and wounding six others. The Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which spearhead the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that control much of northeastern and eastern Syria and have long had a foothold in Aleppo, widened their control in the city as government troops left, a senior YPG source said.

US general takes helm in Lebanon cease-fire as Syrian battles esc...	Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers arrives in Beirut to lead international team enforcing truce, joined temporarily by Biden adviser Amos Hochstein; as Hezbollah challenges deal, Israel hopes Syria's escalating conflict will shift focus to Assad regime Hezbollah’s attention appears to be shifting to Syria as rebel forces make dramatic advances, potentially diverting the terrorist group's focus from violating agreements with Israel to defending Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Israeli officials have characterized the development as a short-term positive, especially given Hezbollah’s recent efforts to challenge the Lebanon cease-fire framework. In light of the evolving situation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a special security meeting Friday night to discuss the implications of the Syrian conflict and the enforcement of the Lebanon cease-fire agreement. 'This is something we need to monitor closely to see how it unfolds,' Israeli officials said. 'It doesn’t necessarily impact us in the short term, but any instability in a neighboring country could eventually affect us. That said, there may also be opportunities for change here.' Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that in the near term, the developments could benefit Israel’s security. Assad, weakened by the ongoing conflict, is unlikely to provoke Israel and may exercise caution in allowing Iran to use Syrian territory to supply Hezbollah. However, Ben-Yishai warned that the longer-term outlook is concerning, as the Sunni rebels are jihadists no less dangerous than the Iranian-backed Shiite groups. Despite the upheaval in Syria, Hezbollah’s cease-fire violations continued over the weekend. The IDF reported on Saturday targeting a military vehicle in southern Lebanon, near a Hezbollah missile production site, in response to these breaches. The international enforcement mechanism overseeing the Lebanon cease-fire agreement is expected to ramp up operations later this week. Until then, Israel has maintained aggressive enforcement. 'Every violation will be met with significant enforcement, as is currently the case,' a senior Israeli official said. The enforcement framework is headed by U.S. Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, who previously served as the head of special operations at U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Jeffers arrived in Beirut last Wednesday, coinciding with the cease-fire’s implementation. He co-chairs the monitoring and enforcement mechanism alongside Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to President Joe Biden who helped broker the agreement. Hochstein will serve as the civilian co-chair until a permanent civilian representative is appointed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The mechanism, managed by the United States, includes the Lebanese Armed Forces, the IDF, UNIFIL (the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) and France. Jeffers brings extensive experience from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and has received numerous commendations for his service. Under the cease-fire terms, Hezbollah is prohibited from maintaining weapons south of the Litani River. However, Hezbollah operatives residing in villages in the area may return under the guise of civilians. Meanwhile, the IDF is required to withdraw to Israeli territory within 60 days, during which the Lebanese Army is expected to deploy in southern Lebanon and along the border to prevent weapons smuggling and Hezbollah’s rearmament. Israel has also agreed to enter negotiations over the land border with Lebanon. The international enforcement mechanism will monitor compliance, while Israel retains the right to act against violations. A side letter from Washington assured Israel of its ability to enforce the agreement unilaterally if necessary. According to the letter, Israel and the U.S. will share sensitive intelligence on violations, with the U.S. authorized to share some information with the Lebanese government or the enforcement mechanism. The letter explicitly grants Israel the right to respond to violations in southern Lebanon and address broader threats elsewhere if Lebanon cannot or will not act. Any such actions must be coordinated with the U.S. Israeli reconnaissance flights over Lebanon will continue for intelligence purposes but are restricted to avoid breaking the sound barrier. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk1fwztxkg	2024-11-30T13:39:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/Bkb5QbYmyx/Bkb5QbYmyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
From deals with third-world countries to dubious middlemen: Insid...	With US supplies limited, embargoes imposed and competition from Ukraine, IDF turns to third-world deals, shady brokers and billions in spending to maintain its firepower as Israel races to replenish depleted weapons stockpiles after over a year of war In the dead of night on September 12, 1990, the wheels of an El Al Boeing 747 hit the airport runway in Israel with history in the hold: Two Apache attack helicopters, folded up and dismantled, ready for assembly. By the following morning, they were ready for their maiden flight. It's been 34 years. Apache helicopters have taken part in all wars and operations ever since but eventually became worn out. Although the Apaches were fixed up and upgraded over the years, the more advanced Saraf was introduced and the Apache’s days seemed numbered. When the Cobra squadron bases closed down, the IDF was left with only two active combat helicopter squadrons—the 190th and 113th Apache squadrons. Last year, the IAF was preparing to close them too. The army preferred long-range stealth bombers, like the F-13 that can get as far as Iran, and continue bolstering the attack UAV array. A 'flying tank' like the Apache sounds a bit outdated, more suitable for the wars of yesteryear. Then came October 7. That morning, there were four Apache helicopters on standby at the Ramat David Air Base. They took off to the Gaza border region at around 7:00 a.m. Half an hour later, more and more helicopters were sent off. The Apaches were called from one place to the next. 'Every five or six minutes, I was getting another call-out,' says 113th squadron commander, Lt. Col. A. They participated in the battles at kibbutzim, the defense of bases that had been attacked, and in efforts to repel the waves of looters and terrorists from Gaza. At some battle sites, their roles were decisive. These critical hours proved that there really is no substitute for these 'flying tanks' and the pilots who can see what’s happening to the infantry and armored corps on the ground, and communicate with them directly. Nukhba terrorists’ videos show they were afraid of almost nothing. The noise of the combat helicopters, however, permeated them with fear. Apaches have been in the skies almost continuously since then. The use of attack helicopters, including in the ground operation in Lebanon, has been so intensive that the IAF has taken the extraordinary measure of returning even retired Apaches for their sixth decade of active duty. Closing down squadrons? Outdated helicopters? If this war has proven anything, it’s that we need more Apache helicopters. But this is where the problems start. The Defense Ministry asked the Americans to urgently purchase more Apaches, even used ones. They just need to get here. The Americans agreed, but told Israel to wait in line at Boeing which manufactures them. It’ll be a few years. The IDF looked into whether, nonetheless, anything might be done to speed things up and free up a few Apache 'slots' (production line orders dedicated to specific countries). In other words, arrange it so that some other country waits a little and, in its place, considering its urgency, the IDF receives whatever that country ordered. It turned out that Boeing had 300 Apache helicopters in various stages of production earmarked for the U.S. Army. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Brown, however, turned down the IDF’s request to transfer the helicopters. Poland, for example, that had put in its order before October 7, would be receiving 90 new Apaches. The IDF, on the other hand, wouldn’t be getting such helicopters anytime soon. This chase for Apaches is just one of many examples. A year and a month into this intensive war, Israel needs almost everything—shells, tanks, F-15 one-ton bombs. To this end, a transglobal race has kicked off in efforts to procure as many armaments as possible, as quickly as possible, for as little money as possible. It’s just that all of this is very complicated indeed. Some countries have imposed arms embargos on Israel, and some manufacturers are demanding exorbitant prices. And there’s always the stiff competition with other world conflicts, chiefly the war in Ukraine. Take, for example, the IDF’s desperate need for tanks and artillery shells: When the ground operation kicked off, the guys in the tanks and the Artillery Corps fired almost with abandon. If a target looked suspicious, they’d shoot. But very quickly, around December, the ground forces started keeping an eye on their arsenals, also reserved for a full ground operation in Lebanon. Israel then asked the U.S. for American shells. They agreed and the shipment showed up within weeks. At the same time, to build up an arsenal, the defense establishment also asked a Balkan state to immediately purchase thousands of shells. 'The price they quoted us was high. When we got back to them, hoping to negotiate a better price, they upped the price by 50% to the vicinity of $4,500 for an individual shell, and $6,000 for a cannon shell. These are very high prices' says a senior ranking defense establishment official familiar with these efforts. 'They also demanded a downpayment. We came back home to think about it and assess the option. We then got a call from them, telling us we’d missed our chance and that Ukraine had paid and bought the lot before us.' 'We go to countries you wouldn’t believe an Israeli has ever set foot in,' says a defense establishment official. 'Countries with whom we have no diplomatic relations, including Muslim states on all continents. You’d never believe who’s agreed to sell to us, but with one key condition.' So, from the start of last year through to right now, IDF officers and Defense Ministry officials have been galivanting around the world on procurement trips. According to various reports, some of these countries, such as Serbia, which has become Israel’s main arms supplier over the past year, have good relations with Russia, and would, it seems, rather supply to Israel than to Ukraine. Others, like India, which has relations with Iran and hundreds of millions of Muslims in its country, sell arms to Israel despite internal difficulties. According to foreign reports, India has become Israel’s main provider of explosive materials, selling thousands of tons to the IDF Engineering Corps. Oh, and these reports were published in Spain, which doesn’t shy away from harming Israel in any way it can. This is yet one more example illustrating how this race is driven by two things: Politics and money, and not necessarily in that order. 'We go to countries you wouldn’t believe an Israeli has ever set foot in,' says a defense establishment official. 'Countries with whom we have no diplomatic relations, including Muslim states on all continents. You’d never believe who’s agreed to sell to us, but with one key condition.' What condition is that? 'That we don’t reveal their identities.' Some countries not only insist on complete secrecy, or demand outrageous prices. They also take advantage of Israel’s predicament, demanding a return they were very unlikely to have gotten in the past, including the reciprocal sale of Israeli-manufactured advanced boutique technology. A third-world country, never mind from which continent, or whether it uses the Cyrillic or Arabic script, demanded, and received, military technology that may include advanced UAVs, computerized warfare systems, etc. in exchange for the most basic needs such as gunpowder, shells, explosive devices and other low-tech military equipment. According to the sources who spoke to Ynet's sister publication Yedioth Aharonoth, some of these deals weren’t entirely formal, almost under the table. With Defense Ministry approval, but at lightning speed. This is what it’s like in Israel’s new race for arms, which has itself become a battle. The arms justify the means, even via dubious sources, even with far-flung countries. We just need something to shoot. The problem: The prolongation of the war During the week following October 7, IDF officers opened up the emergency arsenal storerooms of two Northen and Southern Command reserves divisions (146th and 252nd respectively) and their faces dropped. Alongside the shortage of equipment, such as walkie-talkies, ceramic vests, weapons and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles not fit for use, they realized that over 50% of commanders didn’t have the night-vision devices (NVDs), needed for the upcoming ground operation. These instruments are critical for any modern ground warfare, and Hamas and Hezbollah already had them. There are only a few companies in the world that know how to manufacture NVDs meeting military standards. 'Elbit is one such company, and we knew that it already had a deal finalized at the time to supply the American Army with 10,000 bino and monocular NVDs,' says an officer who was involved. 'So, we swiftly asked the American Army if they would turn this deal over to us. They explained, however, that only a presidential decree could release the equipment that was already in U.S. Army warehouses. We paid $127 million for these NVDs, got the presidential decree and flew them straight to officers in Gaza as, even on those first days, we knew we were going for a long war. That was one of many complex measures we’ve taken along the line to equip the army.' And the root cause of the problem is the long war: Over the years, the IDF had readied for short wars of a few weeks. 'Short wars were a national necessity,' a senior ranking officer tells us. 'The Israeli economy can’t take, and may consequently collapse from, a long war. The Israeli public, on whose civil-Zionist sentiment the IDF’s strength as a reservist army rests, will erode accordingly. The political echelon instructed the IDF to prepare for a short, deadly war with powerful opening strikes. Bang-and-we’re-done, if you like—like in the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014.' With this as a working assumption, one might rely on importing weapons and armaments from other countries. 'With hindsight, for our military buildup, we had developed an existential defense dependence on the United States and countries such as Germany. This relies on an extremely dangerous amalgam of foreign products,' says a senior defense official. 'It has to change, even if the costs are high.' But the war dragged on and the arsenals were depleting. Left with no choice, the IDF was forced to economize its arms use. And this comes at a price. Forces operating now for weeks in Jabaliya are getting less UAV time. Tanks are going out on operations with limited shells. They also have fewer D9 bulldozers. Some of the equipment has been transferred to Lebanon, some has been hit or worn out in Gaza. There are also fewer using precision weapons, such as suicide drones or precision steel-penetrating laser-guided mortars. On the ground, there’s no real difference for now. 'Personally, I believe that statistically, artillery and direct tank fire are more effective than expensive precision weapons,' says an officer fighting in northern Gaza. 'Killing a terrorist using a tank shell or sniper, rather than a missile fired from a UAV, is regarded as more ‘professional’.' The various configurations of explosive materials are also being carefully managed by the IDF. 'Only last month, IDF forces used 100 tons of gunpowder to blow up a network of Hezbollah tunnels in the north. We’ve collapsed hundreds of miles of tunnels in Gaza and have still only reached half,' says a senior officer. 'Where do you think we have so much gunpowder from?' There’s only one answer to this question: From wherever possible, and as quickly as we can. The defense establishment has been forced into 'barter' deals with foreign armies, and speeding up weapons inspection that used to take months. In one case, a huge shipment of explosives arrived for the ground forces in the dead of night from a country whose military equipment isn’t known for its world standards. Instead of a lengthy, ordered, inspection, the material was transferred directly to Testing Ground 24, by the Rishon Lezion coastline. Technological and Logistics Directorate (ATAL) officers test-fired a few hundred of these weapons in the field, tested to see if they met regulations, took X-ray photographs of them, and immediately sent them to soldiers waiting for them avidly on the battlefield. 'Some people in the U.S. Army are in love with Israel, and support us in ways it’s hard to describe. Like homies.' In these ways, thousands of weapons from overseas have been assimilated into the IDF over the past year. 'Yes,' the IDF will admit, 'the haste meant that even when some weapons failed preliminary testing and weren’t sent to the soldiers, most of the weapons we bought, including advanced aerial weapons that we received from countries you wouldn’t believe would agree to sell to us—were in working order. To arm the IDF, we found ourselves in places you’d never imagine.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In these desperate times, the defense establishment turned to 'jobbers'—international arms dealers specializing in brokering indirect deals. 'With the international arms race, everyone’s doing it,' says the defense establishment. 'Not all jobbers are reliable, but sometimes, we have no choice.' A senior defense official familiar with the matter explains how it works: 'The Ukrainians don’t pay for many of their arms purchases. Someone else—various third parties—will buy for them, and this affects our arms race.' The official also recalls an unusual situation this past year illustrating the dangers of working with wheeler-dealer arms traders: The IDF requested to quickly purchase artillery fuzes for a critical weapon. This fuze didn’t exist in Israel’s weapons industry and defense establishment procurement officials checked with these 'jobbers.' One jobber told the Israelis that there was a manufacturing facility in a certain country (naming a third-world country) that has this fuze. The condition, however, was a 25-year Israeli investment in this facility.' So, what did you do? 'We quickly sent a representative of ours. After spending a whole day looking for this weapons factory—in a very exotic country—he met the local broker, and then went looking for the plant.' What did he find? 'Mostly ruins. When he got back to Israel, he told us that there were no fuzes there, no warehouses and no factory—but at least the food was great. It’s important to understand that we’re leaving no stone unturned to find weapons and weapons substitutes for the IDF, and we need to investigate any rumor in this crazy market. States buy from wherever they can. We had cases where we purchased weapons that we learned were faulty when they got to Israel, and we had to send them back.' The defense establishment stresses that most arms deals are between governments, but that the arms race and relentless pressure to arm the IDF, means there are individual cases purchasing arms from 'a selling, but state, source.' This essentially refers to an arms dealer on the government’s behalf. Third-world African countries, for example, with arms they had once bought sitting in warehouses, are now offering to sell them. Within weeks, these 'goods' will reach a Givati battalion in Jabaliya in Gaza or an Engineering Corps soldier in Maroun El Ras in Lebanon. 'Every ‘hand’ along the way, obviously makes the product more expensive. We had cases where they asked for a 150% downpayment as they’d heard on the news that the IDF now needed more weapons,' says a defense official. 'The market’s gone so crazy that arms dealers approached us at the start of the war telling us that they knew about warehouses of shell fuzes in Switzerland—despite there being no such thing in Switzerland. There are arms dealers, primarily Israelis, who won’t bluff us. They’re mainly ex-Israeli defense, and their reputation is important to them. Some dealers will sell their own grandmother for the chance of another deal selling 5 tons of TNT.' So, what do you do? 'In efforts to overcome this and speed up deals, we’ve learned how to work with several sources and dealers simultaneously.' Defense officials sent to these countries to procure weapons for the IDF say that some of these countries are not officially on our side. 'These might be Muslim countries that, on one hand, will firmly condemn Israel and provide safe haven to terrorist organizations,' says one official, 'and on the other, sell us weapons without batting an eyelid, so long as we maintain full discretion.' Why do we have to buy from these countries? 'The Americans have arms, good for decades, scattered across the globe. CENTCOM (United States Central Command) has a great deal of weapons, and they’ve been opening up these arsenals to give us military equipment over the past year. There were times they found they’d miscalculated and didn’t have enough for themselves, claiming ‘they too are at war.' Generally speaking, however, they go out of their way to help us with supplies. We don’t get everything from the U.S. though.' American homies And still, Israel’s main weapons provider is the United States. The diplomatic fall-out and lack of trust between the Israeli government and the Democratic U.S. administration hardly improves—to say the least—Israel’s armament in the throes of war. So, to secure Israeli armaments, senior officials are sometimes forced into using personal relationships they’ve developed with their U.S. Army colleagues. Some of this aid borders on begging. That American aircraft carrier remained in the Middle East in recent months, only thanks to a personal request by a senior IDF officer to CENTCOM officers and Gen. Michael Kurilla, widely viewed as very sympathetic to Israel’s needs. Senior ranking officers tell us of friendly WhatsApp conversations with their American counterparts culminating in whole containers of explosive materials earmarked for U.S. forces being shipped to the IDF from explosive materials superpower Taiwan, or from Guam in the Pacific Ocean that’s under U.S. military control. 'CENTCOM officers release armaments wherever they can,' says a senior ranking IDF official. 'They also help with the transportation by land or sea, and speed up maritime and aerial procedures to Israel. This is global in many senses. Some people in the U.S. Army are in love with Israel, and support us in ways it’s hard to describe. Like homies.' One of these homies is CENTCOM deputy commander, three-star general Brad Cooper. 'Almost each week, Cooper will receive a request for aid from the IDF. He’ll contact his friends in the U.S. Army and send messages to senior ranking U.S. officers across the globe to see who can, in a matter of days, transfer to the IDF certain weapons from arsenals scattered across the globe.' At the same time, however, IDF is also feeling the reverberations from the Washington-Jerusalem political fallout and President Joe Biden’s veto of some of the shipments. At the beginning of this year, a routine shipment of 3,000 JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) bombs for the Air Force was supposed to arrive. This is a kit of sorts that transforms a 'dumb' bomb designated to be simply thrown into the air on a ballistic flightpath, into a 'smart' bomb, self-guiding itself to its predetermined target. Approximately half the shipment consisted of half-ton bombs, the rest weighing one ton. The payment to Boeing, the manufacturer, was made in shekels, rather than dollars from the aid monies. The IDF swiftly leased a ship to carry this shipment from a port near New York to Ashdod. At the last minute, however, the White House ordered halting the shipment. IDF top brass were left astounded, and only after weeks of persuasion, chiefly by former defense minister Yoav Gallant opposite his Pentagon counterpart, was the shipment approved—in part. Only the half-ton bombs were sent to Israel. The Americans officially claimed that the one-ton bombs might cause extraordinary peripheral damage, killing uninvolved civilians mainly in Gaza. These containers of bombs, for which the Israeli tax-payer had paid millions of shekels, are meanwhile at an East Coast port. The army is now looking for storage space for them to stop them from rusting. Another, no less critical, shipment stuck in the U.S. is that of 130 D9 diggers for the Engineering Corps, still awaiting transportation from the Caterpillar plant to Israel. This vast shipment is pending approval from State Department officials. Engineering Corps heavy-duty equipment personnel desperately need these vehicles that have proven decisive in this war. 'We have to change our way of thinking' The U.S. administration has more problems than its political fallout with Israel: It has committed to supplying Ukraine with arms too, and the needs of Ukraine’s army and those of the IDF invariably clash. Everyone needs artillery shells. Right now. This was Gallant’s first conversation with his American counterpart, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, in the first hours of October 7. Understanding that Israel was going to war, Gallant asked Austin for a few urgent things. One amazed the secretary of defense. 'Fifty thousand artillery shells?' he asked. 'Is that what you’re short of right now? You have far more than that. The shells are already in Germany on their way to Ukraine.' These were the 50,000 American artillery shells stored in emergency U.S. Army warehouses in Israel for any emergency that may arise. Like the war in Gaza. Truth be told, far more shells—around 250,000—were stored mainly in secret warehouses in southern Israel. Back in 2022, however, Israel received an urgent request to approve transferring these shells to Ukraine. Israel didn’t foresee a major military conflict at the time. The Russians were pounding the Ukrainians and Jerusalem agreed the shells would leave from here. Two hundred thousand shells had already reached Ukraine. Another 50,000 were already in Germany, also about to be shipped out to Ukraine. With American approval, Gallant managed to halt that shipment and bring it back to Israel. What will happen down the line with the shells? Defense Ministry envoys are running around the world to find more. In February, Elbit was asked to increase its local artillery shell production lines. Elbit is in the planning stages of setting up a plant in the Negev to add to its factories in the Sharon and northern Israel. And then? Artillery personnel will have to be careful about firing any 155 mm projectile. The U.S. is, obviously, not the world’s only arms producer, but buying from other countries is an extremely politically charged affair. We have the Western countries who’ve declared arms embargos on Israel. In some cases, it’s for show: Canada declared an embargo, while in practice only ever supplied a tiny quantity of arms to Israel. The French embargo, on the other hand, does damage Israeli armament efforts. 'We never depended on the French anyway,' says a defense establishment official. 'Their leadership harbors a burning hatred toward Israel.' Italy, which Israel believed would support Israel following the election of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, halted its supply of cannon shells for Israeli Navy vessels and spare parts for them at the start of the war. Israel purchased these weapons—no surprise—from the U.S. The Defense Ministry is making efforts to increase Israeli production as an alternative to this dependency. Germany, as mentioned, is one major arms supplier to the IDF that continues to support Israel, as do Hungary and the Czech Republic. Despite Britain officially publishing a black list of weapons export licenses to Israel that have been frozen, in practice, some weapons are still being sold and are reaching Israel. This mainly includes components for avionics systems and parts for weapons production lines for Israeli ground forces. And what about all the rest? Like we said, Israel will have to get them on its own. Here’s another story illustrating the problems of Israeli arms producers’ dependency on foreign sources, in a country such as Israel. At the beginning of this year, an Israeli arms manufacturer noticed signs suggesting that a company supplying it with explosive raw materials was caving into pressure and was about to cut off supply. 'We’re talking about tens of tons of various kinds of explosive raw materials, without which we can’t produce thousands of missiles, bombs, interceptors and a wide range of other weapons for the IDF. And this was in the middle of a year of war,' says an official familiar with the incident. So, what did you do? 'Even before this boycott was official, we managed to quickly turn to another supplier and seal a new deal so as not to find ourselves stuck with an acute shortage of weapons for the soldiers. These are things that have to be spotted early on. You need to act quickly. If you don’t, you’re in a huge mess.' Army and arms manufacturers sources say that one lesson learned from this new arms race is that Israel will need to set up a huge national stockpile of explosives for manufacturing various IDF weapons to last years ahead. The IDF’s 23 attachés across the globe have also been recruited to the procurement campaign. By the first month of the war, the Defense Ministry headquarters gave them a list, instructing them to turn to their respective local defense ministries and activate the connections they’d cultivated. It was now money time. 'This is how I found myself dropping ‘multi-national’ bombs,' says a senior pilot. The fuze is from Asia, the GPS kit from some a German warehouse, and the weapon’s central component is from an American warehouse in Japan.' The Planning Directorate’s foreign relations department made efforts to free up supply lines that had never been open to Israel, including countries officially condemning Israel. 'There’s a country that agreed to sell us certain weaponry, only on certain transportation conditions,' says an IDF officer. So, what did you do? 'We were forced to transport the shipment with connections between cargo planes and trucks and ships jaunting from one place to the next. Some of the equipment arrived after ‘14 working days,' but some of it sailed between far-off continents for months before reaching the guy in the tank in Jabaliya.' The two men running this complex round-the-world effort are Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Amir Baram and head of the Planning and Force Build-up Directorate Maj. Gen. Eyal Harel. They have a clear division of responsibilities: Baram deals with the army internally—who needs what and when; Harel tries to get hold of it from foreign armies and governments. Defense Ministry procurement personnel are also trying to untangle bureaucratic obstacles and pacify treasury personnel. The game is mainly about speed. With all the conflicts across the globe, lots of people will be jumping at the chance to buy a single ton of explosive materials. 'We need to wake up. We’re not alone in the world,' says a senior IDF official. 'Arms manufacturers’ production lines open up and are snatched up in the blink of an eye. You must understand: even if Resolution 1701 is implemented tomorrow, Hezbollah retreats north of the Litani, there’s a full hostage deal in Gaza and cease-fire prevails over the Middle East, we’ll still only be at the start of the IDF’s military buildup for years, decades to come. It’s also clear that it won’t be the same IDF as we had before October 7.' The IDF is wary of the delay in the procurement of new 'Reshef' Sa’ar ships manufactured for the Navy by Israel Shipyards Ltd., replacing the outdated Nirit 4.5. The acquisition deal for JLVT (known in the IDF as 'Para') tank parts, designed mainly to replace the old M113 APC, is moving forward. The concern, however, as mentioned, is for urgent armament. This includes purchasing hundreds of Tamir interceptors for Iron Dome, Arrow and David’s Sling batteries. 'The Iranians aren’t stupid,' says an IDF official about the need for interceptors. 'Between rounds, they are tweaking their methods and trying to manipulate our aerial defense systems—be against fire from Iran, Lebanon, Yemen or Iraq.' So, what do you do? 'We have to ease up regulations, change our way of thinking. We have years of fighting ahead, and on more than one front.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1tefly71g	2024-11-30T13:07:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/03/05/BJggZzgB6T/BJggZzgB6T_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Zamir Burke, 20, combat engineer squad commander in 401st Brigade's 601st Engineering Battalion, from Beit Shemesh, fell in Jabaliya; IDF aircraft destroy central Gaza rocket launch site poised to fire at Israeli territory The IDF reported on Saturday that Staff Sgt. Zamir Burke, 20, a combat engineer squad commander in the 401st Armored Brigade's 601st Engineering Battalion, from Beit Shemesh, was killed in combat in the northern Gaza Strip town of Jabaliya. Another soldier from the battalion was seriously wounded by an anti-tank missile during the incident. Separately, a 46th Armored Battalion soldier from the same brigade was severely wounded in southern Gaza, and a soldier from the 7th Armored Brigade's 82nd Battalion was severely wounded during an operational accident in northern Israel, which the IDF is investigating. Meanwhile, the IDF reported that an Israeli aircraft destroyed a rocket launch site in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, which it said was poised to fire at Israeli territory. According to the IDF, rockets were launched from the site following the strike but did not cross into Israeli territory. Earlier in the day, a rocket alert was sounded in Netiv HaAsara near Gaza, but the IDF later confirmed it was a false alarm. Separately, the World Central Kitchen (WCK) organization announced the suspension of its operations in Gaza after several staff members were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle. The IDF confirmed that one of the fatalities, Hazmi Kadih, was involved in the October 7 massacre at Kibbutz Nir Oz. Kadih had been employed by WCK.

Syrian rebels capture Aleppo International Airport amid rapid gai...	Russian and Syrian forces continue to launch airstrikes to repel rebel advances, as death toll rises to 327; Syrian regime says preparing counteroffensive while army forces reportedly withdraw from Hama Rebel forces in Syria claimed to have captured Aleppo International Airport on Saturday afternoon, marking another major gain for opponents to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's second-largest city. Earlier, the Syrian regime had suspended all flights and closed the airport. The rebels, reporting dramatic progress, said they now control more than half of Aleppo. The Syrian and Russian air forces responded with heavy airstrikes targeting rebel positions in Aleppo, including those of the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition war monitor. The Observatory reported that the death toll in the clashes has risen to 327, including Ahmed Khader Ali, a senior security official for the Assad regime in Aleppo. The rebels also announced a new front in the Hama region, claiming to have captured six villages. Rebel forces have also been moving southward in the Idlib region, reportedly seizing the city of Maarat al-Numan and now control the entire Idlib Governorate, according to rebel sources cited by Reuters. The Syrian Defense Ministry acknowledged that rebels had entered significant portions of Aleppo but pledged a concentrated counteroffensive. 'Syrian forces will take all measures to ensure the safety of Aleppo residents and restore control,' the Assad regime said in a statement. Meanwhile, Syrian forces are retreating from the city of Hama in the northwest toward Homs, according to reports in Syria. The offensive, led by HTS and supported by other rebel groups, is the largest assault against the Syrian army since a 2020 cease-fire in northern Syria. HTS, formerly Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, holds territory in Idlib and parts of neighboring Hama, Aleppo and Latakia governorates. The rapid gains by the rebels have prompted strong accusations from Iran, a key ally of President Assad. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a call with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, claimed the offensive was part of an 'American-Zionist plan to destabilize the region.' The rebel advance comes as Assad's forces, backed by Russian air power and Iranian support, continue to face challenges in maintaining control over northern Syria, where much of the decade-long civil war has been centered. According to Ynet senior military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai, the surprise attack by Sunni rebels in Aleppo is likely strongly tied to the cease-fire between Israel and the Shiite Hezbollah terror group. Following the cease-fire declaration in Lebanon, it seems that Syrian rebels, in consultation with Turkey, concluded that this was the right moment to strike—while Hezbollah, Iran's other proxies and Revolutionary Guard forces in Syria are at their weakest and focused on aiding Lebanon. As such, this was seen as an opportune time to hit the Assad regime. The 2011 uprising against Syrian President Assad was met with brutal suppression, plunging the country into a civil war that continues more than a decade later. Assad managed to cling to power with critical support from Russia and Iran, and his forces’ recapture of Aleppo in 2016 marked a decisive moment in solidifying his regime. The rebels’ offensive, coinciding with the cease-fire in Lebanon, comes amid shifting power dynamics in Syria, fueled by escalating clashes between Israel and Iran’s proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amid the regional turmoil, Israel has ramped up its airstrikes targeting Iranian forces in Syria. According to UN figures, Israel has conducted more than 116 strikes in the country, resulting in over 100 fatalities. Meanwhile, hostilities have driven around half a million people to cross from Lebanon into Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylt6poqke	2024-11-30T09:03:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/SyYDTwuXkl/SyYDTwuXkl_0_177_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Why Mikati failed to save Lebanon from Hezbollah, despite hopes	Long allied with the terror group and Syria the western educated billionaire promised to bring Lebanon out of economic crisis but remains too weak to bring any change on the ground Lebanon's care-taker prime minister Najib Mukati was chosen to head the government in Beirut in 2021, until a new cabinet could be agreed on. As Lebanon's wealthiest man, many hoped he would be able to save the failing state from economic collapse. 'Mikati attempted to build his name as a central figure who could bring Lebanon out of its financial crisis,' says Dr. Ido Zelkovitz, head of the Middle East Studies Program at the Jezreel Valley Academic College. 'He had the background in business and education.' He was a graduate of the American University in Beirut, went on to study business at INSEAD in France and later on at Harvard. But his alliance with the Syrian regime and with Hezbollah has been long-lasting. He first came to power as an interim leader in 2005 after the assassination of then prime minister Rafik Hariri. Lebanese public outrage at the murder that was carried out by Hezbollah at the direction of Damascus, brought down the government and Mikati who was a member of parliament, was called to step in until elections were held. In 2011 after the government of Saad Hariri, the slain prime minister's son, also fell, he once again was called to lead but was forced out two years later as opposition to the Syrian involvement in Lebanon, once again reached a boiling point. In 2021, Mikati was supported by most political parties in Parliament, including Hezbollah, to take the reigns of government once again. He said he aimed to form a cabinet of professionals without political affiliation, to bring the necessary economic reforms to the struggling nation, already in dire economic difficulties. To the Lebanese public, however, he was a member of the corrupt elite that caused the crisis. The local currency crashed, inflation peaked, food prices spiked and according to the UN, the poverty rate stood at 78%. Power outages were a daily occurrence and fuel was in short supply. Mikati called on the Arab world to assist. 'As long as he is indebted to Hezbollah, he is part of the obstacles on the path of economic recovery,' Zelkovitz says. Hezbollah is the reason that the West and Sunni Arab nations refrain from investing in Lebanon. Mikat, therefore could not forge the ties that would bring such investments. 'He is a band aid on the problem, at best,' Says Eitan Ishai from the department of Islamic and Middle Eastern studies at the Hebrew University. 'Although he is bias to one side, his lack of charisma allows him to be prime minister. He comes from a well-known Sunni family, has experience in politics and is convenient for Hezbollah. Lebanon has been in economic, political and social crisis since 2019 and this war came out of nowhere. Mikati will bring no great change.' During the months of war, the care-taker prime minister was a vocal critic of Israel. He engaged Arab and international leaders to advance a cease-fire but had no real influence and it was speaker of parliament Nabih Berri, who represented Hezbollah in those efforts. After the cease-fire agreement came into effect Mikati called on residents of South Lebanon not to return to their villages until the Lebanese army tells them to. His calls were ignored, and convoys of displaced villagers were seen heading south waving Hezbollah flags. Despite the years-long alliance with Hezbollah, on one thing Mikati and the terror-group do not agree and that is Iran's involvement in Lebanon. In October, Iran's speaker of parliament Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaftold the French Le Figaro, that his country was willing to negotiate over the implementation of UN resolution 1701, passed at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Mikat was outraged and summoned the Iranian Charge D'affaires for a meeting to clarify the comments. 'This is an outrageous intervention in Lebanese internal affairs and an attempt to assert unacceptable control,' he said. But according to Zelkovitz, Mikati understands that Hezbollah does have the support of some Lebanese and he would not try to diminish its political standing after the military beating it sustained in the war. 'He wants to keep the Shi'ite Sunni consensus,' he says. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: If he could disarm Hezbollah, I believe he would do so happily. He is first of all a patriot who want to bridge the gap between sectors,' Zelkowitz says. 'I don't think the Lebanese army could disarm Hezbollah and there is a strong affiliation between the military and the Iran-backed group. American military equipment and technology, especially invested in internal security in the Lebanese army could find its way into Hezbollah's hands.' Lebanon has been without a president for the past two years after Michel Aoun stepped down in October 2022. The political agreement between the religious groups in Lebanon states that the president would come from the Christian community and the prim minister from the Sunni Muslim sector. This has led to a political stalemate with no sector able to force its position on others in a way that would alter the reality on the ground. Since Aoun's departure, Mikati and Berri have been trying to lead in the vacuum left behind. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjrve5omkx	2024-11-30T04:42:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/15/H1eU11qRjykx/H1eU11qRjykx_1_314_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Biden buys book on Israel-Palestine conflict by critical historia...	The Hundred Years' War on Palestine by historian Rashid Khalidi describes the conflict as a colonial war against the indigenous people of Palestine; author most prominent anti-Israel voice especially after Hamas massacre U.S. President Joe Biden was spotted leaving a book store on Friday, after he purchased The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017, a book by Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi. Biden played out a traditional practice of shopping on Black Friday, launching the American custom of shopping for the holiday season. Khalidi has been vocal in in criticism of Israel especially after the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre and said earlier in the year, before Biden pulled out of the presidential race, that he would not vote to reelect the president. He is considered one of the more prominent voices critical of Israel. In a recent interview he said the political motivations of Israel are unclear. They conduct ethnic cleansing, push the population of northern Gaza to the south but what their ultimate aim is remains unclear. Khalidi's book that was published in 2020 offers and critical and a considered controversial analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where he accuses Israel of conducting a 'colonialist war against the native Palestinians.' According to Khalidi's book, modern Palestinian history can best be understood as a colonialist war to force them out of their homeland. Khalidi, a short summery of the book says, the war was first forged by the Zionist movement and later by the state of Israel but with the backing of the United States and Great Britain, the superpowers of the time. Khalidi was also critical of president elect Donald Trump who in his first term in office, moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, calling his policies discriminatory of the Palestinians. He said the conflicts between settlers and indigenous people always end in one of three ways: By complete defeat of the indigenous population, as was the case in north America, by the colonialists being pushed out, as was in Algeria or by reconciliation and compromise, as was the case in South Africa after the fall of the apartheid regime, in Zimbabwe and Ireland. He wrote that the popular resistance – as he calls the Palestinian conflict – will continue and praised the first intifada as an extraordinary example of an uprising against oppression that can be considered the first victory of the Palestinians in the colonialist war that began in 1917. The second intifada, that resulted in the construction of the partition wall between the West Bank and Israel, Khalidi the greatest failure of the Palestinian national movement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryshi8d7jg	2024-11-30T00:16:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/BJh3zSOXke/BJh3zSOXke_0_177_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

As Syrian rebels sweep into Aleppo, army closes airport and roads...	Russia promises Assad regime extra military aid to thwart the rebels; sources say new hardware would start arriving in the next 72 hours Syrian authorities closed Aleppo airport as well as all roads leading into the city on Saturday, three military sources told Reuters, as rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad said they had reached the heart of Aleppo. The opposition fighters, led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, carried out a surprise sweep through government-held towns this week and reached Aleppo nearly a decade after having been forced out by Assad and his allies. Russia, one of Assad's key allies, has promised Damascus extra military aid to thwart the rebels, two military sources said, adding new hardware would start arriving in the next 72 hours. The Syrian army has been told to follow 'safe withdrawal' orders from the main areas of the city that the rebels have entered, three army sources said. The rebels began their incursion on Wednesday and by late Friday an operations room representing the offensive said they were sweeping through various neighbourhoods of Aleppo. They are returning to the city for the first time since 2016, when Assad and his allies Russia, Iran, and regional Shi'ite militias retook it, with the insurgents agreeing to withdraw after months of bombardment and siege. Mustafa Abdul Jaber, a commander in the Jaish al-Izza rebel brigade, said their speedy advance this week had been helped by a lack of Iran-backed manpower in the broader Aleppo province. Iran's allies in the region have suffered a series of blows at the hands of Israel as the Gaza war has expanded through the Middle East. The opposition fighters have said the campaign was in response to stepped-up strikes in recent weeks against civilians by the Russian and Syrian air force on areas in rebel-held Idlib, and to preempt any attacks by the Syrian army. Opposition sources in touch with Turkish intelligence said Turkey, which supports the rebels, had given a green light to the offensive. But Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson Oncu Keceli said on Friday that Turkey sought to avoid greater instability in the region and had warned recent attacks undermined de-escalation agreements. The attack is the biggest since March 2020, when Russia and Turkey agreed to a deal to de-escalate the conflict. Civilians killed in fighting On Friday, Syrian state television denied rebels had reached the city and said Russia was providing Syria's military with air support. The Syrian military said it was fighting back against the attack and had inflicted heavy losses on the insurgents in the countryside of Aleppo and Idlib. David Carden, U.N. Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, said: 'We're deeply alarmed by the situation unfolding in northwest Syria.'

Can Jews sill safely walk the streets?	ILTV's Insider explores how a Jewish safety crisis escalated and what can be done about it A young rabbi was murdered by terrorists in the United Arab Emirates. Canada's former justice minister was targeted in an Iranian assassination plot. Violent protests, filled with chants of 'death to the Jews' and calls to burn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, erupted in Montreal. A recent survey by the Jewish Federations of North America revealed alarming statistics: nearly 25% of Jews experienced antisemitic incidents in the past year, and 75% overheard or saw antisemitic comments in person or online. Less than 100 years after six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, it is beginning to feel unsafe to walk the streets—anywhere in the world—even in Jewish communities, even in the Jewish state. Is there a Jewish safety crisis? How did it escalate, and what can be done to stop it? These were the questions explored on ILTV’s Insider last week. 'We have seen a significant rise in Jew-hating attacks, especially—but not only—since the October 7 attack last year,' said Dov Ben-Shimon, chief executive officer of the Community Security Service in America. 'But our adversaries don’t define us. Jewish life in the U.S. is still vibrant, compelling, and dynamic. At the same time, there is this wave of hate—this hatred of Jews that comes from the right and the left, from Islamic extremists and more—that threatens our people and our community. We have to be prepared now more than ever to stand up to that hate and evil.' Ben-Shimon explained that antisemitism has escalated in North America for several reasons: 'hate-reinforcing algorithms' on social media, an increasing number of individuals who hate Jews as Jews and Zionists and are not deterred from acting, and inadequate security measures to protect Jewish communities. On November 21, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad emissary in the United Arab Emirates, was kidnapped and violently murdered. Ben-Shimon warned that such an event 'could absolutely happen' in the United States as well. He emphasized that one of the best ways to prevent such tragedies is by building local security networks in every Jewish community, regardless of size. 'It means training volunteers to act as force multipliers—the first line of defense in every community—to identify problems and connect with law enforcement and security teams,' Ben-Shimon said. 'It also means stronger communication, risk assessments, and training programs, especially on situational awareness, emergency procedures, and threat identification.' However, as Ben-Shimon and another guest, documentary filmmaker Pierre Rehov, pointed out, antisemitism is not a new phenomenon. In his latest work, 'Pogroms,' Rehov delves into the historical context of the October 7 attack and its roots. He attributes it to an alliance between Islamists, the KGB, and the Nazis, all driven by a shared goal to eradicate Jews and Israel. Despite these escalating threats, there remains no unified Western response, argued Vivian Bercovici, former Canadian ambassador to Israel and founder of the State of Tel Aviv website. 'I think that we see a lot of ostriching—burying heads in the sand and pretending it’ll pass, it’ll go away,' Bercovici told ILTV. Building on Rehov’s analysis, Bercovici highlighted a significant factor driving the rise of antisemitism in the West: the rapid growth of Muslim populations in Western countries over recent decades. 'People have not integrated into their communities, and they bring values that are very clearly hostile to Jewish people, and that’s what we’re seeing,' she said. Bercovici stressed the importance of recognizing reality rather than dismissing it. 'Look at the facts. Stop trying to explain them away,' she said. 'Stop behaving the way Jewish communities did in Europe in the 1930s.'

Remembering Yona Brief, an American-Israeli soldier who died in b...	Dovi Gordon: 'He was full of adventure and passion for life' Fallen soldier Yona Brief was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem earlier this week. Brief, an Israeli-American, was honored by thousands of mourners, many from Israel’s Anglo community. Brief had been injured in May 2023, and after being discharged, he insisted on rejoining the battle efforts. On October 7, he fought valiantly in Kfar Aza and had been hospitalized in the ICU since then. On Day 417 of the war, he succumbed to his wounds. His funeral became a national event, drawing thousands, including Knesset Member Chili Troper, who shared a few words in his memory. Tears were shed and stories were shared, as Yona Brief had become a symbol of bravery and sacrifice for many Israelis. 'I was lucky to know Yonah as a kid,' said close friend Dovi Gordon. 'We went to camp together, and he was full of adventure and passion for life.' Gordon recounted Yona’s heroic actions on October 7, when he and his comrades rushed to Kfar Aza. 'There’s a lot of things that happened that day, but the main thing, and the main act, was his commander got caught in an ambush, and Yonah went in to save them. Yonah told me—this is his words—that he felt the first few bullets going through. He said, it’s not too bad. I could continue,' Gordon continued. Despite his injuries, Yona pressed on, determined to save lives, even as he endured more wounds. 'He understood the whole time what was happening. The people I’ve spoken to said he knew he was sacrificing his life, and he decided to continue anyway,' Gordon recalled. 'And he was—he was the best. He was cool. He was fun to be around. He was always in a group of friends. He was always connecting between people in life,' his friend said. 'He just had that passion, and I think that’s what I take from him.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvkbf00xjx	2024-11-29T19:20:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/SJXmfGdXJl/SJXmfGdXJl_0_90_407_230_0_small.jpg
The Rescue - The only firsthand account of October 7 by Israel's ...	When she needed a helicopter to evacuate the wounded from Gaza and no one responded, he texted, 'We’ll make sure it gets there'; Amid chaos at Kfar Aza, she set up the Paratroopers' HQ in Sderot - Major Noga and Guy, a 669 medic, reflect on pressure, partnership, and moments of comfort during the war October 8, 12:25 PM, a text message between Noga, the Head of Operational Command for the Paratrooper's Special Forces brigade, and Guy, a reserve combat paramedic in Unit 669: Noga: 'I need a rescue helicopter. We've got casualties. Can you help me?' Guy: 'What's the situation? Give me details.' Noga: 'We have three wounded.' Guy: 'Location?' This brief, technical exchange is emblematic of the chaos of October 7 and the days that followed. Even the sharpest observer wouldn't guess that this conversation was between an engaged couple who had already set a date and venue for their wedding. This happened just over a day after the horrific attack began. Terrorists were still roaming in Israel, and the fighting continued. 'Our unit's deputy commander was seriously wounded,' Noga recalls. 'They thought he was dead; someone even said so. I couldn't get through to the command center to request a rescue helicopter—no one was responding. It was a state of helplessness. So, I sent a WhatsApp to Guy, who was also in combat. It wasn't a conversation between partners.' Guy: 'I contacted a friend from 669 who serves at the Air Force's control center.' Noga: 'That's how I got a helicopter. It's one of the reasons why the unit's deputy commander is alive today. After a challenging six-month rehabilitation, he returned to his position and is back on the ground again in Gaza.' The next interactions between Noga and Guy were more intimate, but the circumstances were no less surreal. 'I was managing the combat headquarters of the unit, and we had set up a temporary command station in Sderot, which was still being heavily bombarded. I asked Guy to update me on his location,' says Noga, 27, who is about to complete her legal internship at the Supreme Court. 'On October 9, Guy sent me a message: 'We're in Kissufim.' Shortly after, I received a report of a shooting in Kissufim. Terrorists were opening fire and ambushing soldiers. I knew he was there. I tried calling Guy, but he didn't answer. I kept calling, but there was no response. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. For forty minutes, I was certain the worst had happened. Yet, I had to keep operating, overseeing my unit’s combat efforts and giving the impression that everything was under control, even though it was far from reality.' Guy, 30, a medical student at Tel Aviv University, tells what was happening from his perspective: 'As we were searching for Hamas gunmen who managed to ambush Golani Battalion soldiers and then managed to escape, we were ambushed. I was behind, not on the front line. We had seven guys wounded, two of them critically. We loaded them onto our Hummers and drove as fast as we could to a nearby open field and called in for a 669 rescue helicopter. While treating two casualties simultaneously—one with a gunshot wound to the head and the other with a round in the chest—I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket. In the midst of chaos, no call is more important than the wounded person bleeding and not breathing in front of you. We had arrived at the field location we coordinated with central command and were waiting for a helicopter, but the phone kept vibrating. I thought someone from 669 on the helicopter might be calling to locate us. I checked my phone and saw numerous missed calls from Noga. I called her back immediately, fearing something might have happened to her. She choked up on the phone, saying, 'I thought something happened to you. 'Noga: 'That was the first time I cracked. I cried with relief.' Noga and Guy married amid the war and during the emergency call-up, which has continued until today. They met maybe three or four times from October 7 until the big day. One of the meetings was when Noga asked Guy to bring her a package she ordered online for the wedding. 'It was a white dress for the dancing part, and I needed to see if it fit. I asked Guy to bring the package to the Gaza border.' Guy: 'I drove south and met Noga at an abandoned house near the border, where her team had been sleeping on the floor for months. The truth is I didn't know what was in the package. Noga opens the box, puts on the dress, and stands in front of the mirror. I see a smile spread across her face. And it's no longer the tired officer who just finished an exhausting shift. At that moment, she was Cinderella.' Noga: 'Guy hugged me. It was a magical moment.' Apart from the wedding and its preparations, Guy and Noga didn't experience many magical moments during the war. Guy recounts the events of October 7 and the war from his perspective as a combat paramedic in 669 and from the viewpoint of his teammates in his new book The Rescue- October 7 through the eyes of Israel’s Para Rescue Commandos, His first book, From Zero to One Hundred, published a few years ago, is a gripping diary of his special forces rescue team’s experiences during mandatory service. It has become essential reading for teenagers aspiring to join elite units and is popular with the general public. October 7 is a date etched into the memory of every Israeli. For Guy and his family, however, another date—September 30—was equally significant, just a week before the Hamas attack. 'I was on a trip to Georgia during the holiday of Sukkot with my parents and all my siblings,' says Guy. 'On Saturday evening, we were dining in a local restaurant in a remote village in the Caucasus Mountains. My dad seemed pale, sweating, and unwell. I thought it might be food poisoning from some khachapuri. Suddenly, his head slumped onto the plate, and his glasses broke.' 'My brother Ari, a commander and medic in the army, immediately sprang into action. He laid our father on the floor and elevated his legs. I knelt beside him, instinctively placing my hand on his neck and finding no pulse. It took about ten seconds for the gravity of the situation to hit me. I began performing CPR, questioning whether my compressions were deep enough and if the rhythm was correct. At the same time, I found myself saying goodbye to Dad, imagining how he wouldn't be there at my wedding and how much he loved Noga. Those two minutes felt like an eternity. Then, finally, he started showing signs of breathing. Meanwhile, a local ambulance arrived at the restaurant. 'More accurately, an old pickup truck with two Georgian grandmothers and no equipment at all. We're driving to the hospital - and there's not much equipment there either. One defibrillator in the whole complex. I struggle with the team to get him into catheterization, and then he goes into cardiac arrest again. It took two and a half days to bring him back to Israel on a medical flight accompanied by a friend who is an intensive care doctor. At Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, doctors discovered an electrical issue with his heart. They implanted a pacemaker, and now he’s doing fine. Thank God. In 669 you've done quite a few resuscitations, both before October 7 and during the war. What's the difference between treating your father and treating a soldier or civilian you don't know? 'I believe the deepest fear for any medical professional is having to use their skills on someone they love. The fear was even greater in our case because we were alone. Suddenly, my father's life was in my hands'. 'Was this the most challenging experience of the past year for you?' 'Absolutely.' And he went through quite a few difficult things, especially on October 7. The week before October 7, Guy and Noga stayed at her parents' house in Moshav Shoresh, near the hospital where his father was being treated. On the morning of October 7, Noga left early to rush to her unit's base, while Guy delayed for about an hour. 'I didn't want to go to reserve duty; I wanted to be with my father. At that point, we still didn't know what was happening to him. I was debating whether to tell the unit I wouldn’t come and suggest they call someone else. After all, 669 isn’t dependent on just one person. But deep down, we don’t know how to say no. At 8:30, I got into the car, grabbed a coffee, and put on some music. I arrived at the 669 base, equipped myself, and met two in service rescue soldiers. We took a pickup truck and headed south. Looking back, we now view October 7 as a reality we've been living with for almost a year. But on that morning, it was as unimaginable as if aliens were about to invade Earth.' Guy and the two soldiers with him, all trained medics, were instructed to head to Kibbutz Nahal Oz. 'Three of us in a pickup truck—I was in the back—had no idea where we were going. We heard on the radio: 'Security incident in the south, special forces en route.' Suddenly, we were caught in a traffic jam and saw that the entire road and surrounding fields were filled with burned or bullet-riddled cars, bodies, and wounded people. There were screams and calls for help. Operating on autopilot, we grabbed the medical equipment and began treating the injured. We had no idea who these people were, what had happened, or if there were terrorists among them. One thing I did notice was that everyone was dressed in bright, colorful clothing as if they had just returned from India.' Today, anyone reading this description would immediately recognize it as the scene of the Nova party massacre. However, at that time, Guy and his comrades had no idea they were amidst the greatest disaster since the Holocaust. They were unaware that thousands of terrorists had effectively overrun the Gaza envelope, committing slaughter, arson, and abduction of men, women, and children. All they knew was that they had to reach Nahal Oz as quickly as possible. 669) is not just a rescue and medical evacuation unit, but also one of the four leading elite units in the IDF, whose members are trained for all combat scenarios.) We entered the kibbutz and began going house to house, fighting and rescuing the wounded. At one point, we received a call from our unit directing us to continue to Kfar Aza. When we arrived at the gate, we were met with complete chaos. Vehicles emerged from inside, carrying wounded soldiers and civilians in terrible condition. I realized that our most critical role was at the entrance of the community: treating the wounded, managing evacuation vehicles to get them out quickly, and keeping the route open for more teams of soldiers to enter and evacuate the injured. Meanwhile, medical supplies were running low. 'A soldier arrived with a gunshot wound to his stomach and his forearm blown off by a grenade. He was bleeding in front of me, and I didn’t even have a tourniquet. A paramedic from one of the units fighting inside Kfar Aza came to us, unloaded the wounded, and shouted, 'I need tourniquets.' I had none to give him. Were there any wounded you had to triage because there was no point in using time and equipment on them? 'Yes. There were wounded who still had a pulse and were breathing, but I knew I had no chance of saving them. Without a vehicle or sufficient equipment, I had to triage them and focus on providing improvised care to those I could still save.' On the night between Saturday and Sunday, Guy and his friends were sent to Kibbutz Be'eri. 'Until that moment I didn't know what was happening in Be'eri. I barely knew such a place existed. We received instructions to enter and search for survivors. We're driving slowly inside Be'eri, searching for hours. We found wounded and living people. There were still exchanges of fire with terrorists. But only when dawn broke did we really understand what happened there.' While Guy and his two unit comrades tried to cope with the chaos at the entrance to Kfar Aza, not far from there, in the town of Sderot, Noga was giving orders. 'Noga is the first woman in this role,' Guy says proudly. During the war, she also entered Gaza from time to time. 'I would update Guy only after I came out,' she says. A few months ago Noga was promoted. Now she commands the operations of the paratroopers brigade. Noga knows Major Uri Knafo, a company commander from their regular mandatory service in the Paratroopers. As fate would have it, Guy was in the helicopter team that rescued him when he was wounded in the fighting in Gaza. They recounted this story, which is beyond any imagination, when we sat at the 669 dorms on the unit's base. Not far from there, a memorial corner is being set up in memory of the seven669 fighters, officers and doctors of the unit who fell in the war. Since the beginning of the war, the unit has rescued and evacuated more than 2,000 wounded, one of whom was Knafo. Guy: 'It was Friday when we received an alert. We were airborne with four helicopters and landed in Khan Yunis in the Strip. The 669-ground team loaded six wounded. I took the two closest to the cockpit: one with shrapnel wounds and the other with a severe bullet injury to the leg.' 'The guy with the bullet in the leg was me,' says Knafo, 31, a high-tech professional from Tel Aviv. Guy: 'I could see you were in excruciating pain. I asked one of the medics to prepare a blood transfusion for you while I administered morphine. Then you suddenly said, 'I'm still on antibiotics.' I thought you might be hallucinating. We landed at Sheba Hospital in central Israel, and you grabbed my hand tightly and wouldn’t let go. As we entered the ambulance and arrived at the trauma room, you were comfortable thanks to the morphine. The doctor leaned over you and said, 'He looks familiar.' I was about to leave when she asked, 'You were here a few days ago, right?' That’s when I discovered you had been wounded earlier, evacuated by 669 to Sheba, returned to combat, and were now wounded again.' Noga and Guy got married in Kibbutz Shefayim on Tu B'Shvat, on January 25, 2024. They debated for a long time whether to postpone the wedding due to the war but ultimately decided to go ahead with the original date. 'The guys from my unit were stationed inside Gaza, and there was serious doubt whether they could make it to the wedding,' Guy explains. Noga: 'They're like family to us. Our whole refrigerator door is covered with magnets of their pictures.' Guy: 'They were upset with me, saying, 'Aren’t we important enough for you to postpone the wedding for us?'' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After speaking with everyone they could, Noga and Guy managed to arrange for the team to be pulled out of Gaza for the weekend to attend the wedding. That same week, a building collapse in the center of the Strip resulted in the deaths of 20 reservists. 'At the wedding, one of the guys told me, 'We intended to film a short video for you, but after spending all night extracting bodies from the collapsed building, we had no energy left to make it.'' Noga and Guy spent their wedding night at a hotel in Shefayim. When they booked rooms for their family before the war, they had no idea the hotel would later be used as accommodation for displaced from Kibbutz Kfar Aza. They also didn’t realize that Kfar Aza would become an integral part of their life story. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1uzdidx1l	2024-11-29T12:53:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/25/B1xJbC5kYA/B1xJbC5kYA_2_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg
ICC prosecutor recommends rejecting Israel's appeal against Netan...	Karim Khan submitted a document to the ICC Appeals Chamber, recommending the rejection of Israel's request regarding the Netanyahu and Gallant, stating that 'the decision is procedural and does not directly concern the court's jurisdiction' The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested the dismissal of Israel's appeal against arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, arguing that the appeal does not meet the criteria for direct appeal under the Rome Statute. Khan argues that the decision in question is procedural and does not directly address the court's jurisdiction, making it non-appealable under the Rome Statute. He stated that the decision pertains to the timing and verification of Israel’s appeal, not the court’s authority. 'The pretrial chamber is the appropriate forum to address this issue,' he noted. The prosecutor has asked to dismiss Israel’s appeal and its request to suspend the arrest warrants issued by the pretrial chamber due to procedural inadmissibility. On Wednesday, Israel submitted two documents to the ICC’s appeals chamber in response to the arrest warrants. As first reported by Ynet, Prime Minister Netanyahu decided at the last moment to inform the court of Israel's intention to appeal.

Government's plan to facilitate the return of northern residents	Evacuated residents return on February 1 with grants based on family size; the government will also assist in rebuilding and revitalizing affected communities, and the state will finance housing for displaced residents until reconstruction are complete Yossi Shelly, the director-general of the Prime Minister’s Office, is set to present a comprehensive plan for the return of northern residents to their homes, according to a report on Friday. The proposal is expected to be submitted for government approval at its upcoming meeting in Nahariya. Under the plan, residents are scheduled to begin returning on February 1, incentivized by financial grants tailored to family size. For instance, an average family of two parents and four children would receive approximately 60,000 shekels, while couples without children could be eligible for grants of 20,000 to 25,000 shekels. Those returning later will receive reduced amounts, as the state will cover the cost of their temporary housing in hotels or rented apartments until their return. The process will be gradual, to complete the return by the end of the academic year on July 1. The government will also assist in rebuilding and revitalizing affected communities. Residents whose homes were destroyed, such as in Metula and Nahariya, will receive additional financial aid beyond existing compensation funds. The state will finance housing for displaced residents until reconstruction or renovations are complete, with clear timelines established for the recovery process. Initial assessments reveal extensive damage: over 500 homes were completely destroyed, and another 1,000 sustained varying levels of damage. Rebuilding costs are estimated at 1.5 billion shekels, with an additional 2 billion shekels required for renovations. The plan also calls for significant investment in restoring public infrastructure, including roads, parks, and fences. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The initiative aims to restore normalcy while providing fair and comprehensive support to affected residents. The one-time grants are calculated based on the date residents cease state-funded temporary accommodations and the number of children eligible for child allowances.

The fact is, it is a solution to stop the hot stage of the war because we can just give NATO membership to the part of Ukraine that is under our control,' Zelensky told Sky News.

Netanyahu to convene security meeting amid Syria developments	The PM will hold a meeting with top security officials to discuss the ongoing battles between rebel forces and Assad’s army; 'Any instability in a neighboring country could impact us, but there may also be opportunities' Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a special security phone meeting on Friday with top security officials to discuss the developments in Syria, where fighting continues between rebel forces and Assad's army, and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon that took effect two days ago. Israel is closely monitoring the situation in Syria as rebel forces are fighting along the Syrian-Iranian axis and threatening the Assad regime. Israeli officials say, 'This is something we need to follow closely to see how it develops.' They also note, 'It’s not necessarily something that will affect us in the short term, but any instability in a neighboring country could impact us. It appears there may even be opportunities for change here.' In northern Syria, battles between rebel forces and Assad’s army continued this morning, two days after a surprise offensive launched by the rebels. The rebel attack in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Idlib is the largest against the Syrian army since 2020 when a ceasefire was declared in the region. Reports indicate that the rebels are advancing in rural areas of these provinces, with 14,000 residents displaced by the fighting. Meanwhile, Israel is also tracking the ceasefire's implementation in Lebanon.

Hezbollah chief says group scored 'divine victory' in war against...	Naim Qassem, the successor of Hassan Nasrallah, spoke for the first time since the ceasefire saying 'The agreement is under Lebanese sovereignty, and we defeated the enemy because it was forced to justify it'; Qassem claimed a historic victory as 'One of the signs of the enemy's defeat is that our people are returning to their homes, while its settlers are not' The head of the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, Naim Qassem, said in a televised address on Friday that the group had scored a 'divine victory' against Israel even greater than that declared after the two foes last fought in 2006. Nearly 14 months after Hezbollah began launching rockets into Israel as part of a 'supportive front for Gaza,' during which the group's slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah, stated that the fire would not cease until the fighting in Gaza stopped, Qassem opened his remarks by declaring Hezbollah’s decision to stand by the Palestinians. He asserted that Hezbollah did not want war, but felt a 'religious and humanitarian obligation' to support Gaza. 'We repeated that we do not want war, but we are ready for one if Israel forces it upon us.' Qassem claimed, 'We are on the verge of a divine victory, greater than the victory of 2006.' He added, 'The war began with the goal of destroying Hezbollah, returning civilians to the North, and building a new Middle East. Israel expected to achieve its objectives quickly after striking our leadership and capabilities. Hezbollah managed to stand firm on the frontlines and began hitting Israel’s internal front.' He further said, 'The resistance has proven through this war that it is prepared, and Nasrallah’s plans were effective and accounted for all developments. Israel gambled on internal conflicts, but that gamble failed due to cooperation (in Lebanon, Hezbollah). The resilience of the resistance shocked the world, frightened the Israeli army, and brought despair to the enemy.' Regarding the ceasefire reached under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, Qassem stated, 'The agreement is under Lebanese sovereignty, and the resistance is present on the ground. We hold our heads high because we have the right to defend ourselves. One of the signs of the enemy’s defeat is that our people are returning, while settlers are not returning on the other side.' In response to criticism in Israel about the end of the fighting, Qassem said, 'We defeated the enemy because it had to justify the agreement.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As reported by Arab media outlets, the agreement includes 'the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon,' meaning that only the Lebanese army will be authorized to carry weapons. 'The coordination between the resistance and the Lebanese army will be at the highest level,' Qassem stated. 'No one is betting on a disagreement between us. The primary focus of the agreement is south of the Litani River, which confirms the Israeli military's withdrawal from all areas it occupied.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qlhupxyx	2024-11-29T08:45:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/29/S1D92DwXkl/S1D92DwXkl_89_0_950_535_0_small.jpg

Actor, disabled IDF veteran explains why he enlisted in reserve d...	As an IDF veteran with a disability, Dean Miroshnikov was not obligated to enlist for reserve duty, yet, a year ago, he entered Gaza, far from his restaurants and bars in Tel Aviv; 'I see the world as divided between good and evil, and I understand we must protect our place,' he says in an interview, explaining why he feels most on edge during his time off at home Forget the polished and sharp image of actor and model Dean Miroshnikov, known for his roles in numerous TV shows and films. Over the past year, Miroshnikov has traded in his suits for IDF uniforms. In December, he volunteered for the 'Magen Be'eri' Battalion (a group of veterans from elite IDF units). Since then, he's been far removed from his business ventures in Tel Aviv, including Noama, Oyster Club, and Berlin Café, which are located in the bustling nightlife center of Nachalat Binyamin. On October 7, Miroshnikov was in South Africa filming a movie. But just a month later, he was back in Israel amid the war, and within weeks, he was in uniform, without hesitation. By December, his battalion entered Gaza, rebuilding it from the ground up. He spent most of the summer in Rafah, Gaza, with occasional short breaks at home. For almost a year, Gaza and the West Bank have been his everyday sights, though he occasionally returns for a brief respite. He spends his time off with his wife, Ani Miroshnikov, but even while holding her hand in the streets of Tel Aviv, he remains alert. In professional terms, this is called PTSD. 'When I'm in Gaza, I have a narrow field of vision. I don't need to look behind because I know someone is covering me. But when I'm walking in Tel Aviv, I always check 360 degrees, looking both ways and behind. I hold my wife’s hand and look right, then left. We were surprised once at Berlin Café during a terrorist attack in the summer of 2023, where a city security officer was killed. I feel the danger everywhere. So, when I return from reserve duty and enter the city center, the tension intensifies. I don't want to be caught off guard.' How do you transition from fighting in the heart of Gaza or operations in the West Bank to the bustling center of Tel Aviv? 'One of the reasons I serve in the reserves is because of what I see in the West Bank. Every night, we arrest people trying to harm us, infiltrate the country, and carry out attacks. If my team and I can stop even ten terrorists who could have reached Nachalat Binyamin to carry out attacks, that’s why I do it. One of my business partners, Uri Ziman, volunteers with Tel Aviv’s emergency response team; he does all the necessary training. When I return to Nachalat Binyamin and sit in the corner of the restaurant with my wife and friends, I don’t want it to end. I want tourists to keep coming to Israel. Even when I’m on reserve duty, I stay updated on everything happening with our restaurants. I’m in all the business WhatsApp groups, seeing how every missile fired from Lebanon or anywhere else is destroying businesses. There are days when people are too scared to go out, and that empties the restaurant both that evening and the next day.' Is there another place you'd consider calling home? Miroshnikov, 36, was born in Ukraine and immigrated to Israel at the age of nine. He has spent the past six years traveling across the country, giving motivational talks to youth. He’s about to celebrate his 1,000th lecture. As a disabled IDF veteran, Miroshnikov was not required to serve. In 2010, while serving in Shayetet 13, he was injured during the Gaza flotilla raid. Fourteen years have passed since that day, but the memories remain vivid. 'The reason I share my story with students is that I turned it into a tool,' says Miroshnikov. 'I had PTSD that used to take over and make me angry at the world. I was ashamed to go to therapy and ask for help. But eventually, I did, and I’m still in the process. At some point, someone suggested I give lectures. They heard I was an actor and had served in Shayetet. The first time I spoke, I told the story of the Mavi Marmara. From there, I built a lecture where I explained what happened, but also what it’s like to be an immigrant in Israel and why serving in the IDF was important to me. PTSD is about disorganized thoughts, but when I build a story and know exactly what happened from the moment we were called to the helicopter, it helps. I bring order to my thoughts, and when I tell the story, I feel like I’m turning on a light switch. I turn it on, and by the end of the lecture, I switch it off and don’t think about it anymore. I think we’re all living in a post-trauma state as a nation. If someone feels the need to talk to someone, that’s okay. It doesn’t always have to be a psychologist; sometimes writing it down or recording and listening later can help too.' You volunteered to go to war, even though as a disabled veteran, you weren’t obligated. What was your motivation? 'Listen, no one is obligated. Some people tell me straight to my face, ‘I don’t care, I’m not enlisting.’ But what about my commander, a 49-year-old man with a business, a family, and kids? Does he have to enlist in the war? He came here, didn’t sleep at night, and we went into villages to do what needed to be done. If we don’t do this, there won’t be a country.' Miroshnikov’s motivation changes depending on the situation. 'At first, I said there’s no way I’m not going to be part of this. I’m a commando, and I do whatever is needed, especially when soldiers are lacking. I won’t sit on the sidelines in a situation like this. Now, I’m here for my friends in the battalion, for the people who get to go home once in a while.'

I see the world divided between good and evil, and I understand that we need to protect this place. Otherwise, that spot on the map will be covered with black dust, and the Middle East will be lost. We strike in Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and Gaza. We protect the good and the beautiful heart that has to keep beating. If we don’t, the world will go mad.' Where do you find your optimism? 'Last week, on one of the nights, we went on an attack mission in the West Bank. Before that, we toured Jewish and Palestinian villages. Suddenly, we saw a group of girls in one of the moshavim. Without thinking twice, we jumped out of the jeep and danced with them. They recognized me, and the whole team burst out laughing. It was a joyful moment, and it gave us incredible energy before heading out on a mission. We felt we had brightened the day of those we were about to protect. That’s an amazing power. Then I came back to Tel Aviv, to my restaurants in Nachalat Binyamin, proud, knowing deep down that I did something good. It’s an incredible feeling.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjn3bvpxye	2024-11-29T07:37:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/H1gOF3gI7Jg/H1gOF3gI7Jg_0_117_768_433_0_small.jpg

Saudi Arabia abandons pursuit of US defense treaty over Israel st...	Saudi Arabia has shifted from seeking a full US defense treaty to a scaled-down military pact, tying normalization with Israel to concrete progress on Palestinian statehood; Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman initially sought a two-state solution pledge but renewed demands amid Israel’s actions in Gaza Saudi Arabia has abandoned its pursuit of an ambitious defense treaty with Washington in return for normalizing relations with Israel. It is now pushing for a more modest military cooperation agreement, two Saudi and four Western officials told Reuters. In a drive to get a wide-ranging mutual security treaty over the line earlier this year, Riyadh softened its position on Palestinian statehood, telling Washington that a public commitment from Israel to a two-state solution could be enough for the Gulf kingdom to normalize relations. But with public anger in Saudi Arabia and the wider Middle East at fever pitch over Israel's military actions in Gaza, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has again made recognition of Israel conditional on it taking concrete steps to create a Palestinian state, two Saudi and three Western sources said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is still eager to secure normalization with the Saudi powerhouse as a historical milestone and a sign of broader acceptance in the Arab world, Western diplomats said. But he faces overwhelming opposition at home to any concessions to the Palestinians following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and knows any gesture in the direction of statehood would fracture his ruling coalition, they said. With both leaders shackled by their domestic powerbases, Riyadh and Washington hope a more modest defense pact could be sealed before President Joe Biden leaves the White House in January, the sources said. A full-blown U.S.-Saudi treaty would need to pass the U.S. Senate with a two-thirds majority - and this would be a non-starter unless Riyadh recognizes Israel, the six sources said. The pact now under discussion would involve expanding joint military exercises and drills to address regional threats, mainly from Iran. It would foster partnerships between U.S. and Saudi defense firms, with safeguards to prevent collaboration with China, the sources said. The agreement would promote Saudi investment in advanced technologies, especially drone defense. The U.S. would increase its presence in Riyadh through training, logistics, and cyber security support, and may deploy a Patriot missile battalion to enhance missiledefensee and integrated deterrence. But it would not be the kind of binding mutual defense treaty that would oblige U.S. forces to protect the world's biggest oil exporter in the event of foreign attack. 'Saudi Arabia will get a security deal which will allow more military cooperation and sales of U.S. weapons, but not a defense treaty similar to that of Japan or South Korea as initially sought,' said Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Gulf Research Institute think-tank in Saudi Arabia. The Trump dilemma The picture is complicated further, however, by the impending arrival of Donald Trump in the White House. While Trump's plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict excludes any provisions for Palestinian statehood or sovereignty, he is a close ally of the Saudi crown prince. Palestinian and some Arab officials worry that Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner - architect of the 'Deal of the Century' and also a close ally of the crown prince - may ultimately persuade him to support the plan. How the prince reconciles Saudi priorities with this shifting diplomatic landscape will be pivotal, defining both his leadership and the future of the peace process, diplomats said. The current U.S. administration has not given up hope for a deal on security guarantees before Biden leaves office in January, but several obstacles remain. One person in Washington familiar with the talks said there was reason to be skeptical about whether there was enough time to strike a deal. U.S. officials are mindful that the kingdom is still interested in formally cementing the guarantees it has been seeking, especially to gain access to more advanced weapons, but are uncertain whether it would prefer to get it done under Biden, or wait for Trump, the source said. 'We continue to discuss and have many lines of effort on the table (with the Saudis),' the U.S. official said. The White House National Security Council declined to comment when asked about efforts toward reaching a deal on U.S. security guarantees for Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu's office declined to comment when asked about the Saudi position on Palestinian statehood. A defense treaty giving Saudi Arabia U.S. military protection in exchange for recognizing Israel would reshape the Middle East by uniting two long-time foes and binding Riyadh to Washington at a time when China is making inroads in the region. It would allow the kingdom to shore up its security and ward off threats from Iran and its Houthi allies, to avoid a repeat of the 2019 strikes on its oil facilities, which Riyadh and Washington both blamed on Tehran. Iran has denied any role. A senior Saudi official said the treaty was 95% complete but Riyadh opted to discuss an alternative agreement, given it was not doable without normalization with Israel. Depending on the format, a scaled-down cooperation agreement could be approved without going through Congress before Biden leaves office, two of the sources said. There were other stumbling blocks in the negotiations to secure a mutual defense treaty. For instance, there was no progress in the talks about civil nuclear cooperation because Saudi Arabia refused to sign a so-called 123 Agreement with the U.S. that would have denied Riyadh the right to nuclear enrichment, the six sources said. Saudi objections to articles related to human rights proved to be another area of disagreement, one Saudi source close to the talks told Reuters. 'The big prize' While the Saudi leadership strongly advocates Palestinian statehood, it remains uncertain, according to diplomats, how the crown prince would respond if Trump revives the deal he floated in 2020 to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The plan marks a dramatic shift in U.S. policy and international agreements by overtly aligning with Israel and deviating sharply from the long-standing land-for-peace framework that has historically guided negotiations. It would allow Israel to annex vast stretches of land in the occupied West Bank, including Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley, and recognize Jerusalem as the 'undivided capital of Israel' - effectively denying Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem as their capital, a central aspiration in their statehood goals and accordance with U.N. resolutions. By legitimizing Israeli annexations, the Trump plan is viewed by many as a severe blow to the two-state solution and Palestinian hopes of statehood. Saudi officials insist that the creation of a Palestinian state by previous international agreements, including East Jerusalem as its capital, remains an essential condition for long-term regional peace and stability. Without it the cycle of violence will continue to jeopardize any normal relations, they say. 'How can we imagine a region integrated if we sidestep the Palestinian issue?' a senior Saudi official said. 'You can't prevent the Palestinian right to self-determination.' And in some of the harshest criticism of Israel since the start of the Gaza war, Crown Prince Mohammed called Israel's military actions in Gaza 'collective genocide' in his address to an Arab and Islamic summit in Riyadh this month. The potential for Saudi normalization with Israel, however, could be revisited in the future, perhaps once the dust settles after the Gaza war - and possibly under a different Israeli government, diplomats said.

'For Trump, Saudi Arabia is the big prize,' said Gerges. 'As to how normalization could happen despite repeated Saudi leader's insistence they will not recognize Israel until a real path to a Palestinian state is set, Trump could promise a ceasefire in Gaza in return for normalization and tentative promise to support a Palestinian state, without obliging Israel to make any real concessions to the Palestinians.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj00qjuvxje	2024-11-29T05:42:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/05/rk4HPsA96/rk4HPsA96_119_1098_2571_1447_0_small.jpg

Wiz will be the biggest company of its field in the world: Top fe...	In an exclusive interview, Wiz's CMO & VP of Product Strategy forecasts how the cybersecurity company will eclipse its competition, why it was wrong to accept Google's lavish purchase offer, why connections with the group of founders is considered an opportunity and how she learned to embrace failure Raaz Herzberg met Assaf Rappaport by chance on a shuttle bus. A short time later, she was the one who saved Wiz for him, when she made it clear that the startup he founded would not go far unless it significantly changed direction - and the rest is history. In her first interview, CMO & VP Product Strategy at Wiz tells how the company will be the biggest in the world in the field, why it was wrong to accept Google's lavish purchase offer, why the connection with the group of founders is considered an opportunity rather than deprivation, and how she learned to embrace failure Raaz Herzberg, 32, started her journey at Wiz, the successful Israeli cyber startup, on a shuttle bus. She worked as a product manager at Microsoft Israel, traveling there by bus. One morning she sat down next to Assaf Rappaport, then Microsoft Israel's CEO. 'I sat down next to him simply because there was no other seat available,' says Herzberg. 'He is very friendly, so we started talking.' 'Raaz sat next to me,' Rappaport recalls, 'we didn't know each other, but she was full of amazing ideas about what could be improved at the company. That meeting resulted in establishing an excellence program for young product managers. Since then, we had many opportunities to talk about security issues, and whenever I had doubts I would go to consult with her.' Rappaport was already an experienced entrepreneur and an admired manager. He reached the top at Microsoft management after in 2015 Microsoft acquired his cybersecurity company Adallom for $320 million, which he co-founded with his three partners, Yinon Costica, Ami Luttwak and Roy Reznik. In 2019, when the four decided to move on and founded Wiz, Herzberg, the 27-year-old product manager from that chance meeting on the bus, was their first hired employee. To a large extent, that decision saved their company. 'I was hired to serve as a product manager at Wiz, reporting to Yinon,' Herzberg recalls. 'It was during the COVID lockdowns, and we used the time talking to senior information security managers in organizations, who were our potential customers. We gave them presentations, ten a day, and asked for feedback. I remember presenting them the network security problem we intended to solve, while I heard on the other side of the line an American guy saying, ‘It sounds great'.' 'After spending ten days in such conversations, as a product manager I was supposed to go to product developers, telling them 'this is what needs to be built,' but then I realized that I had no idea what I was asking them to build. It was frustrating because the conversations were too general, and I couldn't see what the solution was supposed to look like in detail.' Herzberg realized that the security product offered by Wiz, which had just been established, was not appealing to the customers because it did not address a different problem the customers were previously facing. She didn't hesitate to put forth her dramatic conclusion to Costica, telling him gently that the company he had started was not heading in the right direction. After spending ten days in such conversations, as a product manager I was supposed to go to product developers, telling them 'this is what needs to be built but then I realized that I had no idea what I was asking them to build.

Herzberg realized that the security product offered by Wiz, which had just been established, was not appealing to the customers because it did not address a different problem the customers were previously facing. She didn't hesitate to put forth her dramatic conclusion to Costica, telling him gently that the company he had started was not heading in the right direction. She has just joined the company but listened to our conversations and told us: 'I don't understand what a difficult problem the product solves for our customers and why it is important,'' Costica said in an interview with Calcalist last year. 'She was the first to alert that the product was not going in the right direction.' Rappaport also remembers this key moment: 'It was at the very beginning, when we still called ourselves 'Beyond Networks' with a completely different idea. Raaz sat with us, the founding team, she felt like the dumbest one in the room, and the only one who didn't understand why the idea to start the company was good, and assumed that the problem was with her, while in fact it was with us. In retrospect, thanks to her we changed direction.' What made you decide to say to the founding members that they were heading in the wrong direction? After the conversations I held, I could tell the difference between a customer who is saying 'It sounds interesting, we will catch up later', and a customer who is saying 'Wow, how much does it cost? I will connect you with my team', says Herzberg. 'Once I realized that none of us really fully understood what we were doing, we decided to make a sharp turn and move to engage in cloud security. We called it 'a suicide act' because it meant that we had to go to organizations who already had first-generation solution for cloud security, for which they have already paid, and we also knew that we would have to meet much higher standards, to have them purchase our product instead.' Weren't you afraid? 'The organizational climate here allows every employee to express their opinion and say things like, 'it doesn’t make sense to me'. It's like family, where you feel comfortable to say whatever crosses your mind, knowing that they are on your side.' Many excellent companies remain private for a long time, such as OpenAI. Herzberg is CMO & VP Product Strategy at Wiz, responsible for a team of 50 people. She is the most senior woman at the young cybersecurity company, which is growing at an unprecedented rate for an Israeli company, and perhaps globally. Five years since its establishment, Wiz's revenues reached half a billion dollars, its cloud security solution is used by 45 of the Fortune100, and just six months ago it raised $1 billion at an unimaginable $12 billion valuation. But an even bigger drama occurred this July, when Wiz rejected Google's $23 billion acquisition offer. How can you say No to such an offer? 'Generally speaking, without referring specifically to Google, the sales in the cloud infrastructure security market in 2023 were about $550 billion. In 2024, it’s expected to grow to $680 billion. The market is growing at a crazy pace, we are close to its growth and fully believe in our ability to become the biggest company in the world in this field. It’s big, and it's not worth giving it up for any purchase offer.' Even if it’s $23 billion? 'CrowdStrike (which provides endpoint security) is worth today $75 billion, Palo Alto Networks (which engages in network security) is worth $120 billion. I believe we’ll be bigger because the cloud market is going to be bigger, and we have strong indications that our solution is the right one.' Some say that the valuation is overestimated. 'When Wiz raises funds, investors review its activity carefully, so they know that we are selling a solution to the most critical problem in the security market today. I'm highly familiar with the cloud security world and have engaged in the field for a decade, but today only 15% of organizations use the cloud. This means that we've just begun. Wiz has infinite potential, and that’s why, for now, we prefer to remain private.' We? 'All the founders at Wiz believe that it should remain private. An IPO could be an amazing and exciting stop along the way, but still, it’s just a stop.' So, when will you become public? 'We will not remain private forever, but there is no pressure. We managed to raise enough money, which allows us to go public when the time is right. In recent years, we see more and more excellent companies that remain private for a long time, and the private market knows how to support and finance them. Take OpenAI for example, and other companies that have raised billions and could have already launched an IPO.' Assaf Rappaport said he would consider IPO when you’d reach around a billion dollars in sales. You're halfway there. 'That’s definitely the goal, but there’s no rush.' Bloomberg reported that you're in discussions to sell existing shares at a valuation as high as $20 billion. Is this a fundraising round that hasn't been completed and was disclosed too soon? I don’t comment on speculation. When a round is completed, we provide updates.' 'I didn’t serve in IDF's Intelligence Unit 8200 and felt underqualified' Herzberg’s journey to the heart of the cybersecurity industry did not follow the typical path. She served in the IDF in a technology unit after pursuing science and math majors in high school, 'where there were scarcely three girls in the class.' When she finished her military service, she did not opt for R&D or Computer Science. 'I didn’t want to work in high-tech and enrolled in economics and law studies at the Hebrew University. The truth is, I didn’t serve in the IDF's intelligence (prestigious) unit 8200, so I didn’t think I was qualified.' So, what happened? 'What happened was that waitressing was exhausting, and salaries in the tech sector are much higher. The truth is that I tried several times to move away from high-tech, and besides I have natural talent for painting, but in Israel there is tendency to work in the tech industry. 'I didn't want to do something purely technological, but when I started working at Ginger Software (which develops an AI-powered writing assistant), I saw the magic of a start-up where half the staff were linguists. That's the beauty of using technology as a tool to empower a different field. 'In the end, I enrolled in a demanding joint program of Computer Science at the university and Design studies at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. During my studies I worked part time at Google as a software programmer, and then I moved to work at Microsoft as a product manager.' Studying for a dual degree while working at Google isn't an easy task. 'I completed my computer science duties, but haven't completed the degree at Bezalel due to workload. But during my studies, I managed to engage in many projects that combined the two fields.' So, you gave up painting? 'I painted in many formats over the years, and while working at Wiz I returned to engage in hyper-realistic oil painting. I studied once a week with the painter Erez Aharon, but recently, unfortunately, I can't find the time.' You ended up in high-tech by chance? 'I finished my studies and felt somewhat confused, finding myself interested in many fields. If by any chance the tech industry ceases to exist tomorrow, there would still be many things that fascinate me. Sometimes I regret not going to law school. 'Public advocacy also appeals to me. I’d love to bring reform to Israel Railways; I've traveled by train from Haifa to Tel Aviv for 12 years and the experience hasn’t changed to this day. My dream is to turn that ride into a 20-minute trip, like you see in other places around the world.' 'I was completely overwhelmed, my legs were shaking' Despite her lack of experience, Rappaport asked Herzberg to lead the company's global marketing team. 'We had two very good American marketing managers in Silicon Valley, but we didn't feel that it was working. Then two years ago Assaf told me, 'I need you in marketing.' I found it somewhat absurd and replied that I was too busy; it made no sense to me, but he believed in me.' Despite the lack of self-confidence that she describes, Herzberg effectively became the fifth informal co-founder at Wiz, who is involved in every decision-making. Moreover, she is also the highest compensated employee in terms of the value of her stock options in the company. What was the marketing problem that demanded your help? 'Wiz had an excellent product that customers didn’t know about. Each time we reached a new potential customer, they would say, 'It’s a shame we haven’t heard about you before, we already purchased another security product'. No one heard of Wiz, and that was a problem.' And what did you do? 'First we addressed the visual issue. I don't believe in fear-based marketing, using black or red colors. That's why at conferences we would use pink or light blue. At the RSA conference, where all the security companies participate and you have to pay a million dollars just to get space at the exhibition, I wanted everyone at the conference to pay attention to us. So, we built a stand with a 'Wizard of Oz' concept ('Wiz of Oz'), and since then we've been using similar marketing strategies.' How do you attract and preserve large customers? 'There's an inside joke of cybersecurity, saying that founders of big cybersecurity companies live on airplanes because they spend all their time meeting customers. These deals are worth millions of dollars, and the founders want to understand their customers and their needs in depth. So, it is necessary to meet the customers yourself – and it turned out that I became a significant 'force multiplier'. It was surprising, first and foremost, to me.' What are your success metrics as a marketing manager? 'In the past we had 30,000 followers on LinkedIn, and now we have 250,000. There's also an increase in the number of searches for the product, and, of course, in the number of deals closed in the past two years. Analysts who three years ago could write about cloud security without mentioning us, can no longer ignore us.' If you're so evaluated, why aren’t you a formal fifth co-founder in this 'boys’ club'? 'They knew me when I was just an employee at Microsoft but knew nothing about my capabilities. We didn’t have the kind of relationship that we have today. They’re a decade older than me, they are more experienced, and they asked me to do things at Wiz on a scale I’d never done before. We were all pleasantly surprised by my achievements, especially me. 'To some extent they took a risk having me; they would invite me to meetings from the beginning, making me feel comfortable to share my opinion, allowing me to speak with the biggest clients, unlike other companies, where the founders are the only ones allowed to speak to clients in the first two years. It’s really not obvious.' What did you discover about yourself? 'At Microsoft, I didn't do things on such a scale, and I was always accompanied by staff members. At Wiz, everything started from scratch. Ahead of discussing with one of the first big customers, they told me, 'we want you to close the terms of the agreement with this customer.' I was completely overwhelmed, my legs were shaking. 'When I was discussing with the security manager of a giant company, he started talking about what the contract should include for ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) purposes. I had no idea what he was talking about, so I texted Assaf while we were still talking, asking 'what is ARR?' We keep the screenshot of this text message to this day. That discussion became our company heritage.' Don’t you feel like working in a 'boys' club' or a sense of regret that you didn’t establish a startup yourself? 'It doesn’t feel like 'boys' club' here. Ami is a national religious Jew, Yinon and Assaf have male partners - it’s a diversified workplace. I don't feel like I have to be 'one of the crowd'. I have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be part of an exciting journey, at a company growing faster than any other in the world in terms of sales. I feel a deep sense of belonging and pride, and the title matters less to me. Will I start my own company in the future? Who knows.' And what will happen in the next company they establish? 'If they start a third company and don’t offer me to be a co-founder, that’s a different story. We've been engaging in the cloud industry to begin with; if customers want the best, they will come to us.' Let’s talk about competition. You’re talking about making Wiz the biggest company in the field, but you’re still far from your top competitors such as CrowdStrike and certainly Palo Alto, which has annual sales of $8 billion 'These are amazing companies, leaders in their field, but CrowdStrike is an endpoint security company, and Palo Alto is a network company. Most of their revenues come from these areas, and they were founded long before the cloud. Wiz is a cloud company. The market that Wiz wants to lead - the cloud security market - is larger than the endpoint or even network markets.' But the competing companies understand this too, this is why they acquired cloud security companies. 'In terms of cloud, we beat them, because their solution wasn’t formed for the cloud - it’s not their forte. H&M, for example, is a clothing chain that also started selling some furniture. That’s fine, but if you want the best furniture, you go to a furniture store.' There's a word get around that you’re selling packages at a loss to increase market share.

IDF eliminates 40 terrorists, arrests 100 in ongoing Jabaliya rai...	Givati Brigade soldiers' work in one of Gaza's most dangerous locations moves to its third month, with experienced troops aiming to snuff any embers left of Hamas in the area The Givati Brigade’s Reconnaissance Unit successfully raided a large school complex in the heart of Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp, which consists of several multi-story buildings, in only three hours on Wednesday. The operation, carried out by a little over two platoons, resulted in the arrest of about 100 Hamas terrorists and the elimination of 40 others — 22 in close-range encounters and another 18 via airstrikes — all without any casualties among the soldiers. 'Less than a year ago, we would've deployed two or three brigades over several days for a divisional-level operation in such a location. Today, it's executed by a battle-tested battalion and a half against a terrorist organization that's being systematically defeated,' one of the operation's commanders told Ynet on Thursday. The Jabaliya raid is the longest IDF operation since forces transitioned to a new operational model favoring limited incursions into Gaza, with the IDF’s active ground maneuver phase having ended approximately 10 months ago. The raid, conducted by the 162nd Division, is now entering its third month. As anticipated early on, it's proving to be longer and different from previous operations. The reason lies in the IDF Southern Command's tactical shift: dividing the northern third of Gaza and encircling populated areas while filtering Gazan civilians fleeing southward toward Gaza City from Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists. The approach faced international criticism. However, the IDF has repeatedly stressed that there were no signs of starvation in Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya or Beit Hanoun. Just this week, Jordanian troops dropped aid packages in the Palestinian enclave. Further, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), in cooperation with foreign bodies, held special operations to prepare humanitarian aid delivery for conflict zones. Dozens of aid trucks enter this area daily via Israel’s Erez border crossing. Southern Command’s spearhead division estimated the raid will likely continue for several more weeks, as Jabaliya’s stronghold still houses between 100 and 200 terrorists. According to military data, 1,500 terrorists have been killed in the raid so far — a significantly higher figure than in comparable raids or divisional attacks during the ground operation’s first phase. The data also reveals that approximately 1,200 terrorists have been captured and interrogated, with intelligence from these interrogations directly supporting the soldiers' progress in real-time. This intelligence provides new targets, locations of explosives and even the positions of combat tunnels still present in Gaza. Some of these interrogations take place in the field, conducted by Unit 504 investigators and Shin Bet agents. During Wednesday night’s raid, field investigators identified several Hamas company and platoon commanders among the detainees, who surrendered without resistance. 'We’re not reaching levels seen in the West Bank yet. We’re facing anti-tank fire and significant explosives, but the forces are learning from the extensive experience they’re gaining as time passes,' the IDF said. 'We’re achieving greater operational efficiency with fewer troops and are getting closer to fully defeating Jabaliya,' it added. In the past 48 hours alone, 80 terrorists have been eliminated and the IDF has managed to drive about 75,000 Gazans southward throughout the operation. The high numbers from Wednesday night’s operation were largely due to the forces’ surprising and deceptive maneuvers, as well as progress made by Kfir Brigade troops in Beit Lahia, marking the young infantry brigade’s most significant test to date. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The raid has so far involved around 1,500 airstrikes, some conducted during a period when the IDF had shifted its primary focus to Lebanon and had fewer aircraft available for operations in Gaza. 'Our goal is to provide complete safety to the residents of Netiv HaAsara, near Beit Lahia, or to the residents of Sderot, who can see Jabaliya from their balconies. Even if it’s challenging and will take more time, it’s being done thoroughly, systematically and methodically,' the IDF stressed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1gj9wp7kx	2024-11-29T01:21:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/SkZnqirI7yl/SkZnqirI7yl_0_297_961_540_0_small.jpg

12,500 targets, 100 special operations: IDF tallies Hezbollah con...	Military report details over a year of fighting against terror group during which it seized military intelligence, eliminated Hezbollah commanders and struck thousands of targets The IDF published on Friday a summary of the prolonged conflict with Hezbollah, which ended this week with a cease-fire agreement after nearly 14 months. While ground operations in the Gaza Strip are expected to continue for years, the IDF Northern Command is preparing for ongoing cease-fire enforcement strikes and warning fire until Lebanese Army forces complete their deployment south of the Litani River, allowing Israeli forces to gradually withdraw and return to Israel. According to military data, 121,000 communication devices, computers and electronic devices, along with documents, were seized and confiscated in Lebanon during dozens of covert operations preceding the two-month-long ground campaign that concluded earlier this week. Additionally, 13,000 anti-tank missile launchers, anti-aircraft rockets and missiles, as well as 12,000 explosives, UAVs and various explosive devices, were captured or destroyed. The military estimated that over 155,000 items were seized in total. The military assessed that Hezbollah holds less than 30% of its UAV fleet from before the war — still numbering several hundred. According to the IDF, at least 2,500 terrorists were confirmed to be eliminated, though the actual number is believed to be around 3,500 with twice as many injured. Officially, Lebanon has reported 3,961 fatalities, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants and another 16,520 injuries. Among those killed were Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, his designated successor Hashem Safieddine and 13 other senior figures. The fatalities include 4 division commanders, 24 brigade commanders, 27 battalion commanders and 63 company commanders. As part of the campaign against Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, approximately 160 military headquarters, 150 weapons depots and over 1,500 terror infrastructure sites were destroyed. Overall, 1,600 Hezbollah military headquarters from various units and more than 1,000 weapons depots were targeted. The Israeli Air Force reported fighter jets flew 14,000 hours and attacked in 11,000 offensive sorties. In total, 360 terror infrastructures were attacked in Beirut and the Beqaa Valley alongside about 1,000 additional targets — out of 12,500 Hezbollah assets struck across Lebanon since October 8 of last year, with intensified efforts since August. The Navy held 25,000 hours of maritime operations off the coast of Lebanon. On the ground, 14 brigades participated in the campaign, alongside over 100 special operations and 24 divisional raids. Meanwhile, Israel continues to promise strict enforcement of the cease-fire agreement. On Thursday, the IDF announced it conducted its first airstrike since the cease-fire, after 'terrorist activity was identified in a facility used by Hezbollah to store mid-range rockets in southern Lebanon.'

Does Rawhi Fattouh have the support of the Palestinian people?	Maurice Hirsch: The PA has been 'entirely usurped by the PLO and its mechanisms' The individual whom Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has named as a temporary successor, who would take over from him should he die or leave his post, does not enjoy the support of the Palestinian people, according to Lt.-Col. (res.) Maurice Hirsch of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. He told ILTV on Thursday that Abbas’s appointment of the chairman of the Palestinian National Council, Rawhi Fattouh, someone who is not connected to the Palestinian Authority, is basically saying that the PA has ceased to exist. 'It has been entirely usurped by the PLO and its mechanisms,' Hirsch said. Hirsch added that Fattouh does not have popular support among the people. 'He's only being appointed, really, as a functionary for the interim period until new elections happen,' Hirsch said, although the Palestinians do not have a good track record of holding elections, and therefore, 'he will just assume this position for an unending period of time.'

In Aleppo countryside, the opposition turns the tables on the Syr...	For the first time in years, Syrian opposition groups have launched a significant military operation against regime forces, indicating a potential strategy shift for the diminished opposition The Aleppo countryside in Syria is witnessing a new military development as Syrian opposition factions and allied groups launched a surprise attack on positions held by Iranian forces and Syrian regime troops. The battles mark the first significant military operations between the opposition and the regime in northern Syria since the March 2020 cease-fire. In the early hours of Wednesday, opposition factions including the Sunni Islamist group Tahrir al-Sham launched the battles, ultimately capturing multiple villages and towns in the western Aleppo countryside. Among the spoils was the Syrian Army’s 46th Regiment military base, which had been subjected to near-daily shelling since the regime captured it in February 2020. At the time of this report, the factions are still engaged in battle. Special military sources told The Media Line that the opposition's factions captured approximately 10 individuals, including Russian personnel, and killed or injured dozens more. The Media Line obtained videos and photos showing 10 drones captured by the opposition groups, captured Syrian soldiers, and other captured fighters who opposition members identified as Russians. One military source from the Sham Legion, an alliance of Sunni Islamist rebel groups, said that several factions are participating in the operation, codenamed 'Deter the Aggression.' Participating groups include Tahrir al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, Jaysh al-Izza, the National Front for Liberation, the 50th Brigade of the Syrian National Army, and the Levant Front. The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said that the factions had captured approximately 25 military and civilian locations in the western Aleppo countryside, including Qubtan al-Jabal, Anjarah, Urm al-Sughra, Awijil, Sheikh Aqil, and Kafr Basin. These battles mark one of the most significant offensives in recent years, breaking a period of relative stagnation in Syria’s civil conflict. The front lines have remained largely static since President Bashar al-Assad’s government regained control of most of the country, bolstered by Russian military support. The renewed rebel offensive may indicate a shift in strategy aimed at increasing pressure on Assad’s forces in Aleppo, a region of critical strategic importance. While Assad’s government has retained control over much of Syria, this flare-up underscores the ongoing volatility of the conflict. Analysts suggest that the return of large-scale operations by opposition forces could reignite broader hostilities in areas that had seen a semblance of stability. More than 75 regime forces were killed in the battles, including officers. Opposition forces captured over 10 regime personnel and seized five tanks, an armored vehicle, and a missile storage depot. The opposition factions have not yet disclosed their casualty numbers. Another source close to the opposition factions said that more than 10 regime officers were killed in the ongoing clashes. Activists on social media shared photos suggesting that some of the fighters who were killed were affiliated with Hezbollah—photos show Lebanese currency in their clothes and images of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah they had brought to battle. The battles have triggered displacement in both opposition-held areas of the Idlib and Aleppo countrysides and regime-held parts of Aleppo city, especially as fighting approaches the city’s outskirts. Opposition factions are now less than 6 miles away from Aleppo city. Over 6 million civilians live in the Idlib and Aleppo countrysides under the control of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, Tahrir al-Sham, and other opposition factions. These areas are considered Syria’s last opposition strongholds. Khaled Mahmoud, a civilian from Aleppo, reported that residents of several of the city’s neighborhoods had moved deeper into the city’s interior, fearing clashes and civilian casualties in the event of opposition advances. Speaking to The Media Line, Mahmoud highlighted the dire humanitarian situation resulting from the displacement, made worse by harsh conditions and cold weather. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Areas in the western Aleppo countryside and Idlib saw similar displacement to safer locations within northern Syria. According to the Response Coordinators Team, a group associated with the opposition, over 8,735 families have fled from northwestern Syria. As clashes intensified in the Aleppo countryside, Syrian regime forces and Russian aircraft bombed parts of Idlib. Cluster munitions hit a camp in the northern countryside, killing a child and injuring three children and two women. Two additional people were injured in the town of Sarmin, east of Idlib. A source from the Syrian Civil Defense, the humanitarian group also known as the White Helmets, said that shelling targeted the industrial zone in Idlib, the village of Qaminas to the east, the village of Kansafra to the south, and the town of Sarmada in the northern countryside. School and university classes in Idlib were suspended following the attacks, and conferences and similar events were canceled.

I'll never be the same kid I was': Munder family's lives one yea...	Ohad Munder and his mother Keren recount their first steps back home after their family was abducted to Gaza on October 7 and released in the first hostage deal Three generations of the Munder family were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 last year: Avraham and Ruti, residents of the kibbutz, along with their daughter Keren and her son Ohad, who had come from Kfar Saba to visit for the Sukkot holiday. Keren’s brother, Roi, was murdered that day. Ruti, Keren and 10-year-old Ohad were released a year ago in the hostage release deal, while 79-year-old Avraham remained in Gaza. In August, his body was discovered in a tunnel in Khan Younis, recovered and returned to Israel, where he was laid to rest in the kibbutz he called home. Ohad Munder Zachri, now only ten years old, describes adjusting to a new normal. Old habits and hobbies have been left behind. 'I'll never be the same kid I was. I don’t go to school as much. I’ve also temporarily stopped attending the gifted students program. It’s hard for me to stay home alone, something I used to love,' he shares. 'We marked the day we returned—it’s a significant day for me. I returned from captivity, the most horrific and impactful experience of my life,' Ohad continues. Reflecting on the past year, he adds, 'This year has been incredibly complex.' He spent his ninth birthday on October 23, 2023, in Hamas captivity, a day when many Israelis flew balloons across the country in his honor. Keren recounts that even after returning from Gaza with her son, finding moments of peace has been difficult. 'I felt I needed to bring color and light into our home, so we decided to renovate. It was something to hold onto during those tough days waiting for my father,' she shares. 'There’s nothing we used to do regularly that we continue to do the same way. And if we do, it’s without the same joy. Nothing has healed—returning from captivity as only three out of the family, losing a brother and a father in this ongoing war and so many from the Nir Oz community where I grew up, many of whom feel like family. 'When we returned, I was surprised by the reception in Israel,' she admits. 'The level of attention, the extended family’s detailed attention. But even now, I still can’t fathom the failure that took place that Saturday along the border fence,' she adds. 'The massive blow to Kibbutz Nir Oz, which continues with a third of the hostages still being members of the kibbutz. I’m also stunned by how the war is being handled, by the misplaced priorities that leave the hostages in there still.' Keren explains: 'Given the cease-fire in the north and the holdup in ending the fighting in the south, it seems the army remains in Gaza to pave the way for future Jewish settlement there, rather than to search for and rescue our sons and daughters from the nightmare of the tunnels. It’s a cruel act tearing our nation apart.' When it comes to dreams for the future, Keren and Ohad imagine a different reality—one where the hostages return home and their community finally begins to truly heal. 'We’re still at war, worrying about the soldiers fighting bravely and the hostages whose return we demand.' 'I want to live a safe life in this country. Lawmakers must act with the well-being of all its citizens in mind—and above all, those children, civilians and soldiers who were violently and cruelly abducted to Gaza. 'They’re in there without protection, stripped of their rights and their lives have been in real danger for nearly 14 months. This must end before we lose them all inside the rubble. I want to close my eyes and wake up to the news that everyone is coming back. Only then can we turn to commemorating our loved ones,' Keren explains.

'There’s so much to rebuild in the south and north and even more in people’s hearts. We deserve leadership that gives our children hope.' Ohad concludes: 'I want there to be a cease-fire, for all the hostages to come back safely, for all the soldiers to return safely and for Israel to be a country of peace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkrmamiqjx	2024-11-28T10:32:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/SkWgkNcAN7Jg/SkWgkNcAN7Jg_0_49_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Yitzhak Goldknopf criticizes court for targeting Israeli leaders while failing to prioritize release of 101 hostages held by Hamas; FM Sa’ar says Israel has no plans to govern civilian life in Gaza Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, during a visit to the Gaza border on Thursday, called for Jewish settlement in the coastal enclave as a response to the October 7 massacre and the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. He criticized the ICC for pursuing alleged war crime charges against Israeli leaders instead of focusing on the release of 101 hostages still held by Hamas. Goldknopf was photographed near the Netzarim Corridor access road alongside right-wing activist Daniella Weiss and the Nachala movement, which promotes settlement initiatives, including a plan labeled the 'Map of the Garinei Hityashvut in Gaza,' using a Hebrew term referring to small groups or communities committed to establishing and developing new Jewish settlements. Goldknopf is not the only minister showing interest in Gaza settlements. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich advocated for the 'voluntary emigration' of Gaza residents and the complete military reoccupation of the territory. Speaking at a conference of the Yesha Council, a settler lobby, Smotrich claimed Israel could assume civil responsibility for Gaza, dismissing concerns over costs. 'Even if it costs five billion shekels, I’d spread it over 50 years—this is what’s needed to secure Israel’s safety,' he said, adding that military boots on the ground would be essential to combat terrorism and maintain security. Smotrich also cited opportunities created by the incoming Trump administration to facilitate emigration. 'If we talk about it less, we can achieve more. In two years, Gaza could have less than half its current population, creating an entirely different reality,' he said, describing voluntary emigration as a 'game-changer' for Israeli control over Gaza and the West Bank. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said on Thursday he believed that Israel would finish the 14-month-old war in Gaza when it 'achieves its objectives' of returning the hostages and ensuring Hamas no longer controls the Palestinian enclave. Sa'ar said Israel did not intend to control civilian life in Gaza, adding that peace was 'inevitable', but couldn't be based on 'illusions.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He also said that he believed that the United States would punish the ICC for having issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. Israel has said it will appeal the ICC decision to move against Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza war. But during a visit to the Czech Republic, Sa'ar said other countries were also dismayed by the decision, including the United States. 'I tend to believe that in Washington, legislation is going to take place very shortly against the ICC and whoever cooperates with it,' Sa'ar told a joint press conference with Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhbsn8xyl	2024-11-28T09:49:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/Hy00wpRBmyx/Hy00wpRBmyx_0_128_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Over 3,500 Hezbollah operatives killed in 14-month war, IDF revea...	Military says Hezbollah injuries in war at least twice its fatalities; with no demilitarized zone, destroyed southern Lebanon homes expected to be rebuilt; fears grow over Hezbollah resuming border provocations, which cease-fire may not prevent A day and a half after the northern cease-fire took effect, the IDF is reviewing the outcome of the war with Hezbollah, emphasizing the terrorist group’s diminished strength compared to its peak before October 8, 2023. According to the military, 3,500 Hezbollah operatives were killed during the hostilities, with at least double that number injured or incapacitated. The IDF has pledged aggressive enforcement of the truce, bolstering border barriers and enhancing surveillance and monitoring capabilities. The Lebanese army has begun deploying southward to areas vacated by Israeli forces, with this deployment set to be larger and more robust than prior to the war, under American oversight. 'Rules of engagement have changed, and while challenges remain, our mission to push Hezbollah northward and keep them there is clear,' IDF officials said. Despite residents near the border demanding that Hezbollah’s fortified forward villages not be rebuilt, the IDF acknowledges these buildings are likely to return. The military’s focus will be on ensuring the absence of weapons in these areas and preventing the re-establishment of underground storage facilities and arms caches. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The cease-fire agreement does not establish a demilitarized zone, leaving the IDF responsible for enforcing security and monitoring the border to prevent arms smuggling back into Lebanon. The military is also preparing for potential provocations, such as Hezbollah-organized motorcycle parades or displays of flags, which could challenge the fragile truce. The IDF’s primary objective is to preserve its achievements and enforce the cease-fire. Troops remaining in southern Lebanon are working to block the movement of Hezbollah operatives and civilians into border villages. Efforts are underway to rebuild defensive infrastructure and establish a fortified military presence to prevent future attacks. While the northern region has seen its first 24 hours of calm since the war began, the IDF warns that enforcement actions, like a strike on a rocket-launching cell in southern Lebanon on Thursday, may provoke Hezbollah retaliation. Despite the damage inflicted on Hezbollah’s capabilities, the organization is expected to rebuild in the coming years, necessitating the reinforcement of Israel’s defensive posture and the construction of military outposts along the border. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rsmx8x1x	2024-11-28T08:24:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/Syf00WQL7Qkl/Syf00WQL7Qkl_0_165_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF to launch new Haredi brigade during Hanukkah	Military recruiting 30 troops for Hashmonaim Brigade, with more primed to join later on, focusing on halachic lifestyle; brigade aims to build trust with Haredi community, offering combat roles with strict religious accommodations The IDF announced on Thursday the launch of its new Haredi combat brigade, 'Hashmonaim,' named after the Hasmonean dynasty who led the Maccabean Revolt over 2,000 years ago, with recruitment symbolically timed to coincide with Hanukkah. Initial enlistment will include 30 conscripts who have completed pre-draft assessments, with dozens more expressing interest. The brigade aims to establish one combat company of 60-80 soldiers and a reserve unit of Haredi recruits undergoing extended combat training. Unlike previous initiatives, recruitment is focused on voluntary enlistment through dialogue with yeshiva leaders and Haredi community rabbis rather than through the 7,000 draft orders recently authorized. The IDF hopes to build trust by demonstrating sensitivity to Haredi needs, including adherence to a strict religious lifestyle and halachic practices. Recruits must commit to the brigade’s regulations, including maintaining a Haredi lifestyle, modest speech and using filtered cell phones. They will be required to wear traditional Shabbat attire, such as suits and hats, during prayers and meals. Any violation of the rules will result in dismissal to standard service without special accommodations. Training and courses will be conducted entirely within the brigade to prevent integration with non-Haredi units, addressing previous concerns about breaches of religious standards in existing frameworks. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Col. Avinoam Emunah, commander of the Hashmonaim Brigade, called the initiative historic. 'I have the privilege of commanding the ultra-Orthodox brigade and being part of this extraordinary project that has the potential to bring meaningful change to Israeli society and the Jewish people as a whole,' he said in a recorded message. 'For the first time since the founding of the IDF and the establishment of the state, we’ve created a brigade that allows the ultra-Orthodox community to enlist, fight and serve while preserving their way of life and their identity. I invite you—those who feel the calling to defend their land, their people and their country—to join us and take part in something historic, something unprecedented. Be part of the beginning of this blessing.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skhbs6rx1g	2024-11-28T06:22:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/yk14167117/yk14167117_0_0_1282_722_0_small.jpg

Man on the street: What do people from Tel Aviv think of the ceas...	All of us, as human beings in this world, are supposed to be against war' After nearly 14 months of relentless fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which displaced over 60,000 residents of Northern Israel, a ceasefire has finally come into effect. While the truce offers a sigh of relief and a glimmer of hope, it also raises pressing questions: Will the ceasefire hold? And is it the right decision for Israel’s security and future? More than 16,000 rockets launched during the conflict destroyed homes and forced thousands into displacement. Now, residents wait to see if the uneasy calm will last or if they’ll once again find themselves seeking refuge in Tel Aviv’s safe rooms. During the conflict, even the occasional northern rocket strikes added to the anxiety in the center of the country. For now, there's a collective breath of relief—but also lingering uncertainty. 'For me, as an Israeli, I have to say that people dying—it doesn’t matter if you’re an Israeli or a Lebanese citizen. All of us, as human beings in this world, are supposed to be against war,' said one resident of Tel Aviv. Israel’s airstrikes displaced nearly a million people in Lebanon, while Hezbollah continued firing into Israel until the ceasefire took effect. Opinions are divided over the ceasefire: some believe additional military pressure could have further degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities, while others argue diplomacy must now take center stage. 'I think it was a good idea. The northern communities have to go home, and this allows them to get home,' said another Tel Aviv resident. 'It’s been a really tough time, both economically and socially, having them away from the north. So I think it’s really important to find an agreement to get them home, even if it doesn’t allow Israel to achieve the last 10 or 20% of the war.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skcvbcrmke	2024-11-28T02:22:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/rkU7GRS7kx/rkU7GRS7kx_0_0_713_402_0_small.jpg

The rebel organizations in northern Syria launched a 'deterring aggression' operation in Aleppo and Idlib provinces and captured settlements; Fierce fighting is going on between the parties, and the number of people killed in the fighting is the highest in the region in recent years; Russian planes bombed rebel strongholds The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Thursday that the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied rebel factions launched a surprise attack on the Syrian army in the northern province of Aleppo on Wednesday. According to the observatory, 'the death toll in the last 24 hours stands at 132, including 65 fighters of Hayat Tahrir Am-Sham, 18 of its allies and 49 soldiers in the Syrian army.' The Syrian military said that its forces were responding to the attack launched by the rebels. The Reuters news agency reported that the Syrian Air Force, along with the Russian forces assisting Damascus in the civil war, bombed areas held by the rebels near the border with Turkey. The battles in the province of Aleppo are taking place near the province of Idlib. According to the monitoring center, which provides regular reports on the war, this is the highest number of casualties in battles in the region in recent years. The monitoring center reported that in the extensive attack, called 'deterring aggression,' the rebels took control of 21 villages and sites in the western countryside of Aleppo. In a short time, after clashes with regime forces, the rebels reached a distance of 10 kilometers from the city of Aleppo. A military statement carried by state news agency SANA said that 'armed terrorist organizations grouped under so-called 'Nusra terrorist front' present in Aleppo and Idlib provinces launched a large, broad-fronted attack' on Wednesday morning. It said the attack with 'medium and heavy weapons targeted safe villages and towns and our military sites in those areas'. The army 'in cooperation with friendly forces' confronted the attack 'which is still continuing', inflicting 'heavy losses' on the armed groups, the military statement said, without reporting army losses. The Observatory said that 'Russian warplanes intensified air strikes', targeting the vicinity of Sarmin and other areas in Idlib province, alongside 'heavy artillery shelling' and rocket fire. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which used to be the Islamist al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, controls parts of the Idlib province and small areas of the neighboring provinces of Aleppo, Hama and Takiya.

An Israeli tank fired two rounds into the southern Lebanese town of Markaba on Thursday, two Lebanese security sources told Reuters, 24 hours after a cease-fire barring 'offensive military operations' came into force. One of the security sources said two people were wounded. Lebanon's state news agency said two people were wounded and transferred to hospital after an Israeli attack on the town, without specifying the type of attack. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah and Israel on the tank rounds.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkazn2smje	2024-11-28T00:13:26-08:00

Biden pushes Gaza hostage deal while Trump prepares to lay out Mi...	Biden secures Lebanon cease-fire with global support, seeks Gaza breakthrough before Trump’s inauguration; Egypt pressures Hamas while urging Israel to show flexibility, and Hamas signals readiness for a deal, but conditions remain firm as diplomatic efforts intensify across the region As his time in the White House draws to a close, U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly emphasized his intention to focus on resolving key issues in the Middle East. This week, he marked a significant achievement with the announcement of a cease-fire in Lebanon after nearly 14 months of fighting on the northern front. However, Biden is far from content and is now pursuing a new hostage deal with Hamas, nearly a year after the last one. In this effort, the Biden administration is engaging with an unexpected – though perhaps not entirely surprising – partner: his predecessor and president-elect, Donald Trump. Although U.S. officials have expressed skepticism about the chances of reaching a Gaza agreement before January 20, citing what they describe as Hamas’ 'lack of willingness,' The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Cairo is pressuring Trump’s incoming administration to push Israel toward greater flexibility on certain sticking points that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant about. At the same time, Egypt has delivered a blunt message to Hamas: 'You are isolated, especially following the cease-fire in the north.' Egyptian officials further informed the group that their demands for a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza are unlikely to gain Netanyahu’s approval. Meanwhile, Axios reported that Biden conveyed a clear message to Netanyahu in their most recent conversation, emphasizing the opportunity created by the northern cease-fire. According to the report, two senior American officials disclosed that the conversation occurred shortly after the Israeli cabinet approved the Lebanon cease-fire agreement. 'We have an opportunity now – let’s get the hostages out,' Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, who responded positively, indicating his willingness to try. Should Biden succeed in brokering an agreement between Israel and Hamas in the next two months, Trump may attempt to claim credit for the achievement. Earlier this week, Trump’s incoming National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, credited the cease-fire in Lebanon to Trump’s influence, tweeting: 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump.' Netanyahu confidant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly briefed Trump earlier this month at his Florida estate on the Lebanon negotiations. According to Israeli officials who spoke with The Wall Street Journal, Trump approved the plan and expressed hope that the agreement would be finalized before his inauguration on January 20. Trump and Netanyahu, as far as is publicly known, have spoken at least three times since Trump’s election victory. Biden’s National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, stated on Wednesday that the incoming administration is being kept 'informed at every step' regarding developments in the Middle East. A senior Biden administration official noted that Trump’s advisors agreed the Lebanon cease-fire was beneficial for all parties involved – Israel, Lebanon, and the United States. 'The priority was to act now, rather than later – something Trump’s team also recognized. This agreement will save many lives on both sides,' the official stated. Trump’s stance on Gaza has been inconsistent in the past. In July, he called on Netanyahu to 'end it quickly,' referring to the conflict. However, in October, Trump expressed support for Israel’s campaign against Hamas and Hezbollah, telling Netanyahu in one of their conversations: 'Do what you need to do.' According to The Wall Street Journal, since winning the election, Trump appears to see a strategic advantage in resolving the Gaza crisis before his inauguration, just as Biden does. 'A flurry of diplomatic activity is already underway,' Egyptian and Arab mediators told the American newspaper. Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani is currently in Cairo, pushing for an agreement, amid reports that an Egyptian delegation has either recently arrived in Israel or plans to do so soon. Egyptian officials, after extended contact with Trump’s team, are reportedly pressuring him to take an active role in resolving the Gaza crisis, believing that his involvement could encourage Netanyahu to move forward with an agreement. 'Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power,' Biden tweeted on Wednesday. He reiterated similar sentiments in his remarks following the northern cease-fire. Hamas: 'Ready for a cease-fire agreement' On Wednesday morning, as Lebanese residents were seen returning to their destroyed villages and raising Hezbollah flags, Hamas welcomed the agreement between Israel and Lebanon. A senior member of Hamas’ political bureau told AFP that the group was 'ready for a cease-fire agreement' as well, which would include a hostage deal. 'The announcement of the ceasefire in Lebanon is a major achievement for the resistance. It’s a victory,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The senior Hamas official also stated the group had informed mediators in Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey of its readiness to negotiate a ceasefire and a 'serious hostage deal.' Predictably, he accused Israel of disrupting previous progress. Hamas also reiterated its commitment to cooperating with efforts toward a ceasefire in Gaza but maintained its conditions. 'We are determined to stop the war against our people under the conditions we agreed upon: a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the return of the displaced, and the completion of a hostage deal,' the group announced. Qatar’s Prime Minister Al Thani also commented on the northern agreement on Wednesday, saying, 'Consultations with Egypt regarding a Gaza ceasefire are ongoing. We hope the agreement in Lebanon will lead to a ceasefire in Gaza. We have also agreed with Egypt on joint humanitarian aid projects.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkf6kqrxkl	2024-11-27T22:45:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/06/B1gwA7LyHC/B1gwA7LyHC_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Denial of visa comes weeks after Australia also rejected her visa request, citing remarks in which she denied Nazi medical experimentation on Jews in concentration camps during World War II The U.S. conservative political commentator Candace Owens was refused a visa to enter New Zealand for a speaking engagement because she had been banned from another country, immigration officials said Thursday. News of the ruling came weeks after neighboring Australia also rejected her visa request, citing remarks in which she denied Nazi medical experimentation on Jews in concentration camps during World War II. Owens is scheduled to speak at a series of events in several Australian cities and in Auckland, New Zealand, in February and March 2025. Tickets remain on sale and there is no acknowledgement on the promoter’s website that she has been refused entry to both countries. The commentator, who has more than 3 million followers on YouTube, is accused by her detractors of promoting conspiracy theories and antisemitism and has ignited firestorms with her remarks opposing Black Lives Matter, feminism, vaccines and immigration. In March, Owens said she had parted ways with the Daily Wire, on which she had hosted an online talk show since 2021, after clashes with its founders over her remarks about Jews and her opposition to U.S. military support for Israel. She was widely criticized for comments in a YouTube video in July that minimized the Holocaust. Owens had promised Australian and New Zealand audiences a discussion of free speech and her Christian faith when she announced the speaking tour in August. But Australian officials banned her from the country in October, with Immigration Minister Tony Burke telling reporters Owens 'has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,' citing her remarks about the Holocaust and about Muslims. 'Australia’s national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else,' Burke said. Australian Jewish groups had urged officials to bar her from the country.

Egyptian sources told the newspaper that 'Cairo's announcement of the visit is evidence of optimism about reaching an agreement. The vision includes a temporary cease-fire of about one to two months to close the details of 'the day after', alongside the gradual release of hostages, with priority given to adults and those suffering from chronic diseases.'

There is no street that has not been destroyed': A return to Dah...	Hezbollah printed posters prior to the cease-fire to distribute in Dahieh to broadcast victory the day the bombings stopped; Residents of Beirut sifted through the ruins and tried to assess the damage, but unlike in 2006 no one has come to help; 'Winter is beginning, the temperature is dropping and there are no windows' Displaced Lebanese citizens returned on Wednesday at the start of the cease-fire to the areas that have come under attack in recent months, accompanied by song, celebrations, signs of support for Hezbollah and shooting in the air - but this was a show planned in advance by the Shiite terrorist organization. Along with the attempt to convey the joy of the cease-fire and a perceived victory, the Arab media covered the shock of the residents when confronted with the destruction, and realized how difficult it will be to restore their destroyed homes before winter sets in, as well as the lack of an immediate response from Hezbollah, in contrast to what happened at the end of the Second Lebanon War. The Saudi newspaper ASharq Al-Awsat reported Wednesday night that, three days before the cease-fire came into effect , Hezbollah began printing posters and flags for distribution in Dahieh and other areas in Lebanon that came under attack. The preparations created a surreal sight of citizens driving around in their cars, waving Lebanese and Hezbollah flags and celebrating 'victory' among the ruins of their homes, when some of them have nowhere to return to and need alternative housing for the near future. The Lebanese National News Agency reported that convoys of vehicles waving Hezbollah flags and bearing pictures of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah and his alleged successor Hashem Safieddine - who were both killed - arrived in Dahieh Wednesday to celebrate, despite the massive destruction in the neighborhood. The cars honked, the young people sang in the squares and intersections, bulldozers began opening the roads and clearing the ruins - but the signs of sadness were evident on the faces of those whose property was destroyed and also lost their livelihood. The traffic congestion that characterizes the area has returned, but the joy recorded in the photos does not reflect reality. The houses of the Dahieh are a pile of rubble, and ASharq Al-Awsat reported that about 450 buildings in the area were destroyed during the months of fighting; But these are unofficial figures, since many other buildings were damaged but not completely destroyed. The Saudi newspaper noted that the buildings that were destroyed did not reach the number destroyed in the Second Lebanon War, which was claimed to be 720, 'but the attacks now were carried out over a wider geographical area than in the previous war, so the number of buildings that were damaged is greater.' About two weeks ago, the Al-Akhbar newspaper, which serves as Hezbollah's mouthpiece, provided completely different data. It reported that, in 2006, 246 buildings were destroyed in Dahieh and that by the end of October the number had only reached 220. Also, according to the Qatari Al-Araby channel, 300 houses were destroyed in Dahieh. ASharq Al-Awsat emphasized that there is hardly a street in the district in the south of Beirut that is not destroyed. On every street corner you can see the remains of the attacks and smell the smell of fire. Abed, a young Syrian who works as a security guard in one of the buildings in Dahieh, spoke to the newspaper when he came to collect his belongings from his apartment located in one of the buildings that were attacked. Three floors of his building were damaged and, according to the engineers who came to inspect the damage, it seems that it will not be possible to restore the building. Muhammad Hashem, also a resident of Dahieh, told the Saudi newspaper that his house was severely damaged by an attack aimed at a nearby building. 'When we see the misfortune of our neighbors, our misfortune seems easier. But in any case, we won't be able to live in the house in the near future, because the stairs of the building were damaged and inside the house there are no windows or glass that can be closed, and winter began with a record drop in temperatures,' he said. In contrast to what happened at the end of the Second Lebanon War, the newspaper noted, then Hezbollah rushed to examine the damages and pay compensation to the victims, today no one has yet made contact with the displaced. Thus, yesterday's celebrations were also accompanied by criticism. Many fled for fear of stray bullets from the 'joy shooting,' and a young man on a motorcycle even cursed the shooters: 'We survived Israel's missiles and they want to kill us with their stupid bullets.' 360 targets were attacked in Da'ahia, more than 12,000 in all of Lebanon IDF spokesman, Lt. Col. Daniel Hagari, presented on Wednesday night, less than a day after the cease-fire, data on the attacks in Lebanon throughout the 14 months of fighting. In Dahieh, according to the data, the IDF attacked about 360 targets. Hagari noted that among the targets that were attacked were 'terrorist headquarters and workshops for the production of weapons. The IDF's fighting in Lebanon was powerful, planned and included tricks and daring operations, some of which were secret that we have not yet revealed, all with the aim of creating security for the residents of the north.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'This morning, the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon entered into force, as approved by the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister and the Cabinet,' Hagari said on Wednesday. 'IDF forces are still occupying positions in southern Lebanon, in the villages and areas from which there will be a gradual withdrawal in accordance with the agreement. The Air Force planes continue to fly in the skies of Lebanon, they are gathering intelligence and are prepared to act where necessary. In the coming weeks, we will reshape the area of ​​defense and security. We will apply the lessons from the past.' . Hagar revealed documentation of a missile manufacturing site that was attacked before the cease-fire. 'During the night, before the agreement entered into force, we attacked about 180 targets throughout Lebanon. One of them is a central missile production site near the Syrian border, which we have been monitoring for a long time. This is a strategic asset of Hezbollah. Near the site, we attacked a Radwan camp, where the unit's operatives were staying and training, the purpose of which was the implementation of the 'Occupation of the Galilee' plan,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1svzdbqke	2024-11-27T20:29:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/Hyl2g3EQJe/Hyl2g3EQJe_0_233_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Palestinian leader Abbas names interim successor in case of depar...	Rawhi Fattouh tapped interim Palestinian Authority chairman until elections held; PA officials claim US-Saudi pressure aims to reshape leadership, possibly preparing PA to govern Gaza post-war Palestinian Authority (PA) Chairman Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday named Rawhi Fattouh as his interim successor should he leave office. Fattouh, 75, a former speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, would serve as president for a 90-day transitional period until elections are held, in accordance with Palestinian law. The decision surprised many within the PA, with officials noting Abbas had not consulted senior figures, including Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary-general of the PLO Executive Committee, who is seen as a contender for the presidency. Some officials speculated the move was influenced by a U.S.-Saudi initiative to reshape the PA, potentially positioning it to take control of Gaza after the war. 'The U.S. requested Abbas appoint a deputy who could assume leadership, which he saw as an effort to sideline him,' one official said. 'His decision ensures he remains central to the PA’s leadership.' Three key candidates are seen as potential successors to Abbas: Mahmoud al-Aloul, known for his hardline views; Jibril Rajoub, a former security chief and sports administrator; and Mohammad Mustafa, the current prime minister focused on economic reforms. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While Abbas, 89, struggles with waning public support, some Palestinians view his rule as preferable to alternatives like Hamas, particularly after the October 7 Hamas attacks. However, analysts warn his eventual departure could trigger violent power struggles that might destabilize the PA. Compounding the PA’s challenges is longstanding Israeli political instability. Abbas’s outreach to former defense minister Benny Gantz gave way to dealing with a government that imposed measures undermining the PA’s economy, including bans on Palestinian workers. Critics argue successive Israeli governments, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, weakened the PA while empowering Hamas, further eroding its authority in the West Bank. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkplqbh7ke	2024-11-27T12:38:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/02/12/H1FoCw8pi/H1FoCw8pi_0_111_1989_1119_0_small.jpg
BBC staff quit journalists’ union after being told to dress in Pa...	Staffer says journalists, who pride themselves on impartiality and fight to keep their union free of politics, being encouraged to break BBC’s editorial guidelines The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has confirmed to Jewish News that BBC journalists have resigned from the union after it distributed directives from the Trades Union Congress (TUC) urging workers to dress in Palestinian colors, or wear a keffiyeh, as part of a Day of Action for Palestine. The TUC has called for a permanent cease-fire, the cessation of violence in Gaza and the release of all hostages. But in recommending Palestinian dress as part of the event, due to take place on Thursday, November 28, some NUJ members at the BBC feel their union has crossed a line. One BBC staffer said the suggestion was a clear breach of the BBC’s commitment to impartial reporting, telling The Times: 'BBC journalists, who pride themselves on impartiality and who fought to keep their NUJ free of politics, are being encouraged to break the BBC’s editorial guidelines by supporting a political cause.' They added that they were reconsidering their NUJ membership after the 'hypocri,tical and antisemitic' action. Jewish staffers at the BBC say that Nigel Lewis, the broadcaster’s director of HR, has been alerted to the situation and raised it with HR leads across the corporation. BBC Security has also been made aware of potential flashpoint situations created by the wearing of Palestinian flag colors or headscarves. In a message to NUJ members, the journalists’ union now says that 'clearly members working across the BBC and in public service broadcasting have important duties in relation to impartiality and work within social media guidelines the NUJ would not wish members to breach.' Just as clearly, the union has been alarmed by the response and the resignations. Jewish chat groups speculate there might be at least a dozen more people handing in their NUJ membership cards. Charlotte Henry, a freelance journalist who has also resigned, wrote in her newsletter, The Addition, that the union had become 'a hostile environment for Jews, and I can no longer be part of that.' The TUC was unable to say whether it had ever previously asked workers to wear the national colors of one side or another in a conflict. It did confirm, however, that it has never asked members to wear Ukraine-colored clothing during the country’s conflict with Russia. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As far as the Palestinian cause goes, however, the TUC is not simply asking participants to 'wear something red, green, black or a Palestinian keffiyeh' to their workplace, but 'visibly show solidarity' by posting pictures of themselves in such clothing on social media. The Board of Deputies issued a strongly-worded statement accusing the trade unions of 'playing student politics on a conflict on whose facts they appear to be plainly ignorant,' rather than following their core mission of protecting workers. The statement added: 'Whatever the stated intent, attempts to bring this issue into the workplace in such a fashion will undoubtedly add to the belligerent atmosphere which many Jewish staff have been facing.'

Still counting its dead, Hezbollah faces long road to recover fro...	Terror group working to re-establish organizational structure fully, probe security breaches that helped Israel land so many painful blows and fully review last year, including mistakes in underestimating Israel's technological capabilities, sources say With the bodies of its fighters still strewn on the battlefield, Hezbollah must bury its dead and provide succor to its supporters who bore the brunt of Israel's offensive, as the first steps on a long and costly road to recovery, four senior officials said. Hezbollah believes the number of its fighters killed during 14 months of hostilities could reach several thousand, with the vast majority killed since Israel went on the offensive in September, three sources familiar with its operations say, citing previously unreported internal estimates. One source said the Iran-backed group may have lost up to 4,000 people - well over 10 times the number killed in its month-long 2006 war with Israel. So far, Lebanese authorities have said some 3,800 people were killed in the current hostilities, without distinguishing fighters from civilians. Hezbollah emerges shaken from top to bottom, its leadership still reeling from the killing of its former leader Hassan Nasrallah and its supporters made homeless en masse by the carpet bombing of Beirut's southern suburbs and the destruction of entire villages in the south. With a ceasefire taking hold on Wednesday, Hezbollah's agenda includes working to re-establish its organizational structure fully, probing security breaches that helped Israel land so many painful blows, and a full review of the last year including its mistakes in underestimating Israel's technological capabilities, three other sources familiar with the group's thinking said. For this story Reuters spoke to a dozen people who together provided details of some of the challenges facing Hezbollah as it seeks to pick itself up after the war. Most asked not to be named to speak about sensitive matters. Hassan Fadallah, a senior Hezbollah politician, told Reuters the priority will be 'the people.' 'To shelter them, to remove the rubble, to bid farewell to the martyrs and, in the next phase, to rebuild,' he said. Israel's campaign has focused largely on Hezbollah's Shi'ite Muslim heartlands, where its supporters were badly hit. They include people still nursing casualties from Israel's attack on its mobile communications devices in September. 'I have a brother who was martyred, a brother-in-law who was wounded in the pager attacks, and my neighbors and relatives are all either martyrs, wounded or missing,' said Hawraa, a woman from south Lebanon with family members who fight for Hezbollah. 'We want to collect our martyrs and bury them ... we want to rebuild our homes,' said Hawraa, who stayed in her village until she was forced to flee by the Israeli assault in September. She declined to use her full name, citing safety fears. The Israeli offensive displaced more than 1 million people, the bulk of them from areas where Hezbollah has sway. A senior Lebanese official familiar with Hezbollah's thinking said the group's focus would be squarely on securing their return and rebuilding their homes: 'Hezbollah is like a wounded man. Does a wounded man get up and fight? A wounded man needs to tend to his wounds.' The official expected Hezbollah to carry out a wide-ranging policy review after the war, dealing with all major issues: Israel, its weapons, and the internal politics of Lebanon, where its weapons have long been a point of conflict. Iran, which established Hezbollah in 1982, has promised to help with reconstruction. The costs are immense: The World Bank estimates $2.8 billion in damage to housing alone in Lebanon, with 99,000 homes partially or fully destroyed. The senior Lebanese official said Tehran has a variety of ways to get funds to Hezbollah, without giving details. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close Hezbollah ally, is urging wealthy Lebanese Shi'ites in the diaspora to send funds to help the displaced, two Lebanese officials said.

Hezbollah did not immediately respond to a detailed request for comment for this story. Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'The resistance will continue Hezbollah has indicated it intends to keep its arms, dashing hopes of Lebanese adversaries who predicted the pressures generated by the war would finally lead it to hand them to the state. Hezbollah officials have said the resistance - widely understood to mean its armed status - will continue. Hezbollah opened fire in support of Palestinian ally Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023. Israel went on the offensive against the group in September, declaring the aim of securing the return home of 60,000 people evacuated from homes in the north. Despite the resulting devastation, Hezbollah's Fadlallah said the resistance put up by its fighters in south Lebanon and the group's intensified rocket salvos toward the end of the conflict showed Israel had failed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says its campaign has set back Hezbollah decades, eliminated its top leaders, destroyed most of its rockets, neutralized thousands of fighters, and obliterated its infrastructure near the border. A senior U.S. official said Hezbollah was 'extremely weak' at this moment, both militarily and politically. A Western diplomat echoed that assessment, saying Israel had the upper hand and had almost dictated the terms of its withdrawal. The ceasefire terms agreed by Israel and Lebanon require Hezbollah to have no military presence in an area between the Israeli border and the Litani River, which meets the Mediterranean Sea some 30 km (20 miles) from the frontier. Hezbollah, which approved the deal, has not declared how it intends to help implement those terms, including whether it actively hands its arms to Lebanese troops who are deploying into the south, or leaves the weapons for soldiers to find. Israel complains Hezbollah, which is deeply rooted in south Lebanon, never implemented the same terms when they agreed to end a previous war in 2006 war. Israel says the group was preparing for a large-scale assault into northern Israel, pointing to its military build-up at the frontier. Andreas Krieg of King's College in London said Hezbollah had retained considerable capability. The performance of its 'core infantry fighters in southern Lebanon and rocket attacks deep into Israeli territory in recent days showed the group was still very, very capable,' he said. 'But Hezbollah will be very much bogged down in the effort of rebuilding the infrastructure and also, most importantly, securing the funds to do so,' he said. 'Repaying the debt' Hezbollah has been handing out cash to people affected by the hostilities since they began, paying $200 a month to civilians who stayed in frontline villages, and offering more as people were forced to flee the areas, according to recipients. Since the start of the escalation in September, Hezbollah has been paying around $300 a month to help displaced families. The group has made no secret of the military and financial support it gets from Iran, which shipped huge sums of cash in 2006 to aid the homeless and help rebuild. Hezbollah supporters say more will be on the way. One, citing conversations with a local Hezbollah official, said the group would cover a year of rent for the homeless in addition to furniture costs. Addressing the Lebanese people in an October sermon, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said 'the destruction will be replaced... repaying the debt to the wounded, bleeding Lebanon is our duty...' The World Bank, in a preliminary estimate, put the cost of damage and losses to Lebanon at $8.5 billion, a bill that cannot be footed by the government, still suffering the consequences of a catastrophic financial collapse five years ago. Gulf states Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia helped pay the $5 billion reconstruction bill in 2006, the last time Hezbollah and Israel went to war. But there has been no sign that these Sunni-led Arab states are ready to do so again. Hezbollah conducted a lot of reconstruction work after the 2006 war, financed by Iran and using its construction wing. The project was directed by Hashem Safieddine, a Hezbollah leader killed by Israel 11 days after Nasrallah, in a sign of the bigger challenges it will face this time round. 'For Hezbollah, the priority is to guarantee the loyalty of the Shi’ite community. The destruction has been enormous and it will impact the organization,' said Mohanand Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjubrgrq1e	2024-11-27T11:49:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/ryGE4sxHQyl/ryGE4sxHQyl_0_0_960_664_0_small.jpg

This was the right time': Netanyahu sought Lebanon cease-fire de...	White House envoy addresses representatives of Jewish American communities, detailing Lebanon cease-fire agreement, Biden’s unwavering support for Israel and plans to enforce deal Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu requested a cease-fire in Lebanon last October, describing the timing as strategic, White House special envoy and chief mediator in the cease-fire talks Amos Hochstein revealed Wednesday. 'The moment was right. It culminated in about a week before the elections in the United States, at the end of October, Netanyahu asked for me to come out. We met, we decided this was the right time,' Hochstein said during a call with representatives of American Jewish communities. Hochstein linked the Lebanese agreement to a potential Hamas hostage deal, suggesting that resolving hostilities in the north has left Israel focused on a single front. 'The Lebanese deal here opens an opportunity on the hostage deal,' he said. 'The president could not have been more clear and I know that everybody always blames the Israelis about everything, but the president was very clear that Hamas has not come to the negotiating table in good faith for months but here's the deal, they will. They wake up this morning at 4 a.m. with Hezbollah, that used to be actively supportive of Hamas on the northern front, ending the conflict. Israel is now not distracted by two fronts. It is fighting a one-front war, and there's no cavalry coming from the north anymore for Hamas.' Hochstein praised U.S. President Joe Biden’s commitment to resolving the hostage crisis, emphasizing the urgency to act before the U.S. presidential transition. 'The president is refusing to let the hostages stay in tunnels or in some other horrible condition that they're in for three more months because the United States has a transition period. We're not going to wait,' he said. He highlighted Biden’s unwavering support for Israel and the Jewish people during both his terms as president and vice president under Barack Obama. 'When October 7 happened, he went to Israel against the advice of some security officials. When the Iran threat was there, he deployed more military personnel and equipment to the Middle East to defend Israel, not once, but twice,' he said. Despite occasional tensions with Netanyahu, Hochstein called the U.S. Israel’s most important ally, citing Biden’s ability to prevent international boycotts or punitive actions against Israel. 'The reason the United States is so important is because when other countries want to abandon Israel, or when they're going to the Security Council, or they're going to the G7 or the G20, thinking of boycotts, to go after Israel, it needs the president of the United States to convince those countries not to do that,' he said. 'He has that credibility, so he can call presidents of countries and say, 'Hey, buddy. Don't do this. Stop what you're trying to do.'' Hochstein detailed the complexities of negotiating the Lebanon cease-fire, describing it as a war between Israel and Iran via Hezbollah. He clarified that while the cease-fire is permanent, IDF forces would temporarily remain in southern Lebanon to allow time for the Lebanese army to deploy. He emphasized that, unlike the 2006 cease-fire, this agreement includes an enhanced mechanism involving France, the U.S., Lebanon and UNIFIL to address violations promptly. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'In 2006, the war ended with a cease-fire that had no implementation effort whatsoever. That has to change,' he said. 'We have taken a mechanism that already existed, that Israel had already established together with Lebanon and UNIFIL, called the tripartite mechanism, and we enhanced it to include France and the United States.' Hochstein said this mechanism would be able to respond to reports of violations quickly and added that Israel would be able to act if violations are not dealt with. 'Biden has been very clear with everyone and instructed me to negotiate a deal that Israel and Lebanon maintain the right of self-defense under international law. Israel continues to maintain that right. So does Lebanon,' he said. 'If there's a direct threat to Israel that is not addressed by this mechanism or by the appropriate authorities in Lebanon, and it poses a continuous threat, Israel will take care of that threat on its own. That is what the president said in very clear terms. I'll just say we have other channels to verify that Hezbollah is aware of its obligations.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjyh00ksq1l	2024-11-27T10:54:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/rkcEKLiG1e/rkcEKLiG1e_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The Red Line': New cease-fire terms aim to keep Hezbollah at bay	New cease-fire with Lebanon broadens restrictions on Hezbollah fighters, differing from 2006’s Resolution 1701; IDF ready to enforce deal and warns of possible escalations; US mediator Hochstein details his messages to both sides The world continues to examine the details of the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, highlighting the growing distinctions between it and UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Lebanon war between Israel and Hezbollah. The deal, published by Lebanon's cabinet on Wednesday, runs to just over five pages of printed text and includes a map of southern Lebanon. The area to be free of Hezbollah weaponry is delineated by a red line labeled 'New 2024 line' that runs east-west across Lebanon. It starts from a point on the coast about 25 km (15 miles) north of the Israeli border and runs eastward, mostly along the Litani River but then diverging from it north of the town of Yohmor, thus going beyond the area that UN Security Council Resolution 1701 said would be free of non-state arms. The area in question is relatively close to Metula, meaning the new zone is intended to push Hezbollah operatives even further from the border—assuming the agreement is fully honored, which remains uncertain. The expanded zone includes Beaufort Castle, a Crusader-era fortress considered strategic because it commands a view onto the Israeli border, said retired army brigadier general Hassan Jouni. The 2006 resolution also said there would be 'no weapons without the consent of the Government of Lebanon' deployed across Lebanese territory. The new cease-fire deal goes further, stipulating that only 'official military and security forces' in Lebanon are authorized to carry arms. It specifically names those forces as the Lebanese Armed Forces, the Internal Security Forces, General Security, State Security, Lebanese customs and municipal police. 'Naturally it means a seriousness with implementation, so that there is no obscurity around this that could be interpreted in a different way,' said Jouni. 'It serves the interest of the Lebanese state and its official institutions, but it is not to the interest of Hezbollah.' Officials in both the Beirut government and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which wields enormous political influence in Lebanon, have long referred to cabinet statements since 2008 enshrining the right to 'resistance' as de facto official approval for Hezbollah's arsenal. Two Lebanese officials told Reuters they did not find the added language in the new deal cause for concern, and said the most important achievement was a halt to the war. But diplomats said the wording could give Israel more leverage than after 2006 to prevent Hezbollah from re-arming or redeploying fighters or weapons. 'Lebanon either didn't have any other option, or they think they can outsmart it,' one diplomat from the region said. A senior Western diplomat said Israel had such an upper hand, following months of heavy strikes that eliminated much of Hezbollah's top leadership and displaced more than 1.2 million people, that it could effectively dictate terms. Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah was asked by a reporter on Wednesday about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements that Israel retained military freedom of action and would strike Hezbollah if it violated the deal. Fadlallah said the group would retain the right to defend itself if Israel attacked. U.S. President Joe Biden’s special envoy, Amos Hochstein, discussed the cease-fire agreement in an interview with NBC, highlighting the challenges in achieving it. Hochstein noted that Israel reached a point of significant military achievements and was advised to leverage them for political gains, emphasizing that lasting security can only be achieved through an agreement with Lebanon, not by imposing security measures. He added that Lebanon also faced a pivotal moment where difficult political decisions were necessary to demonstrate control over the country and concern for its citizens. 'We must be ready for renewed skirmishes or full-scale fighting' Overnight, the IDF struck three key border crossings between Syria and Lebanon, following a wave of 330 strikes in the 24 hours leading up to the cease-fire. The military emphasized its commitment to enforcing the agreement, which mandates the withdrawal of forces from Lebanon within 60 days while preventing Hezbollah's presence south of the Litani River and halting the transfer of weapons across Lebanon. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'There is an international mechanism led by the U.S., with representatives in Beirut, Northern Command and Tel Aviv, but we are not relying on it,' the IDF said. 'We must enforce the agreement ourselves and be ready for the possibility of renewed skirmishes or full-scale fighting. The achievements in Lebanon must be leveraged, and we remain focused. Implementation of the understandings will unfold gradually in the coming weeks.' The military warned of the need for public readiness to support enforcement strikes should violations occur. 'Israeli readiness to act is key. We may return to fighting—we are only on the first day of this arrangement. In some areas, there are mobile operations; in others, static deployments. Lebanese civilians will not return to border villages anytime soon. Tactical movements will occur, but forces are not leaving the area yet.' Regarding clashes with Lebanese residents, the IDF said: 'The incidents involve Lebanese individuals, including terrorists emerging from hiding and attempting to flee. Some were shot and detained, while others were killed or injured.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ymjyhm1g	2024-11-27T09:29:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/SkoHmyBQkx/SkoHmyBQkx_2_0_1105_622_0_small.jpg

Following ICC decision to issue arrest warrant for PM, UK courts would look at 'various issues including immunity' if he traveled there UK courts would assess whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is immune from arrest under international law if he visits the UK, a Downing Street spokesperson confirmed Wednesday. The process would involve determining whether to enforce the ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, former defense minister Yoav Gallant and a Hamas leader, with immunity among the legal issues to be reviewed. When asked if private discussions between the UK and Israel had taken place on the matter, a spokesperson for Labour leader Keir Starmer declined to comment. No. 10 also faced pressure to clarify its stance after France acknowledged Netanyahu’s immunity as a sitting head of government, noting that Israel is not a member of the ICC. While the UK has stated it supports the ICC, officials have not explicitly confirmed whether they would arrest Netanyahu. The Downing Street spokesperson said that the domestic legal process would assess 'various issues, including immunity,' adding that the government would not preempt this process. Asked if the UK was becoming isolated over its ICC position, with Germany also confirming it would not arrest Netanyahu, the spokesperson said it was up to other countries to enforce their own domestic legal processes.

Netanyahu notifies ICC of intention to appeal arrest warrants	PM decides to challenge court’s findings against him and former defense chief Gallant just before deadline; political allies suggest ignoring court and relying on Trump sanctions Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided Wednesday to notify the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague that Israel will appeal arrest warrants issued against him and former defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The decision came just hours before the deadline to appeal expired. The appeal, which will not suspend the warrants, challenges the ICC's findings before its appellate chamber. Legal experts advising Netanyahu argued that Israel has a strong case, citing flaws in the court’s decision. However, some ministers and officials opposed the move, advocating instead to ignore the ICC, deny its authority and rely on anticipated sanctions by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration to pressure the court into retracting the warrants, thus 'teaching the court a lesson.' 'The Americans are planning hellish sanctions against any country aiding the court and that will be the end of it,' a senior Israeli official said. 'We shouldn't beg a body we have no trust in,' he added despite some indicating Israel could manage the situation if an inquiry committee is established.

Military warns civilians against moving south as forces enforce cease-fire framework; 4 Hezbollah operatives, including commander, detained for entering restricted zone; 'If enforcement fails, we will apply even greater force,' IDF chief says IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee called on Lebanese civilians to avoid returning to their homes south of the Litani River between 5 p.m. Wednesday and 7 a.m. the following morning. 'Anyone south of the Litani must remain in place,' he said. Meanwhile, IDF forces detained four individuals who approached troops in southern Lebanon. A statement from the Prime Minister's Office later identified the suspects as Hezbollah operatives, including a local commander.

In Lebanon Hezbollah claims victory, others say nonsense	Son of slain Hezbollah leader posts video from his destroyed home in the Dahieh praising the 'fortitude and sacrifice' of Lebanese while the daily Nidaa al- Watan slams the terror group saying such a defeat is the 1st since Hezbollah's inception Son of slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Wednesday posted a video clip after he returned to his destroyed home in the Dahieh quarter of Beirut and praised the 'fortitude' and 'sacrifice' of the people claiming victory over Israel. Other residents of the Hezbollah stronghold celebrated the 'victory' chanting support for the Shiite terror group and Nasrallah. Residents of South Lebanon also returned home to their villages telling the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen network that they were overjoyed at the victory over Israel and that while they were back home, Israelis were still displaced from their homes in the Galilee. The Lebanese army handed out leaflets to returning villagers with warnings and explanations about the danger of munitions left on the ground. Lebanese Defense Minister Maurice Salim told the Qatari Al Jazeera network that 10,000 troops will be deployed to the south. 'We are committed to international decisions,' he said. 'Our sovereignty is based on the military's deployment on our southern border. There will be no other force in Lebanon other than our army and UNIFIL.'

In the report the paper said many of Hezbollah's leaders are no longer alive, 'We must all ask where is the victory without them? ' The paper said the alleged victory is in fact the destruction of villages along the border. 'Lebanon's first line of defense was destroyed, as was the second and the tunnels that connect the homes of civilians.' The report named other defeats presented as wins including the displacement of residents from the south and the country's inability to provide them with shelter throughout the war.

Merkel slams Netanyahu in post-political memoir	Former German chancellor accuses prime minister of undermining work toward two-state solution, and praises his predecessor: 'I could talk to Olmert'; expresses shock at antisemitic protests after October 7 massacre Angela Merkel says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu systematically undermined the possibility of a two-state solution by encouraging the settlement enterprise. 'We agreed to disagree,' Merkel, the former German Chancellor, writes in a memoir out on Tuesday. The book has aroused great interest since it is seen as a 'letter of defense' to claims that arose after the end of her term in 2021, centering around her responsibility for the immigrant crisis and dependence on Russian gas. In the book, Merkel not only answers these claims, but briefly deals with Israel and its leaders, and alongside the strong support she emphasizes for Israel and its right to defend itself - especially after the October 7 massacre. she wrote that unlike Netanyahu, she personally liked his predecessor Ehud Olmert because she could talk to him directly and openly, even about explosive problems and issues such as the Palestinian conflict. In the chapters where Merkel touches on her relationship with Netanyahu, nearly forgetting her German composure and accuses him of being someone whose policies sabotaged the possibility of resolving the Middle East conflict. Merkel's attitude toward Israel is much more sympathetic. She recalls her first visit to Israel as a government minister in 1991, shortly after the reunification of Germany. According to Merkel, Israel had a great academic reputation in East Germany, despite the isolation in the communist country where she grew up and lived until reunification. The visit came after years of indirect contact between Merkel and Israel: she grew up in East Germany, which did not have any relations or scientific ties with Israel, but for the purpose of her doctoral thesis in quantum chemistry she was helped by the works and studies of Israeli researchers and scientists, which were sent to her by American and British researchers. Merkel also discusses her last visit to Israel, 30 years after the first - and after she had already announced that she would step down as chancellor. It was a farewell visit where she met with then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. and made sure to visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. The most memorable visit for Merkel was in 2008, during the celebrations for the 60th year of the establishment of Israel. Merkel then gave a historic speech in the Knesset plenum, a speech which she began in Hebrew saying that Israel's security is part of Germany's 'raison d'etre' - a statement that became unofficial German policy in the region, and has been the basis of Berlin's support for Israel since the October 7 massacre. Merkel points out that during that trip she visited the home of David Ben-Gurion in Sde Boker in and told an inquisitive resident who wanted to know when she would return, 'I like the way you live and I can see myself moving here when I am no longer chancellor.' She writes that she was serious at the time but now doubts she would be able to. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the book, Merkel presents for the first time a reference to the October 7 massacre. She says that Israel is the only democracy in the region and is under constant existential threat - and expresses surprise and astonishment that after the murderous terrorist attack, instead of receiving solidarity and empathy, Israel and Jews experienced a huge wave of antisemitism and hatred in Germany and many other countries. She writes that she fully supports the right of citizens to demonstrate for the Palestinians and against the policies of Israel and Germany, but warns against abuse of the right to protest and freedom of speech. Everyone who lives in Germany, writes Merkel, is committed to its basic rules - including the fight against racism and antisemitism - and she says that action must be taken against those who do not meet this commitment by all possible means. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk505fv7kl	2024-11-27T05:13:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/10/04/8803588/8803588_0_46_980_552_0_small.jpg
Forces nab Iran arms smuggled for West Bank terror	IDF and Shin Bet thwart smuggling of advanced and plentiful mines, explosives, rifles and small arms sent by Tehran from Syria to bolster terror in West Bank The IDF and Shin Bet said on Wednesday that they had thwarted an effort to smuggle Iranian weapons sent to terror operatives in the West Bank. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said the weapons originated in Iran and were intended to arm terrorist operatives in the area of Jenin. 'Subsequently, another location was revealed where the majority of the cache was buried.' The Shin Bet refused to disclose the exact location of the bust. The operation led to the seizing of 'rockets, 40 powerful Claymore explosives of various types, some geared to activate remotely, bombs, mortar launchers, sniper rifles and additional weapons.' The details of the intercepted shipment revealed that it had been sent by Unit 4000, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence's special operations division. According to the IDF, the shipment included '33 improvised Claymore explosives, wireless activation systems for Claymore explosives, six RPG-7 launchers, three 107mm rockets, 24 RPG-18 and RPG-22 rockets, 40 standard large Claymore explosives including detonators, two 60mm mortar barrels, 20 60mm mortar shells, six long M16 rifles and one M4 rifle and with ammunition, seven Hunter sniper rifles and 37 pistols (Glock and XD-9).' The IDF and Shin Bet identified Jawad Ghafari, and the Special Operations Unit of the Quds Force in Syria, as responsible for the shipment. They said that the delivery had been coordinated with the Quds Force's special operations unit in Syria (18840), under the command of Unit 840 leader Etsar Bakri.

Following Hezbollah cease-fire, Hamas signals willingness to adva...	Despite Hamas' upper echelon decimated by Israeli forces, existing leadership inside the enclave have congratulated Lebanon on the cease-fire with Israel, saying the group would welcome a similar agreement that would include return of the hostages As the agreement between Israel and Lebanon unfolded, a senior member of Hamas' political bureau declared on Wednesday that the Gaza-based organization is 'ready for a cease-fire agreement,' which would also include a deal for the release of hostages. In an interview with the French news agency AFP, the official praised progress in Lebanon, calling it 'a major achievement for the resistance' and 'a victory.' The Hamas official further stated that the organization had informed mediators in Egypt, Qatar and Turkey of its willingness to reach a cease-fire agreement and a 'serious hostage deal.' However, he accused Israel of having disrupted previous progress on such negotiations. Despite cautious optimism expressed by the Hamas official, reports from Gaza on Wednesday morning described renewed attacks, including heavy artillery shelling and gunfire near Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern part of the Strip. Sami Abu Zuhri, another senior Hamas figure, told Reuters that the group 'appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza.' Meanwhile, reports from Gaza indicated that displaced residents staying at a school in Beit Lahia were instructed to leave the area and move through a humanitarian corridor to Gaza City, hinting at preparations for further strikes in the region. At the same time, other reports noted that, through international coordination, several wounded patients and their companions were evacuated from Gaza Wednesday morning to receive medical treatment in the UAE, Jordan and Egypt. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) addressed the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, stating that 'hunger has reached critical levels, with people scavenging through weeks-old garbage for food scraps.' The agency warned that 'with winter approaching, conditions are rapidly worsening, and survival is impossible without immediate humanitarian aid.' In recent weeks, Israel reached out to Turkey, signaling openness to Turkish involvement in mediation efforts for a hostage deal. While senior officials in both Israel and the White House have repeatedly denied this, President Joe Biden mentioned in his Tuesday address regarding the Lebanon cease-fire that 'the U.S. will also work with Turkey to push for an agreement in Gaza.'

He said that as long as fighting continued in Gaza, Hezbollah would continue its attacks.

Netanyahu has hours to decide whether to appeal ICC's arrest warr...	Prime minister must respond to top UN court by midnight; Experts recommend that Israel appeal while lawmakers pushto wait for assumed Trump administration sanctions Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must decide on Wednesday whether Israel will notify the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague of its intention to appeal the arrest warrants against him and former defense minister Yoav Gallant or ignore them and wait for sanctions to be imposed by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration against the court. Experts recommended that Netanyahu appeal, arguing that Israel has a 'case' and that the decision is flawed. On the other hand, ministers and other officials oppose this, believing Israel should ignore the warrants since an appeal would implicitly acknowledge the court's authority. The deadline to respond regarding Israel's intent to appeal is midnight. On Tuesday, Netanyahu held a classified discussion on the arrest warrants but no decision was made. Earlier, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot was asked whether Netanyahu could be arrested if he visited France following the warrants issued against him by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. 'Questions of potential immunity for certain officials must be examined,' he said. Such a statement increases the likelihood of an appeal. Israel believes there’s a sense of international opposition to the issuing of the warrants. Barrot told the France Info news site that 'France is deeply committed to international justice and will act in accordance with international law based on its obligations to cooperate with the International Criminal Court,' stressing that the court's law 'addresses questions of immunity for certain leaders, which is ultimately subject to judicial authority.' Israeli lawmakers suggested ignoring the pending warrants and giving the court a 'lesson' through paralyzing sanctions they believe the incoming Trump administration will impose, 'forcing them to back down.' 'The Americans are planning hellish sanctions against any country aiding the court and that will be the end of it,' a senior Israeli official said. 'We shouldn't beg a body we have no trust in,' he added despite some indicating Israel could manage the situation if an inquiry committee is established. Given the harsh reactions from senior members of Trump's incoming administration, Jerusalem is inclined to refrain from appealing and wait for developments on the international stage, particularly the anticipated severe response once the new U.S. administration assumes office on January 20. 'I predict the court will ultimately back down due to the unprecedented pressure that will be exerted on it,' An Israeli official familiar with the details said last week. 'They’ve never encountered anything like this. They’ll be begging us to give them a way out. After learning a lesson that will knock them down a peg, we might consider helping them climb down from their tree.'

Residents of north afraid to return home despite cease-fire	While Netanyahu specified the reasons for the cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah, evacuated residents are not buying it, saying that returning now is tantamount to surrender; 'I’m not buying it. We saw what they did to the poor residents in the south' Fourteen months after Hezbollah joined Hamas in the fight against Israel, a cease-fire took effect at 4:00 a.m. on Wednesday, announced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a pre-recorded televised statement. But for residents who were evacuated from their homes in northern Israel over a year ago, the agreement offers little reassurance. Many are rejecting its terms outright, claiming it fails to provide the basic security they deserve. Many families from northern Israel are demanding to stay in their evacuation locations until at least the end of the school year, unwilling to uproot their children from their current schools. 'From the moment we were evacuated, we’ve been dreaming of going back home to Kiryat Shmona,' Yifat Elmalich, a mother of three, told Ynet. 'But we want to return with full security, to give our kids freedom, to heal emotionally, and to bring them back mentally healthy.' She shared the heavy fears weighing on her and the difficulty of making a decision. 'We don’t want to go back to a life of constant fear – of rockets falling or terrorists infiltrating. This agreement feels weak and not in our favor. I have three daughters in different schools, and just as hard as it was to uproot them from the city, it will be just as hard to uproot them from here in the middle of the school year. For now, we’re leaning toward staying put. Our house was damaged by shrapnel, and we still don’t feel fully safe in the city.' Hofit Mor, who was evacuated with her husband and four children from Moshav Kfar Yuval in the Upper Galilee, is also skeptical. 'I’m against the agreement. It feels like it’s bringing us back to square one, to where we were before the war,' she said. 'Right now, I’m staying in the Jezreel Valley and letting my children finish the school year here so they don’t have to go through more upheaval. Beyond that, our house is only 100 yards from the border. I was born and raised in Kfar Yuval, but after seeing the disaster in the Gaza border region, we realized the danger we were living in. Under these conditions, I’m not going back.' Tali Hassin, also from Kfar Yuval and a mother of four, is renting an apartment in Afula, where her children are enrolled in local schools. 'Our home in the moshav took a direct hit; it’s uninhabitable. There’s no water, no electricity, some of the walls are destroyed, and the entire house is covered in soot. On one hand, the kids want to go back to their friends and to their familiar spaces at home. But on the other hand, there’s immense anxiety about returning. Once the house is repaired and we can organize our belongings, there’s a chance we’ll consider it – of course, only if there’s peace and security. As it stands, I’m not going back. I have nowhere to live, and there’s not enough quiet to feel safe.' Michael Biton, 77, a resident of Kiryat Shmona for 67 years, has been staying in the student dormitories at Yezreel Valley College. 'My wife and I, along with our three children and 13 grandchildren – all residents of Kiryat Shmona – are now living near each other in the dormitories. Since 1967, we’ve lived under fire from Lebanon. In 1969, my wife was injured by rockets and left disabled. There was maybe a 20-year pause, but since then, Hezbollah has grown into a terror monster.' 'For the residents of the north, this agreement isn’t a solution – it’s a threat' 'My wife and I will return because we have nowhere else to go,' he added, 'but our children won’t come back until the school year ends. My grandchildren are enrolled in schools here in the Jezreel Valley.' Still, he stressed, 'if the agreement is violated, we’ll have no choice but to pack our bags and leave for good. 'I lost my brother and two nephews in a bombing attack in the city in 1973. Despite that, we stayed. We love the city deeply. On holidays and weekends, all of Israel comes to visit us. In my eyes, Kiryat Shmona is the most beautiful city in the world, and I dream of returning to it. I want to live the rest of my life there in peace,' he concluded. Nava Erez, 76, from Kibbutz Hanita in the western Galilee, also has been staying in the student dormitories at Yezreel Valley College, along with her daughter and grandson. 'Since yesterday, my stomach has been in knots from all the uncertainty, from not knowing what’s going to happen with my life,' she said. 'My house suffered minor damage from a missile blast, but it’s still livable. The moment the community leaders tell me it’s safe to return, I’ll grab my grandson and load up all our belongings. Only the council leaders and community managers know the area and are responsible for us. If the prime minister tells me to go home, with all due respect, my peers and I will wait for their instructions.' Residents of Shlomi, evacuated over a year ago to the Royal Hotel in Jerusalem, are voicing deep fears over the new Israel-Lebanon agreement, which they believe fails to deliver real security. Among them is Inbar Ben Harush, a mother of two teenagers. Speaking to Ynet, she didn’t hold back. 'This is a catastrophe for all of Israel, especially for us in the north. It’s basically saying, ‘Prepare to be conquered in the Galilee.’ Hezbollah will return to the villages in southern Lebanon, rearm, and rebuild their tunnels. It’s only a matter of time.' For Inbar, residents feel completely overlooked in the decision-making process. 'The leadership doesn’t care about us. Our opinions, the opinions of our children—they mean nothing to them. Nobody asked us, nobody consulted the local authorities, and the fact is, everyone opposes this agreement. It’s going to cost us our children’s lives.' She didn’t mince words about her lost faith in those in power. 'We’ve lost trust in our government and its leadership. Maybe we can still restore faith in the IDF, but the lies we’ve been told for years won’t disappear overnight. Once again, they’re blatantly lying to us, saying: ‘Go back; everything will be fine.’ I’m not buying it. We saw what they did to the poor residents in the south.' Matan Davidian, 36, shares her concerns and is even more blunt, calling the deal 'a surrender agreement.' 'We’re going home to a situation far worse than the one we left,' he said. 'In the past, when there was fire from Lebanon, we responded immediately. Now, we’ll need approval from other countries, which means we won’t respond at all – we’ll just ‘contain.’ Our children can’t be human shields.' Matan pointed out that Hezbollah’s threat is far greater than just holding anti-tank missiles. 'They’re firing them from villages in southern Lebanon – villages this agreement will let them return to. We’ve been warning for years that Hezbollah has a plan to invade the Galilee. Hamas just acted on their plan faster. They would’ve taken over Nahariya and Haifa. This agreement doesn’t eliminate that threat.' He also stressed the need for a proper security buffer zone in the north. 'There must be a buffer zone at least 6 miles deep, controlled by the IDF, to ensure there are no rockets or tunnels. Residents of southern Lebanon saying they’ll return to their homes? They’re part of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force.'

'If they tell me to go back tomorrow, I’ll take my kids and move somewhere else. Anyone with common sense would do the same,' Matan declared. Inbar added, 'We’re willing to stay here another year or even two if we have to, but we’ll only return when there’s real security, not just a ‘sense of security.’' Matan called on the government to reevaluate its approach and rebuild trust. 'The government needs to think carefully and restore both security and faith. For the residents of the north, this agreement isn’t a solution – it’s a threat.' Inbar wrapped up with a plea. 'We truly want to go back, just not like this. Let families with children in schools stay where they are. Changing schools again isn’t an option, especially not in the middle of the school year, and especially during matriculation exams. Let the kids finish the year. They’ve lost enough already – don’t make life harder for them.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy004av4qyg	2024-11-27T00:15:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/ryVzw0PmX1l/ryVzw0PmX1l_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said on Wednesday the group 'appreciates' Lebanon's right to reach an agreement that protects its people, and it hopes for a deal to end the war in Gaza. 'Hamas appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza,' Abu Zuhri told Reuters. Abu Zuhri blamed the failure to reach a cease-fire deal that would end the Gaza war on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly accused Hamas of foiling efforts. 'Hamas showed high flexibility to reach an agreement and it is still committed to that position and is interested in reaching an agreement that ends the war in Gaza,' Abu Zuhri said. 'The problem was always with Netanyahu who has always escaped from reaching an agreement,' he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rya4clemkl	2024-11-26T23:55:22-08:00

Israel appeals to Turkey to help mediate Hamas hostage deal	Government is willing to receive Erdogan's help in pressuring Hamas to complete a new deal despite repeated denials and the Turkish president's anti-Israel rhetoric as Hamas' power center moves to Istanbul Israel reached out to Turkey in recent weeks expressing willingness to receive its help in mediation efforts for a potential hostage deal with Hamas in Gaza. Despite repeated denials from senior Israeli and White House officials, U.S. President Joe Biden mentioned in his speech on Tuesday regarding the cease-fire in Lebanon that 'over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza.' Amid these discussions, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar completed a secret visit to Turkey about 10 days ago. A senior Israeli official clarified that Turkey wouldn't act as a mediator in the hostage deal but could exert pressure on Hamas, especially since some of its leadership recently relocated from Qatar to Istanbul. A White House official similarly denied Turkey's direct involvement in Gaza. 'I think President Biden was referring to the fact that certain parties involved are currently in Turkey, which brought it into the picture,' according to the official. 'This wasn’t to suggest that Turkey is mediating or negotiating. That said, we’ll leave no stone unturned in trying to make progress.' The inclusion of Turkey in these efforts is contentious within Israel's leadership, partly due to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s positions and actions since the war began. For example, President Isaac Herzog’s visit to the UN climate summit in Baku was recently canceled in part because Turkey refused to allow Herzog’s plane to fly over its airspace. Erdogan, who claimed that Turkey had severed diplomatic ties with Israel two weeks ago though Jerusalem had not been formally notified, boasted about preventing Herzog’s plane from crossing Turkish airspace. 'Turkey is committed to demonstrating its stance on several issues and we will do so,' he said. Since the war’s outbreak, Erdogan has frequently criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s policies in Gaza, following the October 7 massacre and the onset of the war. About a month into the war, Erdogan declared that 'Israel is a terrorist state committing genocide in Gaza' and claimed that 'Hamas is a party that won the elections in Palestine,' even though the last elections held n Gaza took place in 2006 and Hamas took control of the territory in 2007 after clashes with Fatah. In April, during a Turkish parliamentary session amid the ongoing war, chants of 'Death to Israel' were heard from the gallery while Erdogan praised Hamas and in an unprecedented statement accused Israel of orchestrating attempted coups in Turkey over the past decades. 'Hamas is a resistance movement, not a terrorist organization. Israel? It has surpassed Hitler,' he said. Erdogan's rhetoric has continued in recent months. In September, he called on Muslim nations worldwide to unite against what he referred to as 'the expansionist threat' of Israel in the Middle East, alleging that Israel seeks to conquer regional states. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Israel won’t stop at Gaza. After seizing Ramallah, it will target the lands of Syria and Lebanon,' Erdogan asserted, further claiming that Israel might even aim to occupy Turkey. 'They’ll set their sights on our homeland, between the Tigris and Euphrates. That’s why we say 'Hamas resists on behalf of Muslims.' That’s why we say 'Hamas isn’t only defending Gaza but Islamic lands, including Turkey,'' he declared. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvxusvxkx	2024-11-26T23:25:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/HJ4i3XEQ1l/HJ4i3XEQ1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

ICC decision breaches its own foundational principles'	former Canadian justice minister Irwin Cotler, who liaises with Netanyahu and ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan, discusses life under Iranian assassination threats, urges international unity against authoritarian regimes’ transnational repression Irwin Cotler, a prominent human rights advocate and former Canadian justice minister, sat down this week with The Media Line for a comprehensive interview. The conversation spanned critical issues such as assassination threats against him from the Iranian regime, the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) actions against Israeli leaders including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the broader implications for international justice and democracy. In May, Cotler shared about the challenges Israel faces on the international stage, including allegations of war crimes, the ICC’s actions and the global rise in antisemitism, which Cotler described as a threat not only to Jews but to democracies worldwide. A year under threat: The Iranian regime’s targeting of Cotler Cotler began by revealing the profound personal impact on him and his family of being targeted by the Iranian regime. In November 2023, upon returning from Washington, DC, he and his wife were met by Canadian law enforcement at Montreal’s Trudeau Airport. 'I was told then, to use their words, that there was credible evidence of ‘an imminent and lethal threat,’' Cotler recounted. 'From then on, I had 24-7 protection, which included armored cars outside my house' and 'security people accompanying me on any encounter that I was engaged in, whether I went to a medical appointment or whether I went to a family gathering.' For over a year, Cotler lived under constant surveillance and security measures, a reality he initially kept private. The situation became public following a detailed front-page report by The Globe and Mail, which prompted both houses of the Canadian Parliament to unanimously condemn the Iranian regime’s assassination threats and express support for Cotler’s advocacy work. 'In a rather divisive Parliament, which we have in Canada … to get a unanimous resolution of both houses of Parliament is highly unusual,' Cotler noted. 'I hope that sends a message … to the Iranian regime that their culture of impunity will not persist, that they will be held accountable, but equally to the Iranian people, that we stand in solidarity with them.' The roots of Iran’s hostility: Cotler’s advocacy against the regime Cotler attributed the Iranian regime’s animosity toward him to his decadeslong, outspoken criticism of their actions. 'I recall that the 21st century began with, on January 3, 2000, the supreme leader of Iran saying … there can be no resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict without the annihilation of the Jewish state,' Cotler stated. 'This open and public call for genocide is a standalone violation of the Genocide Convention.' He emphasized that such rhetoric constitutes incitement to genocide, a punishable offense under international law irrespective of subsequent actions. Cotler has consistently called for holding the Iranian leadership accountable for what he describes as a 'sevenfold threat': Nuclear ambitions: Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons capability. Ballistic missile development: Enhancement of missile technology that could deliver nuclear payloads. Sponsorship of terrorism: Being the leading state sponsor of international terrorism. Regional hegemony: Exerting influence through proxy groups like Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis. Transnational repression: Engaging in international assassination plots and suppression of dissidents abroad. Cybersecurity threats: Conducting cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, and Massive domestic repression: Systematic violations of human rights within Iran. 'My advocacy has always been … pro-Iranian, pro-the Iranian people,' Cotler emphasized. 'It has been against the Iranian regime, which I feel is betraying its own heritage, its own values, and its own people.' Cotler has been instrumental in advocating for the designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization—a move Canada adopted six months ago after years of his lobbying efforts. Cotler asserted that Iran’s targeting of him is part of a broader pattern of transnational repression executed by authoritarian regimes. 'This is a larger phenomenon than myself,' he said. 'It’s a looking glass into the need to combat the Iranian regime’s culture of criminality and impunity, and to support more the Iranian people, who are the targets of massive domestic repression.' He cited the cases of Masih Alinejad, an Iranian American journalist and women’s rights advocate who faced assassination attempts, and former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who was targeted by Iranian operatives. Cotler called for a unified international response to counter such threats. 'I’ve recommended to the Canadian government that they establish a separate department and agency to deal with the phenomenon of transnational repression and assassination,' he revealed. 'It needs to be prioritized on the agenda, and we need to set aside the necessary resources and manpower for that purpose.' The threats have profoundly altered Cotler’s daily life, restricting his personal freedoms and impacting his family. 'I have security 24-7. I no longer have any freedom of movement because I must be accompanied in whatever I do,' he explained. 'It’s made a major change in our life.' He shared a poignant anecdote involving his granddaughter, who, upon seeing the security presence, innocently asked: 'Ima [Mom], tell me the truth. I’ll still love Saba [Grandpa]. I’ll still love him. ... What crime did he commit?' Cotler also expressed disappointment over missing significant personal events due to security concerns, such as his 60th law school reunion at McGill University. 'I was very much looking forward to it. … But then my security people got word … that there was apparently evidence of an imminent and lethal assassination attempt within the next 48 hours,' he said. 'Of course, I could not go to my law school reunion.' The ICC and Israel: Scrutinizing Karim Khan’s actions A significant portion of the discussion focused on the International Criminal Court’s actions against Israeli leaders, specifically Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. Cotler was critical of ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan’s approach. 'I believe that he has gone about this in a wrong way,' Cotler asserted. 'The special prosecutor should be called out for the manner in which … he has not adhered to his own principle of cooperation.' Cotler elaborated on his attempts to facilitate dialogue between Khan and the Israeli leadership. 'At the request of the special prosecutor, Karim Khan, and with the cooperation of the prime minister of Israel, I helped facilitate meetings between them,' he explained. 'Well, on the very day that the ICC’s team was supposed to come to Israel … Karim Khan, the special prosecutor, peremptorily canceled that visit and on the same day held a press conference … calling for arrest warrants against both Netanyahu and Gallant, along with Hamas leaders.' Cotler viewed this move as a breach of the ICC’s foundational principles. 'To me, that was a breach of his own principle of cooperation, let alone also the principle of complementarity,' he emphasized. Cotler added that when he heard Khan was going to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant, he told the ICC prosecutor, 'If you do that, the effect will be to incentivize … antisemitism as well.' Cotler accused Khan of applying double standards, contrasting the ICC’s leniency toward Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro with its aggressive stance on Israel: 'Previously he [Khan] had visited with the Venezuelan dictator Maduro. … He agreed not to institute arrest warrants with respect to the Venezuelan dictator … but yet he called for arrest warrants against the prime minister and defense minister of a fellow democracy.' 'You can’t go ahead and give the Venezuelan dictatorship a waiver from an arrest warrant because you said you cooperated with them, and then call for an arrest warrant against a democracy when they have been willing to cooperate and you have not cooperated with them,' Cotler argued. He underscored the importance of the principle of complementarity, which holds that the ICC should defer to a country’s own judicial processes if they are robust and independent. 'I have taken the view that Israel always had to use the very words of the prosecutor, Karim Khan himself, ‘a robust and independent judiciary,’ and that should be sufficient for purposes of combating an ICC warrant,' he stated. Cotler has strongly advocated for Israel to establish an independent state commission of inquiry to investigate any alleged misconduct, which he believes would strengthen Israel’s position against the ICC's charges. He revealed that he has directly communicated this recommendation to Prime Minister Netanyahu and former defense chief Gallant. 'Well, I have conveyed that to the prime minister before,' Cotler stated. 'I've said that I believe that there should be an independent commission of inquiry. I'm just reaffirming now what I've said before and have conveyed to him.' When asked if there was any chance the arrest warrants could be revoked, Cotler expressed optimism. 'I do believe that it can be pushed back,' he affirmed. 'I recommended directly to the prime minister and to … Yoav Gallant, at the time the defense minister. … The defense minister was responsive to this, but I believe that Israel should have and still should establish an independent state commission of inquiry.' He explained that such a commission would demonstrate Israel's commitment to investigating any allegations internally, thereby reinforcing the principle of complementarity. 'That would allow the prosecutor to clearly state that Israel is undertaking its own independent investigation,' he explained. 'Under the principle of complementarity, the ICC should not substitute its judgment for that of an independent judiciary and an independent legal process.' Cotler noted significant public support within Israel for such a commission. 'The last polling I saw showed a dramatic support for that amongst the Israeli public. Over 70% were in favor of such an independent state commission of inquiry, only 8% against,' he shared. 'The United States has called what the ICC has done as outrageous, given as well the false moral equivalence that has been created between a democracy like Israel … and not only a terrorist organization, but a genocidal antisemitic terrorist organization like Hamas' Cotler expressed concern that the ICC’s actions could have serious repercussions for Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, potentially restricting their international travel. 'The community of democracies … have said, with the exception of Germany … that they would abide by the decision [to arrest Israeli leaders],' he said. 'I believe that … there are sufficient grounds, both with respect to the evidence and with respect to the law, for a democracy … to say that while it has been a founding member of the ICC … it can refuse to institute the arrest warrant.' He criticized the ICC’s alleged moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. 'The United States has called what the ICC has done as outrageous, given as well the false moral equivalence that has been created between a democracy like Israel … and not only a terrorist organization, but a genocidal antisemitic terrorist organization like Hamas,' Cotler remarked. Addressing the question of the ICC’s jurisdiction over Israel, which is not a member state, Cotler explained the complexities involved. 'We filed a brief with the ICC saying that they had no jurisdiction because Israel was not a state party and Palestine was not yet a state,' he recounted. 'However … Palestine was admitted as a state party to the ICC. … The ICC, in a majority judgment, did say that it had a jurisdiction.' Despite disagreeing with this decision, Cotler acknowledged that the ICC’s stance complicates the legal landscape. 'We have strong enough arguments … to call on both the ICC to reverse its decision, the special prosecutor to withdraw the arrest warrants,' he asserted. Cotler discussed the responses from international leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, who have criticized the ICC’s actions. While Trump suggested imposing sanctions on Karim Khan, Cotler advised against such measures. 'I’m not in favor of sanctioning the ICC,' he stated. 'I prefer the route of calling out the decisions as being outrageous, which they are, but not of imposing sanctions.' He emphasized the importance of addressing the issue through legal and diplomatic channels, maintaining the integrity of international justice systems. Cotler addressed concerns about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s stance, as Canada is a founding member of the ICC and may be obligated to enforce arrest warrants. 'I believe that we can independently say why we would not honor an arrest warrant,' Cotler said. 'I hope to be meeting with him shortly and to convey that personally to him.' He suggested that Canada’s legal framework provides grounds to refuse compliance with the ICC warrants, especially given the circumstances. Throughout the interview, Cotler stressed the critical need for democracies to stand united against authoritarian regimes and uphold the principles of justice. 'This must serve as a wake-up call … for the community of democracies,' he urged. 'We need to have the other G7 countries [take action].' He criticized actions like Australia’s refusal to allow former Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked to enter the country for a security conference. 'I thought that was shocking. … Punishing the leaders of that democracy without any basis whatsoever,' Cotler remarked. 'That’s the only way I can characterize what the Australian government did.' Finding hope amid challenges Despite the grave issues discussed, Cotler concluded on a hopeful note, expressing faith in the eventual triumph of justice and democratic values. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I’m a strong believer in what Martin Luther King said, that in the end of the day, the arc of history will bend towards justice,' he reflected. 'While we are going through difficult times, I do believe that at the end of the day, the arc of history will bend towards justice.' When asked about what he misses most due to the security constraints, Cotler shared: 'I just miss the freedom that my family could have to live a normal life with freedom of movement. … I would love to be able to go back to the normal movement of any citizen in any democracy.' He also expressed gratitude for the support he has received: 'I’m very encouraged by the strong support of both houses of the Canadian Parliament … and the very, very strong support that I’ve gotten from the Iranian people themselves.' 'In the end, justice will prevail,' Cotler affirmed.

Turkey is helping mediate a hostage deal at Israel's request	In recent weeks, Israel has turned to Turkey to join the mediation efforts in an attempt to reach a hostage deal in the Gaza Strip. This comes after Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar secretly visited Turkey about 10 days ago. An Israeli senior official clarified at the time that the Turks would not be mediators in a hostage deal, adding that they could help put pressure on Hamas, since part of the organization's leadership recently left Qatar and is in Istanbul.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkbsysv7yl	2024-11-26T21:43:32-08:00	
Hamas official says 'Ready for a cease-fire in Gaza as well'	A Hamas official said that 'the organization is ready for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip after the settlement in Lebanon,' the French news agency AFP reported.

We are ready for a serious cease-fire agreement and a serious prisoner exchange agreement.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj6jrev7kx	2024-11-26T21:41:22-08:00	
IDF could start withdrawing from Lebanon within hours	The cease-fire started at 4 a.m., and under the approved agreement the IDF must leave over the next 60 days, but a senior US official says this withdraw could begin shortly; It will include removal of dozens of Israeli flags that IDF soldiers have placed in Lebanese army posts The cabinet approved a cease-fire agreement in Lebanon that requires the IDF should to withdraw within 60 days, but the Americans say that the process may be shorter and, in fact, the withdrawal from southern Lebanon may begin within the next day. In the day before the cease-fire went into effect, the IDF launched non-stop attacks in Daheih and in central Beirut and other areas in Lebanon, including on the Syrian border. Hezbollah, for its part, launched non-stop volleys to the north, and also fired into the Hadera area. But at 4:00 a.m., the shooting stopped and the cease-fire began, which, unlike the one in Gaza during the hostage deal, is supposed to be permanent, not temporary. The IDF's withdrawal from Lebanon will be gradual and may begin as early as Wednesday under heavy air cover. It will also include the removal of dozens of Israeli flags that IDF soldiers have placed in Lebanese army posts and positions they have occupied in Lebanese territory. A senior U.S. official said that during this two-month period the 'Lebanese army forces will begin deploying in the south. This is a process that cannot happen overnight or within days. This is intended to prevent the situation from creating a vacuum. We are not saying that at the end of the 60 days the IDF will withdraw, but much before. This will be a gradual withdrawal in several areas where the IDF is present. The Israelis will withdraw completely no later than 60 days, perhaps as early as the 50th day.' The official added that, 'unlike previous agreements, especially in 2006, this time there is an agreed-upon map. The Lebanese army will receive permission from the Lebanese government to deploy and fulfill its mission and guarantee that they will deploy in the south and make sure that Hezbollah moves to the north, and that all its heavy weapons are removed. They will patrol the area and guarantee that if any infrastructure or weapons remain they will be removed and it will not be possible to rebuild such infrastructure in this area.' The enforcement mechanism will be upgraded, he said. 'The U.S. and France will join an existing mechanism that was created shortly after the Second Lebanon War and includes UNIFIL, Israel and Lebanon. The U.S. will head that mechanism, and will receive complaints from both sides for any possible violation.' We will work with the Lebanese Army to make sure every violation is addressed. There will be no American soldiers in the area, but there will be military assistance to the Lebanese army in cooperation with the French army.' He noted that 'there is another element called the Joint Military Commission, - which includes the armies of other countries that will provide equipment, training and financial resources to the Lebanese army and the Lebanese security services. Unlike in the Second Lebanon War, here we are obliged to stay on the ground, see what is happening and follow Hezbollah or other terrorist organizations.' The same senior American emphasized the importance of rebuilding Lebanon. 'From the lessons of the past, Hezbollah was the only one that did reconstruction work in southern Lebanon. This time it is in the interest of all of us to support economic growth and rebuild Lebanon. Hezbollah is very weak militarily and this is the opportunity for Lebanon to exercise sovereignty over its territory, elect a president and attract foreign investors so that it can return to economic normality and independence.' 'Israel had great achievements on the battlefield, but it is impossible to achieve long-term security only on the battlefield,' he clarified. 'This requires a political solution that is supported by the military achievements. Hezbollah did not ask permission from the people of Lebanon when it decided to join the Hamas attacks. This is a war that most Lebanese did not want, and it is important that they be able to return home safely.' He referred to the speech of U.S. President Joe Biden, saying that the president 'made it clear that if there is an immediate threat to Israel, then Israel - like any country in a similar situation - will have to deal with it. If we use the tools we have in Lebanon and don't take our eyes off the ground this will not be necessary. We are confident that if Israeli action is necessary it will not happen soon and, in any case, it will be rare. The same senior official expressed hope that the agreement in Lebanon will lead to an agreement in Gaza as well. 'What happened today has the potential to be a game-changer in Gaza. If there is anything that can put pressure on Hamas, on people who do not really care about the lives of their people and even their own lives - it is the reality, in which they see that Hezbollah has decided to abandon them. This can lead to a change in the reality on the ground.' He emphasized that President-elect Donald Trump's people were informed about the contacts: 'President Biden thinks that normalization is the ultimate change in the Middle East.

Only the people of Lebanon should make decisions through the speaker of the Parliament, the prime minister, and if, God willing, he is elected, then through the president.' Addressing the Israeli claim that the United States threatened not veto future resolutions in the Security Council if there was no agreement, the senior American official said: 'No. This point did not come up.

I live in fear for the girls who are still there': Former hostag...	Agam Goldstein-Almog, 18, was freed from captivity a year ago, but the memory of the women she was forced to leave behind still haunts her; 'If something happens to them, I don’t know how I’ll live with the fact that I was the last one to see them,' she says 'It took me time to understand I was back in Israel,' said 18-year-old Agam Goldstein-Almog, reflecting on her release from captivity a year ago in an interview with Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'I feel like I’m living a step forward and a step back, unable to comprehend that this is my reality – what happened to me and my family.' Agam was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza along with her younger brothers, Gal and Tal, and her mother, Chen, during the brutal attack on October 7. Her father, Nadav, and her older sister, Yam, were murdered in the assault. After 51 days in captivity, Agam and her family were released, but she now speaks for the women she met in the tunnels who remain in captivity. 'If I had known a year ago that I would leave the women who were with me and they would still be there, I would have said goodbye differently. I would have been sorry. I was sure they’d be freed a day or two after us,' she said. 'I knew nothing – not even when I’d be released. And honestly, I still don’t feel free because they are still there.' Agam’s voice trembled as she continued: 'If something happens to them, I don’t know how I’ll live with myself, knowing I was the last one to see them, that I delivered messages from them to their families. The danger to life there is constant, every single day.' 'People tell us we’re a miracle – that it’s amazing we’re here. But I can’t feel that joy, that sense of a miracle. The sharp transition from Gaza to Israel – I still can’t grasp it. In so many ways, I’m still living there, trapped in the fear for the women who are still in captivity. A year has passed, but it only amplifies the pain and confusion. Where are they? How are they?' Over the past year, Agam has struggled to adjust to a new home and a shattered family. 'My daily life has completely changed. Every action I take is weighed down by a heavy sense of unease,' she said. 'Every decision, big or small, feels overwhelming. I often feel like there’s no point to anything. It’s hard to get out of bed because I can’t believe the reality I’m waking up to – without my father, my sister, my home, or those women still captive.' Describing the emptiness, she added: 'It’s hard to be in this new, incomplete family dynamic. Home, which should feel comforting and whole, sometimes feels unbearable with what remains. I still have so much, but I’ve lost so much, too. I ask myself, when will I finally feel at home? When will this feel like my family? When will I wake up in the morning and not feel this pain, not long so desperately for what I’ve lost? When will I be able to accept what’s left and be grateful for it? Many times, I feel alone in my sorrow.' Now, a year after returning, Agam has a message for Israelis: 'I hope the country remembers the joy of our return – how people could finally breathe again when we came back. Yes, we returned to grief and mourning, but we were here. Let’s recreate that joy by bringing everyone back. It cannot end any other way.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She added: 'Knowing so many people were waiting for me gave me strength. I immediately told my mom that the women still in captivity had to see it – the goodness of people, the soldiers who took care of me after Gaza. Each of those encounters slowly restored my faith, showing me there’s still good in the world. I hope those left behind will have a chance to feel that goodness, too. We must bring all the hostages home. These are our people. They’ve been suffering for so long, and this is a reality we must never accept.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy79kammyx	2024-11-26T20:15:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/yk14162618/yk14162618_1_370_1890_1064_0_small.jpg

Avivi warns: Israel will 'do the job' if Hezbollah threat persist...	Brigadier general points out Israel is counting on Trump administration to address the root of the issue: Iran If Lebanon and the international community fail to ensure that Hezbollah and its weapons remain far from Israel’s northern border, then 'Israel will do the job,' according to Brigadier General (Res.) Amir Avivi. Avivi made this statement shortly before Israel announced its agreement to a U.S.-brokered temporary ceasefire with Lebanon. The deal includes a timeline for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon within 60 days. 'The most important thing for Israeli society, and I think overall for the government, is to make sure that we're able to impose the reality where Hezbollah cannot rebuild itself again. This is the most crucial thing,' Avivi told ILTV. Speaking ahead of the final agreement, Avivi was unable to comment on whether he believed it would achieve its objectives. The deal outlines several key measures: the IDF will withdraw fully from Lebanon within 60 days, and the U.S. will facilitate negotiations to resolve 13 disputed border points between Israel and Lebanon. The Lebanese army will take control of the border region in southern Lebanon, with UNIFIL returning to oversee the area and a temporary U.S. force deployed to ensure the agreement’s implementation. An international commission will monitor Hezbollah’s compliance with the agreement, while the Lebanese army is tasked with continuing to dismantle Hezbollah’s military infrastructure. Israel retains the right to respond to any violations without seeking prior approval. The Israeli Security Cabinet approved the deal late Tuesday night with a vote of 10 to 1. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after thanking U.S. President Joe Biden for his efforts in brokering the agreement, stated, 'The length of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon. We will enforce the agreement and respond forcefully to any violation. We will continue united until victory.' Despite the agreement, Avivi emphasized that the ceasefire is only a temporary measure. He pointed out that Israel is counting on a broader strategy, particularly with the incoming U.S. administration under President Donald Trump, to address the root of the issue: Iran. 'It needs to be dealt with militarily with an airstrike, a major airstrike, or two or three, whatever is needed to dismantle all these nuclear sites and military sites and really bring down the Shia axis,' Avivi explained. 'Attacking Iran can make a change.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfhqmn71g	2024-11-26T19:52:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/rkA58007mJl/rkA58007mJl_0_128_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Global social media campaign aims to dismantle differences, build...	Anthony Wolch, founder of See the Good: 'We’re tracking stories about people who have propelled humankind forward' A new global campaign aimed at dismantling differences and building bridges to tolerance and understanding has launched on social media. See the Good (STG) harnesses the power of storytelling to spotlight individuals from marginalized communities whose actions, inventions, and contributions have made a meaningful impact on the world. Anthony Wolch, the founder of the project, joined ILTV News on Tuesday to discuss the initiative. The campaign has garnered support from a growing list of celebrities, including Michael Douglas, Gene Simmons, Dalia Ziada, Geddy Lee, Daryl Davis, Mayim Bialik, Emmanuelle Chriqui, David Draiman, and Montana Tucker. 'We’re tracking stories about people who have propelled humankind forward with such an order of magnitude that without them, likely one of us wouldn’t be sitting here or alive today,' Wolch told ILTV. 'Then they’ve distributed these innovations without the primary purpose of patent or profit, just to make the world a better place. And then they distribute these innovations without regard to race, language, creed, background, or religion.' The project was conceived about a year ago when someone called Wolch with a challenge: 'You’ve literally run the world’s biggest brands, including Nike, Google, and Coca-Cola, as a creative leader. Surely, you can come up with an idea to slow down hate.' In response, Wolch and his team conducted a global data study to uncover why traditional approaches to combating hate often fall short. 'Common sense will tell you why they don’t work, but data science will converge in the same place. So See the Good was born out of that data study,' Wolch explained. He described See the Good as 'a data-driven, celebrity-amplified global anti-hate campaign that’s purpose-built and strategically designed to unite people and combat the rising tide of hatred and division.' However, Wolch emphasized that the campaign’s success depends on collective action. 'I challenge individuals, I challenge corporations to contact us,' he urged. 'Look at seethegoodnow.com. Get in touch with me. Get in touch with us, because if we’re not all going to get behind this, it’s going to be very difficult to make a change.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy7iyxnqje	2024-11-26T19:30:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/HJ1111l74Qkg/HJ1111l74Qkg_0_233_1023_576_0_small.jpg
Iran’s supreme leader calls for Netanyahu’s execution amid ICC ar...	Khamenei ramps up rhetoric, accusing Israel of war crimes as Iran faces mounting domestic and international criticism Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has escalated his rhetoric against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to issue arrest warrants. Addressing members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Basij forces, Khamenei declared that the arrest warrant was insufficient, suggesting Netanyahu should face the death penalty. 'The actions they are taking are not a victory; they are war crimes,' Khamenei stated. 'Issuing Netanyahu's arrest warrant is not enough; his execution warrant must be issued.' The event, attended by senior IRGC officials, also featured the regime’s infamous chants of 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel.' Khamenei accused Israel of bombing hospitals and homes, a claim he later echoed on X (formerly Twitter). Critics highlighted his hypocrisy, given Iran's documented funding of terror proxies responsible for attacks on civilian infrastructure. Khamenei’s speech comes as his regime faces growing domestic unrest and international condemnation. Iran has intensified its execution campaigns, targeting jailed dissidents and protesters. In October alone, the regime executed over 160 individuals, including Jamshid Sharmahd, a German citizen and U.S. resident abducted from Dubai in 2020. While the regime attempts to deflect criticism by focusing on Israel, it is under increasing pressure at home and abroad for its human rights abuses and destabilizing activities across the region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkwi3mexkx	2024-11-26T19:16:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/By2x9til1e/By2x9til1e_0_0_2295_1292_0_small.jpg

Israeli strikes hit north Lebanon crossings with Syria for 1st ti...	Israeli strikes late on Tuesday targeted Lebanon's three northern border crossings with Syria for the first time, Lebanon's transport minister Ali Hamieh told Reuters. The strikes came moments after U.S. President Joe Biden announced that a ceasefire would come into effect at 4:00 a.m. local time on Wednesday to halt hostilities between Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Israel. Hamieh said it was not immediately clear whether the roads had been cut off as a result of the strikes. Israeli raids on Lebanon's eastern crossings in recent weeks had already sealed off those routes into Syria. Syrian state media Sana had said Israeli strikes targeted the northern crossings between Syria and Lebanon but it was not immediately clear what side of the border was hit. Syrian state TV reported that 10 people were injured, including three critically, in an Israeli strike on the Arida border crossing, with the wounded transported to nearby hospitals, while casualties were also reported in a separate Israeli strike on the Dabousieh border crossing with Lebanon. The Israeli military did not immediately comment but has previously stated that it targets what it says are Iran-linked sites in Syria as part of a broader campaign to curb the influence of Iran and its ally Hezbollah in the region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1iv6px7kg	2024-11-26T13:37:16-08:00

Cease-fire in Lebanon set to begin at 4 a.m.: These are the 13 pr...	Agreement will end fighting in the north after almost 14 months; But the dissolution of Hezbollah does not appear in the agreement; Biden spoke with Netanyahu who confirmed that 'Israel maintains freedom of action in enforcing it' On October 8, 2023, Hezbollah joined the fighting against Israel, a day after the surprise attack launched by Hamas. Almost a year and two months later, on Tuesday night the Security Cabinet approved the agreement that will put an end to fighting in the north. According to the plan, the cease-fire will come into effect at 4 a.m. on Wednesday. The agreement passed in the Security Cabinet with 10 in favor and one against, Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. 'Israel appreciates the US contribution to the process, and maintains its right to act against any threat to its security,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement after the announcement of the cease-fire. The statement added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'spoke to U.S. President Joe Biden and thanked him for the U.S. involvement in achieving the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon and for the understanding that Israel maintains freedom of action in enforcing it.' U.S. President Joe Biden announced the cease-fire from the White House Rose Garden on Tuesday afternoon in Washington. 'I have good news from the Middle East. I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Israel and Lebanon, they approved the cease-fire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah.' Biden thanked French President Emmanuel Macron, saying: 'Let's be clear - if Hezbollah violates the deal, Israel will retain the right to defend itself. In the same way, Lebanon's sovereignty must be maintained and a new beginning allowed for it.' Biden also said that 'Hamas now has a choice to make; the only way out of this is to release the hostages and in the process end the fighting. In the coming days, the U.S., with the help of its partners, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, will try to push for a cease-fire agreement in Gaza. The U.S. remains ready to conclude the historic agreements with Saudi Arabia for full normalization with Israel. I continue to believe that peace is possible. I will not stop working to achieve it.' The dissolution of Hezbollah does not appear in the agreement, which only says that it will not operate in southern Lebanon. In addition, there is no commitment that Hezbollah operatives will not return to the border area. On the other hand, the U.S. guarantee letter, which is a side agreement, allows for Israeli intelligence flights , but the planes will be prohibited from breaking the sound barrier. Prime Minister Netanyahu listed the reasons that he said led to his decision to agree to the cease fire, including 'the delay in armaments that will be resolved soon,' but did not call on the residents of the north to return to their homes. These are the 13 points included in the agreement: * Hezbollah and all other armed groups in Lebanese territory will not carry out any offensive action against Israel. * At the same time, Israel will not carry out any offensive military action against targets in Lebanon, including on the ground, in the air and at sea. * Israel and Lebanon recognize the importance of Resolution 1701 of the UN Security Council, which calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah and other forces from Lebanon south of the Litani River. * These commitments do not negate the right of Israel and Lebanon to exercise their right to self-defense. * The official Lebanese security forces and army will be the only armed entities that will be allowed to carry weapons or operate their forces in southern Lebanon. * Any sale, supply and production of weapons or materials related to weapons to Lebanon will be under the supervision and control of the Lebanese government. * All unauthorized facilities for the production of weapons and materials related to weapons will be dismantled. * All military infrastructure and bases will be dismantled, and all weapons without a permit that do not comply with these obligations will be confiscated. * A committee will be established that will be acceptable to Israel and Lebanon to oversee and assist in ensuring the enforcement of these commitments. * Israel and Lebanon will submit reports on any expected violations of these commitments to the committee and the UNIFIL force. * Lebanon will deploy its official security forces and military forces along all borders, crossing points and the line that defines southern Lebanon, as shown in the deployment plan. * Israel will gradually withdraw south of the Blue Line within 60 days. * The U.S. will promote indirect negotiations between Israel and Lebanon to reach a recognized land border. The U.S. guarantees to Israel Alongside this, the United States provided guarantees to Israel. These are the sections that are included in the U.S. guarantee letter: * Israel and the U.S. intend to share sensitive intelligence concerning violations, including any infiltration by Hezbollah into the Lebanese army. * The U.S. may share information provided by Israel with the Lebanese government or commission to allow them to address the violations. * The U.S. is committed to cooperating with Israel to curb Iran's destabilizing activities in Lebanon, including preventing the transfer of weapons, affiliates and others from Iranian territory. * The US recognizes Israel's right to respond to threats coming from Lebanese territory in accordance with international law. * In the southern region, Israel reserves the right to act at any time against violations of the commitments. Outside the southern region, Israel reserves the right to act against the development of threats directed against it, if Lebanon is unable or unwilling to thwart these threats. If Israel decides to take such steps, it will inform the U.S. of this wherever possible. * Israeli flights over Lebanon will be conducted for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes only and will not break the sound barrier. 'The war will not end until we achieve all our goals' Netanyahu released a pre-recorded statement ahead of the announcement of the cease-fire, which allowed him to side-step questions from reporters. 'I promised you victory, and we will achieve victory. We will complete the elimination of Hamas, we will return all our hostages, we will ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, and we will return the residents of the north safely to their homes,' said the prime minister at the beginning of his statement that was recorded before the debate on approving the cease-fire in the cabinet. 'The war will not end until we achieve all our goals, until we return the residents of the north safely home. It will happen, just as it happened in the south. My friends, the residents of the north, I am proud of you, your ability to endure, I am fully committed to your future.' Netanyahu also detailed Israel's actions in the various sectors of the war, including the struggles against Iran, Hamas in Gaza, the terrorist organizations in the West Bank, the Houthis in Yemen and the pro-Palestinian militias in Iraq. Referring to the war in the north, Netanyahu said that 'Hezbollah chose to attack us from there on October 8. We set it back decades.' We eliminated Nasrallah; we eliminated all the senior officials of the organization and thousands of terrorists, and we destroyed most of the rocket capabilities and the infrastructure it built near our border,' he added. 'We have eliminated thousands of terrorists and destroyed the underground infrastructure near our border for years. We have attacked strategic targets throughout Lebanon and brought down dozens of terrorist towers in Dahieh. All of this sounded like science fiction, But it's not science fiction, we did it.' 'At every moment of managing this campaign, I observe all fronts simultaneously. That is what I did at the beginning of the war when I decided to focus on Gaza and not open a broader front in Lebanon. That is what I did several months ago when the conditions ripened to go north, and then we decided to focus on Hezbollah,' he said. 'That is what I did after the missile attack from Iran, when we meticulously decided on the time and nature of our response. And that is what I am doing today. I observe all the fronts simultaneously and see the broad picture. I am determined to give our courageous soldiers every resource to keep them safe and bring us victory.' 'Therefore, this evening I will bring a ceasefire outline for the cabinet's approval. The length of the cease-fire depends on what happens in Lebanon. With the United States' full understanding, we maintain full freedom of military action. If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself, we will attack. If it tries to rebuild terrorist infrastructure near the border, we will attack. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck carrying rockets, we will attack.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The prime minister listed the reasons for the cease-fire in the north: 'The first reason is to focus on the Iranian threat, and I will not expand on that. 'The second reason is to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks. And I say it openly, it is no secret that there have been big delays in weapons and munitions deliveries. These delays will be resolved soon. We will receive supplies of advanced weaponry that will keep our soldiers safe and give us more strike force to complete our mission. 'And the third reason for having a ceasefire is to separate the fronts and isolate Hamas. From day two of the war, Hamas was counting on Hezbollah to fight by its side. With Hezbollah out of the picture, Hamas is left on its own. We will increase our pressure on Hamas and that will help us in our sacred mission of releasing our hostages.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxzuh7qkl	2024-11-26T12:41:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/BJHRpwmmJe/BJHRpwmmJe_1_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF names Druze soldier killed in northern Gaza battle	Sergeant Tamer Othman, 21, from the Nahshon Battalion, Kfir Brigade, fell in a clash between Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya during a raid in the area; He is the 13th fallen soldier from the Druze community, and the 806th soldier since the beginning of the war The IDF announced Tuesday that Sergeant Tamer Othman, 21, from Kafr Yasif, a soldier in the Nahshon Battalion (90), Kfir Brigade, fell during combat in the northern Gaza Strip. Othman was killed during an encounter between Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya as part of an operation in the area. Since the beginning of the war, 806 Israeli soldiers have been killed in action. Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community, expressed deep sorrow following the death of Othman. 'Grief strikes another Druze town and takes another young life,' Tarif said. 'The heroic fighter, Tamer Othman, fell in battle. There are no words to describe the sorrow and pain of losing another young man at the beginning of his life. The Druze community continues to pay the highest price in this brutal and cursed war, losing its finest youth. I grieve with the Othman family, who, against their will, join the grieving families of our fallen.' Knesset Member Hamad Amar (Yisrael Beiteinu) also paid tribute to Othman, calling him 'a brave and daring young hero. With his death, he adds another chapter of heroism to the story of the Druze community. He leaves behind a family, friends and a community that will always miss him. He fought valiantly for our values and our security and fell in service to the homeland. Thank you for protecting us.

Biden to deliver remarks Tuesday afternoon, White House says	U.S. President Joe Biden will deliver remarks in the White House's Rose Garden on Tuesday, the White House said, before leaving Washington for his Thanksgiving break in Nantucket, Massachusetts. The announcement came on the heels of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing a ceasef-ire agreement with Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sytidqq7yx	2024-11-26T09:50:22-08:00	
Netanyahu on coming cease-fire: 'I promised victory and we will a...	In pre-recorded statement, almost a year and two months after Hezbollah in the north joined the surprise attack by Hamas in the south, the prime minister addresses a cease-fire in Lebanon; 'This is not the same Hezbollah, we set it back decades' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a pre-recorded statement Tuesday evening following a meeting of his political-security cabinet and ahead of the cease-fire in the north which is expected to take effect Wednesday morning according to the plan - almost a year and two months after Hezbollah joined the fighting against Israel, after the surprise attack by Hamas in the south. 'I promised you victory, and we will achieve victory. We will complete the elimination of Hamas, we will return all our hostages, we will ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, and we will return the residents of the north safely to their homes,' said the prime minister at the beginning of his statement that was recorded before the debate on approving the cease-fire in the cabinet. 'The war will not end until we achieve all our goals, until we return the residents of the north safely home. It will happen, just as it happened in the south. My friends, the residents of the north, I am proud of you, your ability to endure, I am fully committed to your future.' Netanyahu also detailed Israel's actions in the various sectors of the war, including the struggles against Iran, Hamas in Gaza, the terrorist organizations in the West Bank, the Houthis in Yemen and the pro-Palestinian militias in Iraq. Referring to the war in the north, Netanyahu said that 'Hezbollah chose to attack us from there on October 8. We set it back decades.' 'We eliminated Nasrallah; we eliminated all the senior officials of the organization and thousands of terrorists, and we destroyed most of the rocket capabilities and the infrastructure it built near our border,' he added. 'We have eliminated thousands of terrorists and destroyed the underground infrastructure near our border for years. We have attacked strategic targets throughout Lebanon and brought down dozens of terrorist towers in Dahieh. All of this sounded like science fiction, But it's not science fiction, we did it.' He gave three reasons for entering into a cease-fire in the north:: 'The first reason is to focus on the Iranian threat, and I will not expand on that. 'The second reason is to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks. And I say it openly, it is no secret that there have been big delays in weapons and munitions deliveries. These delays will be resolved soon. We will receive supplies of advanced weaponry that will keep our soldiers safe and give us more strike force to complete our mission. 'And the third reason for having a ceasefire is to separate the fronts and isolate Hamas. From day two of the war, Hamas was counting on Hezbollah to fight by its side. With Hezbollah out of the picture, Hamas is left on its own. We will increase our pressure on Hamas and that will help us in our sacred mission of releasing our hostages.' Netanyahu said he would put the cease-fire accord to a vote of his full cabinet later in the evening, after Israeli television news reported that the more restricted security cabinet had earlier approved the deal. 'We will enforce the agreement and respond forcefully to any violation. Together, we will continue until victory,' he said. 'In full coordination with the United States, we retain complete military freedom of action. Should Hezbollah violate the agreement or attempt to rearm, we will strike decisively,' he said. He added that there were three reasons to pursue a cease-fire – to focus on Iran, replenish depleted arms supplies and give the army a rest, and finally to isolate Hamas. U.S. President Joe Biden will deliver remarks in the White House's Rose Garden later Tuesday and is expected to announce the cease-fire, according to reports. Netanyahu, whose last press conference he held was on September 2 after the bodies of six hostages were located, did not have to face reporters and their questions since he pre-recorded his statement. The prime minister delivered the statement after the cabinet meeting regarding the cease-fire, which US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce tonight after 10:00 p.m. The cease-fire itself is expected to take effect Wednesday at 10:00 a.m., after the Lebanese government also approves it. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump was updated on the details of the agreement. A senior Lebanese official clarified to Al-Hadith that 'the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon is not related to the hostages held by Hamas. The agreement is not related to the Gaza front.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A few minutes before the cabinet meeting, the IDF launched a wave of attacks in Daheih, which in Lebanon they called 'the most intense attacks since the beginning of the war.'

Among the targets were also the branches of the Hezbollah Bank. The attacks in Dahieh - and in the center of Beirut - continued even after that. At the same time, Hezbollah launched barrages into the northern cities, and incessant alarms were heard in Haifa, Acre, Nahariya, Ma'alot and other localities.

Netanyahu says the war will not end until residents of the north ...	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was committed to the security of the north and its residents and the war would not end until they can return home safely. Speaking in a pre recorded video address Netanyahu said Hezbollah was taken back decades. 'I will bring the cease-fire to the cabinet. its duration depends on Hezbollah's compliance,' adding that any violation will be met by an IDF strike. He violations include not only opening fire but also attempts to re-arm. Netanyahu said the cease-fire was necessary so that Israel could focus on the Iranian threat and because the U.S. administration withheld arms. That is about to change.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjz4nym71g	2024-11-26T09:19:22-08:00

Parents raising Baby Sophia appeal to court to allow them to keep...	Two days after court orders baby to be transferred to her biological parents following an IVF mix-up , the couple who have been raising her since birth appeal the decision; Taking her away is 'wrong and outrageous' they say A dramatic appeal was filed Tuesday morning in District Court in Lod in the case of a high-profile mix-up at an Israeli IVF clinic, two days after the family court ordered the transfer of the baby Sophia from the couple that has been raising her since birth to her biological parents. Along with the appeal, a request was also submitted to delay the execution of the judgment. In the letter of appeal obtained by Ynet, lawyers Galit Kerner, an expert in medical negligence, and Yonathan Kanir, an expert in family law, claim that Sophia 's transfer to her biological parents is 'a wrongful and outrageous act.' The attorneys represent the family that has raised the baby and the birth mother, into whose womb the embryo of the genetic parents was mistakenly implanted. 'The parents who gave birth to Sophia and are raising her never agreed that anyone would take her from them,' the appeal states. The appellants seek to delay both the change in the registry of the parents' identity and the physical transfer of the baby. Criticism of the verdict focuses on several aspects: apparent disregard of serious claims, prevention of submission of important evidentiary material, and rejection of significant evidence. The appellants also criticize the professional opinion submitted in the procedure and the tests that preceded its preparation. According to them, the consent of the parents raising the toddler to carry out genetic tests did not indicate an intention to give up their parentage. According to the ruling, the transfer of the baby should take place within 60 days, unless the court accepts the appellants' request. The case began in September 2022 when a genetic test revealed that a woman undergoing IVF was carrying an embryo unrelated to her or her partner. Before the child’s birth, an investigative team at Assuta initially identified another patient as the likely genetic mother. However, legal proceedings later confirmed that she had no genetic link to the baby. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The investigation found that the mix-up likely occurred during the embryo transfer process, when two patients were scheduled back-to-back. As a result, embryos intended for one woman were mistakenly implanted in another. About a year and a half after the birth of the baby, her genetic parents were located, who demanded that she be transferred to their custody. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj11k9f7qjl	2024-11-26T09:05:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/10/26/Hyl00HCTUNi/Hyl00HCTUNi_0_177_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Young woman from Kafr Qassem arrested on suspicion of attempting to smuggle 6,000 M-16 bullets, for which she was reportedly promised several thousand shekels; Arrest follows a similar case in which two men were caught trying to smuggle 20,000 bullets Northern District Israel Police officers arrested a 22-year-old woman from Kafr Qassem on Monday night on suspicion of attempting to smuggle 6,000 bullets intended for M-16 rifles. She was apprehended while traveling south from northern Israel toward the West Bank. Police plan to request an extension of her detention at the Nazareth Magistrate's Court. Authorities believe the ammunition was destined for the Palestinian territories to be used by terror organizations. Investigators also suspect the woman was promised several thousand shekels for transporting the bullets. The arrest follows a separate case involving two young men caught smuggling 20,000 bullets, also intended for the West Bank. 'Every piece of ammunition that reaches the territories poses a potential threat to our soldiers and civilians,' said Chief Superintendent Oshri Amor, deputy commander of the Northern District's central unit. 'We take these cases with utmost seriousness. Our unit has been waging a relentless campaign against the smuggling of weapons into the Palestinian Authority.' Police suspect criminal gangs exploit women with no prior criminal record, such as the arrested suspect, to serve as couriers.

Rocket and drone warning sirens sound throughout northern Israel for nearly an hour as cease-fire looms; opponents call on cabinet to not agree to a deal with Lebanon that does not include taking territory on border that would remain under IDF control; 'Any deal that would bring Hezbollah terrorists back to the border near our homes would be criminal negligence' Rockets and drones fired from Lebanon set off warning sirens in dozens of communities throughout northern Israel on Tuesday as municipal heads from the conflict line in the north and hundreds of commanders and soldiers from the Israeli Reservist-Generation of Victory movement called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the members of the political-security cabinet not to promote any agreement with Lebanon if it does not include the taking of territory along the border that will remain under the control of the IDF and guarantee the safety of the residents. At the same time, about 10 people demonstrated in front of the Begin Gate in Tel Aviv against the promotion of a cease-fire in the north.

Foreign ministers from the world's industrialized countries said Tuesday they strongly supported an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah and insisted that Israel comply with international law in its ongoing military operations in the region. At the end of their two-day summit, the ministers didn't refer directly to the International Criminal Court and its recent arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister over crimes against humanity. Italy had put the ICC warrants on the official meeting agenda, even though the G7 was split on the issue. The U.S., Israel's closest ally, isn't a signatory to the court and has called the warrants 'outrageous.' However, the EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell said all the other G7 countries were signatories and therefore obliged to respect the warrants. In the end, the final statement adopted by the ministers said Israel, in exercising its right to defend itself, 'must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including international humanitarian law.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ss8uxq1x	2024-11-26T07:26:39-08:00	
Store owner in Australia threatens Israeli tourists with shovel, ...	Two young Israelis who asked the owner of a tobacco shop if she knew where the donations she collects for the Palestinians go were met with an angry and antisemitic response; Video of the incident goes viral; 'Incidents like this happen in Australia every day' A tobacco shop owner in the Australian town of Townsville in North Queensland threatened two Israeli tourists on Saturday and cursed them with an antisemitic epithet. The incident was recorded, posted on social media and went viral. According to a report in the Daily Mail, the two Israelis, young men in their 20s, spotted a sign asking for a donation for the Palestinians near the front counter of the store. They approached the store owner and suggested that she verify where the donations end up, which infuriated her. The woman told the two young men: 'Get the hell out of my store.' She was then recorded at the entrance of the store holding a shovel and shouting at one of the two Israelis: 'I don't care about Israel, but I do care about the fact that you are a dirty f**king Jew.' The woman continued to shout and swear until the two Israelis left the store. The Australian Jewish Association condemned the incident and said in a statement that it is a continuation of the antisemitic attacks that are taking place throughout the country. 'The wave of anti-Jewish hate continues to surge across Australia,' according to the association. 'Many of the government's actions have contributed to the surge of anti-Jewish hatred. Incidents like this are happening every single day across Australia.' The Australian Anti-Defamation Commission also condemned the antisemitism. The chairman of the league, Dvir Abramovich, said that the incident is a national crisis, in his words.

Australia is at a crossroads. Will we let this cancer of hate define who we are, or will we rise up and reclaim Our values ​​of fairness, safety and inclusion?'

Fadlallah told Reuters that Lebanon was facing 'dangerous, sensitive hours' before the anticipated announcement of a cease-fire, given the Israeli Air Force's intensified strikes on Tuesday afternoon on Beirut and its southern suburbs.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skliqwmqyl	2024-11-26T06:05:50-08:00

A number of unidentified drones have been spotted over three United States Air Force (USAF) bases in England over the last six days, a U.S. Air Force spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday. 'Small unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of and over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell from Nov 20 to Nov 26,' a spokesperson said in an emailed response to Reuters. The three bases, two in Suffolk and one in Norfolk, are leased by the USAF from Britain. A spokesperson for Britain's Ministry of Defense said they 'take threats seriously and maintain robust measures' at defense sites. 'We are supporting the U.S. Air Force response,' the spokesperson added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bykg7dmmyl	2024-11-26T06:03:16-08:00	
Former NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo joins Israel defense team for ICC cas...	Cuomo joins Netanyahu’s legal team to challenge ICC arrest warrants, eyeing a political comeback with a potential NYC mayoral run; Emphasizing solidarity with Israel, he joins a high-profile team led by Alan Dershowitz, defending against what they call unjust international bias against Israel Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who stepped down amid allegations of sexually harassing 11 women, has joined Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s legal team to counter arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. 'I am proud to be on the legal defense for the prime minister against the arrest warrant at the ICC and I am proud to stand against antisemitism.,' he declared. Cuomo, eyeing a potential run for New York City mayor next year, is showing increasing interest in Israel – a strategic move to court the Jewish vote in the city, home to the largest Jewish community outside of Israel. Since returning to public life last year, he has engaged in pro-Israel lobbying, strengthening his political ties with a significant voting bloc in local elections. 'This is the moment that counts. This is the moment that is going to be in the history books. …This is the moment that true friends stand up, shoulder to shoulder and fight for the State of Israel,' Cuomo proclaimed at a New York event for the National Committee for the Advancement of Jewish Education. Cuomo, a trained lawyer and former New York State Attorney General, is the brother of former CNN star Chris Cuomo, who also got entangled in his brother’s scandal and had to leave his job. The legal team was assembled by Netanyahu’s close friend, Professor Alan Dershowitz, and includes prominent figures in the American and global legal systems. Among them are former U.S. Attorneys General, former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, and Fox News host attorney Mark Levin. Dershowitz and the team will argue that the ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel, which is not a member of the court, and that Israel’s judicial system is independent and effective. 'Israel has one of the best and most independent legal systems in the world, one that is both willing and able to investigate its own leaders. The Israeli courts have convicted and imprisoned a former prime minister, a former president and several ministers. Hamas has no such judicial system,' Dershowitz wrote in a Wall Street Journal column, where he announced the members of Netanyahu’s legal team. 'The U.S. should sanction the institution. This process is already under way in Congress and should be pursued.' He stated that the issuing of arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reflects blatant discrimination by the international institution and equates Israel's defensive actions with Hamas's acts of terrorism. 'Without making comparisons to the Holocaust, the ICC – which along with the International Court of Justice has shown bias against Israel for years – would probably have issued warrants against the Jewish fighters in the Warsaw ghetto along with the Nazis who were seeking to murder them. By pursuing these illegal and unjustified warrants, the ICC has lost its credibility.' Dershowitz also promised to prove that Israel's actions in Gaza do not violate any international laws or the laws of war. 'Even if the inflated numbers of casualties provided by the Hamas Health Services were accurate, the proportion of civilians to combatants killed by the Israel Defense Forces would be lower than in any comparable war anywhere in the world,' he argued. 'This certainly doesn’t qualify as genocide or any other war crime. In addition, the efforts by Israel and the international community to send food and other provisions into Gaza have been stymied by Hamas and by gangs who have stolen the shipments.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He emphasized that this is not just a legal battle but also a fight for global public opinion. 'This case will be tried in a courtroom in The Hague. It will also be tried in the court of public opinion, both in the U.S. and throughout the world. For that reason, I am assembling a team of world class lawyers from around the globe to help defend Israeli leaders against the false charges.' Dershowitz hopes the legal team will refute the charges and restore public confidence in international law. 'The court undermines the rule of law and international morality,' he wrote. 'Our goal is to defend Israeli leaders and preserve the rule of law from corruption.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkih00s7myl	2024-11-26T05:56:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/12/02/rkXbLmwDs/rkXbLmwDs_0_146_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

The laser era': Israeli military to acquire personal laser defen...	IDF to sign deal with defense giant integrating new Israeli technology allowing compact laser systems to target missiles and drones threatening forces The Defense Ministry and defense industry giant Rafael Advanced Defense Systems are set to sign a major new deal in the coming months to procure compact anti-missile laser systems for intercepting anti-tank missiles and other aerial threats designed to protect infantry soldiers. This development is set to revolutionize the battlefield, comparable to the first operational deployment of the IDF’s Trophy active protection system fitted on tanks or the Iron Dome's first interception. The military is expected to integrate and equip its forces with Rafael's innovative system — an active laser-based defense array that will likely be deployed with elite units and combat brigades initially. The system can neutralize threats such as anti-tank missiles and kamikaze drones targeting soldiers by using a laser beam to burn and destroy the threat mid-air automatically, whether the troops are maneuvering in enemy territory or on routine border security missions. The deal is expected to be finalized soon and will join Rafael's other groundbreaking defense systems, such as the Trophy system, which successfully intercepted hundreds of threats targeting Merkava Mark IV tanks and Namer armored personnel carriers over the past year along the Gaza Strip and Lebanon border. The new system may arrive in the IDF as early as next year and is inspected as part of a broader weapons system that could also include remotely operated machine guns and possibly a 30-mm cannon, enhancing both the unit's defensive and offensive capabilities. This compact laser system is also expected to reduce IDF operational costs. Each laser activation costs only a few dollars, compared to the thousands required for each Trophy system interception. 'Rafael managed to develop solutions for atmospheric disturbances and concentrate energy into a laser beam capable of striking a target the size of a coin, neutralizing it by unifying multiple beams into a single one before impact,' security sources explained. 'This is even simpler than for shorter ranges than long ones, fit for infantry defense.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last month, the Defense Ministry signed a massive NIS 2 billion ($549 million) deal to significantly expand the deployment of the Iron Beam laser interception system. 'This deal heralds a new era — the laser era,' said Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, noting that the first operational utility of the ground-based laser system is expected to be ready within a year. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjru1smmyx	2024-11-26T04:43:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/yk14164179/yk14164179_0_27_354_200_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu responsible for failings leading to Oct. 7, commission ...	Independent investigative panel says prime minister and cabinet responsible for failings before during and after massacre, IDF and defense minister failed to prepare for attack, respond to warnings, deploy forces; calls for national commission of inquiry The civilian commission of inquiry into events leading up to and on Oct. 7 2023, released its findings on Tuesday declaring the government failed in its primary mission to protect the citizens of Israel and that the ministers and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu bare direct responsibility. 'They acknowledge and accept their responsibility,' the commission wrote. The findings also state that the IDF, the Shin Bet and others 'Failed miserably in fulfilling their only mission to defend Israelis,' but they, the report notes, unlike the political leadership, did own their responsibility, and some even payed the personal price 'as expected by anyone who bares it.' The disaster was not an act of fate or a sudden collapse of institutions but one that could have been avoided or at least minimized dramatically,' the commission wrote. 'The disaster that began on October 7 2023 still continues and at the time that this report is being written, over 800 IDF soldiers have fallen and more civilians than that have been killed, while 101 Israeli civilians are still being held captive by Hamas. Soldiers are falling nearly daily as the result of the war that is the direct continuation of the failings detailed in this report.' the government must immediately establish an independent national commission of inquiry In its conclusions, the commission says the government must immediately establish an independent national commission of inquiry into the failings. Members of the commission said they invited ministers to testify but were refused and that since they are not an official national commission, they could not force their testimony. The 5-member civilian commission that was headed by retired judge Varda Alsheikh prepared the 70-page findings over two months after hearing the testimonies of 120 witnesses including former prime ministers, retired military commanders, soldiers and the families of victims of the Hamas atrocities and of hostages abducted by Hamas and held in Gaza. In its findings the commission said Netanyahu bares responsibility for ignoring warnings that the enemy identified a weakness in Israel and an opportunity to start a war. 'He is among the most responsible for the rift in Israeli society, that although it was not the direct cause of the Hamas massacre, it did have an adverse effect on the fortitude of Israeli society, this despite the prime minister being cautioned time and again. Netanyahu as prime minister was also responsible for delegating authority to ministries and for their failing to respond to the needs of the home front because of confusion among them.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu and his government bolstered Hamas while the military which was aware of the terror group's plans to invade the border area communities, did not prepare its forces for such an attack and its intelligence failed to respond to the risk. The findings showed that then Defense Minister Yoav Galant, the chief of staff and their predecessors were responsible for cutting down IDF deployment around Gaza and for the lack of preparedness of troops in their bases as well as the neglect of the captured lookouts. Netanyahu bares responsibility for ignoring warnings that the enemy identified a weakness in Israel and an opportunity to start a war The commission's probe delved into the prevailing 'conception' that spanned years believing it was superior and that Hamas was deterred, leading to Netanyahu's funding of the Gaza rulers and the hubris which allowed the wrong decisions to be made. 'Israel has no national security doctrine approved by the Prime Minister and his cabinet, leaving political considerations over vital security ones,' the commission wrote. It found that for years there had been no meaningful conversation of about strategy. 'We can say definitively that the government in general and its prime minister in particular, did not prepare adequately not only ahead of the Oct. 7 calamity but for any other disastrous scenario.' The commission investigated the massacre at the Nova music festival and the lack of communication between the military and police ahead of the event. It delved into the deployment and eventual abduction of the IDF lookouts, still held captive and found local commanders at fault. Government ministries failed to respond to needs of victims in the immediate aftermath of the massacre The commission also investigated the roll played by civil society in the immediate aftermath of the massacre, and the failings of government ministries and institutions to respond to the needs in the emergency and in the days following, including providing for those displaced from the communities impacted and leaving them without the support they so needed and even failing to provide education and other services. The commission said the government also failed in providing adequate shelters for people living within range of enemy fire, despite deciding on a budget but failing to use it. '50% of Israelis still do not have adequate protection,' the commission said. The commission notes that although its findings were delivered to the prime minister, he has not responded to them >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1t86nxxkl	2024-11-26T03:45:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/29/rkboOwHCg1e/rkboOwHCg1e_0_141_2000_1125_0_small.jpg

From Jerusalem to the Oval: How Amos Hochstein became Biden's loy...	With trusted ties in Lebanon and a unique background bridging energy and diplomacy, Amos Hochstein navigates complex Middle Eastern affairs the way no Israeli could possibly fathom The viral clip from last week, featuring President Biden's envoy Amos Hochstein, entering a Starbucks in Beirut where the staff refused his money, calling him their 'guest,' encapsulates his long-standing relationship with Lebanon. Born in Jerusalem, Hochstein's connection with the Arab nation helped secure the maritime border agreement between Israel and Lebanon two years ago, and now he seems poised to broker a deal with Hezbollah to restore calm to the north. Hochstein's successes, despite not being a traditional diplomat and coming from an energy background, highlight the personal nature of Middle Eastern politics. Once an Israeli and Jewish, Hochstein is also a trusted friend of Lebanon, proving this unique mix works. A few weeks before October 7, Hochstein visited eastern Lebanon, making what seemed like a dramatic political statement. He toured the ancient ruins of Baalbek, an area known as a Hezbollah stronghold, dressed in white pants and a blue golf shirt, without a security entourage, taking photos of the crumbling stone walls and columns of what was once a Roman city. Several muscular men in black T-shirts followed him from a distance. The Lebanese media was abuzz. How could a senior American official — an Israeli-born, no less — move so freely in a Hezbollah area? This scene demonstrated how the son of Susan and Micky Hochstein from Jerusalem became one of the few Americans trusted by Hezbollah's leadership, albeit without much enthusiasm. Even after most of the organization’s leadership was eliminated, it seems Nasrallah's successors still trust Hochstein, though not as much as Joe Biden does. 'He is a very close advisor to the president,' Edward Gabriel, president of the American Task Force on Lebanon, a nonprofit organization in Washington focused on improving U.S.-Lebanon relations, told The New York Times. 'As a result, he can speak with a lot of authority when he's on the ground.' Officially, Hochstein (51) is Biden's senior advisor for global energy and infrastructure, but that's just a title, as Biden has trusted him on various issues for many years. Hochstein joined the administration as a senior official in the State Department's energy division, helping manage oil and gas market disruptions after Russia invaded Ukraine. In early 2023, he was re-added to the White House team at Biden's request and was regularly in the Oval Office for various energy discussions before being appointed special envoy for Lebanon affairs. Hochstein's first visit to Lebanon was in 1995. He said he fell in love with the country and was 'drawn to its tragedy,' even though gaining the Lebanese government's trust wasn't easy. In 2021, Lebanon announced it would regard Hochstein in his American capacity and not 'in his Israeli status.' Hochstein no longer holds Israeli citizenship, but a senior Democratic Party official previously said that 'his Israeli background certainly played a role in his appointment as envoy for the crisis.' According to him, 'Biden learned during Obama's era that Israelis demand America make them feel like they're the most important child, otherwise they'll just turn their back on you.' Either way, as can be seen from how Hochstein moves between Baalbek and Beirut, he has earned the trust of the country's key players. In addition to his work on the Israel-Hezbollah file, Hochstein was also one of Biden's main envoys to Saudi Arabia. He was among the advisors who helped persuade the president that the U.S. should not ostracize Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite the revulsion over his role in the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Hochstein and the Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, led quiet diplomacy in pursuit of the 'big deal' that was supposed to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia before October 7 disrupted everything. From his start with Hillary Clinton to becoming a trusted advisor to Biden, Hochstein went from being a young Jerusalemite, a Bnei Akiva member who served in the armored corps, to a key player in U.S. foreign policy. His immediate family still resides in the Rehavia neighborhood of Jerusalem. After his military service, he moved to the U.S. and uniquely secured a senior staff position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. By 1997, during the Bill Clinton administration, while still in his mid-20s, Hochstein was sent to North Korea to report on its economic and military status and was later involved in secret dealings with Iraq. He has since transitioned between diplomatic service and the private energy sector, maintaining extreme discretion at every turn. He is married to Julie Ray Ringel, a coach and faculty member at Georgetown University in Washington, and they have four children. His initial connection with Biden began in 2007 when he was responsible for policy matters in Senator Chris Dodd's brief presidential campaign, who was very close to Biden. Hochstein's big break came while working for Hillary Clinton in the State Department during President Barack Obama's first term. He worked to help Ukraine find a new natural gas supply following Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea, weaving a deep network of connections and understanding in the global energy arena. Obama's second Secretary of State, John Kerry, appointed him in 2014 as the coordinator for international energy affairs, effectively making him America's chief energy diplomat. He worked closely with Vice President Joe Biden, who quickly grew fond of him. This proximity later made Hochstein the focus of attention from conservative media and Republican Congress members when reports surfaced that in 2015 he expressed concern to Biden about his son Hunter’s ties in Ukraine. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regardless, Hochstein has always remained particularly loyal to Biden. After The New York Times published an editorial in June last year urging Biden to withdraw from the presidential race, Senator John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania Democrat, tweeted profanity against the article. Hochstein promptly retweeted it. If Hochstein can now bring calm to Lebanon, he may return to the private sector in January with his head held high, as one of Biden's few foreign envoys who successfully completed their missions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sj008xx7m1e	2024-11-26T02:35:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/HkORELsGkl/HkORELsGkl_0_78_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Military says will enforce compliance of the cease-fire deal	Lebanese, international outlets share optimism cease-fire deal near; reports Iranian leaders support Hezbollah's agreement to the conditions; security cabinet to convene to approve Israel's decision The IDF said on Tuesday it would enforce the terms of the cease-fire deal that would end the fighting in Lebanon, and is expected to come into effect within days, as negotiations appear to be nearing their conclusion. The security cabinet will convene later in the day to approve the agreement. It will not be brought to the full cabinet or the Knesset. 'The military is currently engaged in combat and will know how to enforce and act in accordance with any decision made by decision-makers,' the IDF said in a statement. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi attended a meeting of NATO chiefs of staff held in the UK. According to a report in the New York Times, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved the emerging agreement. According to sources in the IRGC, an agreement has already been reached and Hezbollah has effectively agreed to the cease-fire. The cover of Hezbollah-affiliated outlet Al-Akhbar featured a photo of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from behind at the UN General Assembly, with the caption: 'The agreement is near; the lesson is being implemented.' The paper claimed the 'resistance' and its capabilities remains intact regardless of whether Hezbollah forces are north of south of the Litani River. 'If this isn’t another maneuver by the Israeli prime minister, then the Lebanese are very close to the end of Israeli aggression,' the paper wrote. During a situational assessment held by the IDF on Monday, concerns were raised about fire from Lebanon intensifying, including significant 'concluding salvos,' in the potential final days of the conflict. The Homefront Command issued new guidelines for communities in the north, in expectation for Hezbollah efforts to end the fighting with images of Israeli casualties and damage. Al-Akhbar also reported on Tuesday that preparations have begun for a special Lebanese cabinet meeting on Wednesday, contingent on Israel's official approval of the agreement in the security cabinet meeting. The report noted that during the session, Lebanese ministers will be presented with the implementation mechanism for UN Resolution 1701, which serves as the basis for the current agreement, and would be asked to ratify it. Four senior Lebanese officials on Monday said that U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to present the cease-fire agreement within approximately 36 hours. However, the White House tempered these reports, saying, 'We're close to a cease-fire, but it's not finalized yet.' Even if Biden and Macron announce the cease-fire, it won’t take effect until the Israeli Security Cabinet approves it, with a meeting scheduled for 4:00 p.m. Netanyahu doesn’t plan to bring the agreement to the government or Knesset for approval, as it’s a cease-fire agreement rather than a diplomatic treaty. 'The cabinet is authorized to decide on war and is also authorized to decide on a cease-fire,' Israeli officials explained. Once approved, the cease-fire would take effect within hours or by the next day. Amid reports of the anticipated announcement by Biden and Macron, a senior political source suggested the declaration will likely be made on Wednesday morning following the cabinet’s approval. 'This will be an American-French announcement and both sides will declare their acceptance,' the source added. The three reasons behind Israel's decision A senior official outlined Israel’s rationale behind advancing the cease-fire agreement, citing three primary reasons. 'First, we aim to prevent, as much as possible, a UN Security Council resolution addressing both the north and the south. We're in a transitional period for the U.S. administration and we understand the complexity and sensitivity involved, so we want to avoid that. Once a resolution is passed, it becomes irreversible. Therefore, we're doing everything to prevent it.' The second reason mentioned was the need to refresh the forces. 'Reserve soldiers have been engaged in over a year of fighting, moving from Lebanon to Gaza and back. We want to allow them to regroup and regain strength,' he said. The third reason highlighted was severing the connection between Gaza and Lebanon, 'which Hamas opposes.' He elaborated, 'Hamas's interest is to continue receiving support from Hezbollah and Iran.' 'We're disrupting that, disconnecting the fronts, leaving Hamas isolated in the war, along with the added military pressure. We hope that the strategic and diplomatic measures, combined with ongoing military pressure, will lead to a deal for releasing hostages,' he explained He further stressed, 'We remain committed to acting against Hezbollah and any threat. What's critical is our enforcement capability and we have it. The cease-fire will be tested on the ground. If the cease-fire holds, so will the overall situation. If not, we'll strike Hezbollah.' 'It's essential to note that our priority is to get through these next two months,' The senior official added. 'Hezbollah is a completely different terror organization than it was on October 6 — we've eliminated its entire leadership, including [Hassan] Nasrallah. He was the one directing Iran's actions at times.' Addressing the agreement details, he said, 'Several border adjustments in the accord favor Israel. We're not returning Hezbollah prisoners — there's no such clause in the agreement.' Overall, he described the agreement as 'only a piece of paper.' Therefore, 'What's most important is securing a side letter from the U.S. granting us the right to act when necessary —whether against terror infrastructure, missile shipments or other threats. 'If we identify such activities, we have the right to unleash firepower and retaliate against Hezbollah and Lebanon, including via operations beyond the Litani River. Attempts to deliver weapons from Syria to Lebanon will also warrant action, including strikes on [Bashar] Assad regime targets as we've done in the past.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He added, 'The addendum isn’t a public document, nor will it be signed. The supervision mechanism will be more effective since it will be led by the U.S. — not with American forces on the ground, but under U.S. political leadership. The IDF will gradually withdraw southward until returning to Israel during the agreement’s initial 60-day period.' The official also noted that 'Israel is negotiating with the Biden administration and it’s estimated that the agreement will allow the U.S. to lift delays on arms supplies. However, this isn’t presented as an incentive or condition.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryawzg7qjl	2024-11-26T01:54:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/r14ZSem7ke/r14ZSem7ke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
TESTING NEWSLETTER BANNER	Dan Fefferman: Hate crimes can happen anytime, anywhere The attack by a terrorist in the United Arab Emirates that led to the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan was 'a desperate attempt to sabotage the good relations between Israel and the UAE, to sabotage the [Abraham] Accords, and also maybe to harm and intimidate,' said Dan Fefferman, founder of Sharaka and a Middle East affairs analyst. Speaking to ILTV on Monday, he said that Chabad emissaries were in the UAE well before the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020 and added, 'I'm certain they won't allow themselves to be intimidated by this cowardly act.'

New York Times backtracks after failing to call rabbi's death a m...	Paper reports slain Chabad emissary 'found dead' in UAE ignoring violent crime; after outrage including from former Governor Andrew Cuomo and former Congressman Matt Walsh, rewrites its headline The New York Times came under criticizm for failing to describe the killing of a Chabad rabbi in the UAE, murder after writing that he was 'found dead.' After a fiery backlash accusing the paper of ignoring an antisemitic attack, the reporting was corrected. Zvi Kogan, a 28-year-old Chabad emissary in the United Arab Emirates, was reported missing last Thursday amid fears of abduction. On Sunday morning, UAE authorities discovered his body, sparking outrage and a swift response from officials. The UAE announced the arrest of three suspects linked to Kogan's kidnapping and murder. Described by the Prime Minister as a victim of a 'heinous act of antisemitic terror,' Kogan's death was initially reported by the New York Times with a headline that read, 'Israeli Rabbi Missing in Dubai Found Dead,' as highlighted by the Daily Mail. This sparked a social media storm, with politicians and public figures lambasting the newspaper for glossing over the violent and antisemitic nature of the crime. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo criticized the Times for minimizing Kogan's murder, stating, 'Rabbi Kogan was not 'found dead'; he was murdered.' He went on to highlight a disturbing trend in media, particularly with the New York Times, of downplaying antisemitism. Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres also rebuked the Times, writing, 'Contrary to the Times, Rabbi Zvi Kogan did not simply 'disappear' in Dubai. He was kidnapped and murdered because he was Jewish. The media should report on the kidnapping and killing of Rabbi Kogan for what it is: an act of antisemitic terror.'

Mideast expert: Chabad will not be deterred by Kogan murder in UA...	Dan Fefferman: Hate crimes can happen anytime, anywhere The attack by a terrorist in the United Arab Emirates that led to the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan was 'a desperate attempt to sabotage the good relations between Israel and the UAE, to sabotage the [Abraham] Accords, and also maybe to harm and intimidate,' said Dan Fefferman, founder of Sharaka and a Middle East affairs analyst. Speaking to ILTV on Monday, he said that Chabad emissaries were in the UAE well before the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020 and added, 'I'm certain they won't allow themselves to be intimidated by this cowardly act.' Since the signing of the Accords and until the October 7 Hamas massacre, there was a significant influx of tourists traveling from Israel to the UAE.

Elon Musk finds new adversary in Lockheed Martin after F-35 repor...	Tech entrepreneur shares video of drones flying and captions ridiculing comment on American defense company, leading to its stock crashing Tesla CEO Elon Musk sparked controversy over the weekend by criticizing Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet program, a key defense initiative. Musk’s remarks, delivered via X (formerly Twitter), caused Lockheed shares to drop 3.8% on Monday, closing at $521.89 and wiping out nearly $5 billion in market value. Musk shared a video on Sunday showing drones flying in coordinated formations, captioned, 'Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.' His comments drew attention not only because of his influence as the head of Tesla and SpaceX but also due to his advisory role with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. A scathing report Musk’s comments come after the U.S. Pentagon has identified significant challenges with the F-35 stealth strike fighter jets, critical to Israel’s Air Force operations, according to a classified 382-page report. The F-35, known as 'Adir' in Israel, faces issues with stealth reliability, maintenance systems and operational efficiency, raising questions about the world’s most expensive weapons system, which has cost $1.8 trillion to develop. The report revealed recurring malfunctions in the jet's prognostic health management system, designed to detect issues automatically. High false alarm rates—averaging one per hour instead of the standard one per 50 hours—have complicated maintenance and delayed missions. The report also noted problems with the F-35’s lethality due to design flaws in its gun systems and challenges maintaining its low-observability signature, a cornerstone of its stealth capabilities. Operational availability is another concern, with repair times twice as long as required, limiting the aircraft's mission readiness. Despite its advanced design to counter threats from adversaries like China and Russia, the F-35 has undergone only one relevant test to evaluate this capability. Cyber vulnerabilities also emerged as a critical issue, with the Pentagon urging Lockheed Martin to enhance defenses against digital threats. The company responded, citing significant investments in cybersecurity. Lockheed Martin defended the jet, stating that over 90% of its systems meet required standards and attributing many issues to logistical failures rather than design flaws. However, the report’s findings reignite debates over the F-35’s cost-effectiveness and suitability for long-range missions. The F-35 and its role in defense The F-35, a cutting-edge fighter jet capable of stealth combat, supersonic flight, and advanced weaponry delivery, is central to the U.S. Defense Department’s arsenal. Comparable aircraft exist in Russia and China, highlighting the strategic importance of the program. Despite Musk’s criticism, experts argue the F-35 fulfills critical roles that drones cannot. 'Modern fighter jets fill irreplaceable roles,' said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory. He explained that drones lack the ability to intercept enemy bombers or undertake missions thousands of miles from their launch points, such as supporting naval operations. Drones are increasingly integral to military strategies, particularly as technology evolves. The Defense Department’s 'Replicator Initiative' aims to deploy thousands of autonomous systems for diverse military missions. However, analysts emphasize that the future of military operations involves both drones and manned aircraft, each serving distinct purposes. Military perspectives on drones Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific forces, addressed the growing use of drones during a recent talk at the Brookings Institution. When asked about the potential application of Ukraine’s drone successes against Russia in a hypothetical Taiwan-China conflict, Paparo dismissed the notion that drones alone could counter China’s extensive military capabilities. 'The [Chinese military] has 2,100 fighters, three aircraft carriers and a battle force of 200 destroyers,' Paparo said, adding sarcastically, 'Oh well, Roger, we’ve got a couple drones. No problem.' Lockheed’s response Lockheed Martin issued a statement, stressing the F-35’s importance. 'The F-35 is the most advanced, survivable, and connected fighter aircraft in the world, a vital deterrent and the cornerstone of joint all-domain operations,' the company said. Lockheed also expressed its commitment to working with President-elect Trump and Congress to strengthen national defense. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Financial implications The F-35 program represents a significant portion of Lockheed’s business, accounting for about 25% of its sales, according to Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu. The program also impacts the broader defense supply chain, contributing 10% of sales at Northrop Grumman, 5% at L3Harris Technologies, and 1% at Honeywell International. Lockheed is expected to deliver 150 F-35 jets in 2024 and 156 in 2025, with each jet priced at roughly $80 million. The company also generates service and development revenue tied to the program. Despite Musk’s critique, his own ventures intersect with the defense sector. As CEO of SpaceX, valued at $250 billion, Musk oversees a company that has challenged traditional government contractors like Lockheed. SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell recently criticized cost-plus government contracts, advocating for cost-efficiency and performance-based profits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Market reaction Monday’s trading highlighted Musk’s influence. While the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% and 1%, respectively, Lockheed’s stock fell. Defense budgets and geopolitical threats typically drive Lockheed’s performance, but Musk’s public comments have added a new variable for investors to consider. Since the Nov. 5 presidential election, Lockheed shares have dropped 0.2%, while the S&P 500 has gained 4.5%. However, year-to-date, Lockheed’s stock remains up about 20%. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hytcw1qqyg	2024-11-25T22:11:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/rJyjydfXJl/rJyjydfXJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Fact vs. fiction: The truth about Israel’s humanitarian aid to Ga...	Comment: When in the history of warfare has a country provided humanitarian aid and medical services to its enemy? Israel has been accused by the United Nations and other international so-called human rights organizations of purposefully withholding humanitarian aid and starving the Gazan population. And the International Criminal Court has even gone so far as to issue arrest warrants against Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant—saying they have committed, among other things, the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare. This is, of course, false. Anyone who has been truly following the war this past year knows this is a ridiculous accusation. Just how ridiculous? Well, let’s take a look at the numbers: Since the start of the war, Israel, through COGAT, which is the Israeli government body responsible for coordinating and facilitating humanitarian aid for Gaza, has facilitated the entry of over 2.2 billion pounds of humanitarian aid. That is over 1 million tons of aid to Gaza on 57,545 massive trucks. And food—Israel has facilitated over 872,000 tons of food on over 40,000 trucks into Gaza and over 50,000 tons of water. It also supplies water through water lines and water pumping facilities. It has also brought in over 27,000 tons of medical aid on over 2,700 trucks and has vaccinated Gaza's civilian population against disease. Does that sound like genocide? Does that sound like purposeful starvation? When in the history of warfare has a country provided humanitarian aid and medical services to its enemy? But the UN alone has cried out famine and genocide countless times. As have the useful idiots on the streets of Western cities. They, of course, completely ignore the fact that Israel sends in the trucks, the food, the aid, only to have Hamas hijack them once they make their way into Gaza. Recently, 98 aid trucks were hijacked and the goods stolen. By who? The UN refuses to say. UNRWA and the UN have proven to be incompetent and unable to even properly deliver aid to Gazan civilians—their main job. So they place the blame on Israel. It’s an easy out. But the numbers speak for themselves. The accusations against Israel—ludicrous. And I’ll add—how much aid are the hostages receiving? There are still 101 hostages being held in Gaza. How much food is being delivered to them? How much medical care are they receiving? Which international organization is looking out for them? Sadly, we all know the answer. Shameful.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjoftkxxjl	2024-11-25T21:30:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/09/yk13733454/yk13733454_0_0_579_326_0_small.jpg
Israel raises travel threat level for Thailand	Thailand joins a growing list of countries where the threat level for Israelis has been increased Israel's National Security Council has elevated the threat level for Israelis traveling to Thailand to Level 2, citing the persistence of potential dangers. While the council emphasized that the threat itself has not worsened, it issued the raised warning to ensure Israelis remain cautious. The advisory recommends that Israelis in Thailand avoid attending large events associated with Israel and conceal Jewish or Israeli symbols. Travelers are also urged not to share their location or travel plans on social media. This updated warning follows a previous advisory on November 12, which called on Israelis to heighten their awareness while abroad. Concerns have grown since earlier this month when the Mossad confirmed that terrorists were planning an attack targeting Israelis at a Full Moon Party on the island of Ko Pha Ngan, a popular destination for Israeli tourists. Thailand joins a growing list of countries, including Australia and several Western European nations, where the threat level for Israelis has been increased due to security concerns.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy00jvyxmjx	2024-11-25T21:21:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/12/r1HIgigz1g/r1HIgigz1g_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Will Israel’s northern residents feel safe to return home?	Sarit Zehavi: 'The IDF gained great achievements' in Lebanon The only way that the 65,000 displaced residents of northern Israel will return to their homes after a ceasefire agreement is if they feel that Hezbollah cannot regain power, according to Sarit Zehavi, founder and CEO of Alma. In an interview with ILTV News, Zehavi said, 'The key question is whether we're going to see Hezbollah military operatives watching us from the kitchen windows, just on the other side of the border.' If Hezbollah is back on the border, she said, 'the future of the North is very unclear and that is an understatement.' Zehavi noted that even if it is safe, it is possible that a percentage of those who can afford to live elsewhere and who do not have an emotional attachment to the North may choose to stay away. 'That's why it's so important to make sure that Hezbollah cannot recover,' she said. However, Zehavi said she was in favor of a ceasefire agreement because the residents of the North 'want to go back to normality.' She said, 'The IDF gained great achievements, military achievements, against Hezbollah, degrading its capabilities on various fields, including killing the leadership of Hezbollah, killing more than 170 commanders of Hezbollah, eliminating big amounts of its rockets and pushing it away from the border.' So what is the concern? Whether Hezbollah will be capable of recovering, Zehavi noted.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by7ihkxqyg	2024-11-25T21:07:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/Skln00L6Yfkl/Skln00L6Yfkl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Pope Francis clarifies Israel 'genocide' remarks: 'Taken out of c...	Pope Francis, addressing a diverse interfaith delegation, says that his remarks that Israel should be investigated for genocide were taken out of context: 'I did not claim that Israel committed genocide, Hamas should no longer exist in the world' Pope Francis met with an interfaith delegation at the Vatican on Monday, which included Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, and Druze representatives. He clarified that remarks attributed to him in excerpts from an upcoming book, suggesting he said 'Israel should be investigated for genocide in the Gaza Strip,' were taken out of context. 'I did not claim that Israel committed genocide,' he explained to the delegation. 'I was shown materials from the war, and I said that if this is true, then it needs to be investigated. I understand what is happening in Gaza. I think Hamas should no longer exist in the world, but the war should also not be prolonged,' he emphasized. The meeting included Rabbi Yosef Garmon, formerly the Chief Rabbi of Guatemala and currently head of 'The Humanitarian Coalition,' which promotes humanitarian programs in Latin America. Rabbi Garmon, a tank commander in the 9026 Battalion who participated in fighting in Gaza and the north, addressed the Pope, who was born and raised in Argentina before becoming the leader of the Catholic world: 'You cannot say that Israel must be investigated for genocide. 'Look at my fellow soldiers who died from our unit,' Rabbi Garmon continued. 'They died because we entered Gaza only to search for the terrorists and to protect the innocent. Israel also protects the Palestinians and liberates them from Hamas. Any other country would bomb them from the air and eliminate this threat in one day. Israel has the capability to end the war in one day and erase Gaza entirely, but it did not act that way and risked its soldiers to prevent the killing of innocents. You should investigate those who call to investigate Israel - not the other way around.' Pope Francis reiterated that his words were taken out of context and noted his agreement that people of different faiths are also threatened by radicalism, and if it prevails, everyone loses. He claimed that while Palestinians continuously send him materials about the war, Israel does not provide him with documentation or draw attention to it. Druze religious leaders from Hurfeish, a Druze town in northern Israel, also attended the meeting, informing the Pope that the Druze community in Israel suffers from terrorism and recounting the story of 12 children killed in Majdal Shams in the northern Golan by a Hezbollah rocket. About a week and a half ago, an Israeli delegation of families of hostages and those released from Hamas captivity visited the Vatican and met with the Pope and senior Italian officials. During the meeting, Tal Shem's family gave the Pope a soccer jersey with Tal's name and called for his release. This followed a conversation between Nevo, Shem's son, and Pope Francis about their shared love for football before the delegation's arrival. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Pope expressed his closeness to the families of the hostages and committed to doing everything he can to ensure their release. 'I pray for you and your people,' he noted, 'and the first important thing is to save people.' The delegation also included Yelena Trofanov, whose son Sasha is still in captivity; Yocheved Lifshitz, whose husband Oded is still held in Gaza, and her daughter Sharon Lifshitz who accompanied the delegation; Adi Shem, who, along with her children Nevo and Yahel, was released from Hamas captivity after 50 days, while the family patriarch Tal remains in captivity; and Luis Har, who was released in a heroic operation after 129 days in captivity. At the end of October, the Pope also met with Alon Kaminer, considered one of the war's most severely wounded from its outset. A year after the injury, in which he lost both hands, a leg, and an eye, he traveled to the Vatican with a delegation from the Sheba Medical Center, and the Pope embraced and blessed him. 'In our meeting, he told me to keep smiling and to keep pushing forward,' Kaminer recounted. 'Our conversation was a simple exchange between two people, and at the end, he told me that I have a beautiful smile. It was amazing; it was a really strong and emotional experience.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s111vvugqkl	2024-11-25T19:27:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/BJf009SfQke/BJf009SfQke_0_206_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu's dilemma: Appeal ICC warrants or wait for Trump?	PM calls meeting on ICC situation as some allies back appealing warrants, while others push to wait for Trump administration to unleash 'hellish sanctions,' aiming to pressure court into suspending them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to convene a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague against him and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. The decision will determine whether Israel will appeal these warrants. Israel has until Wednesday to officially notify the ICC if it intends to appeal the decision. Legal experts suggest Israel has grounds for a legal appeal, though this remains uncertain. The appeal can challenge the judges' arguments but not the warrants themselves. In contrast, the political leadership suggests ignoring the warrants and delivering a 'lesson' to the court through severe sanctions, which they believe will be imposed by the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 'The Americans plan hellish sanctions against any country that assists the court, and that's where it will end,' an Israeli official said. 'We shouldn't have to beg before a body we have no trust in.' However, court officials have provided indications Israel could manage the situation if it establishes an internal inquiry. Given the strong responses from senior members of the incoming Trump administration to the court's decision to issue the warrants, Jerusalem is inclined not to appeal and to wait for developments on the international stage, namely Trump's entry to the White House on January 20. 'My assessment is that the court will eventually back down because the pressure on it will be unprecedented, and they have never experienced anything like it,' an Israeli source familiar with the details remarked last week. 'They will beg us to give them a way out. After they undergo a 'lesson' that brings them down to earth, we might then consider helping them climb down.' While there is no option to appeal the arrest warrants themselves, an appeal can be filed against the court's determinations with the appeals chamber. However, such appeals do not freeze the warrants, fueling skepticism in Israel about the appeals process. The appeals chamber includes diplomats from Mongolia, Peru and Japan—figures perceived as lacking legal expertise and familiarity with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli officials fear ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan may pursue secret arrest warrants against IDF soldiers and officers. The issue is now shifting to the political arena, as the court’s decision could directly impact Israeli leaders. The 124 countries party to the Rome Statute, which governs the ICC, would be legally obligated to arrest and extradite Netanyahu or Gallant if they enter their jurisdiction. Gallant is scheduled to travel to Washington next Sunday for high-level talks with U.S. officials at the White House and State Department. This marks his first visit to the U.S. since the ICC issued an arrest warrant against him. The trip follows Netanyahu’s previous ban on Gallant’s U.S. visits before his dismissal earlier this month. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response to the ICC decision, the White House has expressed strong opposition. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the United States 'rejects the decision fundamentally,' criticizing the prosecutor’s haste and the errors in the process. He reiterated that the ICC lacks jurisdiction in the matter and confirmed ongoing coordination with Israel and other partners to determine the next steps. As the U.S. is not an ICC member and has not signed the Rome Statute, Gallant faces no direct legal risk during his visit. However, the situation may complicate his travel route, as some European countries could potentially block the use of their airspace. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1se0ugqkl	2024-11-25T13:11:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/ByFJ3s2Gye/ByFJ3s2Gye_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Thousands gather to mourn Chabad rabbi murdered in UAE	Large crowds brave heavy rain to lay Rabbi Zvi Kogan, murdered last week after being abducted in Dubai, to rest in Jerusalem's Mount of Olives Thousands gathered under heavy rain Monday evening to lay Rabbi Zvi Kogan to rest, following his murder in the United Arab Emirates last week after being abducted from Dubai. The funeral procession began at the 770 House in Kfar Chabad, with the burial scheduled for Jerusalem’s Mount of Olives. Rabbi Kogan, 25, came from a large ultra-Orthodox family unaffiliated with Chabad. After completing his yeshiva studies, he followed his brother Reuven—an influential figure in Dubai—and joined the Chabad movement, eventually moving to the UAE. Kogan served as an aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, the UAE’s chief rabbi, and managed the kosher grocery store Rimon Market in Dubai, where he was last seen on Thursday. He married six months ago, to Rivky Holtzberg, the niece of Chabad emissaries Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg, who were murdered in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. Jared Kushner, son-in-law of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, announced Monday that he and his wife Ivanka donated $1 million to Chabad UAE in memory of Rabbi Kogan. 'Ivanka and I are saddened by the loss of Rabbi Kogan, who was senselessly murdered to stop the historic bridges he was building between Jews and Muslims in the UAE,' Kushner wrote on X. The couple emphasized that 'In the UAE, people of all faiths and backgrounds thrive together in an environment of mutual understanding and respect,' and criticized the 'constant scapegoating of Israel and the Jewish people,' calling it a distraction by 'inept leaders who use hatred to deflect from their own shortcomings.' Kogan's body was handed over to ZAKA volunteers earlier Monday and flown to Israel for burial. His family, including his grieving wife Rivky, arrived in Israel ahead of the funeral. 'We’re in shock, shattered, horrified,' said Aaron Shpielman, Rivky’s brother. 'We want good things to come. We want the Messiah. My sister is in a state beyond words.'

In a Gulf-state-led operation, they were captured and extradited to Abu Dhabi. Images released Monday showed three Uzbek suspects, identified as Olimpi Toirovich, 28, Makhmudjon Abdurakhim, 28, and Azizbek Kamlovich, 33, handcuffed, blindfolded, and wearing blue prison garb. Reports suggest the suspects had tracked Kogan’s movements before abducting him in Dubai and driving him to Al Ain, 90 minutes away. Evidence of violence and blood was found in his vehicle, which the suspects used before murdering him and discarding his body, discovered Sunday. UAE authorities are expected to seek the death penalty for the suspects. While no motive has been officially stated, Israeli officials have labeled the murder an antisemitic terror attack. However, the UAE’s official announcements have referred to Kogan only by his Moldovan citizenship, avoiding mention of his Israeli nationality. Israeli sources believe the attack was not directed by Iran but possibly by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas or another terrorist group. Iran has denied any involvement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylxypf71g	2024-11-25T11:57:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/ryLQDHz7Jl/ryLQDHz7Jl_0_171_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Withdrawal and freedom of action: What’s in the Lebanon agreement...	With cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah reportedly imminent, deal outlines 60-day trial period, Lebanese Army and UNIFIL deployment, US-led international enforcement committee and provisions allowing Israel to address threats and violations After nearly 14 months of clashes and exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, cease-fire seems ever closer with Israel reportedly having given its approval to end the hostilities. Lebanese officials and a Western diplomat told Reuters that Washington has informed Beirut a cease-fire could be announced 'within hours,' pending approval by the Security Cabinet, which is scheduled to convene Tuesday. These are the key provisions of the emerging agreement. Israeli withdrawal timeline: Under the proposed agreement, Israeli ground forces would begin withdrawing from southern Lebanon within 60 days of the cease-fire's implementation. The withdrawal, described as a 'pilot phase,' aims to assess the feasibility of the arrangement. Once completed, Israel plans to call on northern residents displaced by the fighting to return home. During this interim period, Hezbollah is expected to retreat north of the Litani River. Border negotiations: The agreement also stipulates that Israel and Lebanon will begin negotiations over disputed border points following the implementation of the cease-fire. However, Israel cannot be compelled to accept specific compromises. Deployment of Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers: The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) would replace withdrawing Israeli troops south of the Litani. These forces would oversee the dismantling of remaining Hezbollah infrastructure in the area and ensure the terror group does not reestablish its presence. Additionally, LAF, with UNIFIL support, would monitor and prevent weapons smuggling and production within Lebanon, bolstered by Western military aid from the U.S., UK and France. International oversight mechanism: A U.S.-led international enforcement committee would be established to oversee compliance with the agreement, drawing on UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which followed the 2006 Lebanon War. The committee would include Britain, Germany and France, despite Israeli opposition to French involvement. Israel has conditioned its acceptance of France's role on assurances that Paris will not enforce International Criminal Court arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or former defense minister Yoav Gallant. The Lebanese sought involvement from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan in the agreement, but none of these countries have officially declared they will take part in the committee. However, it is likely that at least one Arab state will play some role. The international mechanism is expected to assist the LAF and UNIFIL in enforcing their responsibilities under the agreement. The committee is also tasked with determining whether to allow one side to use force if the other violates the agreement. On this issue, the agreement does not mandate a specific timeline for a response. This means that if Israel identifies a threat from the Lebanese side that breaches the agreement, it will be able to act immediately. Hezbollah prisoners and targeted killings: The agreement stipulates that Hezbollah operatives captured by Israel during ground operations will not be returned to Lebanon. While Hezbollah sought guarantees against targeted killings of its leaders, Israel refused to commit, leaving the issue unresolved. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: U.S. security guarantee for Israel: A separate U.S.-endorsed document not included in the Lebanese agreement preserves Israel's right to take immediate military action against direct threats, such as rocket launches or bombings. Israel would also retain the ability to interdict arms transfers from Syria to Hezbollah. For non-immediate threats, Israel would first refer cases to the enforcement committee. Israeli officials highlighted differences between the emerging deal and UN Security Council Resolution 1701, amid criticism from northern residents and local leaders directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Unlike the 2006 resolution, the new agreement establishes an international enforcement committee led by the U.S., which Israel believes will be more robust than previous reliance on UNIFIL alone. The agreement also recognizes Israel's right to prevent Hezbollah’s rearmament and to address emerging threats south of the Litani River, which Israeli officials view as a significant step toward ensuring long-term security. Officials in Jerusalem expressed confidence that the incoming U.S. administration, led by President-elect Donald Trump, will support Israel's operational freedom under the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkek008m7jl	2024-11-25T11:17:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/01/SJ00hTofZke/SJ00hTofZke_0_8_853_481_0_small.jpg

Lebanon spoils: IDF reveals over 60,000 Hezbollah weapons seized ...	Massive arsenal stored at IDF logistics base includes jeeps, rocket launchers and anti-aircraft missiles; only half of terror group’s captured weaponry transported to Israel while the rest destroyed in the field Over the past two months of its ground campaign in southern Lebanon, the IDF has seized approximately 60,000 pieces of weaponry and military equipment from villages repurposed as Hezbollah strongholds, officials said Monday. The seized items, processed by the IDF’s Trophy Unit in the Technology and Logistics Directorate (Atal), include firearms, combat vehicles, motorcycles, rocket launchers, anti-aircraft missiles and operational intelligence materials. According to IDF sources, the haul represents less than half of the stockpiles uncovered in Hezbollah's staging areas near the Israeli border. For every four weapons caches removed by ground forces, approximately six more were destroyed in the field by forces. Among the 10,000 larger items seized are 40mm shells, rockets and anti-tank missiles. Smaller munitions, like rifle or machine-gun rounds, are counted by the crate. The military is still deliberating how to handle the massive cache, which adds to hundreds of thousands of weapons and munitions uncovered during operations in Gaza. IDF officials noted a significant quality gap between the arsenals: Hezbollah’s weaponry is generally newer, standardized and effective, with much of it originating from Iran and Russia, while Hamas' arsenal is comparatively worn and improvised. Despite the quantity of seized arms, the IDF has no plans to equip its forces with AK-47 rifles or RPG missile launchers, citing the risk of operational confusion and adherence to standard-issue weaponry. However, some materials, particularly explosives, are already being used in the field for destroying tunnels and weapons depots. Among the notable finds were Iranian-made .50 caliber sniper rifles, capable of causing devastating injuries, designed as imitations of Austrian sniper rifles. Hezbollah’s vehicle fleet, also displayed Monday, included off-road ATVs for transporting arms and fighters, as well as larger jeeps and pickups retrofitted to carry rocket launchers, anti-aircraft missiles and mobile heavy machine guns. 20 tons of ammunition a day Atal presented staggering data on military logistics and consumption during the war, now in its 13th month. Historically, both the IDF and government planned for wars lasting up to five weeks, but the current fighting has vastly exceeded those expectations. Medical supplies for combat troops have cost NIS 280 million ($73 million) so far, equivalent to four years of supplies under normal conditions. Additionally, the IDF has supplied two million liters of water to troops in Gaza and consumed 157 million liters of diesel fuel and 500 million liters of jet fuel, primarily for aircraft in both northern and southern theaters. Since October 7, 160 factories producing food and textiles have been repurposed exclusively for military use. Transportation costs have surged dramatically, with the cost of airlifting one kilogram of goods for the IDF rising from $3–$4 pre-war to $17 due to aviation challenges. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Atal has supplied 15 million spare parts to combat units. Thousands of armored vehicles and trucks worn down by the prolonged fighting have been repaired, with 90% of vehicles damaged by IEDs or anti-tank missiles restored to operational status within an average of two and a half weeks. Over the past year, the IDF’s armored vehicles, including tanks and APCs, have logged 900,000 kilometers—four times the distance of an average year packed with drills and training. The military has also repaired or replaced 8,150 engines, many in active combat zones in Gaza and Lebanon. For example, the readiness of armored vehicles and bulldozers in the 162nd Division, fighting continuously in Gaza since the war’s start, now stands at 85%. The number of mechanical repairs completed during ground operations in Gaza is equivalent to servicing the equipment of 13 entire divisions. Atal's policy has prioritized direct support to front-line units, often at great cost. The logistics branch has suffered 97 fatalities and 2,200 wounded so far. It has conducted 2,000 logistical missions, replenished units 800 times, delivered 100 tons of supplies by air and sea and provided 1,600 living quarters for troops. Daily, Atal distributes 20 tons of ammunition via 90 trucks, 300,000 liters of diesel, 15,000 liters of jet fuel and 500 equipment items to troops. The IDF has also procured 70,000 new tactical helmets and receives 70 drones daily to support combat operations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1rgxszxye	2024-11-25T09:55:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/ByM3WOgfQke/ByM3WOgfQke_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Israel braces for heavy Hezbollah attacks as cease-fire nears	Stricter safety guidelines issued for border communities and Golan Heights; schools in Nahariya and Acre remain closed; leaders slam Netanyahu: 'We refuse to once again fall into the slumber dictated by international interests' Amid reports that a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah could be announced 'within hours,' Israeli authorities in the north are bracing for an anticipated surge in rocket fire. Military officials believe Hezbollah may launch an intensified assault in the final days of the fighting, prompting heightened readiness and revised civil defense measures. The IDF announced stricter guidelines following a security assessment. Frontline communities in the northern Golan Heights, including Katzrin and Kidmat Tzvi, will transition from 'partial activity' to 'limited activity' status. Restrictions include a ban on educational activities, a maximum of 10 people in outdoor gatherings and 100 in indoor spaces, and work permitted only where access to shelters is immediate. In Haifa and the Bay region, education will continue under the 'yellow protocol,' requiring proximity to protected areas during activities. The Security Cabinet is scheduled to meet Tuesday to approve the cease-fire agreement, following reports that Israel had given preliminary approval to move forward. However, northern residents remain on edge, with some referring to the coming days as Hezbollah’s 'farewell barrage.' Frustration is mounting in northern Israel, with residents accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of 'abandoning' them. Local anger has been exacerbated by reports of progress in cease-fire talks, which residents claim they are learning about only through the media. In Western Galilee’s Mateh Asher Regional Council and in Nahariya, authorities preemptively announced that schools would remain closed Tuesday, with all education shifted to online platforms. Kindergartens, extracurricular activities and municipal services, including city hall reception, have been suspended. Social activities in Mateh Asher are permitted only under strict conditions and with the oversight of community emergency teams. The tension is mirrored across the border, where spontaneous celebrations were reported in the Lebanese city of Tyre following news of the cease-fire negotiations. Local leaders outraged Acre Mayor Amihai Ben Shlush announced that no classes will be held Tuesday in the city’s educational institutions, citing heightened security risks ahead of the potential agreement. In a statement to residents, Ben Shlush explained, 'These days leading up to the signing of a cease-fire are particularly dangerous for us. Some may view this decision unfavorably. I understand your frustrations and difficulties, but I cannot accept accusations of abandoning children. That’s simply not true.' He added, 'I act solely based on professional considerations to ensure the safety and well-being of our city’s residents. After discussions with Home Front Command, I was informed that heavy barrages are expected, and we must be prepared. I hope I’m wrong, but I’d rather err on the side of caution than risk lives. I’ve decided to close all educational institutions, including informal education programs, for 24 hours. Classes will continue via Zoom.' Moshe Davidovich, head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council and chairman of the Confrontation Line Forum, responded to the reports, warning that any agreement must include robust security measures for residents of the northern border region before their return home. 'If a cease-fire agreement between Lebanon and Israel is signed without substantial provisions to restore the security of confrontation line residents—including a fortified buffer zone with a strong international force and the removal of Hezbollah beyond the Litani River—it will be a historic mistake,' Davidovich said. He added, 'We cannot afford to face the same failures that left us vulnerable after Lebanon and the Second Lebanon War, when unenforced agreements left us exposed. I remind the Israeli government that northern residents are Israel’s first line of defense, and as such, their security must be guaranteed.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Uri Kellner, head of the Golan Regional Council, urged the Israeli government to 'complete the mission of removing the threat over northern residents, rather than agreeing to a cease-fire under fire.' He also called on ministers to 'continue strengthening the Golan and the north by bolstering settlements and communities.' Amit Sofer, head of the Merom HaGalil Regional Council, expressed strong opposition to the emerging agreement, saying, 'We hear the cabinet is set to discuss the proposed deal, and I expect we won’t repeat the grave mistakes of October 7, where 101 hostages remain in captivity. We cannot agree to an arrangement that allows a return to northern border villages, each of which serves as a Hezbollah terror outpost, ready to rebuild the terror infrastructure we paid for in soldiers' blood to dismantle.' He added, 'We refuse to once again fall into the slumber dictated by international interests that seek to create the illusion of quiet and security at the expense of confrontation line residents and the future victims. We’re speaking about an agreement, but they’re speaking about a hudna—a temporary truce to prepare for the next attack.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skyucez7yx	2024-11-25T09:15:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/04/HJgyQOKnFC/HJgyQOKnFC_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Scathing Pentagon report raises concerns over F-35 fighter jets, ...	Israel relies on F-35 for deep strikes and air defense, but concerns growing over operational reliability, technological superiority and high maintenance costs, raising doubts about the fighter jet’s ability to meet strategic and financial expectations The Pentagon has identified significant challenges with the F-35 stealth strike fighter jets, critical to Israel’s Air Force operations, according to a classified 382-page report. The F-35, known as 'Adir' in Israel, faces issues with stealth reliability, maintenance systems and operational efficiency, raising questions about the world’s most expensive weapons system, which has cost $1.8 trillion to develop. The report revealed recurring malfunctions in the jet's prognostic health management system, designed to detect issues automatically. High false alarm rates—averaging one per hour instead of the standard one per 50 hours—have complicated maintenance and delayed missions. The report also noted problems with the F-35’s lethality due to design flaws in its gun systems and challenges maintaining its low-observability signature, a cornerstone of its stealth capabilities. Operational availability is another concern, with repair times twice as long as required, limiting the aircraft's mission readiness. Despite its advanced design to counter threats from adversaries like China and Russia, the F-35 has undergone only one relevant test to evaluate this capability. Cyber vulnerabilities also emerged as a critical issue, with the Pentagon urging Lockheed Martin to enhance defenses against digital threats. The company responded, citing significant investments in cybersecurity. Lockheed Martin defended the jet, stating that over 90% of its systems meet required standards and attributing many issues to logistical failures rather than design flaws. However, the report’s findings reignite debates over the F-35’s cost-effectiveness and suitability for long-range missions. Israel has purchased 75 F-35 jets tailored to its unique requirements, incorporating advanced local technologies for electronic warfare and data security. Since their 2016 deployment, 39 operational Israeli F-35s have participated in missions, including covert strikes in Syria and drone interceptions. Each jet costs $120 million, with future deliveries funded by U.S. military aid. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since its deployment in the Israeli Air Force in 2016, the F-35 has played a pivotal role in numerous missions, including precision strikes in Syria and its landmark downing of two Iranian drones in 2021, marking its first aerial victories. Globally, the U.S. has sold over 1,000 F-35 jets, but Israel was the first to deploy the aircraft in combat, striking Iranian targets in Syria in April and May 2018. The Adir has also been central in operations against Hamas in Gaza, Houthi rebels in Yemen, and in July, it reportedly participated in an attack on Iranian targets. Foreign sources allege it was used in a strike on Damascus that killed a senior IRGC commander at the Iranian consulate. Despite its operational success, criticism of the F-35's high maintenance costs and reliability has sparked debate in the U.S. about whether the aircraft is fit for sustained long-range missions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj00h33z7ye	2024-11-25T08:39:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/19/rJLSt1DJT/rJLSt1DJT_0_91_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Christians for Israel building in Netherlands vandalized by pro-P...	Pro-Palestinian protesters descend on C4I headquarters in Nijkerk, spray-painting graffiti, blocking entrances and attempting to assault staff; police intervene and restore order after hours of unrest The headquarters of the Christian pro-Israel organization Christians for Israel (C4I) was attacked Monday morning by dozens of protesters, reportedly from Extinction Rebellion, Justice Now and the Christian Collective. The incident occurred as employees were arriving for work, taking staff by surprise. Protesters spray-painted accusations such as 'supporting genocide,' 'child murderers,' and 'complicit in the events in Gaza' on the building’s facade and blocked the entrance for several hours. Witnesses said some protesters attempted to assault staff members. Police arrived about 20 minutes after the disturbance began, requiring nearly three hours to fully disperse the demonstrators. No injuries were reported. The attack follows earlier acts of vandalism at the building last summer and comes days before Christians for Israel is scheduled to hold a pro-Jewish community rally in Amsterdam. The upcoming demonstration, organized in collaboration with Dutch-Jewish groups, has drawn the ire of organizations critical of Israeli policies. Christians for Israel condemned the attack, emphasizing their long-standing work to foster Jewish-Arab cooperation and provide aid to Palestinian communities. 'For many years, we have contributed hundreds of thousands of Euros to organizations that aid Palestinians and foster cooperation between Arab and Jewish communities in Israel. Accusing us of complicity in genocide ignores these facts,' a representative for Christians for Israel said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Van Oordt expressed disappointment that dialogue attempts with the protesters had failed. 'We’ve said to them, ‘If you want to have a conversation, this is not the way to do it.’ Instead of engaging with facts and constructive dialogue, they resort to yelling, vandalizing, and spreading misinformation,' the representative added. Frank van Oordt, executive director of Christians for Israel Netherlands, said they were 'shocked,' particularly given its execution by self-identified Christians. 'We are standing up for Israel, and it makes us even stronger,' van Oordt said.'We are shocked, especially because it has been done by other Christians. And we can't understand that Christians won't see that it's the biblical truth that God is bringing back his people to the country. But we will stand up and make that known to all Christians in the Netherlands and in the whole world.' The protest marks escalating tensions in the Netherlands following recent attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam and reflects growing hostility in Europe over the war in Gaza. Christians for Israel plans to proceed with the Amsterdam rally on November 28, emphasizing its commitment to combating antisemitism and promoting dialogue. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrrx7fmyx	2024-11-25T08:16:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/HkbYiwWG71g/HkbYiwWG71g_236_210_956_538_0_small.jpg
What’s really fueling Jewish hate?	Yehuda Kurtzer: The root cause of antisemitism isn’t what you think The Jews are not the cause of antisemitism, according to Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute. 'I think there are a lot of forces underway across the West that are leading to the return of antisemitism in this pronounced way,' Kurtzer told ILTV News this week. 'This includes climate pessimism, economic pessimism, distrust in government, the decline of institutions, polarization of all of our democratic societies, and the way social media amplifies conspiracy theories and loneliness.' Kurtzer made these comments just days after an anti-NATO protest in Montreal turned violent, targeting Israel and the Jews, which led to several arrests. Additionally, a string of antisemitic incidents on college campuses last week has sparked fresh concerns within the Jewish community. Many worry that 2025 may see as much antisemitism and unrest as the previous year. In the three months following the October 7, 2023 Hamas massacre, the Anti-Defamation League reported a more than 360% increase in antisemitic incidents in the United States alone. Similarly, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights revealed earlier this year that some organizations experienced up to a 400% rise in antisemitism since the start of the war. Even before the conflict, an FRA survey found that 80% of European Jews believed antisemitism had grown in their countries over the prior five years. 'When we look at cases of antisemitism, the more pressing thing to do is to examine the conditions in a society that allow something like this to rise,' Kurtzer said. 'Because antisemitism is a symptom of a societal problem, rather than a problem in and of itself.' He explained that addressing antisemitism requires tackling broader societal issues. 'I want to resist the suggestion that if you fix one thing, you'll solve the [antisemitism] problem,' Kurtzer said. He pointed out that while Jewish leaders often believe Holocaust education or security measures like hiring guards for Jewish institutions will solve antisemitism, these steps alone are not enough. 'What we really need to do is start investigating what's going wrong in our liberal democracies and start addressing that set of problems,' he said. Kurtzer emphasized that unlike during the Nazi era, when governments persecuted Jews, today, Jews are equal citizens of Western societies. This position allows them to push public officials to address societal challenges and partner with the Jewish community. 'In turn, I want our Jewish community to be investing more resources in the infrastructure of liberal democracy rather than simply screaming about this hatred that's happening to us,' Kurtzer said. 'I fear that it actually moves us back into enclave thinking, as opposed to saying, how do we help build trust in institutions? How do we play a role in improving the culture around the media?' He continued, 'Those types of things are very different from what oftentimes passes for the Jewish communal discourse around antisemitism.' Some analysts suggest that history is cyclical and that Jewish communities rarely thrive in any diaspora for over a century. Kurtzer, however, said he disagrees and expressed optimism about the future of American Jews. 'American Jews are experiencing right now the greatest continuity on the planet of any single Jewish community,' he told ILTV. 'It's hard to think about, but we've been going strong in America for a long time, and I would hate to start becoming pessimistic about the future of our community because, you know, it never lasts that long.' Instead, Kurtzer urged Jews to focus on their contributions to American society. 'Now we have a responsibility to invest in this story, our own thriving, and America itself,' he told ILTV. Reflecting on the relationship between American Jews and Israel, Kurtzer, a fourth-generation American and liberal Zionist, said he once worried about the growing distance between the two communities. 'I think that those are completely compatible ideas,' Kurtzer said, noting that on October 7, both Israel and American Jews experienced a shared 'sense of collapse,' highlighting their deep, if sometimes unspoken, connection. 'It kind of indicated to us that these are actually communities that are leaning heavily on each other, even if we don't talk about it all the time,' Kurtzer said. 'I kind of feel like it's in the long-term interest of the Jewish people to build a strong, vibrant democratic Israel and a strong, vibrant democratic American Jewish community. Those simultaneous big bets that defy history are going to actually reinforce each other.'

From total victory to total surrender!': Northern Israelis outra...	Residents and local leaders fear emerging truce will allow terror group to regroup and rebuild; 'What will our residents return to? A devastated city with no security and no future?' asks Kiryat Shmona mayor Reports of progress toward a cease-fire with Hezbollah have sparked significant frustration among residents of northern Israel, who fear that a potential agreement could allow the Lebanese terrorist group to rebuild and once again threaten their safety. An American official said Monday that 'a cease-fire in Lebanon is imminent.' After more than a year of hostilities, residents are calling for a decisive resolution that exploits Hezbollah’s current weakened state following the extensive Israeli bombing campaign, which has targeted much of its leadership. Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avihay Stern expressed strong opposition to the reported deal, urging Israel's leaders to reconsider. 'Before signing what feels like a surrender agreement, I call on our leaders to look into the eyes of Kiryat Shmona’s children and think of their future,' Stern said. 'This agreement brings the threat of October 7 closer to the north. How have we gone from total victory to total surrender? Why not finish what we started? We’ve crushed Hezbollah, yet instead of dismantling it completely, we’re giving it the chance to recover. And what will our residents return to? A devastated city with no security and no future? This is madness,' Stern warned. Residents across the region are demanding that Israel 'end the story' and eliminate Hezbollah’s capabilities, ensuring long-term security before returning to their homes. 'They are playing with our lives' Moshe Davidovich, head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council in the Western Galilee, harshly criticized the emerging cease-fire agreement. 'I ask myself whether I’m living in a dream or a delusion—or if the decision-makers in Israel’s government are the ones delusional,' Davidovich said in an interview with Ynet. 'I’m not the one under delusion, because to present this charade—after people have spent more than a year confined to bomb shelters, after children have wet their beds for over a year, after mental health here has been stretched to the absolute limit—is simply insulting,' he added. 'Anyone who thinks we’re just guinea pigs in a lab has clearly lost their way. And anyone who believes they can just flip a switch, say ‘that’s it, time’s up,’ and that life will return to normal with peace and harmony restored along the confrontation line is living in a fantasy. These are people sitting comfortably in central Israel, in ivory towers, steering us toward disaster. 'We have brave residents here who, for over a year, have lost their livelihoods, their businesses, their agriculture, their tourism and their homes. And yet they [the decision-makers] are playing with our lives. Woe to the nation led by such captains.' Davidovich warned that the consequences of the agreement would fall squarely on the shoulders of government leaders. He condemned their failure to reinforce northern shelters or provide sufficient missile-proof rooms, saying, 'The blood will be on their hands. These are rash, unprofessional, unsafe and insecure decisions. We in the north are the state’s bulletproof vest, its shield, and we pay the price. Tragically, we will continue to pay the price because we are ignored, we are invisible, we do not matter.' Asked about discussions with military officials, Davidovich revealed alarming developments in southern Lebanon in recent days. 'What they’ve discovered just four or five kilometers away is extremely concerning. It’s not something from a year ago, or six months ago, or even a month ago—it’s recent, and it keeps me awake at night.' He specifically referenced threats near Rosh Hanikra: 'Those bunkers uncovered three kilometers from Rosh Hanikra have left me sleepless since Saturday. I’m exhausted, I’m worried, and I fear for the future of Mateh Asher’s children and all the kids along the confrontation line. To force them to return home without proper protection is unconscionable.' 'The house is collapsing on me' The head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council cautioned that residents would not feel secure under the proposed agreement, leading to an increasing number of families leaving the region. 'As the days pass, more and more families are leaving the Galilee and the north,' he said. 'We will do everything in our power to stop this trickle from turning into a flood. But it’s already happening daily, and as long as people don’t feel safe, more families will leave. The responsibility for this will lie squarely on the shoulders of the decision-makers.' David Shmuel, a resident of Nahariya whose home was struck by Hezbollah rockets Sunday, also shared his fears in an interview with Ynet, which was interrupted by another air raid siren. 'Yesterday was a terrible day,' he recounted, describing how his daughter narrowly escaped harm by following safety protocols and rushing to a protected room. 'She made it to the shelter, and two seconds later, a missile hit the building,' Shmuel said. 'I was on the phone with her—she screamed, ‘The house is collapsing on me! I hear screams, glass shattering.’ She was in complete shock. She’s still not calm, but we’re okay, we’re healthy.' Reflecting on over a year of life under fire from Lebanon, Shmuel described the situation as unbearable. 'It’s tough. There’s no life, we’ve had no life for a year now. You can’t plan anything, can’t go anywhere, can’t go out freely, not even to do something simple like exercise outside.' While residents long for peace, Shmuel voiced his opposition to the proposed agreement. 'I don’t think now is the time,' he said. 'I think until Lebanon is cleared of threats, the fire must not stop because it will return. Maybe in a year, two, or three—it will come back. 'In the north, we’re used to this, but I think now is the time to end it for the long term, for decades. We must not reach a one-sided agreement today that serves no one, least of all us in the north.' Politicians across spectrum blast emerging Lebanon agreement Criticism of the proposed agreement has come from politicians across Israel's political spectrum, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. While refraining from issuing ultimatums or threatening to dissolve the government, Ben-Gvir called the agreement a 'historic missed opportunity to eliminate Hezbollah.' 'I understand the constraints and the arguments, but this is a serious mistake,' Ben-Gvir said. 'We need to listen to field commanders and local leaders. Now, when Hezbollah is reeling and desperate for a cease-fire, we must not stop. As I warned in Gaza, I am warning again: Mr. Prime Minister, it’s not too late to stop this agreement! We must push forward until total victory.' Likud MK Amit Halevi also expressed reservations, specifically targeting U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who reportedly set a deadline for both sides to finalize the agreement or face his withdrawal from negotiations. Israeli officials fear such a withdrawal could lead to a problematic Security Council resolution imposing a cease-fire. Referring to Hochstein’s role in brokering the 2022 maritime border agreement with Lebanon—widely criticized by the current coalition while in opposition—Halevi warned that any 'Hochstein-style agreement' would be disastrous. 'The emerging deal relies on UN Security Council Resolution 1701 from 2006, but it should be based on Resolution 1559 from 2004, which calls for Lebanon’s independence and the disarmament of militias, including Hezbollah,' Halevi said. 'Any agreement that does not include Hezbollah's removal from Lebanon fails to meet Israel's security needs and contradicts the Cabinet’s decision to ensure residents can return home safely.' Likud MK Dan Illouz echoed concerns, calling reports of the near-deal with Hezbollah 'deeply troubling.' 'Instead of exploiting Hezbollah’s weakness after two months of heavy blows, the agreement under discussion grants the organization strategic gains and endangers Israel’s security,' Illouz said. He criticized the proposed deployment of the Lebanese Army in southern Lebanon, calling it 'self-delusion.' 'This is the same army overseen by a government in which Hezbollah holds significant power. It’s the same army that stood idly by as Hezbollah amassed a massive arsenal of rockets threatening Israel’s citizens,' Illouz said. The international oversight mechanism included in the deal also drew skepticism. 'It reminds me of past agreements—impressive on paper but toothless in reality. They did not last even a few months,' he concluded. Opposition leaders have also voiced strong objections to the emerging agreement, emphasizing the need for Israeli military autonomy in protecting the country’s northern residents and rejecting reliance on international forces. National Unity Party leader Benny Gantz said that the defense of northern Israel must remain exclusively under the IDF, dismissing the involvement of international forces. 'We cannot return to the reality of October 6,' Gantz said during a conference on Israel's post-war economic recovery. 'The IDF must retain full operational freedom to counter threats from Lebanon and continue offensive actions against Hezbollah's infrastructure until a desirable agreement is reached.' Speaking later at his party's Knesset faction meeting, Gantz reiterated, 'Without delving into the specifics of the proposed agreement, one thing must be unequivocally clear: with or without a deal, only the IDF will protect the residents of the north. Not UNIFIL, and not the Lebanese Army.' Opposition leader Yair Lapid also expressed reservations while emphasizing the importance of a political resolution. 'I sympathize with the residents of Nahariya and Metula, but ultimately, a political agreement is necessary,' Lapid said. 'The IDF has achieved tremendous successes in Lebanon—from unacknowledged operations to the elimination of Nasrallah and senior officials, and the ongoing strikes in Dahieh and southern Lebanon. These operational achievements are remarkable, but they are meaningless without a political endgame.' Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Liberman was more direct, labeling the deal 'unreasonable' for not requiring the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah. 'Israel's leadership remains trapped in the same flawed mindset, still living as if it’s October 6, and nothing has changed,' Liberman said during a faction meeting. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'This agreement is disastrous for Israel,' he added. 'The Iranians have already begun rebuilding Hezbollah, smuggling weapons again. Without mechanisms to create distance and ensure a security buffer, I tell the residents of the north: there’s no reason to return home. We cannot accept a deal that absolves the Lebanese government while allowing Hezbollah to operate freely and prepare for the next war.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar stressed the importance of enforceability in any agreement. 'The true test of any deal will not be in its wording or phrasing, but in enforcement,' Sa’ar said. 'This enforcement must focus on two points: preventing Hezbollah from moving south of the Litani River and stopping them from rebuilding their arsenal anywhere in Lebanon.' Sa’ar underscored the government’s commitment to preventing a return to pre-October 7 conditions. 'Any violation must be dealt with immediately. We will not sell the future for temporary peace in the present,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrliwz7ye	2024-11-25T06:29:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/H1u242sfJl/H1u242sfJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Shiites ask why Hezbollah refused a cease-fire: 'You could have p...	Critics of the terror group say an agreement could have been reached months ago under the same conditions after 1 million people were displaced and thousands killed; Shiite cleric calls on community to reject sectarianism and unite as Lebanese The war in Lebanon is exacting a heavy price from civilians, and on no group more than the Shiite Muslims in Lebanon. While cease-fire negotiations continue and their conclusion is reported to be in sight, some Lebanese Shiites accuse Israel of targeting the entire sect and destroying is historic landmarks. They believe they are being unfairly punished because they share a religious identity with the Hezbollah terror group and often live side by side with them in the same area. Hezbollah continued its rocket fire on Israel on Monday after launching missiles at central Israel a day earlier. Millions were sent into shelters as more than 250 projectiles were launched, causing injuries and damage. The IDF also continued its strikes, including on Hezbollah's Beirut stronghold the Dahieh neighborhood. According to Al Akhbar, Hezbollah's media mouthpiece, there are doubts in Lebanon that an agreement is within reach. 'Israeli and American leaks about a pending deal; Lebanon rejects speculations and awaits the official response.' Thus far at least 3,500 people were killed in Lebanon in the war. Most are Hezbollah operatives but according to reports, 900 of the dead are civilian women and children. One million people have been displaced from their homes and the devastation is estimated at a cost of at least $8 billion. This has prompted some to wonder why Hezbollah had not agreed to a cease-fire months earlier, when the same terms currently discussed, could have been agreed upon. This would have spared Lebanon 'destruction, martyrs and losses worth billions (of dollars),' Lebanese legislator Waddah Sadek, who is Sunni Muslim, wrote on the X platform. Criticism of Hezbollah was also voiced by Bahaa Al Hariri, the son of Lebanon's former prime minister Rafik al Hariri, who was assassinated in a car bomb attack by Hezbollah terrorists in 2005. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Lebanon's independence Day falls at a historic and critical moment this year, in which the country stands at a crossroads that would determine its future,' he said in a post on X. 'The greatest challenge is our internal divisions and the attempts of some to replace the state and its institutions, especially its military.' Hariri continued that real independence means getting rid of foreign guardians, of all forms, and their militias. 'The Lebanese people, of all sectors must join the rebuilding of Lebanon.' In an earlier post he praised the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander, Salim Ayyash, who was involved in his father's assassination, in a strike attributed to Israel and also called on the terror group to lay down its arms, after the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in September. Shiite cleric Ali Al Amin, who has been critical of Hezbollah in the past, slammed the group for deciding on its own to begin a war with Israel, and called on other Lebanese Shiite leaders to declare that Lebanon is an independent authority and to abandon anything that contradicts its sovereignty or prevents it from fulfilling its role. 'Ask your leaders why they brought this destruction on Lebanon,' he said according to a report in Saudi Arabia's Al Arabiya network. 'Opening a front in support of Hamas in Gaza, only hurt Lebanon,' he said adding that it is time to move forward toward co-existence of all sectors. Some Shiites told the Associated Press that they were concerned that all Shiites in Lebanon will suffer if Hezbollah is weakened, while others said they hoped there could be 'greater political openness,' that would allow a diversity of Shiite voices. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkspnkgxyg	2024-11-25T04:56:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/H1IGucW71g/H1IGucW71g_0_0_3000_1974_0_small.jpg

These are the telltale signs of quiet violence against women in r...	On the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Israeli women tell of their lives suffering from quiet violence which is harder to prove and more devastating to the soul Rotem was in a violent relationship for over a decade. 'The physical violence began when I was pregnant with my youngest son, but today I can say it was there from the first time we met,' she says. 'Isolation, control, jealousy. He had a need to approve everything I did. Economic, verbal and general violence, throwing things, it was all there, I just didn't know how to identify it.' She says it began with testing the limits of verbal violence. 'The more I let him speak to me badly, the louder our fights, the contempt, the belittling and humiliation around friends, grew. He made me dependent on him. Who would have me? He would ask. What was I worth without him? I found myself trying to change my patterns of behavior and was sure I was the problem,' Rotem says. Like many women who deal with quiet violence, Rotem failed to see the signs or the danger, at first. 'In quiet violence, red lines are constantly crossed. There is a slow development, almost unnoticed. When the story of Shira Isakov who was almost murdered by her husband made headlines, I noticed warning signs that I had been missing.' Rotem says over time she came to realize her life was in danger. 'In every fight he would threaten to slap me and I though to myself it would be better if he would just do it and give me a reason to leave, she says. 'Getting slapped hurts for a bit and then it passes but the quiet violence shakes your entire subconscious,' she says. 'He knew all my sensitive spots. You begin to distrust yourself, have less faith in those around you, become suspicious. Those are things that need years to get over. They leave scars on your soul.' After her second son was born Rotem realized she was not only giving up on herself, but that there were other people who need her. 'I decided to split up but then the threats began. He said he would kill me. This made me walk on eggshells everyday just so that I would not say anything that would set him off.' She was considered at high risk and went with her children to a shelter for battered women. 'It got worse. He would cover my mouth to keep me from screaming, pour water on me and throw food I made into the trash. He would lock me out of the house, hide my car, hide my credit card, throw chairs, plates, glass bottles at me. The house was a broken mess.' Although public awareness of the various forms of domestic violence has increased, many women still fail to recognize the danger that they are in. 'It sounds illogical that a grown person can enter a violent relationship and not understand that they are being treated violently,' Efrat Harel Heiman, a clinical psychologist and head of the Marva Law, Welfare and Empowerment Institute, explains. 'Violence can be physical, sexual, emotional and verbal. Usually such cases involve prolonged violence so I think it would be right to describe it as hidden abuse.' She says these situations can escalate to physical abuse. 'The quiet violence is below the surface. Usually such relationships begin seeming fine and that is a trap that makes the victim believe they are in a good and beneficial partnership. The abuse begins slowly when the victim is already reliant on the abuser. Physical violence could follow and expand in form, over time. The more the abuser feels their victim is submissive, the more they reveal their darker sides.' Liora, a mother of three young children, knows that reality well. 'I was in a toxic relationship for nearly 10 years. I have a career, I am well educated, and I am not a stupid person, despite my partner telling me that I am. I thought he would change, for me. I thought I would be good for him. Today I know I failed. You cannot help someone who does not want to help himself.' She says the violence began early on. 'When we were dating, he would throw things, and once even kicked the wall in. He would punish me. Once he left me on the side of the road and drove off because he didn't like how I behaved. I could have called a friend for help but was embarrassed, so I waited for him to come back,' she says. 'He always made me feel I was at fault and that he only behaved like that with me. I was sure he was the one for me and that it would be wrong to leave him because of my wrongdoings. I told myself I could change, and that I would work hard to be worthy of him. Liora says she could not name what she was going through at first. 'We married quickly when I became pregnant. During our marriage he would spit on me, humiliate and belittle me. We hardly went to social gatherings because I was afraid people would see his outbursts. I lived an unstable life with temper tantrums, and could not make plans because I would never know what mood he would be in.' When the physical abuse began, Liora decided to end the relationship. 'He grabbed on to me and kicked me. That was the turning point. I left home for a while, but he promised he would never do that again and that he would begin treatment. That fizzled out over time. After the second time he was physically violent, I stopped sleeping in the same bed. I was terrified. I went to the police and we split up. But from that point it just got worse,' she says. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'He would break into my house and make threats. He was arrested a couple of times and let go. They thought this was a bad divorce and did not understand that he was a psychopath. In the end his threats became more concrete and I was considered in danger. He was arrested and I was sent to a shelter with my kids.' Liora says quiet violence has no signs and people fail to see they are in that kind of a relationship. 'When I woke up to reality, I asked for a restraining order because I was afraid of him. The judge asked me why I only came now if I was so scared? That to me was the hardest part because when you are beaten physically, it leaves marks, which make it easier for those around you to see and identify the situation. When there are no physical marks, its harder to explain.' Vardit Danziger, CEO of No To Violence Against Women, says quiet violence is dangerous and has severe repercussions. 'It is serious violence. We see more and more women in our shelters who deal with it. It wounds the spirit and can cause trauma, PTSD and anxiety. It is hard to recognize when you are in such a relationship but when you do, it is hard to convince others of it.' 'I think it is time that this matter receives more attention and not only in public discourse. Courts and the police must also recognize it. In France, for example, there is a law that recognizes quiet violence as any other type of violence, but in Israel, the law recognizes physical but not emotional violence, which makes it hard to prove in court,' Danziger says But there is hope. 'Awareness is growing and I think we are on the way to recognition of this type of violence, although we are still far from providing an adequate response to it. I believe we must begin with education. That will bring change.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/skhdzjbmjx	2024-11-25T03:18:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/24/yk14159816/yk14159816_0_83_788_444_0_small.jpg

Egyptian authorities rescued 16 people after a tourist boat sank off its Red Sea coast, three security sources told Reuters on Monday, as search operations continued for the remaining passengers and crew members. The boat, Sea Story, was carrying 45 people, including 31 tourists of varying nationalities and 14 crew, on a multi-day diving trip when it went down near the coastal town of Marsa Alam, according to a statement by the Red Sea Governorate. Governor Amr Hanafi said some survivors were rescued using a helicopter and have been taken to medical care. Efforts to locate more survivors were ongoing in coordination with the Egyptian navy and army.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdf4kmqke	2024-11-25T02:49:51-08:00	
UK would follow 'due process' if Netanyahu were to visit, says FM	Britain would follow due process if Benjamin Netanyahu visited the UK, Foreign Minister David Lammy said on Monday, when asked if London would fulfil the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant against the Israeli prime minister. 'We are signatories to the Rome Statute, we have always been committed to our obligations under international law and international humanitarian law,' Lammy told reporters at a G7 meeting in Italy. 'Of course, if there were to be such a visit to the UK, there would be a court process and due process would be followed in relation to those issues.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1oszyf71l	2024-11-25T02:44:54-08:00

Iran's Khamenei calls for death sentence for Israeli leaders	Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says arrest warrants are not enough and death sentences must be issued for Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant The supreme leader of Iran, which backs the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists fighting Israel in Gaza and Lebanon, said on Monday that death sentences should be issued for Israeli leaders, not arrest warrants. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was commenting on a decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants on Thursday for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense chief Yoav Gallant, and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri. 'They issued an arrest warrant, that's not enough... Death sentences must be issued for these criminal leaders', Khamenei said, referring to the Israeli leaders. In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a 'widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza.' The decision was met with outrage in Israel, which called it shameful and absurd. Gaza residents expressed hope it would help end the violence and bring those responsible for war crimes to justice. Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza.

Handcuffed, blindfolded: See 1st photo of the suspects in the mur...	The suspects in the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan are all citizens of Uzbekistan; It is believed they did not act on behalf of Iran, but they did act for a terrorist organization The United Arab Emirates late Monday morning released the first photos of the three suspects in the murder of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, whose body was found in the city of Al-Ain three days after he was kidnapped from Dubai. The UAE Interior Ministry announced that the three suspects are citizens of Uzbekistan. They are named as Olimpi Tohirovic, 28; Mahmoud John Abdul Rahim, 28; and Azizi Kamilovic, 33. No suspected motive for the murder was announced, though Israel has called it an antisemitic terrorist attack. The announcement about the arrest of the three, which was undertaken, according to the United Arab Emirate, 'with record speed,' did not identify Kogan as Israeli, referring to him only as a 'Moldovan citizen,' though he holds dual citizenship. The Iranian Embassy in the Emirates on Sunday night rejected claims about the involvement of the Islamic Republic. Even earlier, Ynet learned that the latest assessment is that the terrorists who murdered Kogan were not acting on behalf of Iran but, apparently, on behalf of Islamic Jihad, Hamas or another terrorist organization. The murder has shaken the UAE's Jewish community, which Jewish groups estimate to number in the several thousand. Kogan was a resident of the UAE and also a Moldovan national, according to local authorities. He lived in the UAE for several years, working as a Chabad emissary. Israeli agencies are taking part in the investigation, an Israeli official told Reuters on Sunday. The Moldovan foreign ministry has said that it is contact with UAE authorities. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: UAE Ambassador to Washington Yousef Al Otaiba has said that Kogan's murder was a crime against the Gulf Arab country, which sits on the Arabian Peninsula and across the Gulf from Iran. The Israeli and Jewish community in the UAE has grown more visible since 2020, when the Gulf Arab country established official ties with Israel under a U.S.-brokered agreement. The UAE has maintained ties with Israel amid the 13-month-old Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkzfj6wm1g	2024-11-25T01:13:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/SyO3Pp11mkl/SyO3Pp11mkl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Iranian-born Muslim activist attends every pro-Palestinian protes...	Iman Spati, who shows up at every pro-Palestinian demonstration in Berlin despite threats to his life, says 'Ever since I saw them celebrating on October 7, I knew I had to be there' Iman Spati, 38, has no memory of his father, Akbar Spati, except for a small and haunting keepsake: an audio cassette in which his father says, 'Don’t be afraid. Wherever you go, I’ll be watching over you.' A year after recording those words, when Iman was just two years old, Akbar, a political activist in Iran’s opposition, was executed. The man responsible for the sentence was Ebrahim Raisi, then Tehran’s prosecutor general and later Iran’s president. 'To retrieve his body, my mother was forced to pay for the bullets used to kill him,' Spati recalls. In 1999, as repression tightened in Iran and Iman neared military draft age, his family fled to Germany. 'Shortly after I arrived in Germany, I became deeply interested in issues of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment,' Spati says during an interview at the offices of Bild, where he works as a multimedia producer. 'I remembered how it began the same way in Iran. In 2016, after witnessing Berlin’s Al-Quds Day rally, where horrific slogans were shouted and Iranian, Hamas and Hezbollah flags waved, I decided to get more active and document these hate demonstrations.' Since October 7, Spati has attended around 140 pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Berlin – not as a journalist, but as a citizen armed with a video camera to capture what he describes as Germany’s descent into hatred. 'At first, thousands came out to support the Palestinian cause,' he explains. 'Now it’s only a few hundred, but they’re much angrier, more antisemitic, and increasingly violent. They attack police, throw bottles, and the officers are exhausted because politicians won’t back them up.' At almost every protest, Spati is targeted. Demonstrators shout, 'F--- you, Iman Spati,' hurl insults, follow him, and threaten him. In July, someone struck him on the head with a flagpole, and later another individual headbutted him. That same month, while walking his dog, he was confronted outside his home by a man wielding a knife and a blonde woman he recognized from previous demonstrations. 'When I chased them, the woman screamed that I was trying to assault her,' he says. Spati was briefly detained but released after police apprehended the assailant. 'There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of complaints about what happens at these demonstrations, and not a single conviction,' Spati says. 'People pretending to be pizza delivery workers knock on my door, accusing me of being a Mossad agent. The rhetoric is violent and threatening, and no one is doing anything about it. On the contrary, some police officers with immigrant backgrounds see me as the problem, as someone stirring up trouble against Arabs.' Who attends these demonstrations of hate? 'It’s a bizarre cocktail of far-left radicals and radical Islamists who have nothing in common except their sweeping hatred for Israel and Jews,' Spati explains. 'Ninety percent of them think what happened on October 7 was a good thing. The other 10% are too afraid to speak out. The mass Muslim migration in 2015 allowed the far left to openly express their antisemitism under the guise of helping Muslim victims. October 7 lit the fuse. The far left bears the responsibility for what’s happening at these protests – they hate colonialist Israel and the West.' And what about the Muslim protesters? 'Most are in it for the money,' Spati says. 'They earn sometimes thousands of euros a month by posting protest videos that rack up hundreds of thousands of views. And it’s become ‘cool’ to be antisemitic and anti-Israel – it’s a way to fit in socially.' According to Spati, the level of violence and incitement rises with each protest. He recalls an incident earlier this month when a passerby wearing a yellow badge to symbolize support for the hostages in Gaza was assaulted, and his young daughter was dragged into a march. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Ever since I saw them celebrating with baklava on October 7, I knew I had to be there,' he says. 'I’m not afraid of them, I’m afraid of what could happen. I know what it means when people try to bring the Middle East, the place they fled, into the heart of Europe. The average German doesn’t understand what that truly entails.' 'I don’t want to die, but I’m ready to sacrifice my life for the way of life that gave me refuge when I fled Iran,' Spati adds. 'I’m certain my father is watching over me, and he would be proud that his son is carrying on the fight he gave his life for.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qoo211qkg	2024-11-25T00:45:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/Byx734F11Qkx/Byx734F11Qkx_0_50_1024_576_0_small.jpg

According to the municipality, 'the decision to destroy the building after using engineering tools was made due to the fear that the building will collapse and damage the building next to it.' The municipality added that engineering officials determined that it was a dangerous building that could collapse at any moment, and prohibited its residents from entering, not even to take their personal belongings from the apartments. However, Home Front Command personnel will assist as much as possible in removing personal belongings from some of the apartments in the building.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxjntz7jx	2024-11-25T00:35:22-08:00

His Chabad emissary son was killed by terrorists in Mumbai: 'It s...	In 2008, Rabbi Nachman Holzberg's son and daughter-in-law, who were Chabad emissaries in Mumbai, were murdered by Islamist terrorists; Now the husband of the rabbi's granddaughter was murdered in the UAE. Just like his son Gabi, the rabbi says, 'Zvi was dedicated to his work, constantly trying to help more people' Some 16 years after his son Gabi and his daughter-in-law Rivka were killed in an attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai, last weekend Rabbi Nachman Holzberg received the news of the murder of his granddaughter's husband Zvi Kogan in Dubai. 'We feel as if the whole tragedy is happening all over again. It's simply incomprehensible,' Holzberg told Ynet. 'Just like 16 years ago, it happens the week before the world gathering of Chabad emissaries, both then and now; my son Gabriel was 28 years old and Zvi was also 28 years old. There are a lot of things happening here together and it overwhelms everything.' There are not only parallels between the circumstances of the murder, but the lifestyles of Gabi and Zvi there are also similar in Holzberg's eyes. 'Everything that was said about Gabi, is also true of Zvi. He was dedicated to his work, constantly trying to help more people, everyone who entered the Chabad house would leave with a smile on their lips. Jew or non-Jew, winter or summer, Shabbat or weekday, he knew how to give the maximum to everyone.' Holzberg added: 'He was one of the greats of the generation in love for Israel and the unity of Israel. All the sheikhs in Dubai loved him dearly, and the people of the country also loved him very much. He was always running for everyone, as far as he was concerned he had no privacy, he did not care for himself. When he would come to events in New York, he would return immediately because he felt that the place he needed him.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Holzberg calls on others to learn from his grandson's example. 'I wish we would learn from him and try to follow his path, smiling at everyone, loving everyone. When my son was murdered, no one asked whether he was from the Likud or Labor, whether he was right or left, whether he was secular or religious. When they came to kill Zvi they didn't think about whether he was from the right or the left, secular or religious. This is the point that needs to be conveyed from Zvi's story and Gabi's story - that everyone should take care of everyone. For example, everyone considers the hostages in the tunnels as if they were their own family. We are in a time with many orphans, families with parents who have lost sons. Think about them, take care of them, and everyone will take stock of themselves, how can they take care of someone else. That's how we will receive a great blessing and a complete redemption.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1pjajwmkg	2024-11-24T23:31:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2016/11/21/7398345/7398345_2_0_2376_2498_0_small.jpg

Ofer is spending his 2nd birthday as a hostage in Gaza	Ofer Calderon marks his 54th birthday in captivity in Gaza, a year after the release of his two children who were kidnapped with him; He told his daughter when she was released, 'Fight for me' Ofer Calderon's 54th birthday falls on Monday, but instead of celebrating it at a picnic with his four children, he is spending it in a dark tunnel with limited oxygen in the Gaza Strip. Last year, days before the release of two of his children who were kidnapped with him from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, Erez and Sahar, Ofer marked his 53rd birthday, and knew that his gift was the return home of his two children. 'Ofer is a very warm, very homely type,' says Ofer's cousin, Eyal Calderon. 'He is a very present father, and this is not a cliché. He has four amazing children and he is present in the lives of each and every one of them. Yesterday, his daughter Gaya said in Hostage Square ahead of Ofer's birthday that every time they celebrated one of the family members, they started the day with a cake waiting on the table, balloons and gifts from each. Right after that they went for a picnic. Ofer is a person of outdoor spaces and of nature: riding his bike with his team, piloting airplanes. This is a man for whom the most antithetical thing is being in the depths of the tunnels of hell.' Eyal added that Ofer's captivity is 'the opposite of what he represents and is normal for him. Ofer is the type of person, even if you haven't spoken to them in a year, within a moment of conversation you will not feel a difference. Even if there is a distance between the conversations, the conversation flows instantly. When he enters the room he immediately smiles and you don't understand why. He spreads light in the room, lightens the atmosphere. He's not just a 'hostage', he's a living and present person, and is so noticeable wherever he is. I'm sure he behaves like this in the tunnels as well.' What did the returned hostages tell you about him? 'We know from all the hostages who returned and were with him in captivity that he helped them a lot and helped them maintain optimism. Just a few days after Sahar and Erez were released, Shani Goren was brought to the area where he was in the tunnels. He seemed optimistic, he said to her, 'I will prepare food for you from what I have here ', adding that he was sure that he would leave in two or three days. It was on his 53rd birthday that he told Sahar when she was taken from him 'Fight for me, I don't want to die in the tunnels.' This is a girl who is now 17 years old and has been carrying this phrase around for a whole year. A girl her age should not hear any of this from one of her parents, and certainly not carry it around so much. She lives with it and we live with the command from heaven that he bequeathed to her and to us. We fight and do not stop for a moment, our duty is simply to return him as soon as possible.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'They haven't even started the rehabilitation process. They are still in a state of temporary survival, they won't be able to do it until Ofer returns,' Eyal says of the hostage's children. 'They were released on the last day of hostage releases and were under the stress of 'yes or no'. We knew they were supposed to be on the list and I was sure that Ofer would also return in a week or so and we would celebrate him with them. Our decision-makers do not understand what the return of the hostages means to our society, to our communities. They are talking about all kinds of security risks, but they pose the biggest risk, which is the integrity of Israeli society.' What will you wish for Ofer? 'Ofer - I wish you would read or hear or see the energies we are sending you on this birthday. Know that we are not giving up for a moment, I swore to your children that I would not give up and I want you to know that we are all a united family and joined together as one strong fist, and we are doing everything and will continue to do everything to bring you back to us and to your loving children, Sahar, Erez, Gaya, Rotem and all your loving family. You will return, recover and help in the rehabilitation of all of us. We will spread your wide and bright light in the world until you return, and you must return, because the world needs the warmth and cheerfulness and joy you spread. You just have to keep surviving and we are on our way to you and we will get there.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk6z2qzxkg	2024-11-24T22:12:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/25/B1GjJWDfT/B1GjJWDfT_0_133_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Abu Hussein was responsible for many rocket and mortar fire attacks against the Israeli citizens and IDF soldiers operating in the Gaza Strip. Multiple other Hamas terrorists were eliminated in the strike, including the terrorist Muhammad Abd al-Rahman Muhammad Zakout, who infiltrated Israeli territory and participated in the October 7 massacre. Meanwhile, during IDF operational activity in southern Lebanon, the troops located large quantities of weaponry and dismantled numerous armed and ready-to-fire launchers directly aimed at Israeli communities in the Galilee area.

The report released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women said the increase was largely the result of more data being available from countries and not more killings.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjxzv511mjl	2024-11-24T21:08:43-08:00

Are 'peaceful protests' becoming hotbeds of antisemitism?	Multiple antisemitic incidents and violent riots have been reported in cities across the U.S. and Canada Multiple antisemitic incidents and violent riots have been reported in cities across the U.S. and Canada. These seemingly 'peaceful protests' often escalate quickly into major violence, with multiple arrests already confirmed. At least four people have been arrested in Montreal, according to Canadian media, after a protest outside a NATO meeting quickly escalated into major violence. Rioters smashed windows of nearby establishments, set cars ablaze, and some were even seen performing Nazi salutes. The violence intensified with clashes against police as pro-Hamas rioters tore through parts of Montreal. The protest also featured the burning of an effigy of the Israeli prime minister, an act that has yet to receive any acknowledgment from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. This follows Trudeau's endorsement of the ICC arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, where he stated that, as a founding member, Canada will uphold any rulings by the International Criminal Court. Meanwhile, some 300 miles away in Rochester, New York, four university students were arrested and charged with felony criminal mischief after CCTV footage identified them as responsible for hanging viral 'Wanted' posters targeting Jewish staff members across the University of Rochester campus. At Columbia University, silent protestors attended a speech by Israeli Axios journalist Barak Ravid, only to walk out in protest before he began his lecture. Students adorned in keffiyehs marked another demonstration in what has become a regular sight on the Columbia campus. While the Israel Defense Forces continue their mission to rescue hostages still held in Gaza, the international arena is emerging as another front of conflict.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hksaxwbqyg	2024-11-24T17:32:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/13/H1ZjJDyET/H1ZjJDyET_0_0_850_478_0_small.jpg
Is the ICC's case against Netanyahu worse than the Dreyfus affair...	Eugene Kontorovich says the ICC's decision is 'another talking point in a diplomatic war against Israel.' The International Criminal Court (ICC) is a court with no jurisdiction, investigating crimes in a state (Palestine) that does not exist—crimes that never happened, according to Israeli legal expert Eugene Kontorovich. Speaking to ILTV News on Sunday, Kohelet Policy Forum's Kontorovich said the ICC’s decision to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is worse than the infamous Dreyfus Affair. In 1894, Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused and arrested for passing military secrets to the Germans. 'In the affair of Dreyfus, there was, in fact, spying for the Germans, but it was not done by Dreyfus,' Kontorovich explained. 'In this case, the crime they are accusing Israel of—starvation—simply hasn’t happened at all.' Will there be consequences for Netanyahu and Gallant? According to Kontorovich, that depends entirely on how other countries choose to act. However, he expressed little concern about this aspect. Rather, he views the ICC’s decision as 'another talking point in a diplomatic war against Israel to justify boycotts and create an increasingly diplomatically hostile climate.' 'Whether that succeeds or not is really going to depend on how countries react, in particular, how the United States and Israel react,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1eiai11qkx	2024-11-24T17:21:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/02/06/rJoTQKhg00/rJoTQKhg00_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Despite international arrest warrant, Gallant to head to US	Former defense chief set to meet with senior White House and State Department officials in Washington regardless of ICC warrant Former defense minister Yoav Gallant is set to travel to Washington, D.C., next Sunday for talks with senior officials at the White House and U.S. State Department, marking his first visit since the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague issued an arrest warrant against him. The trip comes after a turbulent period for Gallant, who was dismissed from his post by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a reshuffling of government roles. Netanyahu had previously barred Gallant from visiting the U.S., citing the need for better coordination with the Biden administration amid regional security threats, including preparations for Israel's retaliatory strike following Iran's October 1 ballistic missile attack. In early October, Gallant was scheduled for a quick visit to Washington to strengthen U.S.-Israel security coordination. However, Netanyahu postponed the trip, conditioning it on a phone call between himself and President Joe Biden. Shortly after, Netanyahu dismissed Gallant, appointing Israel Katz as the new defense minister. Shortly after his removal, Gallant reiterated his commitment to Israel's security in an X post, writing, 'The security of the State of Israel has been and will always remain my life’s mission.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The White House has criticized the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, including Gallant. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby emphasized that the U.S. 'fundamentally rejects' the court’s jurisdiction over Israel, saying, 'We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' The U.S. is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its authority, ensuring Gallant faces no legal challenges while in the country. However, concerns linger about potential complications if Gallant’s aircraft requires an emergency landing in a country that enforces the ICC’s jurisdiction. Such a scenario could expose him to legal risks under the arrest warrant. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1hms1111mye	2024-11-24T13:53:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/26/HkMMksK8C/HkMMksK8C_0_22_1157_651_0_small.jpg

Life after captivity: Abigail’s new beginning and the long road t...	Abigail Edan, symbol of October 7, celebrates her fifth birthday with her adoptive family after surviving Hamas captivity; her aunt and uncle, who are raising her and her siblings, say, 'She hasn’t changed much, but she’s matured a lot. We’re healing every day' Abigail Edan, abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza at the age of three after her parents were murdered, became one of the enduring symbols of the October 7 events. Months after her release in a hostage exchange, a photo of her in the arms of U.S. President Joe Biden touched hearts worldwide. She marked her fourth birthday in captivity, without any family, after her parents, Roy and Smadar, were killed. Her siblings, Michael and Amalia, survived by hiding in a closet during the massacre. On Sunday, Abigail celebrated her fifth birthday, just two days before what has become a second milestone: the anniversary of her release from Hamas captivity. 'She hasn’t changed much, but she’s matured a lot this past year,' said Zuli and Liron, Abigail’s aunt and uncle, who have adopted her and her siblings. 'For all of us, life is divided into before and after October 7. She was already a happy and healthy child, incredibly smart—wise beyond her years. She thinks she’s 16 and has amazing resilience.' Abigail did not want to take part in our project, wisely asking her aunt Liron why people wanted to photograph her. 'I asked if she remembered Emily, Zivi and Gali, Doron and Keith (Damari, Berman, Steinbrecher and Siegel) our friends from the who still haven’t come back home. I explained that we’re doing this for them,' Liron said. 'And then, with her childlike wisdom, she asked, ‘But how will that help?’' 'A year has passed, and the normal thing to think is, ‘How is it possible that they’re still there?’ For me, it’s a miracle that we’re here today, 415 days later, but there are still 101 families waiting for their miracle. This reality is with us every day—it’s the last thing I think about at night and the first thing in the morning.' 'This is why we agreed to this article,' Zuli says. 'Zivi and Gali grew up before our eyes. I remember them as kids playing soccer in our yard. Aviva (Siegel, who returned from captivity while her husband Keith remains a hostage) was my children’s kindergarten teacher. This is our community. We want to show that it doesn’t matter if it’s a four-year-old or a 40-year-old—they all must come home. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Everyone bears scars, but life is stronger than us, and we have to move forward. But not before every single hostage is returned. We want to give hope to other families, like our neighbor Talia (Berman), that her children will come back safe. That was one of my biggest fears—what would I see after 51 days? I can’t even imagine what it’s like for families still living this nightmare after 415 days.' Zuli and Liron, like many Israelis, never imagined this reality would persist a year after Abigail’s release and nearly 14 months since October 7. As they mark Abigail’s fifth birthday and one year as a new family unit, they acknowledge the challenges ahead. 'We will keep doing what we’ve been doing all year—choosing life,' Liron says. 'Alongside the pain and tragedy, I believe that’s what Roy and Smadar would want for us and our children. A year from now, we’ll be even stronger. People who meet us for the first time often ask which kids are ours biologically, not knowing our story. But that’s not what we focus on. We’re focused on being a family. We have a long road ahead, full of challenges—not just with Abigail, but her siblings, our biological children and everything they experienced that day until we were rescued from our safe room. Our daily work is about healing and recovery as a family, and that process won’t be complete until all 101 hostages are home.' 'This is our life’s mission,' Zuli adds. 'It’s what we do 24/7—helping the kids heal and adjusting to our new family dynamic. It’s important for the public and the state to understand that even when a hostage comes home, the event isn’t over—it’s just beginning. There’s a long road to recovery, and it takes time. We didn’t come home and close the chapter; we’re healing every day, letting the wounds scar over. And that doesn’t happen in a month, or even a year. It’s an ongoing process, and we need the country’s full attention and support to get through it.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r177xzz7jg	2024-11-24T12:16:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/rJEfZPskXye/rJEfZPskXye_1_382_852_480_0_small.jpg

Amid war, these Israeli universities shine in global rankings	Eleven Israeli academic departments rank in world’s top 50, per Shanghai Ranking, excelling in mathematics, chemistry and communications; long decline in computer science rankings halted, marking turning point for Israeli universities Last week, the prestigious Shanghai Ranking for academic institutions published its detailed 2024 departmental rankings, and overall, it was a positive year for Israeli academia. The decline in computer science rankings was halted, with the Weizmann Institute’s computer science department breaking into the top 100. Hebrew University climbed to 14th place globally in mathematics, with Israel boasting three universities in the top 100 for the subject. Additionally, Israel’s two technological universities, the Technion and the Weizmann Institute of Science, ranked in the top 40 in chemistry, a highly profitable field. In journalism and communications, Israel emerged as a global leader, with Hebrew University and the University of Haifa both ranked in the top 30. Overall, 11 Israeli academic programs are ranked among the world’s top 50. It was also a strong year in the overall institutional rankings published in August. After several weaker years, three Israeli universities — the Weizmann Institute of Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Technion — were ranked among the top 100 globally. The Weizmann Institute of Science led Israeli institutions, securing the 69th spot, slightly down from 68th last year. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem climbed from 86th to 81st place, while the Technion dropped from 79th to 85th, resulting in a swap between the two institutions. Additionally, the Technion was ranked 11th among the world’s top technological universities. The Shanghai Ranking, published annually since 2003, evaluates the research performance of academic institutions based on various criteria, including the number of Nobel and Fields Medal laureates among faculty and alumni, the number of scientific papers published in leading journals such as Nature and Science, and other research achievements. The ranking assesses over 2,500 universities worldwide, highlighting the top 1,000. The high status of Israeli academia has become de rigueur, but it is important to remember that Israel is a country of just 10 million inhabitants. When calculating the number of institutions in the top 100 relative to population size, Israel ranks fourth in the world, trailing only Switzerland, Singapore and Denmark, and ahead of countries like France, Germany, the UK and Sweden. Last week, rankings were also published for specific academic departments, including technological fields, which hold special significance for the Startup Nation. The good news is that the decline of Israeli programs in computer science has been halted. The Weizmann Institute, which dropped last year to the 100–150 range (exact rankings are only published for the top 50), returned to the top 100. Ben-Gurion University and the Technion, which also saw declines, regained ground, and the University of Haifa entered the top 100 for the first time. However, Hebrew University's computer science department remains stuck in the 401–500 range. Despite these improvements, Israeli institutions are still far from the high marks of 2018, when the Weizmann Institute ranked 21st and Tel Aviv University was 37th. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: If there is one scientific field where Israel truly excels, it is mathematics. The Hebrew University has advanced significantly, climbing from 25th place in 2020 to 14th. Tel Aviv University ranks 45th, and the Weizmann Institute is close behind in 46th. In 2020, only Hebrew University was in the top 50. Additionally, four other Israeli universities are ranked among the top 500. Israel’s success in mathematics reflects the advantage for universities in fields where costly laboratories are unnecessary, and there is less competition for faculty. Israel’s ability to shine in resource-light disciplines is further evident in its strength in communications and journalism. Since 2020, the Hebrew University has risen from 30th place to 14th, while the University of Haifa has jumped from 42nd to 28th. In chemistry, a field with significant economic potential, Israeli institutions have seen mixed results. The Technion and the Weizmann Institute, previously ranked between 50th and 75th, have made impressive gains, now ranking 32nd and 39th, respectively. However, other universities have struggled. The Hebrew University’s chemistry department is currently ranked between 201 and 300, while Tel Aviv and Ben-Gurion universities are in the 401–500 range. Relatively low ranking in economics In total, Israel boasts 11 academic departments ranked among the top 50 globally. The Hebrew University leads with three subjects: mathematics (14), communications (14), and law (42). While law improved from last year’s rank of 50, it remains well below its 2022 position of 30. The Technion also has three departments in the top 50: chemistry (32), space engineering (40), and electronics engineering (48). The Weizmann Institute is recognized for two: chemistry (39) and mathematics (46). A surprising standout is the University of Haifa, which, despite being ranked between 601 and 700 institutionally, has two departments in the top 50: communication (28) and public management (41). Tel Aviv University has only one subject ranked: mathematics (45). In economics, four Israeli universities are ranked, but only the Hebrew University places in the top 100, at 51–75. Tel Aviv University is ranked between 201–300, while Reichman University recently entered the rankings at 401–500. In business administration, Israeli universities struggle to compete with the high salaries offered by private American institutions. Until 2022, Tel Aviv University was ranked 201–300, but since then, no Israeli university has made the list. Some fields where Israeli universities once excelled have seen declines. In 2021, six Israeli universities ranked among the world’s top 200 in education, with Haifa at 51–75. Today, only two universities—Tel Aviv and Haifa—remain in the top 200, both below 150. Similarly, the Technion’s space engineering department, which ranked 16th globally in 2020, has gradually fallen to 40th. While still impressive, it reflects a notable decline. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjkaiplxjg	2024-11-24T09:38:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2014/03/17/5220254/5220254_36_110_989_557_0_small.jpg
UAE says suspects captured in Chabad emissary's killing	Emirati Interior Ministry announces 'record-time' arrests in murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, as Iran increases efforts to harm Israeli officials The United Arab Emirates announced Sunday evening the arrest in 'record-time' of suspects in the killing of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, whose body was discovered Saturday in the city of Al Ain, three days after he was abducted. The suspects, identified as Uzbek mercenaries allegedly hired by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, reportedly fled to Turkey immediately after the murder. UAE officials did not disclose where the arrests were made but emphasized the rapid response as a demonstration of their 'unwavering capability to decisively address any attempts to undermine the security and stability of its society.' The UAE Interior Ministry identified Rabbi Kogan as a Moldovan national 'according to his identification documents at the time of entry into the UAE' and stated that an investigative team was formed immediately upon his disappearance, leading to the identification and arrest of the suspects. According to a statement, 'the UAE and its institutions are fully committed to safeguarding the safety and security of its citizens, residents, and visitors... it will utilize all legal powers to respond decisively and without leniency to any actions or attempts that threaten societal stability. Furthermore, it reaffirmed its readiness to implement all necessary deterrent measures to protect social harmony and peaceful coexistence, strictly adhering to the nation’s laws and regulations.' Terhan's tactics According to investigators, the assailants had tracked Rabbi Kogan's movements before kidnapping him, driving him in his own car to Al Ain, and killing him. Signs of violence and blood were discovered in the vehicle. The suspects reportedly fled to Turkey after the murder. The UAE, working alongside Israeli Mossad agents, has imposed a media blackout on the investigation. Questions remain over Turkey's cooperation, as concerns grow about its emergence as a potential haven for terror cells. These fears follow reports of senior Hamas operatives relocating from Qatar to Turkey. This tactic of using paid mercenaries allows Iran to maintain plausible deniability, a method it has previously employed in attacks on Israeli targets in Thailand, Sri Lanka and Sweden. Officials link the same strategy to a stabbing in the UK targeting Iranian dissident journalist Pouria Zeraati. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the killing, calling it a 'heinous act of antisemitic terror.' He vowed Israel would pursue those responsible, adding, 'We value the UAE's cooperation in this investigation and will strengthen our ties in the face of these attempts to undermine peace.' Defense Minister Israel Katz labeled the killing a 'cowardly and despicable antisemitic act of terror,' while Deputy Minister Uri Maklev emphasized that the incident is 'not merely antisemitism, but a full-fledged terror attack.' President Isaac Herzog expressed solidarity with the Chabad movement, calling the attack 'a stark reminder of the evil faced by the Jewish people.' He thanked UAE authorities for their swift response and voiced confidence that justice would be served. Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli reassured Chabad emissaries worldwide, pledging Israel’s full support and describing their work as a 'beacon of light and hope for Jews and Israelis everywhere.' Iran's favored targets: Israeli ambassadors Israeli diplomatic missions abroad have raised their alert level to the highest since the October 7 Hamas attack last year, with officials particularly concerned about potential threats to Israeli envoys, especially ambassadors, who are seen as symbols of government authority. Iran and its proxies are considered the primary threat, as ambassadors are viewed as highly vulnerable targets. In the past, Tehran has successfully targeted official Israeli envoys. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In some cases, ambassadors have been prohibited from living in their official residences and are required to move between safe houses. Any activity outside embassy premises now requires security approval, with officials assessing risks ranging from assassination attempts to possible kidnappings. These heightened measures have significantly restricted the movements of ambassadors, sometimes even preventing them from performing basic daily tasks. The restrictions also extend to their families, who face similar precautions. The Foreign Ministry’s Security Division has been operating around the clock since the Hamas attack, which has also fueled a rise in global antisemitism. Security has been reinforced for many Israeli envoys, and in several instances, they have been relocated to other cities or countries due to concerns for their safety. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjrbkjbqkx	2024-11-24T09:17:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/S15uN00yXyg/S15uN00yXyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Desperate for troops, Putin manipulates vulnerable Yemenis to fig...	Facing manpower crisis, Moscow recruits Yemeni mercenaries with false promises of high wages and citizenship, only to coerce them into joining army and sending them to fight in Ukraine under unreadable contracts, Financial Times reports Russia has recruited hundreds of Yemeni mercenaries to fight in Ukraine, the Financial Times reported Sunday, in a move that raises concerns over Moscow’s deepening ties with Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The Houthis, an Iran-backed group responsible for attacks on Israel and chaos in the Red Sea, reportedly facilitated the recruitment effort. According to Yemeni nationals interviewed by the newspaper, they were promised high-paying jobs and even Russian citizenship. However, upon arriving in Russia with the help of Houthi-linked organizations, they were forced to enlist in the Russian army and sent to the front lines in Ukraine. This recruitment follows earlier reports of Moscow enlisting fighters from Nepal and India, as well as receiving some 12,000 North Korean troops amid manpower shortages in its nearly three-year war in Ukraine. The Financial Times noted that Russia’s efforts in Yemen underscore its growing alignment with Iran and its proxies amid its confrontation with the West. U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking confirmed that the Kremlin is actively building ties with the Houthis and has discussed weapons supplies for Yemen. 'We know that there are Russian personnel in Sana’a helping to deepen this dialogue,' he said. 'The kinds of weapons that are being discussed are very alarming, and would enable the Houthis to better target ships in the Red Sea and possibly beyond.' American diplomats have reported in recent months that Russia is also providing the Houthis with information to aid their missile launches. Maged Almadhaji, head of the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies, a Yemen-focused think-tank, told the Financial Times that the shipments of mercenaries to Russia are organized by the Houthis themselves in an effort to tighten and expand ties with Moscow. Farea al Muslimi, a Gulf affairs expert, added that only a few of the Yemeni mercenaries sent to Russia have any training, and many do not want to go: 'One thing Russia needs is soldiers, and it’s clear the Houthis are recruiting [for them]. Yemen is a pretty easy place to recruit. It is a very poor country.' The newspaper reported obtaining contracts signed by Yemeni recruits, bearing the name of a company identified as a tourism and medical equipment transport company, owned by a prominent Houthi politician. Its investigation indicates that the recruitment of Yemeni soldiers began as early as July. A Yemeni recruit named Nabil told the Financial Times that he was part of a group of about 200 Yemenis recruited to the Russian army in September after arriving in Moscow. He said some were experienced fighters, but many had no military training at all. He recounted that they were deceived and brought to Russia to sign recruitment contracts they could not read. Nabil testified that he was lured with promises of excellent working conditions in 'security' and 'engineering,' hoping to earn enough money to complete his studies. A few weeks later, he found himself with four other fresh Yemeni recruits in a forest in Ukraine, dressed in Russian military uniforms with their faces covered with scarves. 'We are under bombardment. Mines, drones, digging bunkers,' a man is heard saying in a video obtained by the newspaper, reporting that one of his colleagues attempted suicide and was taken to a hospital. According to the Financial Times, the men in the video say they are carrying wooden planks through a mine-filled forest, apparently to build a shelter from the bombings: 'We don’t even get five minutes to rest, we are so tired.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Abdullah, another Yemeni recruited by Russia, told the newspaper that he was promised a $10,000 bonus in addition to a $2,000 monthly salary and eventually Russian citizenship if he worked in Russia manufacturing drones. He arrived in Moscow on September 18 and, along with other Yemenis who arrived with him, was forcibly taken to a facility about five hours from Moscow. There, a man speaking elementary Arabic fired a gun above their heads when they refused to sign recruitment contracts written in Russian. 'I signed it because I was scared,' Abdullah told the newspaper. He said they were then loaded onto buses, underwent basic military training, and were sent to a base near Rostov, close to the Ukrainian border. According to him, many from this group were killed in Ukraine, brought to the war by 'scammers who traffic in human beings'.

Israeli locksmith fatally shot in robbery in Memphis	Aviv Broek, 21, originally from Rehovot, lured by fake service call; found dead near his car in remote location; police report he was shot four times; no suspects have been arrested An Israeli national working as a locksmith in Memphis was shot and killed on Thursday in what police say was a robbery during a bogus service call. Aviv Broek, 21, originally from Rehovot, Israel, had traveled to the U.S. for work and settled in Tennessee. According to police, Broek was called to change a car lock in the city’s south side. Upon arriving at the location and exiting his vehicle, he was robbed and shot four times in the stomach. Police said Broek did not resist and died on the spot. 'On Thursday evening, around 10:30 p.m., Aviv received a call to change a lock,' Ilai, Broek's friend and co-worker, told Ynet. 'When he got out of the car in an isolated alley, he was robbed and shot four times in the stomach. According to the police, he did not resist or struggle, yet they shot and killed him.' Ilai said that a friend who worked with Aviv located him shortly after. 'They reached him two hours after the shooting. They found him lying on the floor and immediately called the police,' he said. 'They used a location app on their phones, and that's how they found him. As soon as the app stopped working, we started to suspect something was up.' Preliminary findings indicate the suspect who lured Broek to the scene used a disposable phone and selected a remote location near a highway with no security cameras. Police have recovered the phone and recordings of the call between Broek and the suspect, but the shooter’s identity remains unknown. 'I am in contact with the investigator leading the investigation, but at the moment there are still no answers,' said Ilai. 'Not only was he robbed and murdered, but they also took his work equipment worth thousands of dollars, cash and even his passport.'

He flew with a friend, initially to Los Angeles, where they worked for about three months, then they moved to Memphis, where they stayed for about six months. They planned to leave, but it was too late. I talked to him about two weeks ago, he was on the road a lot. He said that he was fine, that he was working and making money. He said that there is no antisemitism there, and we don't know if that is the background to the case, but in my opinion it is.' Rotem said the assailants took advantage of his brother’s generous nature. 'He was a giving person, always ready to help others. When they called him, they claimed it was an urgent situation—that someone’s mother was stuck in a car—and offered to pay him double. They lured him into a trap, bringing him to an abandoned house,' Rotem said. 'Despite the late hour, Aviv went to help. He was a man of peace, someone who loved life and new experiences. He was brave and never afraid of anything. This tragedy shocked us. We thought it was safer there than in Israel. Aviv always told us he took care of himself and avoided dangerous places.' In the wake of the incident, Broek’s family and friends launched a fundraising campaign to bring his body back to Israel for burial. The Foreign Ministry confirmed it is aware of the case and stated that the circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybnwpx7ye	2024-11-24T08:07:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/24/SygLe5e7ye/SygLe5e7ye_2_191_1063_599_0_small.jpg

Iran suspected in AI-driven hoax targeting Israeli ministers	Ministers report receiving suspicious invitation to Hanukkah event from purported Chabad figure, later revealed to be fictitious; incident follows mounting threats from Tehran, including killing of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan in UAE Several government ministers, including Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu and Negev and Galilee Minister Yitzhak Wasserlauf from the Otzma Yehudit party, recently received an invitation to an event purportedly hosted by Chabad in New York. Upon further investigation, however, it turned out that the invitation was signed in the name of a fictitious figure, raising suspicions the message was an Iranian attempt to lure government ministers. Estimations now suggest the Iranians, or whoever orchestrated the attempt, used artificial intelligence to fabricate the identity of a rabbi. The individual reaching out from the U.S. possessed a new American cell phone number issued in October. The ministers reported the matter to the Shin Bet in both instances, which began investigating the sender. Senior agency officials informed the ministers that the language of the invitation was likely crafted using artificial intelligence (AI). 'I, Rabbi Yitzchak Shafer, representing the Chabad movement, am honored to invite you to participate in Hanukkah celebrations to be held at the end of December in Brooklyn, New York City. The holiday coincides with the Christian Christmas and the start of the new calendar year,' read the invitation sent to the ministers. 'The event will celebrate the traditions of Hanukkah and include prominent figures from the American-Jewish community, as well as influential political and religious leaders. I respectfully ask for your presence at these remarkable Hanukkah celebrations.' 'If you’re interested and available to attend, I’d appreciate it if you could confirm as soon as possible so we can issue an official invitation from Chabad,' the message continued. 'We’ll also arrange your travel and accommodations for the event. I eagerly await your response. Rabbi Yitzchak Shafer, Chabad.' In one case, a more extended exchange unfolded between the minister and the fictitious figure. 'I work at the Israeli embassy under Ambassador Michael Herzog,' The individual claimed, adding, 'I’m the second secretary at the embassy in Washington, tasked with overseeing cultural and religious matters.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, the minister's aide responded, 'I checked with Ambassador Herzog and he doesn’t know who you are.' To this, the figure replied, 'You’re not telling the truth.' The incident comes against the backdrop of Iran's escalating efforts to target and harm Israeli officials. On Sunday, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad emissary in the United Arab Emirates, was found dead after being abducted and killed by what authorities believe is an Iranian-linked terror cell. Investigations revealed that three Uzbek operatives, allegedly directed by Iran, followed Kogan after he left his kosher grocery store in Dubai, abducted him and fled to Turkey after killing him. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjcmh11acem1l	2024-11-24T06:25:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/B1lfh1Ff1l/B1lfh1Ff1l_153_115_976_550_0_small.jpg

What's Netanyahu waiting for, the next hostage murdered in capti...	Brother of Israeli hostage held by Hamas tells Ynet about the frustrations over government inaction and the focus on war and internal politics; slams Netanyahu for ignoring hostage plight while slamming Shin Bet Kobi Ben Ami, brother of kidnapped Ohad Ben Ami, expressed his deep frustration with the government’s inaction after Hamas released a psychological warfare video claiming a hostage had been killed in captivity In an interview with Ynet on Sunday Ben Ami said he was angry after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a nine-minute video defending his close aid Eli Feldstein, suspected of security breaches, without mentioning the hostages. Feldstein was in custody awaiting indictment after he released a misleading report to the German Bild, claiming then Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar would take hostages out of Gaza through the Philadelphy corridor, allegedly to justify Netanyahu's insistence on maintaining IDF presence there, and refusing to agree to a hostage release deal that would include withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Strip. Netanyahu on Saturday posted a 9 minute speech to camera lamenting the incarceration of his aid and spokesperson and claiming the Shin Bet withheld information from him, abused and mistreated the suspect in an effort to target the prime minister. 'Yesterday, they announced the kidnapping of the rabbi in Dubai, then Hamas released a psychological warfare video,' Ben Ami said. 'After that, the prime minister puts out a nine-minute video and doesn’t mention this at all. So where are we at? I keep asking the prime minister, what are you waiting for? The next hostage to be murder in captivity? The next rape in captivity? For a family member to take drastic action?' he asked. 'Why aren’t you, Israel’s leader, responsible for the fate of 101 hostages, doing everything to bring them home? To restore the lives of survivors and bury the murdered? Every citizen in Israel should know this will be their fate should they be kidnapped from their home in their undershirt and underwear. I’m sorry to say this but this is reality.' Marking a year since the only hostage exchange deal in which Raz Ben Ami, Ohad’s wife, was freed, Kobi described her condition. 'Raz returned from the horror of captivity to the reality faced by families of hostages. For a year, knowing what’s happening there, her husband and father of her daughters isn’t home. I’m sorry to say this but her condition worsens by the day — mentally, physically in all aspects.' Ben Ami also addressed Hamas' psychological warfare video, which allegedly showed a hostage murdered in Gaza captivity. The IDF said the information was under review. 'This only underscores the need to finalize a deal and bring them home,' he said. 'It’s unacceptable that for so long, there’s a baby, a child, women, soldiers, and men in captivity and as we see and know, the next murder or rape could happen at any moment.' 'This must end. It’s simply unimaginable. I don’t know what pains me more now — missing my brother or the constant worry that the worst might happen, that I’ll get the next devastating call. It’s an indescribable situation,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The fear is constant, even when Hamas doesn’t release a video or do anything,' he said. 'Now winter is coming and we’ve received reports from doctors and professors that they [the hostages] won’t survive another winter there — they’ll die. People still alive will die. So what are we waiting for? I truly don’t understand. We’re at our wits' end, desperate and frustrated.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1dgatxxyl	2024-11-24T03:13:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/Bk0QP5Xfp/Bk0QP5Xfp_1_70_623_351_0_small.jpg

Iran to hold nuclear talks with European powers, report	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's government seeks solution to impasse in talks ahead of Trump's second term in office, after IAEA resolution condemns Tehran's continued advances in its nuclear program Iran plans to hold talks about its disputed nuclear program with three European powers on Nov. 29 in Geneva, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Sunday, days after the U.N. atomic watchdog passed a resolution against Tehran. Iran reacted to the resolution, which was proposed by Britain, France, Germany and the United States, with what government officials called various measures such as activating numerous new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium.

Elon Musk become richest man in history, report	Tech entrepreneur snags new title with a valued net worth standing at over $300 billion; fortune expected to rise following Trump's election victory Elon Musk has broken a historic record, becoming the wealthiest person in history with an estimated net worth of $334.3 billion, Forbes reported on Sunday. Musk's wealth surged by $70 billion in just 20 days —a figure exceeding the annual GDP of several nations. This meteoric rise is attributed to several key developments. Tesla shares climbed 3.8%, reaching a three-and-a-half-year high of $352.56 per share. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has reached a valuation of $50 billion, with Musk holding a 60% stake. Another major factor contributing to Musk's wealth increase is U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's election victory. Musk, who donated hundreds of millions to Trump's campaign, is expected to be appointed chair of the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), a role aimed at reducing bureaucracy in U.S. agencies. Wall Street analysts predict Tesla will benefit significantly from regulatory relief under a Trump administration, particularly regarding its autonomous vehicle programs. Musk’s net worth is projected to rise even further with an upcoming investment round in SpaceX, which could raise the company's valuation to $250 billion. The gap between Musk and Larry Ellison, the world's second-richest individual, currently stands at more than $80 billion. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Musk's primary sources of wealth include 13% of Tesla shares (valued at $145 billion), 42% of SpaceX (worth $88 billion), and stakes in other companies such as X (formerly Twitter) and Neuralink.

Lebanon's national carrier becomes a source of pride amid war	Middle East Airlines continues to operate flights despite Israeli strikes near Beirut's international airport keeping vital connection open to the world The relentless strikes in Beirut's Dahieh district during the recent months of conflict have not deterred the operations of Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines (MEA), a fact that has astonished both Lebanese citizens and aviation enthusiasts worldwide. The sight of the airline's planes taking off against the backdrop of smoke billowing from nearby Dahieh sector of the city, a Hezbollah stronghold, inspires immense pride among locals, who watch aircraft navigate the skies amid Israeli attacks. Headquartered at Rafic Hariri International Airport, the Lebanese airline stands alone, as all foreign carriers have suspended flights to and from Beirut, according to an October report by Saudi network Al-Arabiya. MEA has become the sole link between Lebanon's only airport and the wider world. According to reports in the New York Times, MEA was once like any other national airline, facing complaints about flight delays, ticket prices, and the quality of onboard meals. However, since the Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah sites, the airline has been elevated to the status of a national hero. Its aircraft take off and land mere hundreds of yards from where the strikes are carried out, sometimes shortly after they occur. 'We are not the military. We are not heroes. We are a commercial airline,' a former pilot and spokesperson for the airline told the paper. In recent months, there have been numerous reports of damage in the airport vicinity and on the road leading to it. On November 7, the Qatari publication Al-Arabi Al-Jadid reported minor damage to Beirut's airport and its runways due to the strikes, noting that some aircraft were relocated from runways near Al-Ouzai in Dahieh, which was under attack that day. Lebanese Transport Minister Ali Hamieh said the airport was operating normally. For the Lebanese, maintaining and showcasing continuous operations at the airport during wartime is crucial, as the country grapples with a deepening economic crisis exacerbated by the conflict, striving to maintain some connection with the world and sustain tourism. A passenger who spoke with the French news agency in October recounted flying with the airline on the day Hezbollah's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was killed in September. 'I was on the bridge leading to the airport when the explosions were heard. It was a terrifying experience,' she said, adding that she arrived at the airport in a state of panic. Her flight to Cyprus departed on time, and from her window, she could see plumes of smoke rising from Dahieh and the surrounding region. In an interview, she expressed her pride in the Lebanese airline. 'I am proud to be Lebanese and able to fly with my country's airline during war, knowing they will take care of us. I also knew the plane would return with the crew within hours to the war zone.' Lebanon is no stranger to strife. Beirut's airport has weathered multiple conflicts, as has the national airline, founded in 1945. The New York Times said that MEA survived the regional wars of 1967 and 1973, as well as the 15-year civil war that concluded in 1990. The airline continued to operate in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and during the Second Lebanon War. In fact, it has become a kind of success story, remaining profitable despite Lebanon's collapse. According to Mazen Al-Samak, head of the Lebanese Private Pilots Association and an aviation safety consultant, a crisis unit was established by the airline and the country's civil aviation authority since the beginning of the Israeli strikes. This unit assesses each flight, and if there is a risk, take-offs are postponed, or pilots approaching Lebanon are instructed to slow down until it is safer to land.

You cannot find another airport in the world operating under strikes occurring just 500 yards away,' he said. The persistence of the airline has given Lebanon a sense that it is not completely cut off from the world. 'As long as the airport is open, it means we are not completely screwed,' Makram Rabah, a historian at the American University of Beirut, said. 'There is a Mediterranean element here. People living in the Mediterranean always love to go out, whether it's our ancestors, seafarers, or modern transportation. You cannot disconnect Lebanon from the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkituvgqjg	2024-11-24T01:12:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/H1xc9L2nGkg/H1xc9L2nGkg_464_162_2089_1718_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah's 'diamond': New details on Israeli missile reverse-eng...	According to Israeli security officials the Almas missile poses a real threat to IDF forces; Hezbollah begins manufacturing in Lebanon to reduce Tehran dependency Hezbollah has been using the Almas anti-tank missile, reverse-engineered by Iran from an advanced Israeli anti-tank missile that was captured by Hezbollah during the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the New York Times reported on Saturday. Israeli security officials said that the missile now poses a threat to IDF forces near the border and that Hezbollah has begun manufacturing the missiles inside Lebanon to reduce its reliance on Iran's weapons supply chain. Previous reports have already documented Hezbollah's use of the Almas — (diamond in Arabic and Persian) — developed on the basis of the Israeli Spike missile made by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. According to the report, the reverse engineering was made possible after an entire system of the Spike missile — including a launcher and several missiles — was 'left behind in the field' during the 2006 war. Israeli security officials told the American outlet that after this oversight was discovered during an inventory review of equipment deployed in Lebanon and later recovered or destroyed, Israel recognized a significant risk of the weapon being delivered to Iran, dismantled and reverse-engineered. Iran has previously developed weapons by reverse-engineering U.S. missiles and drones and concerns it would do the same with the Spike missile has ultimately materialized. According to Israeli intelligence, Iran's Almas missile, developed from the Spike, was first deployed during Syria's civil war in the past decade. However, they stressed that Hezbollah's use of these advanced anti-tank missiles during that time was relatively limited. Hezbollah's first public use of the missile was in January when it released propaganda footage of an attack on an IDF naval base in Rosh Hanikra. The terror group has since published additional videos showing missile launches targeting Israeli positions near the border. In one video, a launcher was seen with visible markings that revealed it was manufactured in 2023, suggesting that missiles produced in Iran were quickly delivered to Hezbollah through smuggling routes from Iraq and Syria. Now, according to Israeli security officials who spoke with the outlet, Hezbollah has begun producing the Almas missile domestically in Lebanon, aiming to reduce its dependency on Iranian shipments. Iran continues to manufacture the missile for its own military, and some at Israel’s Alma Research and Education Center fear it could be distributed to other Iranian proxies across the Middle East. 'It’s highly likely that these weapons — both current and future models — will be deployed across the fronts where Iran's proxies operate, posing threats to various high-value targets (not only Israeli) over increasing ranges,' the institute noted in an analysis from April. According to the New York Times, the Almas missile already presents a 'significant challenge' to Israeli forces during the conflict with Hezbollah. Israeli security officials noted that anti-tank missiles of this model were among the advanced weapons systems discovered by IDF troops during ground operations in southern Lebanon. These missiles were described as some of the most sophisticated weapons seized, contrasting with a larger cache of less advanced arms, including Russian-made Kornet missiles. In the same way that the Spike missile was based on advanced anti-tank systems like the American Javelin, the Almas is a state-of-the-art guided missile that 'locks onto' its target. It has a reported range of up to 16 kilometers (10 miles). According to the Alma Research Center, operators don’t need a direct line of sight to launch it as it can be fired from underground or via drones. The institute further highlighted the missile's ballistic trajectory, enabling it to strike targets from above — a point where tank armor is typically more vulnerable. The Israeli research center also identified at least three Almas models, each representing an upgrade over its predecessor. In June, Alma researchers reported that Hezbollah had likely begun using a fourth, more advanced version. Innovations in this model reportedly include the ability to transmit clear images during flight back to operators. According to another research group, CAT-UXO, the Almas can carry two types of warheads: one designed for a two-stage explosion to penetrate armor more effectively and another employing a fuel-air explosive to create a massive conflagration upon detonation.

Fate of Hezbollah's operational chief remains unknown after IDF s...	While Israel believes Muhammad Haidar would not have had time to escape the bombing, his death remains officially unconfirmed; known as Abu Ali, he was a close confidant and advisor to slain Hassan Nasrallah The fate of Hezbollah's chief of operations Muhammad Haidar, who was the target of an Israeli bombing raid on Beirut's Al-Basta neighborhood on Saturday, remains unclear. according to some media reports, he was not in the area at the time of the strike. The sector is nestled in the heart of Beirut, and renowned for its middle-class residents who established their homes there as early as the 19th century. With its rich tapestry of artists, painters, and cartoonists, it continues to be inhabited by their descendants. It is strategically located near the National Museum of Lebanon and government buildings. At the center of Al-Basta, in a once stately eight-story building now reduced to rubble, lived 'Abu Ali,' the high-ranking Hezbollah figure. He was the mastermind orchestrating significant field operations. Due to Haidar's longstanding and special relationship with slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, he was appointed to serve in the Lebanese Parliament from 2005 to 2009 to benefit from parliamentary immunity after his alleged involvement in the assassination of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005. Once the threat subsided, Haidar returned to operational roles within Hezbollah. recent information suggested Haidar collaborated with the Iranian Quds Force overseeing attacks. Following the assassination of Hezbollah’s Chief of Staff, Fuad Shukr, last July, he was thought to be his successor and the head of Hezbollah's Special Operations Division. According to posts on social media, many Lebanese citizens, though anonymously, expressed joy at his possible elimination. Naim Qassem, appointed to replace Nasrallah after serving as his deputy for many years, lacks combat experience. He has never held field positions, and like his predecessor, he remains in hiding. It is likely Israel is closely monitoring his movements, and any attempt at unusual maneuvers might lead to his demise. For now, the new Secretary General subtly endorses the 'experiment' with peace initiatives, while Hezbollah's Jihad Department, which Haidar heads, continues attacks. The case of Haidar, the 'mastermind,' is far more complex. According to foreign reports, as early as 2019, Israel attempted to eliminate him when two Air Force fighter jets dropped bombs on a building in the Dahieh district of Beirut. That attempt failed; others perished, but Haidar survived and strengthened his security perimeter. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His recent roles included commanding Hezbollah fighters in Syria, providing military advice to the former Secretary General Nasrallah, and overseeing Hezbollah operations against Israel. According to available information, 'Abu Ali' worked tirelessly around the clock. All that remains of the eight-story building on Mamoun Street in the Al-Basta neighborhood are stones. Five bunker-busting bombs left little behind, and those reporting on the event in Lebanon can only marvel at how Israel once again knew precisely where to aim and when 'Abu Ali' entered his apartment, seemingly too close to the time of the bombing to be able to escape. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj7a9lxm1e	2024-11-24T00:09:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/S13c0Wym1e/S13c0Wym1e_30_25_476_476_0_small.jpg

Chabad emissary found murdered in UAE	Rabbi Zvi Kogan's body identified after local authorities detect signs of a struggle in his abandoned vehicle; believed to be the victim of Iran-sent terror squad; NSC posts warning to Israelis in or traveling to UAE UAE authorities identified the body of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad emissary in Abu Dhabi who was missing since Thursday and believed kidnapped and murdered by Uzbek terrorists acting under orders from Iran. 'The murder of Zvi Kogan, of blessed memory, is an abhorrent act of antisemitic terrorism. The State of Israel will use all means and will deal with the criminals responsible for his death to the fullest extent of the law,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and the Foreign Ministry said in a joint statement. The National Security Council issued a warning to Israelis in or traveling to the UAE to exercise caution after the murder. They are advised to avoid crowded events identified as having Jewish and local participants, keep on alert in public places such as restaurants, avoid obvious Israeli markings, avoid posting travel plans on social media and cooperate with local authorities and immediately report any suspected terrorist presence. Kogan was last seen on Thursday. The Mossad announced an 'intense' investigation in the Emirates after confirming that his disappearance was a terrorist act. It is believed Iran used an Uzbek cell to abduct and murder Kogan, aiming to maintain 'plausible deniability.' The identities of the suspects are known. Kogan served as a soldier in the Givati Brigade of the IDF and was an aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, the chief rabbi of the Jewish community in the country. His family last heard from him on Wednesday, and according to the Mossad, he was last seen in Dubai on Thursday afternoon. After missing his scheduled meetings and failing to make contact, his wife alerted the Chabad House's security officer, who then informed the authorities, and Israel was updated on the situation. Kogan drove to Al Ain, an inland oasis city on the eastern border with Oman, about an hour and a half from Dubai, where his car was found abandoned with signs of a struggle identified inside, and his phone was turned off. Initial investigations revealed that three Uzbeks followed him after he left the supermarket and are suspected of murdering him. The use of Uzbek Shiite operatives by Iranians is quite common. Israeli authorities are aware the Uzbeks in question flew to Turkey, and Israeli security services will collaborate with Turkish authorities to uncover the truth. An Israeli delegation has been sent to the UAE to manage the investigation.

Court remands settler after attack on IDF brass	In the aftermath of the attack on Central Command chief Major Gen. Avi Bluth over the weekend in Hebron, police seeks a five-day remand, granted 2; IDF and police say are prioritizing West Bank settler violence A magistrate court in Jerusalem ruled that a West Bank settlers suspected of violently attacking the military's chief of the Central Command Major General Avi Bluth, in Hebron on Friday, will remain in custody. Police said they were seeking a 5-day remand to investigate but the court granted ruled he will be detained for the next two days. According to officials in the police the matter is considered a high priority and is being investigated alongside other incidents of attacks against IDF troops including the wounding of a soldier. The four suspects face charges including assaulting a police officer, intentional property damage, assaulting a public servant, disorderly conduct in a public setting, and insulting a public servant. During the hearing, a police representative detailed the events: 'The 'Chayei Sarah' Sabbath in Hebron concluded over the weekend, with thousands attending. As part of the operational readiness, Major General Bluth was present in the area. During his tour, dozens surrounded him, shouted derogatory remarks, and attempted to approach him with the intent to assault.' He continued, 'Police and Border Police forces intervened to separate the suspects from the general. During the incident, one suspect assaulted soldiers and police officers, while hurling insults in an attempt to get close to Major General Bluth. The police arrested the suspect, who was then taken to Hebron police station. There, he continued his violent behavior, causing damage inside the cell and making further threats toward the officers.' 'This was a severe and violent incident that was fortunately contained,' the police representative said, I request a five-day extension of the respondent’s detention to complete investigative actions.' The judge acknowledged the substantial evidence in this case. One detainee complained, 'They left us handcuffed all night.' On Friday, Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the cessation of administrative detention orders against settlers, following which at least three incidents involving Jews in the West Bank attacking IDF troops have been recorded. On Friday night, dozens of wayward settlers attempted to assault Major General Bluth in Hebron. On Sunday, approximately 20 settlers threw stones at IDF and Border Police forces near the Itamar outpost, and in another incident, hundreds clashed with forces in Hebron. Eyal Gelman, head of the Hebron local council, condemned the violence, attributing the attack on Major General Bluth to 'a group of intoxicated youths from central Israel.' He stated, 'During the Sabbath, many prayers were held for total victory, for the success and protection of our soldiers, and for the return of the captives. We strongly condemn any violence, especially against our brothers in the IDF and all security forces. I have urged the Israel Police to fully prosecute these few rioters.'

Jonathan Pollard’s six principles of war	Former Israeli agent tells ILTV, 'We have to pursue a policy of annihilation towards the enemy.' Former Israeli agent Jonathan Pollard, who made aliyah in December 2020 after serving 30 years in a U.S. prison, has become a provocative voice in Israel's public discourse. Despite his soft-spoken demeanor, Pollard’s words carry significant weight, delivered with unflinching conviction. Last week, he stirred the conversation further in an exclusive ILTV News podcast interview. Over the course of a 30-minute, one-on-one discussion, Pollard offered unfiltered and controversial perspectives on Israel's most pressing security challenges. He issued a scathing critique of any potential ceasefire with Hezbollah—calling instead for decisive victory—and outlined his vision for bolstering Israel's military self-sufficiency. He also addressed preemptive warfare, nuclear deterrence, and what he described as the peril of 'weaponized compassion.' 'We have to adopt a new core doctrine of six principles,' Pollard told ILTV. 'And the first principle is the readoption of preventive and preemptive warfare against perceived threats.' In other words, he argued, Israel must strike its enemies before they can attack. The second principle, he explained, is that Israel should fight its battles on enemy territory rather than its own. 'There is nothing new here,' he contended. 'It’s a policy [former Israeli Prime Minister David] Ben-Gurion first started and that we’ve forgotten about.' Third, Pollard insisted that Israel must abandon the notion of proportionality. Fourth, he argued that Israel must stop 'managing' the enemy. 'We have to stop mowing the grass,' Pollard explained. 'We have to stop attempting to reach ceasefires. We have to pursue a policy of annihilation towards the enemy. They have to be utterly and decisively eliminated.' The fifth principle, according to Pollard, is Israel's acknowledgment of its right to use nuclear weapons if deemed necessary. Finally, the sixth principle is the acceptance of annexation. 'If you come to fight us, we’re not only going to annihilate you by whatever means, but we're also going to take your land,' Pollard stressed. 'This is something that most people understand in war: You lose, you lose your land or parts of it. And this is something, for example, in Gaza and in southern Lebanon that I firmly believe we should act upon.' War should end with victory and defeat Israel has been waging war on its southern and northern borders since October 7. As the war enters its 14th month, polls show that the people of Israel want the hostages home and the fighting to end. However, proposed U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreements have been met with skepticism on all sides, including the proposed deal between Israel and Lebanon. Pollard is an outspoken critic of such ceasefire deals. Quoting author and former MK Einat Wilf, he argued that wars should end with victory and defeat—'hopefully victory for our side and defeat for our enemy,' Pollard said. 'We have to get back to this notion of decisiveness in warfare,' Pollard asserted. 'Our children, our husbands, our wives are on the frontlines—not just on the battlefield, but in our cities as well now. And because of that, our doctrine, our war doctrine, has to reflect the fact that we cannot waste anybody… We have to fight for a decisive end to the conflict. We can't bequeath the conflict to our children or grandchildren or great-grandchildren. 'A ceasefire, as far as I'm concerned, allows Hezbollah to walk away with a win.' Pollard also expressed his belief that the hostages should not be returned if it means giving Hamas in Gaza a victory. His statement came just days before the Hamas terrorist organization released footage that allegedly showed Israeli hostage Daniella Gilboa being killed. Gilboa was one of the IDF observer soldiers abducted from the Nahal Oz army base on October 7. The IDF reported that it was investigating the footage but had not yet been able to verify or refute its authenticity. Of the more than 250 individuals abducted on the day of the massacre, 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza. The IDF has stated that at least one-third of the hostages are believed to be deceased. 'Where we have hostages, we cannot end this war allowing our enemies to succeed in using hostages to their advantage,' Pollard told ILTV. 'It's difficult for me to talk about this, because I know what it's like to be incarcerated. I know what it's like to be tortured. I know what it's like to be abandoned. So my heart goes out to the families of the hostages and the hostages themselves. But unfortunately, hard decisions sometimes have to be made, and we have to admit that the way we end this war will set a precedent for the future. 'We cannot continue to endanger the lives of our people by allowing our enemies to weaponize our love for each other,' Pollard said. 'We cannot allow our hostages to be weaponized against us, our love to be weaponized against us. We cannot allow our compassion for innocent civilians to prevent us from destroying the enemy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wigmeqyg	2024-11-23T17:38:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/12/30/SysZUtYpw/SysZUtYpw_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg
IDF veteran and UAE chief rabbi's aide: Concerns mount over missi...	Days after Rabbi Zvi Kogan vanished, UAE acknowledges case but referrs to him as 'Moldovan national'; suspicions point to Iranian-backed Uzbek terror cell accused of killing Kogan and fleeing to Turkey Concerns are growing over the fate of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan as the United Arab Emirates addresses his disappearance for the first time. Hours after Mossad announced that Kogan had been missing since Thursday in what it described as a terror attack, the UAE’s Interior Ministry issued an official statement. Notably, the statement made no mention of Kogan’s Israeli identity. In the statement, the ministry confirmed that his family reported 'that he has been missing and out of contact since last Thursday' and that 'the specialized authorities immediately began search and investigation operations upon receiving the report.' The statement referred to Kogan as a 'Moldovan national,' reflecting his dual citizenship. The ministry urged the public to rely on official sources for updates and to 'avoid heeding malicious rumors or misleading news aimed at causing confusion.' Kogan had served in the IDF's Givati Brigade. He is a close aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, the chief rabbi of the Jewish community in the UAE and managed the kosher grocery store Rimon in Dubai where he was filmed just days before he was last seen. A preliminary probe into his disappearance suggests that three Uzbek operatives tailed him after he left the grocery store and drove to Al-Ain, approximately 90 minutes from Dubai where his car was later found abandoned and his phone had been switched off. According to suspicions, he was likely kidnapped and murdered by the Uzbek terror cell, which was allegedly directed by Iran to provide Tehran with plausible deniability. These operatives subsequently fled to Turkey. Israeli intelligence agencies are expected to coordinate with Turkish authorities to pursue leads. The Iranians’ use of Uzbek Shiite terrorists is widespread, and they have also operated in Dubai.

His family reported their last contact with him was on Wednesday, prompting his wife to alert Chabad’s security officer when he failed to attend scheduled meetings. According to Mossad, he was last seen in Dubai on Thursday afternoon. A fellow Israeli living in Abu Dhabi who knew Kogan described him as 'a kind man who was very active in the community. His family is devastated, and the Israeli and Jewish communities are in shock. Kogan was an aide to the chief rabbi of Chabad in the UAE and also founded and managed the community’s kosher supermarket.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skotkxem1l	2024-11-23T15:43:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/Sype1hkmkx/Sype1hkmkx_1_45_827_466_0_small.jpg

The car belonging to Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad emissary who went missing in the UAE in recent days, was discovered on Saturday abandoned in Al-Ain, a city roughly 90 minutes from Dubai, deepening fears that he was kidnapped and murdered. Israeli officials suspect that Kogan, who managed the Rimon kosher supermarket in Dubai, was targeted by three Uzbek nationals who later fled to Turkey. The Mossad has launched an 'intensive' investigation, describing Kogan’s disappearance as a terror attack. Israeli intelligence officials believe the alleged Uzbek cell was directed by Iran to maintain plausible deniability. Initial findings suggest Kogan was followed by the suspects after leaving his supermarket. His car was later found abandoned, and his phone was switched off. Israeli authorities are now working closely with Turkish counterparts to locate the suspects.

Mossad confirms terror attack; preliminary findings suggest 3 Uzbek operatives tailed Rabbi Zvi Kogan after he left his grocery store, killing him and fleeing to Turkey; Israeli intelligence agencies expected to coordinate with Turkish authorities to pursue leads The disappearance of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday is now being treated as a terror attack, Israeli intelligence sources said on Saturday.

That document should have been on my desk': Netanyahu accuses se...	In defense of embattled spokesman, PM lashes out at allegations of leaking classified information, calling investigation politically motivated and likening it to Israel’s broader battles on multiple fronts Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a nine-minute statement on Saturday evening accusing security agencies of withholding critical information, following reports of a Hamas strategy document leaked by workers in his office. In the video, Netanyahu launched a fierce defense of his spokesman, Eli Feldstein, who has been indicted for allegedly leaking classified information to harm national security. 'Eli Feldstein is a patriotic Israeli and an ardent Zionist. There is no chance he would knowingly endanger the security of the state,' Netanyahu said, responding to allegations that have exposed close ties between Feldstein and the prime minister's senior advisers. Netanyahu cited an infamous remark by one of his senior aides calling Feldstein's actions 'boss-approved.' In a dramatic escalation, Netanyahu compared the investigation into the leaked document to Israel's current military situation, saying, 'We are fighting on seven fronts, and this is another front.' In an unprecedented claim, he accused the security establishment of withholding critical intelligence from him. Military officials rejected Netanyahu’s assertion, responding, 'The security agencies do not withhold information from Netanyahu or any prime minister.' They clarified that intelligence undergoes a formal filtering process, ensuring relevant details are shared with decision-makers. 'Raw material is not provided to every official,' they added, noting that aides can request deeper access to original data if needed. Netanyahu also took aim at the ongoing investigation, calling it selective and politically motivated. 'No investigations were launched over previous leaks,' he said. 'Suddenly, we have an investigation over one leak—a document revealing Hamas' strategy to divide Israeli society. That document should have been on my desk. Instead, I was excluded from receiving it.' The prime minister condemned the accusations against Feldstein and an IDF reservist implicated in the case, suggesting the charges were designed to damage him personally. 'This witch hunt will not deter me,' Netanyahu said. Addressing their families, he expressed sorrow, saying, 'It pains me that your sons are being used as pawns in a political game.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Referring to Feldstein as a reserve captain and devout Zionist, Netanyahu decried the treatment of the accused: 'If masked men arrest you in the dead of night, isolate you, shackle you and threaten you with life imprisonment, anyone could break under such pressure—even falsely confess to murder.' Netanyahu accused investigators of employing intimidation tactics, comparing the situation to past cases where initial allegations evaporated in court. 'I read the indictment, and it's clear the reservist also believed that critical documents were not reaching me,' he added, reiterating that withholding such materials from the prime minister is 'a severe issue.' Expressing outrage over the treatment of the suspects, Netanyahu said, 'Young people are being treated like the worst terrorists—held for days without access to a lawyer, their basic rights trampled.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sksbboyqjl	2024-11-23T09:56:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/Hy8hvYJQyg/Hy8hvYJQyg_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Terror group posts footage claiming to show Israeli hostage killed in captivity; military says cannot confirm or deny claim at this stage and the public to ‘refrain from spreading rumors’ Hamas on Saturday released images it claimed showed an Israeli hostage killed in captivity in Gaza. The IDF said it is investigating the claim, saying, 'At this stage, we cannot confirm or deny' the information. The IDF said it is in contact with the hostage's family and has provided them with updates. 'Hamas continues to engage in psychological terror and act with extreme brutality. Please refrain from spreading rumors and information that may harm the families of the hostages,' the IDF added. The release of the video coincides with the one-year anniversary of the hostage exchange deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum responded to the report of the hostage’s alleged death, saying: 'We’ve seen the heavy toll rumors have taken in the past. The pain for families is unbearable. We ask the public to avoid any direct or indirect contact with families. Official updates will only come from authorized sources. It has been 414 days since the hostages were taken into Hamas’ death tunnels. Twenty-seven have already been killed in captivity. How much longer must we wait for their return?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gil Dikman, a cousin of Carmel Gat, who was killed in captivity, posted on X (formerly Twitter): 'As someone who knows firsthand, receiving a rumor with your relative’s name listed among the dead without knowing the truth is the most devastating thing.

In addition to Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) last week released two videos featuring captive Sasha Trupanov, who has been held in Gaza for 414 days. The most recent video was published last Friday, two days after another video of Trupanov was released. The latest footage showed Trupanov speaking, with an image of Shas Party leader Aryeh Deri in the background. Trupanov, who marked his 29th birthday last week, was seen speaking on camera for over three minutes in the previous video. Earlier this year, in May, PIJ released two other videos featuring Trupanov (video 1 | video 2).

Israeli strike on Beirut fails to kill Hezbollah operations chief...	Muhammad Haydar, Hezbollah’s de facto military chief, reportedly survives attempt on his life; at least 11 reported dead and dozens injured in strike An Israeli airstrike early Saturday in Beirut failed to eliminate Muhammad Haydar, Hezbollah’s de facto military chief, Saudi outlet Al-Hadath reported, citing Israeli security sources. Haydar, who rose to prominence after a series of assassinations of top Hezbollah leaders, was reportedly targeted in the strike but was not present in the building. Hezbollah officials denied Haydar’s presence at the site, telling Al-Hadath that 'no senior Hezbollah commander was in the targeted building,' while Lebanese media reported at least 11 deaths and dozens of injuries. The strike destroyed an eight-story residential in central Beirut, with extensive damage reported to adjacent buildings. Civil defense teams were said to be struggling to retrieve victims from the rubble. Lebanon’s state news agency reported that five bunker-busting bombs were used in the attack, creating a massive crater. Footage from the scene showed widespread destruction, with the targeted building reduced to rubble. Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen reported that the building was 'crowded with people' at the time of the attack.

Meet Trump's new Mideast envoy	Steve Witkoff made a fortune in real estate is a decades-long friend of Trump's that is know to be a smart negotiator who will have direct access to the president Compared to other real-estate, oil and tech magnates billionaires who surround Donald Trump, Steve Witkoff is described as a modest man. According to the Palm Beach Post he is worth around $500 million deriving from his 51 properties in London, Miami and New York. Contrary to most of those billionaires, Witkoff has also been Trump's real friend for the past 40 years. Trump trusts him completely and has now appointed him to be his special Mideast envoy. Like Trump Witkoff is a New Yorker who made his fortune there, brought his children into the business and then began spending half his time in south Florida. He is an avid golfer and has played with the president-elect during the second assassination attempt on Trump's life last September. The two men met in 1986 when Witkoff, then a young real-estate lawyer, worked for Traub & Dreyer, a city firm that had Trump as a client. They bumped into each other at a local delly and later worked together on a deal. 'Trump did not have cash so I treated him to a pork sandwich, Witkoff once said. According to his son, Alex, Trump was 'one of the greatest inspirations,' that motivated his father to move from law to real-estate. Their relationship grew closer over the years, through tragedies as well. Witkoff said Trump stood by him when his youngest son Andrew, died of an opioid overdose in 2011. 'His presence brought real solace in a dark hour,' he said during his speech to the Republican National Conference this summer, calling him the kindest and most compassionate man. Witkoff also played the part of peacemaker and ironing out personal disputes between Trump and political adversaries such as Ron DeSantis or Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, resulting in both eventually endorsing Trump for president. The 67-year old native of the Bronx grew up in Long Island, is the son of a coat maker who made good in New York's 1980's real estate world. He married Lauren Rappoport and the couple had three boys Zak, Alex and Andrew, who died of an overdose. In recent years his company enjoyed the property boom in Florida including the Shell Bay club which is described as like Trump's Mar-a-Lago but much nicer. The company earned a reputation of succeeding in property deals where others have failed. One such deal is the high-end South Beach club in Miami where a penthouse was recently sold for $120 million. His success may be why Trump picked him to step into the roll previously occupied by his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump views the Middle East conflict not as a centuries-old religious war but a complex real estate deal that must be worked out. Witkoff who is Jewish, and an avid supporter of Israel agrees. Since the massacre of Oct. 7 last year, he has been Trump's unofficial envoy to the American Jewish business community and said he himself received and helped ensure considerable donations to the campaign. Although he has no diplomatic experience, his friends point to the business contacts he has built in the region, including in Israel. Last year Witkoff sold the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan to the Qatari government's investment fund for $623 million. The Abu Dhabi fund was also involved in the deal. His colleagues in the real-estate world describe him as smart, accessible and a talented negotiator whose style is not to make the other side an adversary, another close ally of Trump said in an interview. He said he was not looking to see blood on the floor before a deal is agreed. Whether that would suffice when negotiating an end to the conflict in our region, remains to be seen but one thing is certain, Witkoff will have direct access to Trump's ear.	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjwkjv1q1e	2024-11-23T05:08:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/HydTuC3fke/HydTuC3fke_1_128_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Iran’s much long hidden collection of Western art re-emerges desp...	Eye to Eye' exhibit draws women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran’s Laleh Park with a collection likely worth billions of dollars As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade. The unveiling of the exhibition 'Eye to Eye' has drawn numerous women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran’s Laleh Park. Their presence, while unacknowledged by authorities, shows the way life has changed inside Iran just in the last few years even as the country’s theocracy presses forward with enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and launching attacks on Israel during the ongoing Mideast wars. 'The first feeling that came to me, and I told my parents, was that I can’t believe I’m seeing these works, which have always been kept far from our eyes,' said Aida Zarrin, a young woman at the museum. 'If such events are held here and we can see artworks like the rest of the world, it’s enough. They are really precious.' The government of Iran’s Western-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the former Empress Farah Pahlavi, built the museum and acquired the vast collection in the late 1970s, when oil boomed and Western economies stagnated. Upon opening, it showed sensational works by Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock and other heavyweights, enhancing Iran’s cultural standing on the world stage. But just two years later, in 1979, Shiite clerics ousted the shah and packed away the art in the museum’s vault. Some paintings — cubist, surrealist, impressionist and even pop art — sat untouched for decades to avoid offending Islamic values and the appearance of catering to Western sensibilities. Nearly everything is believed still to be there, though an Andy Warhol print of the empress was slashed during the revolution. Today, the collection is likely worth billions of dollars. Even with Iran now cash-strapped under Western sanctions, officials with the museum have been able to advocate for keeping the collection, though there have been occasional trades in the past for items from Persian history. Those sanctions may increase under the next administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. As Iranian politics have thawed, re-frozen and thawed again, the collection resurfaces along with those changes. Among the over 120 works being shown are ones from Picasso, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, along with celebrated Iranian artists. One of the Warhols, 'Jacqueline Kennedy II,' is a silkscreen double image of the former U.S. first lady in mourning after the 1963 assassination of her husband, President John Kennedy. Another Warhol portrait of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger also garnered attention from the cellphone photo snappers. 'A lot of these works are important works in the history of art, and that’s why this show distinguishes itself from others,' said Jamal Arabzadeh, the exhibition’s curator. 'A lot of people with less exposure to art have discovered the museum for the first time. ... We are seeing a part of the community that are discovering art and the museum and see the potential of this place, and this is something to be proud of.' The presence of Western art comes as Iran’s government has long fought against items like Barbie dolls and depictions of cartoon characters from 'The Simpsons.' Such Western influences have been deemed un-Islamic in the past and have been seen as part of a 'soft' cultural war against the Islamic Republic. With a ticket costing the equivalent of 14 U.S. cents, the exhibition offers a rare government-sanctioned event not involving the country’s politics or Shiite religion. Among the visitors were many women defying the country’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law. Crackdowns over the hijab have slowed down after Iran’s presidential election in July that elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, though individual cases of arrest continue to draw anger. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: And for many, the cost of tickets to travel abroad given Iran’s collapsing rial currency keep foreign museums out of reach. 'This is very attractive for art enthusiasts because not everyone can go and see museums abroad. It’s extremely exciting to see the works here,' said a woman who only gave her last name, Dolatshahi. 'I had no idea I could see works by van Gogh and Picasso here.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sysf88jm1e	2024-11-23T04:36:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/B1jHOLyQ1e/B1jHOLyQ1e_0_0_3000_1999_0_small.jpg

IDF targets Hezbollah chief of operations in Beirut strike, repor...	Muhammad Haydar, a former member of parliament, described as the strategic and security brain of Hezbollah's operations and its military chief, after the assassination of many of the terror-group's senior commanders The IDF strike on Beirut early on Saturday targeted Muhammad Haydar, Hezbollah's chief of operations, Sky News Arabic reported citing Israeli officials. Haydar, a former member of parliament, was a close advisor to slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, assassinated in an attack on the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut in September. The IDF considered him chief of the terror group's military after a string of assassinations of top Hezbollah commanders. He has been leading the organization in recent months and sources tod the Saudi Arabia Al Hadath channel that he was the strategic – security brain behind Hezbollah's war with Israel. According to reports in Lebanon, the military used bunker busting bombs in the strike that brought down an 8-storey building and created a crater. At least 11 people were killed and more wounded but Lebanese health officials said they expected the death toll to rise because teams were struggling to pull survivors from the rubble. The strike came without warning, as was the practice of the IDF, in the pre-dawn hours, while at the same time, Hezbollah fired 5 rockets at Haifa and its surrounding areas. Later the military warned residents of the Dahieh to leave ahead of an Israeli strike.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s12qag17yg	2024-11-23T00:32:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/BJ8bff17yg/BJ8bff17yg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

It’s not rockets destroying Israel—it's this	ILTV's Insider: Is Israel, as some have said, a nation in trauma? Since 6:29 a.m. on October 7, 2023, Israelis have found themselves on a relentless journey of trauma. Each day since that fateful morning has been punctuated by sirens, artillery fire, and the ever-present echoes of grief and fear. The massacre at the Nova Music Festival and the atrocities across towns and villages in Israel’s south left scars that extend far beyond the physical, searing into the national psyche. The horror of those events—and the propaganda that followed—was not just an assault on Israel but an attack on the very fabric of humanity. On Insider, ILTV News and guests confront the unspoken aftermath: The enduring psychological toll on individuals and a society grappling with loss, fear, and uncertainty. Is Israel, as some have said, a nation in trauma? How do survivors begin to heal? And what would it take to construct a 'mental health Iron Dome' to protect our collective well-being? To help answer these questions, ILTV interviews four guests: Prof. Mark Weiser, director of the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center at Sheba Medical Center Manny Waks, host of the podcast PTSD Nation and a passionate mental health advocate Tomer Zadik and Yoav Haver, Nova Festival survivors Watch Insider: View previous episodes >>	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjzsrwymjx	2024-11-22T22:42:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/06/rJl4IuAprT/rJl4IuAprT_2_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg

Bella Hadid cried when I told her about October 7'	Israeli designer Brit Shaked shares insights from behind-the-scenes interactions with Bella and Gigi Hadid, despite their anti-Israel stance; reveals challenges of haute couture, navigating competitive fashion world Israeli designer Brit Shaked is celebrating eight years since graduating from Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art and moving to New York. She lives in the Big Apple with her partner Ofer and their daughter Rena, who attends a Chabad daycare. 'Ofer and I grew up just 10 minutes apart in Israel, and we have mutual friends back home, but we somehow had to come here to meet,' says Shaked, 32, who recently fulfilled a dream by leading the design and couture production for Victoria’s Secret’s highly anticipated fashion show in New York, the brand's first in six years. Behind the scenes, among angel wings and international supermodels like Gigi and Bella Hadid, Shaked says she remained true to her Israeli roots. 'There was a lot of criticism online about me working with the Hadid sisters, but I didn’t have a say in the matter,' Shaked explains. 'I was chosen to manage this massive project, and they were part of the team of top models, alongside even bigger names like Carla Bruni, Kate Moss, Cher, Adriana Lima, and Tyra Banks. I didn’t treat Bella and Gigi any differently than the others. Instead of avoiding dialogue, as many expected, I saw working with them as an opportunity to speak from a position of strength about the events of October 7.' What do you mean by ‘a position of strength’? 'The fashion world may seem glamorous from the outside, but at the end of the day, everyone is human, with insecurities and fears. All the models care deeply about how they look and are terrified of tripping on the runway during the live show. They crave emotional support and reassurance, just like anyone else. Meeting them for the first time is exciting, but once I start working, I’m the one who ensures they feel comfortable so they can perform their best.' How do you manage to make the Hadid sisters feel at ease while dealing with such conflicting emotions? She laughs. 'I’m an Israeli with an Israeli accent, I served in the army, and I don’t hide who I am. But I separate my work from my personal beliefs. It’s incredibly difficult to detach from our feelings as Israelis, especially since October 7, but when you strip away the public image, the models are surprisingly human. One of them is a mother, and so am I.' What kind of criticism did you face online for working with them? 'The comments were harsh: ‘How dare you. You have blood on your hands.’ But I succeeded in sitting with them one-on-one. I told them I was in Israel on October 7 for a family wedding that was canceled due to the war, and I stayed there for a while with my baby during an extremely traumatic and frightening time. I shared the loss and grief we’ve all felt, how everyone in Israel knows someone who has been impacted. Though the conversation was brief, I felt empowered to expose them to our suffering. Bella even cried when I told her my story.' She cried? She should delete her Instagram. 'I brought that up, too. It was my chance to say, ‘What you’re doing on social media is hurting so many people.’ If I had refused to work with her, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to say it. And I wouldn’t have achieved anything by being confrontational. When I came to their fittings, I had a lot of animosity toward them, and I was even disappointed that they were polite and human toward me. I don’t know if it was genuine, but they’re professionals. You don’t reach their level without being highly professional.' Shaked also held her ground with other celebrities known for their lack of support for Israel, such as Iman and Paloma Elsesser. 'Again, my strength came from the fact that they were models before a critical show and needed my help in their most stressful moments. Right before the show, they came to me in tears from the pressure, and I was able to have a profound impact on them. Despite what they think, I was there as an Israeli and a Jew, and they needed me. That’s why I think the criticism of ‘You shouldn’t have worked with them’ is misguided. The victory is being present, not disappearing. We have more influence from within, not from the outside.' What about the Hadid sisters’ prominence on social media? 'In Israel, people blow their influence out of proportion. Yes, they have a significant following, but in the show I managed, they were just two of many models, including the wonderful Israeli model Sun Mizrahi. The Hadid sisters weren’t special in any way—one opened the show, and the other closed it.' What’s your view on haute couture in Israel? 'Unfortunately, many people in the Israeli fashion industry work for free. It’s hard for me to even mention the sums I earn in New York. There’s no couture in Israel; there aren’t the budgets to execute grand projects, and there’s little value placed on art. When I create a moving garment, I get responses like, ‘Why do I need this?’ or ‘I can’t wear that.’ People in Israel understand the concept of art on a wall, but they don’t grasp paying $10,000 for a dress that’s a work of art.' Do you understand the concept? 'Yes, because I know what it takes and what it offers. Cities like Paris, Milan, and New York have industries built around this, generating millions. There are people who seek unique pieces, and they sell. But let’s face it, succeeding financially in haute couture is challenging. Many celebrities expect designers to work for free, saying, ‘I’m a celeb; design for me, and I’ll tag you online.’ Early in your career, it’s a fair trade—I did plenty of free work for credit because you need the experience and exposure.' Why not shift to commercial fashion entirely? 'I tried, and it made me very unhappy. When you’re a creative designer and have to compromise your art, it’s stifling. For two years, I worked in commercial fashion, and I realized I didn’t aspire to the roles above me. It was demoralizing. On the other hand, I need to make a living. Living in New York with two kids is expensive. So at first, I took unpaid projects for the sake of my creativity while doing other jobs to make ends meet. Now, I constantly look for projects to reinvent myself without compromising too much, which is tough. It’s hard to sit in a room and say, ‘This is my price. I’m worth it,’ knowing some might say I’m delusional.' What advice would you give aspiring Israeli designers? 'There’s still an issue in Israel. The industry relies on Shenkar graduates who are eager to succeed and offers unpaid opportunities, saying, ‘Your design will make it into Vogue.’ I understand that—early in your career, you have to support yourself with other jobs and build experience because this field is experience-driven. But once you’ve gained experience, you must stand your ground and demand fair compensation for your talent and hard work.' Born in New York while her parents studied there, Shaked returned to Israel at age three. Her parents, both in tech, always supported her passion for fashion, which began early. She recently shared on Instagram, 'The 10-year-old me is screaming inside. I can’t believe this is real. When I was offered the role of designing the couture pieces and wings for the Victoria’s Secret show, I thought it was a joke. Today, after zero hours of sleep, a broken back, and severe separation anxiety from my daughter Rena, I’m living a dream I never dared to dream because it felt too big. This massive production, on a scale I couldn’t imagine, gave me a sense of fulfillment and relief that it’s over, and I can return to my life. Even after thinking I couldn’t do it as a mom and pregnant, I proved it’s possible. From cutting fruit for daycare to fitting Tyra Banks, Cher, and Adriana Lima—it’s all doable. And in these dark days, being Israeli and Jewish in such an influential role is my greatest victory.' How did you handle managing a multimillion-dollar budget while pregnant? 'It’s tough, but I worked hard to leave personal matters at home. No one in this industry wants to deal with your personal or medical issues. I learned the rules quickly. For example, there’s no maternity leave here unless you work for a very structured company. Most of my colleagues don’t have or want kids. In fashion, children aren’t the norm, so I manage motherhood quietly, relying on support from loved ones like my husband, who works as a carpenter in his family’s business. Doing all this with a toddler and being pregnant was challenging, but not everyone gets such an opportunity, which is also a financial lifeline.' Shaked prefers to stay behind the scenes and has never felt the need to gain fame as a fashion designer. As she puts it, 'I never cared about having my name on the door—I’m a team player.' This philosophy guides her as she takes the first steps with 'Foryou' a diaper bag brand she founded alongside her good friend Noam Ravid, a fellow Shenkar graduate who also lives in New York. The brand's products are still under development. 'High fashion offers little stability,' she explains. 'You can have one hugely successful project and then go a year without work. That’s why I decided to launch a commercial brand—for financial stability and my kids’ future.' The brand will be infused with humor, something Shaked sees as a way to lighten the challenges of parenthood. 'It’s a reflection of everything I am—an entrepreneur, a mother, and a fashion designer. And finally, I’m the customer myself. Plus, I’ve found the best partner, who’s also a close friend. We’re building this together.' She describes the venture as her 'baby' and 'pension plan,' providing the security her family needs while allowing her to continue pursuing the extraordinary art she loves in the world of high fashion.

IDF strikes Beirut, 8 story building brought down	There was no warning from the IDF before the attack in the early morning hours as was customary; Hezbollah-affiliated media says the building struck by missiles and some nearby were full of people An eight story building was bombed by the IDF early on Saturday killing at least four people and wounding 23 others, according to Lebanese media reports. There was no warning from the IDF Arabic Language spokesperson, ahead of the attack on the Basta neighborhood, as had been the practice before strikes on the Dahieh district in the city or in South Lebanon. The blasts shook the capital around 4 a.m. (0200 GMT), Reuters witnesses said. Security sources said at least four bombs were dropped in the attack. It marked the fourth Israeli airstrike this week targeting a central area of Beirut, where the bulk of Israel's attacks have targeted the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. On Sunday an Israeli airstrike killed a Hezbollah media official in the Ras al-Nabaa district of central Beirut. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen network reported that the number of casualties was expected to rise because the building and others nearby were 'teaming with people,' and emergency teams were struggling to pull victims from the rubble.

My brush with justice: Serving on a New York jury	The jury summons in the mail felt like something out of a Law & Order episode, but reality proved exhausting and mundane; Daniel Edelson joined dozens of impatient candidates called to a courthouse in Lower Manhattan to participate in the US jury system; here's how it unfolded—right up to the anticlimactic ending For those raised on a steady diet of Judge Judy and reruns of Law & Order, few things are more unsettling than a letter in the mail that reads: 'You are summoned.' This meant I had been called to fulfill my civic duty as a juror. My mind raced with dramatic visions of jury room debates where I’d passionately argue, like Olivia Pope, to convince everyone that O.J. was guilty. Reality would hit me soon enough, but in the meantime, nothing was stopping me from Googling court dates for P. Diddy or scouring for new lawsuits against Donald Trump that might coincide with my summons. Who knows? Maybe I’d land on a high-profile case. The envelope in the mail couldn’t have been more conspicuous. Americans have always had a flair for the dramatic with bells and whistles. 'You Have Been Summoned for Jury Service,' the bold text declared. The date fell on the eve of a holiday, and for a brief moment, I considered invoking my Judaism to get out of it. But I knew it would only delay the inevitable. New York law allows you to postpone jury duty only once. Missing the rescheduled date would label me a 'non-compliant juror,' subject to a hefty fine or even arrest for contempt of court. And so, on a dark October morning, I found myself dragging out of bed before sunrise, stepping into the 48-degree chill, and navigating endless lines—from the subway entrance to the courthouse doors in Chinatown. Behind me stood a frazzled mom, who, in a distinctly un-New York, non-progressive Southern drawl, threatened to smack her crying baby if he didn’t stop. As would become a recurring theme, he probably didn’t want to be there any more than I did. Inside the courthouse, the same story continued: another line for the elevator, a never-ending line to the 11th floor, and yet another line outside the room where I was supposed to serve as a juror. The room was packed with dozens of people, most of whom looked tired, annoyed and not entirely sure why they were there. I joined the line without question—a distinctly American habit. After about 15 minutes, someone finally voiced the absurd question: 'Is this the line for jury duty?' It turned out I’d been standing in the wrong line entirely—this one was for exemptions, where people were trying to get out of serving. I’d thought people would jump at the chance to judge others. After all, we do it recreationally all the time—so why not earn $40 a day for it? But apparently, the idea doesn’t appeal to most. In a way, it was a relief to discover that beneath the saccharine American veneer lies a more honest truth: an individualistic, solidarity-free society doesn’t suddenly change its stripes over a fancy envelope in the mail. When presidential candidates openly call to dismantle already-weak public health care systems and deport the vulnerable and the foreign-born, is it any wonder that when told, 'Hey, without your presence, justice won’t be served,' they’re not exactly rushing to comply? Many Americans go to great lengths to avoid jury duty, sometimes in particularly creative ways. Some show up in expensive suits to appear 'too important' for the role, while others wear rags to convey the opposite impression. If they hear it’s a traffic case, they might suddenly declare, 'When I was five, my dad jaywalked, so I’m unfit to judge a case like this—sorry.' Those who remain face a barrage of manipulation from attorneys, who often assume the jurors lack knowledge and try to confuse them with complex calculations for medical damages. Jurors might whisper to one another, 'Oh, poor guy, maybe we should cut him some slack.' But typically, the judge steps in to steer the jury toward more reasonable conclusions, dropping heavy hints like, 'This person broke the law and should be punished accordingly.' For those unfamiliar with the system, it can seem odd. Would you trust your fate to the random person sitting next to you on the bus? Yet, Americans are deeply attached to their jury system (when they’re not required to participate). When told that in many countries a single judge decides cases, they tend to shift uncomfortably in their seats. What? Just one judge decides? Isn’t that strange? asdv The concept of a jury is admittedly quite noble. Its origins trace back to the Magna Carta—a 13th-century charter of rights that England’s King John was forced to sign, promising fair trials and ensuring that judges would not simply serve the interests of the ruling class. The United States, founded as a nation of immigrants seeking to escape Britain’s class system, naturally embraced this egalitarian principle. Juries are a cornerstone of the American justice system and are constitutionally mandated. Some might argue the process is merely theater, with judges ultimately steering decisions, but by law, juries hold the ultimate authority and can override a judge if they choose. The Constitution guarantees a fair and swift trial before a group of 'ordinary' citizens tasked with determining guilt or innocence. In criminal cases, jurors decide whether the prosecution has proven the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. For serious cases, such as those involving the death penalty, the jury also determines the sentence. In civil trials, jurors decide whether the defendant should compensate the plaintiff and, if so, how much. In states like New York, before criminal charges are filed, a 'grand jury' convenes to decide whether there is enough evidence to proceed to trial. Those following Trump’s legal entanglements may recall that if sufficient evidence is found, the case moves to a 'petit jury,' which determines guilt or innocence. In some cases, a separate jury may be assembled to decide the sentence. This layered process means one thing: the system needs a lot of jurors. Nearly every U.S. citizen over the age of 18 can be summoned for jury duty, entering a selection pool known as the 'jury pool.' To qualify, candidates must meet basic criteria, including citizenship, proficiency in English, good health and a clean criminal record. Selection happens through a process called 'voir dire,' where prospective jurors are questioned about their background and potential biases. Those chosen may spend days, weeks or even months serving, particularly in states where juries must reach unanimous decisions. For each day of jury service, participants are entitled to $40, paid either by the state or their employer. Interestingly, the British chose not to implement the jury system in what was then Mandatory Palestine. Fearing that local residents might acquit individuals charged with rebellion against the mandate, the British avoided introducing this extensive system. Today, it’s hard not to be struck by the enormous resources the U.S. dedicates to selecting jurors—a bureaucratic process turned into a large-scale operation. True to form, America does everything on a grand scale, even something as seemingly mundane as jury selection. asdfdxc A diverse crowd fills the spacious waiting room. Like New York City itself, the room is a microcosm of the world: old folk, blue-haired hipsters, suits and, above all, exhausted people nodding off in their chairs. Unlike other jurisdictions that rely solely on voter rolls, New York pulls potential jurors from a variety of databases—tax authorities, informal education records and more—aiming to reach as many people as possible and assemble the most diverse jury pool. Studies show that diverse juries have a significant advantage. Groups composed of individuals from varied backgrounds tend to examine evidence more thoroughly and engage in deeper discussions before reaching decisions. By contrast, homogeneous juries can lead to less fair verdicts, particularly in cases involving defendants from minority groups. All-white juries are statistically more likely to convict Black defendants at higher rates. I know this because it was explained to us by a law professor in a video shown to all jury candidates (more on that later). But despite the room’s visible diversity, everyone shares one common trait: no one wants to be there. I overheard one man solemnly argue to the clerk that being in a relationship made him unfit to serve. Another managed to dodge service by claiming he didn’t understand English—delivered in Spanish with a thick Yankee accent. Those of us who stayed filled out forms about ourselves and waited. And then we waited some more. 'Thank you for your service,' said the polite clerk, patiently repeating instructions for late arrivals with admirable composure. She played a video featuring the chief judge, who enthusiastically extolled the privilege of serving as a juror and ensuring justice for all. 'No one can escape this duty—not even me,' he concluded. Next came the professor’s video, with all the flair of a Hollywood production. It delved into biases and stereotypes. On-screen, dashed triangles formed a Star of David, triggering an odd sense of paranoia. The professor asked, 'How many triangles are in this image?' Answers ranged from 13 to one, but the correct answer was zero—none of the triangles were complete. The point was clear: we tend to fill in gaps and supply information that may not exist. She urged us to challenge assumptions and stereotypes ingrained by media. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Don’t let biases mislead you or discriminate based on religion, race or gender,' she said. 'The system relies on you to deliver justice without prejudice. Thank you for your service!' I left with a few good insights from these videos—ones that lasted about a day. The waiting continued until an unexpected reprieve: a lunch break. There’s no cafeteria in the courthouse, but being in the heart of Chinatown means dim sum beckons from every storefront. The $40 earned from this otherwise pointless day of waiting could easily be splurged. By 2:15 p.m., it was back to the jury room, where I claimed a desk with a charging port. The Wi-Fi was excellent, probably the highlight of the day. The supervisor asked us to maintain a 'library atmosphere,' which seemed fitting given the symphony of snoring around me. I settled into a few surprisingly productive hours of work. assfas Serving on a jury in New York was once a dubious experience, with dirty rooms, grumpy clerks more focused on cleaning floors and talk shows blaring on televisions. But in 1994, Chief Judge Judith Kaye, the state’s highest-ranking judicial official, decided enough was enough. 'We cannot ask jurors to fulfill their civic responsibility in a dilapidated environment while relying on outdated procedures,' she declared. Kaye shortened the duration of jury duty, renovated courthouses, emphasized better treatment of jurors by staff and introduced stricter oversight of the racial and ethnic composition of potential juries. In the past, attorneys could easily dismiss potential jurors based on gender, religion or other characteristics. As recently as May, widespread coverage emerged about a review of more than 35 death penalty convictions in California courts after revelations that prosecutors had manipulated jury selection. These prosecutors ensured Jewish jurors were excluded, citing surveys showing that, compared to other religious groups, Jews were less supportive of capital punishment. Jewish communities are among the most vocal opponents of execution by gas due to the Holocaust’s memory. Judges in the state admitted that excluding Jewish jurors from death penalty cases was a common practice. My grandfather, himself a Holocaust survivor, used to recount how he was disqualified from jury service in New York, even for minor cases, out of concern that the trauma of Auschwitz would make him biased. Even today, attorneys can exclude a certain number of individuals from jury duty if they believe, for any reason, that those individuals cannot be impartial. In a murder trial involving a shooting, for example, attorneys might ask potential jurors if they’ve lost a loved one under similar circumstances (think John Grisham’s The Runaway Jury, later adapted into a film starring Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack and Gene Hackman). In medical malpractice cases, they might ask if anyone has a doctor in their family, and so on. In my case, I didn’t even get the chance to be screened or excluded. At 5 p.m., the clerk cleared her throat and announced that all of us, without exception, were dismissed. The room burst to life, with cheers echoing from every corner. No one understood why we’d wasted an entire day waiting only to be sent home, but no one bothered to ask. I reclaimed my freedom and bid farewell to jury duty—at least for the next two years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1vat5vzyx	2024-11-22T11:25:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/19/ryfNjJ11lke/ryfNjJ11lke_0_617_2250_1267_0_small.jpg

Minister Katz setting stage for settler assault on Palestinians, ...	Following Israel Katz's decision to cease using administrative detention orders against Jews in the West Bank, Palestinian Authority officials are saying this will lead to increased assaults by wayward settlers on Palestinian civilians; 'Then they will complain about The Hague,' says MK Tibi The Palestinian Authority is worried that Defense Minister Israel Katz's decision to cease using administrative detention orders against Jews in the West Bank might legitimize Jewish terror activities in the region, potentially leading to further escalation. Hours after Katz's announcement, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry stated that this decision 'will encourage settlers to commit additional crimes.' 'We view Defense Minister Katz's decision to cancel administrative detention against settlers committing crimes and violations against Palestinian civilians with great concern,' the statement read. The Palestinians also pointed out that 'the number of detainees is very small.' The Palestinian Authority warned that this decision by Katz, who recently assumed office replacing Yoav Gallant, 'encourages extreme settlers to engage in terrorism against Palestinians, their land, and property, giving them a sense of immunity and additional protection.' The Palestinian Foreign Ministry also called for 'effective international action' to curb what they described as 'settler militia terror.' According to the ministry, 'an end must be put to the fact that they receive 'immunity from punishment' and to protect our people from the occupation.' Qadura Fares, head of the Prisoners' Affairs Authority and former prisoners, also commented on Katz’s decision, stating that 'at a time when Israeli authorities are waging the most despicable war against the Palestinian people, with random arrests daily, and perpetuating collective punishment through an unprecedented expansion of administrative detention policy, about 3,500 Palestinians are detained today while the administrative detentions of the Jewish rioters are canceled.' He claimed this move reflects a 'racist and fascist state,' which he argues 'is based on hatred and organized crime, and in its extreme policy, threatens human and social values.' Legal officials issued a warning At noon, senior legal officials addressed the Defense Minister's decision, stating that 'the decision grants a 'license to kill' to 'Na'arei Gva'ot' (hilltop youth) and ties the hands of the Shin Bet in dealing with subversive Jewish elements in the territories.' They added that 'the decision could spur underground activities targeting Arabs and could ignite the area.' Senior officials clarified that 'the decision will also significantly harm the Shin Bet's ability to thwart and deter both extreme Jews and Arabs.' The legal system believes that if petitions are filed to the High Court of Justice, it will overturn Katz’s decision due to its discriminatory enforcement of law on racial grounds. Shin Bet declined to comment on the decision. This week, Defense Minister Katz informed Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar of the dramatic move and requested alternative tools be put in place. However, Katz did not cancel dozens of existing administrative detention orders, but he will not renew them when they expire in a few weeks. 'In a reality where settlements in the West Bank face severe Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions against settlers, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such severe measures against the settlers,' stated the Defense Minister. Earlier, Knesset member Ahmad Tibi responded to the decision, saying, 'This is essentially the Defense Minister's certification for Jewish terrorism. Then they will complain about The Hague. A government of terror supporters.' The 'Tag Meir' organization, which fights hate crimes, stated: 'Administrative detention orders are aimed against Jewish terrorism and acts of revenge against innocent Palestinians. Ceasing the use of administrative detention orders will permit the bloodshed and property damage of these Palestinians, with the approval of the Defense Minister. Minister Katz ignores the diplomatic and security damage that will be caused to Israel due to this decision.' The 'Yesh Din' organization said: 'Administrative detentions are a draconian and anti-democratic measure that should cease to be used against both Palestinians and Israelis. Instead, law enforcement authorities should conduct effective investigations and prosecute when there is sufficient evidence. Let us remember that thousands of Palestinians are held in administrative detention under orders that Minister Katz did not cancel.'

Israel ponders giving aid distribution management in Gaza to US p...	Netanyahu wishes to have a private US security firm manage the issue of distributing humanitarian aid within Gaza, but runs into legal challenges regarding the scope of the operation, and the issue of footing the bill has not yet been solved, given it could implicate Israel in case it turns violent on the ground Amid the Israeli government's plan to delegate the responsibility of distributing humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip to an external company, two main issues are delaying the activation of the American security firm 'Orbis,' which is slated for this role. Legal challenges arise from the company's operational scope in Gaza and the financial source for covering its services. The anticipated cost for securing aid convoys is projected to be around $60 million, independent of the aid distribution itself, which is estimated at approximately $200 million. Additionally, establishing the company's distribution operations in Gaza is expected to take about three months—a problematic duration as most convoys currently entering the Strip are being plundered. Orbis is backed by former U.S. Army generals and is affiliated with an American parent company, essentially a conglomerate of six firms. It remains uncertain whether the U.S. will agree to finance the operation, given the financier assumes responsibility for aid distribution. Concerns were voiced in discussions about a scenario where Israel might be accused of a massacre if security personnel were compelled to open fire. Concurrently, it has been revealed that Israel has paid an advance to the American company to develop plans for a pilot project concerning aid distribution in Jabaliya, located in the northern Gaza Strip. The cabinet is expected to receive an update on the plan on Saturday, but it will not seek approval since a resolution has yet to be found for the challenges of assigning aid distribution to the external company Earlier, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant sharply criticized the government's intention to discuss 'food distribution to Gaza residents by private companies under IDF security,' labeling it a 'euphemism for the inception of military governance in Gaza.' Gallant argued that 'the price will be paid by the soldiers' blood and the State of Israel due to a flawed prioritization that will lead to the neglect of more critical security tasks. Everything hinges on the prior preparation of an alternative entity to replace the IDF in holding the territory—without this, we are on the path to martial law,' he stated. 'The aid will be distributed by private companies, the companies will be guarded by the IDF, and we will all bear the cost.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded to Gallant's remarks. 'for an entire year, he imagined a 'non-existent alternative' to do the work for us, effectively preventing us from taking responsibility for the distribution of humanitarian aid.' Smotrich claimed that 'since this non-existent entity did not materialize, Gallant allowed Hamas to seize control of humanitarian aid and maintain its rule in the Strip, thereby prolonging the conflict, increasing its cost, and exacerbating the suffering of hostages and their families. It is not the management of humanitarian aid that will lead to casualties, nor a military administration if required, but rather the fear of achieving total victory and territorial control that is essential for security.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir fiercely criticized Gallant as well. 'Tonight it was proven again how wise it was for the Prime Minister to dismiss the failed Defense Minister Gallant—as is well known, my position is clear that humanitarian aid should be exchanged only for humanitarian aid, but in any case—as long as aid continues—IDF control over the humanitarian aid to Gaza residents is crucial to dismantle Hamas and strip it of its remaining control of Gaza, which is the goal of the war. Gallant, who is deeply entrenched in the old paradigm and supported by the opposition, would be better off remaining there.' Adversely, former War Cabinet member Benny Gantz backed Gallant's statements, asserting that 'Israeli security control in Gaza is essential. Israeli governance when our soldiers are dealing with sewage and garbage is disastrous.'

Elise Stefanik assumes her position The United Nations faces serious challenges, according to Prof. Gerald Steinberg of NGO Monitor. In an interview with ILTV on Thursday, Steinberg predicted significant changes in the UN's approach once newly nominated U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, assumes her position under the Trump administration. 'The Trump administration could cut off a lot of funding for these activities, which I think will force a sobering up at the UN,' Steinberg said. 'I also believe that in other countries, there’s growing momentum to reevaluate their automatic support for international processes that are proving ineffective.' Steinberg also suggested that several Western European countries might recognize that current UN practices undermine their goals and interests, prompting them to advocate for change. His remarks followed the U.S. veto of a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The U.S. justified its veto, stating the resolution failed to include provisions for the immediate return of 101 Israeli hostages held by Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry0xxj0zye	2024-11-22T01:58:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/02/08/ByVVvvRxd/ByVVvvRxd_0_0_1020_574_0_small.jpg

Defense minister asks Shin Bet chief to plan an implement alternative measures to deal with settler violence in region; Smotrich and Ben-Gvir laud decision Defense Minister Israel Katz announced on Friday he decided to suspend the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Katz informed Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar of the move earlier this week and requested the planning and implementation of alternative measures. 'In a reality where Jewish settlements in the West Bank face severe Palestinian terror threats and unjust international sanctions against settlers, it's inappropriate for the State of Israel to employ such severe measures against members of the settlement community,' Katz said, explaining his shift in policy. 'If suspicion of criminal acts arises, the perpetrators can be prosecuted. If not, there are other preventive measures that can be taken without resorting to administrative detention. I condemn any violence against Palestinians or acts of vigilante justice and call on settlement leadership to take a similar public stance and unequivocally denounce such actions,' he added.' 'It's essential to allow the IDF, other security agencies and law enforcement authorities to address Palestinian terror and violence without individuals taking the law into their own hands.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir praised the decision, saying, 'I commend my colleague, Minister Israel Katz, for this significant and important announcement. His decision to stop issuing administrative orders against settlers in the West Bank corrects years of injustice and honors those who love this land.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also lauded the decision: 'With this decision, Minister Katz has ended years of discrimination against West Bank settlers and rectified a long-standing injustice.'

Biden slams ICC warrants as 'outrageous'	U.S. president criticizes UN court and asserts that there should be no equivalence between Israel and Hamas; Pentagon echoes condemnation U.S. President Joe Biden sharply criticized the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague following its decision to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. In a statement delivered late Thursday night, Biden said, 'The ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' Biden's statement followed a response from the U.S. Pentagon on the warrants. Deputy Pentagon Spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Thursday that the Pentagon rejected the ICC's decision and is concerned about the expedited manner in which the warrants were issued. According to her, senior Pentagon officials are currently consulting with their Israeli counterparts about the next steps. 'We're continuing to support Israel with the assistance it needs in its fight against Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, we don't see eye-to-eye on where the ICC is and we reject the court's decision to issue these arrest warrants,' Singh noted. The ICC on Thursday announced that it had rejected appeals against the move submitted by Israel and issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, who was recently dismissed. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Mohammed Deif, despite reports of his elimination, as Hamas has not confirmed his death.

IAEA Board passes Iran resolution as West pushes Tehran toward ta...	UN atomic watchdog orders Tehran to improve cooperation with agency and provide it with 'comprehensive' report; Iran warns action against it could have the opposite effect The UN atomic watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Thursday again ordering Iran to urgently improve cooperation with the agency and requesting a 'comprehensive' report aimed at pressuring Iran into fresh nuclear talks. The UK, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute Iranian move to cap its stock of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said Iran's move was conditional on scrapping the resolution. Iran tends to bristle at such resolutions and has said it would respond in kind to this one. After previous criticism at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board, it has stepped up its nuclear activities and reduced IAEA oversight. China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favor and 12 abstained. The IAEA and Iran have long been locked in standoffs on a range of issues including Tehran's failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites, its barring last year of most of the agency's top uranium-enrichment experts on the Iran inspection team, and its refusal to expand IAEA monitoring. The resolution seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022 resolution that it was 'essential and urgent' for Iran to explain the uranium traces and let the IAEA take samples as necessary. The resolution in June of this year did the same. The new text asked the IAEA to issue 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear program, including a full account of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA on these issues'. Western powers hope that report, due by spring 2025, will pressure Iran into negotiations on fresh restrictions on its nuclear activities, albeit less far-reaching ones than in a 2015 deal with major powers that unraveled after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018. With Trump due to return to office in January and Iran having taken its uranium enrichment far beyond the deal's limits, it is far from clear whether Trump would back negotiations aimed at setting new limits before the 2015 deal's ones are lifted on 'termination day' in October of next year. If no new limits are agreed before then, the report could be used to strengthen the case for so-called 'snapback', a process under the 2015 deal where the issue is sent to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions lifted under the deal can be re-imposed. Last week IAEA chief Rafael Grossi visited Tehran, hoping to convince new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as relatively moderate, to improve Iran's cooperation with the agency. Iranian reaction Grossi formally reported to member states on Tuesday that 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed' in his meetings with Iranian officials, and that the IAEA had verified Iran had 'begun implementation of preparatory measures'. Iran already has enough material enriched to that level, close to the roughly 90% purity that is weapons grade, for four nuclear weapons if enriched further, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough material enriched to lower levels for more bombs, but Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Grossi said on Wednesday he had asked Iran to cap that stock of 60% material and Iran had accepted his request. He told a news conference that day that it was 'a concrete step in the right direction', suggesting that he felt a resolution could undermine that progress. With the resolution passed, Iran is likely to respond.

'If there is a resolution, it (Iran) will either increase its activities or reduce the agency's access,' a senior diplomat said before the vote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrag3ag1l	2024-11-21T22:37:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/05/H1K7G4C4C/H1K7G4C4C_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Lebanon cease-fire could come 'within days', Israeli officials es...	Despite report claiming Lebanon has yet to agree to certain terms of the U.S.-led agreement, lawmakers say deal could be finalized by the weekend Lebanon seeks to modify the terms of the U.S.-proposed cease-fire agreement to ensure a 'speedier withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon and to give both parties the right to self-defense,' Reuters reported on Thursday amid U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein's visit to Israel directly from Beirut. According to a senior Lebanese official, the country’s negotiators requested these changes during meetings with Hochstein in Beirut. These amendments – previously unrequested by Lebanon – indicate that Hochstein still has significant hurdles to overcome to finalize the deal, despite his earlier statement in Beirut that an agreement was 'within reach.' The Lebanese official added that Lebanon wishes for Israeli forces to withdraw immediately after the cease-fire is declared, allowing the Lebanese Army to deploy across all areas and displaced persons to return to their homes. This position contradicts Israel’s stance, which envisioned a withdrawal within 60 days of the cease-fire taking effect. Lebanon also seeks a revision in the proposal to stress both sides' right to 'self-defense,' not just Israel's. The source noted that while the American draft refers to a withdrawal from 'Lebanese borders,' Beirut preferred specific wording referring to the 'Lebanese border' to ensure a complete Israeli withdrawal. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said on Wednesday that Lebanon wants to enforce Hezbollah’s evacuation from southern Lebanon on its own terms, rather than via Israeli actions. Israel, for its part, demanded to prevent the terror organization from smuggling weapons into Lebanon by land, sea or air and insisted on guarantees that it can enforce this as a fundamental condition of any agreement. The Lebanese official noted that the U.S. draft makes no mention of Israel’s ability to continue striking Hezbollah and stressed that Lebanon insists on maintaining its sovereignty. Israel has also agreed to an addendum providing U.S. assurances that it can target Hezbollah in the future should the agreement be violated. Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday after visiting Lebanon and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also held talks with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of the prime minister and then met with Defense Minister Israel Katz and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Following these meetings, senior Israeli officials estimated that, despite the new conditions reported by Reuters, the agreement with Lebanon is likely to be finalized 'within days.' Meanwhile, official Lebanese sources told Sky News Arabia that 'the negotiations could lead to an agreement by the weekend, barring any obstacles.' However, estimates say the cease-fire announcement is unlikely to take this week and possibly not even next week.

State visit of Dutch foreign minister canceled as world reacts to...	Office of Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar says he spoke with Kasper Waldekamp and the two agreed his planned visit to the country should be postponed; Some countries support UN court's action while others say won't listen to warrants Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar canceled his Dutch counterpart Kasper Waldekamp’s visit to Israel set for Monday after the Netherlands, which hosts the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, became the first country to declare it would honor the court's arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. Sa'ar spoke with Waldekamp, after which his office issued a statement. 'Minister Sa'ar expressed his disappointment, on behalf of the Israeli government and people, over the statement made in the Dutch Parliament following the ICC decision,' the statement said. 'The minister also presented Israel's stance regarding this scandalous and politically motivated decision. It was agreed during the conversation that the Dutch foreign minister's visit to Israel, planned for Monday, would not take place,' the statement added. Geert Wilders, the leader of the ruling coalition in the Netherlands and a vocal supporter of Israel, has yet to comment on the ICC decision. Meanwhile, Sa'ar engaged with his counterparts in two ICC member states – Argentina and Hungary – condemning the decision in strong terms. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto harshly criticized the warrant, calling it 'shameful and absurd.' 'This decision disgraces the international judiciary by equating leaders of a country attacked by a heinous terror attack with the leaders of the terrorist organization responsible,' he added. Argentine president Javier Milei also weighed in, saying his country 'declares its deep disagreement' with the ruling which 'ignores Israel's legitimate right to defend itself against ongoing attacks by terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah.' Another ICC member state, the UK, refused to commit to abide by the court’s ruling. 'This government has been clear that Israel has a right to defend itself, in accordance with international law. There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, which are terrorist organizations,' a UK government spokesman said. Italy would have to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he came to the country, Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the deputy speaker of the Czech parliament called on the parliament to consider a 'temporary suspension of Czech participation in the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute' and membership in the ICC, as well as re-evaluating the country's financial contributions to the court in The Hague. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to questions about his view of the ICC decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. 'Everyone has to abide by international law,' Trudeau said. He added that Canada 'will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international court.' Following the court’s decision, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar instructed Israeli ambassadors worldwide to 'engage influencers in general, not just those in power, foreign ministries or the prime minister's office. In some countries, it might be the opposition that could strongly voice opposition to this. And we need that. We need those voices to be heard.' 'A modern Dreyfus trial' Meanwhile, Netanyahu's office commented on the UN top court's decision. 'The antisemitic decision of the International Criminal Court is a modern Dreyfus trial – and will end the same way. Israel utterly rejects the false and absurd charges of the International Criminal Court, a biased and discriminatory political body,' the PMO said in a statement. 'No war is more just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza since October 7, 2023, when the Hamas terrorist organization launched a murderous assault and perpetrated the largest massacre against the Jewish People since the Holocaust,' it added. 'The decision to issue an arrest warrant against the Prime Minister was made by a corrupt chief prosecutor who is trying to save himself from sexual harassment accusations and biased judges who are motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel. 'The ICC prosecutor lied when he told American senators that he would take no action until he had visited Israel and heard its side. Instead, he cancelled his arrival in Israel last May, several days after suspicions of sexual harassment were made against him, and announced his intention to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and former Defense Minister.' 'No anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not give in to pressure. He will continue to pursue all the objectives that Israel set out to achieve in its just war against Hamas and the Iranian axis of terror,' the statement concluded.

First sergeant Ron Epshtein is 29th soldier killed in current rai...	Soldier, 19, , was killed by an artillery shell in the northern Gaza Strip, though it is not clear whether it was fired by Hamas or the IDF; The raid in Jabaliya, the 3rd since the war started, began last month and hundreds of terrorists have been killed or arrested First sergeant Ron Epshtein, 19, from Nesher, a soldier in the Tzabar Battalion, Givati Brigade, was killed Thursday by an artillery shell in Jabaliya, becoming the 29th IDF casualty since the raid began in the northern Gaza Strip last month. It is not clear whether the shell was fired by Hamas or the IDF. Epshtein, the son of Dimitri and Olga and brother to Daniel, Dina and Maya, was a student at the Hebrew Reali School of Haifa. He is the 14th fallen soldier from the Reali School since the beginning of the war. The director of the school, Yossi Ben David, said announced Epshtein's death in GAza and noted that his sister Maya is in 12th grade at the school and that his older siblings also were graduates of the school. The municipality paid tribute to its native son. 'The city of Nesher bows its head upon receiving the news of the death of Sergeant Ron Epshtein, a native of the city, a soldier in the Tzabar Battalion (432) from the Givati ​​Brigade, who fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. In this unbearably difficult time, we want to hug the Epshtein family, parents Dimitri and Olga and his siblings Daniel, Dina and Maya. May God grant that you will know no more sorrow. May his memory be blessed and engraved forever in our hearts.' On Wednesday the IDF announced that Sergeant First Class (res.) Roi Sasson, 21, from Mevaseret Zion, a soldier in the Nachshon Battalion of the Kfir Brigade, fell Tuesday in an encounter with terrorists in Jabaliya. In the same incident, the commander of the Nachshon Battalion, Kfir Brigade, Lt. Col. Yoel Glickman, was seriously injured, though his life is not in danger. A preliminary investigation of the encounter reveals that the force under Glickman's command was ambushed by a terrorist squad that was waiting inside a building, and came at the end of the battalion's attack on a target in the seam between Beit Lahia and Jabaliya. On Sunday, the Nachshon Battalion had two more soldiers who fell in battle in Jabaliya, who fell in the battle in Jabaliya, Captain Yogev Pazy and Staff Sergeant Noam Eitan. A day before, Sergeant First Class (res.) Idan Kenan Cohen from the battalion also fell in battle. The raid on Jabaliya began about a month and a half ago, although the IDF had already raided the city twice before in the past year - first during an operation in December, and in May and June of this year. Among the 29 dead are also quite a few officers, including the commander of the Israel Defense Force's 401st Armored Brigade, Col. Ehsan Daqsa. In this raid, the forces are scanning Hamas headquarters, mainly in the city's refugee camp, and are also putting pressure on the two neighboring towns, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, in order to move the remaining population south toward Gaza City, and then to continue even further south, beyond the Netzarim Corridor and the southern Gaza Strip. IDF forces are discovering weapons caches daily and engaging with terrorists regularly. The primary threat remains IEDs: Hamas has rigged more than 200 buildings in Jabaliya, primarily with 'dumb' explosives using improvised tripwires but without surveillance cameras. The IDF estimates this operation will be more prolonged than previous ones, potentially lasting several more weeks. Three IDF brigades under the 162nd Division are participating in the raid. The IDF has identified Jabaliya as a core Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza, where hundreds of terrorists — including senior commanders — have converged. Despite the IDF managing to evacuate tens of thousands of residents from the city over the past month, breaking what the IDF describes as a 'fear barrier' imposed by Hamas, a few thousand civilians remain.

Can't determine Deif has been killed': ICC's charges against for...	UN's top court issues arrest warrant against presumed killed Hamas military leader Mohammad Deif alongside Netanyahu and Gallant The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for the former head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, who was reportedly killed last July in an IDF strike in Khan Younis. In the same decision, the court also issued warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Deif was charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes months after the IDF announced Deif's assassination. According to the ICC, the reason behind the warrant is the inability to determine whether Deif was killed. The serious charges against him include 'crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence.' The ICC's announcement said the alleged crimes attributed to Deif took place 'on the territory of the State of Israel and the State of Palestine from at least 7 October 2023.' It was also noted the prosecution initially filed requests for arrest warrants against two other Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, who have since been killed. 'Following confirmation of their deaths, the Chamber granted the withdrawal of the applications on 9 August 2024 and 25 October 2024, respectively. With respect to Mr. Deif, the Prosecution indicated that it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death,' the statement read. 'On 15 November 2024, the Prosecution, referring to information from both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, notified the Chamber that it is not in a position to determine whether Mr Deif has been killed or remains alive. Therefore, the Chamber issues the present warrant of arrest,' it added. 'The warrant of arrest for Mr. Deif is classified as ‘secret’ in order to protect witnesses and to safeguard the conduct of investigations. However, the Chamber decided to release the information below since conduct similar to that addressed in the warrant of arrest appears to be ongoing, in particular the holding of a number of hostages captive. The Chamber considers it is also in the interest of victims and their families to be aware of the warrant’s existence,' the ICC stressed. 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Deif, born in 1965, the highest commander of the military wing of Hamas (known as the al-Qassam Brigades) at the time of the alleged conduct, is responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence.' 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Deif bears criminal responsibility for the aforementioned crimes for having committed the acts jointly and through others and having ordered or induced the commission of the crimes, and for his failure to exercise proper control over forces under his effective command and control,' it added. 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that during the relevant time, international humanitarian law related to international armed conflict (between Israel and Palestine) and non-international armed conflict (between Israel and Hamas) applied. The Chamber also found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the crimes against humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack directed by Hamas and other armed groups against the civilian population of Israel.'

Sending a message to Assad: New details behind the unusual attack...	At least 82 Hezbollah terrorists and militia leaders were killed while the Syrian president was hosting them, and the timing at the height of cease-fire negotiations is no coincidence; 'Israeli attacks in Syria have increased significantly, both in frequency and scope' Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition organization based in London, reported Thursday evening that at least 82 terrorists and commanders in the pro-Iranian militias and the Lebanese Hezbollah organization were killed in the unusual attack in Syria attributed to Israel in Tadmor. According to the group, 56 of the dead are Syrians affiliated with the pro-Iranian militias, and 22 are of non-Syrian nationality, most of them from the pro-Iranian Iraqi al-Nujaba militia. Next to them, four Hezbollah members also were killed. If the reports are correct, it appears that this is a message to Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is hosting senior members of Hezbollah, and therefore Israel is increasing the pressure on the terrorist organization, precisely at the height of negotiations toward a cease-fire, and maximizing success in hitting it not only in Lebanon. Najat Rochdi, the UN's special deputy envoy for Syria, expressed concern about the escalation in the region, telling the UN Security Council that 'the Israeli attacks are probably the deadliest that have hit Syria so far.' According to her, 'Israeli attacks in Syria have increased significantly, both in frequency and scope.' She pointed out that Israel says its attacks are aimed at targets related to Iran, Hezbollah or the Islamic Jihad, but in practice 'there are civilian casualties, including in large attacks on residential areas in the heart of Damascus' that took place recently. She also expressed concern about the 'volatile situation' in the Golan Heights and northwestern Syria, and clarified that 'this year is on track to be the most violent in Syria since 2020, and the risk of even greater destruction is still on the horizon.' After Wednesday's attack, which targeted the city of Tadmor in the Syrian desert, the Ministry of Defense in Syria claimed that Israel attacked from the air from the area of ​​the American military base at Tanaf, which is located in the Syria-Jordan-Iraq border triangle. The ministry has so far reported only 36 deaths, in contrast to the number stated by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and also significant material damage to the buildings that came under attack and their surroundings. In the report, the Syrian Observatory stated that the attack was aimed at three separate sites in the city of Tadmor, two of them in the Al-Jamaiya neighborhood; One of the sites is a weapons depot near an industrial area. The area reportedly is home to families of pro-Iranian activists who have Iraqi citizenship. And in the third site that was attacked, according to the Syrian Observatory, there was a meeting of leaders from the pro-Iranian militias who are in Tadmor, including senior officials from the pro-Iranian Iraqi al-Nujaba militia and a leader from Hezbollah. Meanwhile, an IDF force arrested a Syrian suspect on Thursday who breached the border fence into the southern Golan Heights. The suspect did not stop when ordered to by the soldiers, who shot him in the leg. He was then transferred to Ziv Hospital in Safed for further treatment and investigation, according to the IDF. The Syrian radio station 'Sham FM' commented on the incident, and claimed that the IDF 'kidnapped a 63-year-old civilian who was herding cattle in the area between Syria and Israel, which is under the control of the United Nations, west of the village of A-Rapid in the southern countryside of Quneitra.'

'There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General,' Gaetz, a Republican, wrote in a post on X. 'Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.' The announcement came a day after the House Ethics Committee deadlocked on releasing a report into allegations of sexual misconduct and illegal drug use by Gaetz, and after he met with Republican senators whose support would be needed to become attorney general.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjadmlpg1x	2024-11-21T08:53:55-08:00

Biden, Trump officials reject ICC warrants against Netanyahu and ...	U.S. lawmakers condemn UN Court's decision to issue the warrants saying the current and next administrations won't abide by them; 'Expect a strong response in January,' Trump official says The White House on Thursday condemned the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) issuing of arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, saying that it 'fundamentally rejects the Court’s decision.' U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby added that: 'We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' He said the U.S. will discuss its next steps with its partners. Earlier, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s chosen national security advisor Michael Waltz criticized the ICC, saying that it lacked credibility. 'These allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' he added. Waltz, whom Trump intends to appoint as his advisor upon taking office, added that 'Israel has lawfully defended its people and borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, also condemned the ICC’s decision, saying that the ' International Corrupt Criminal Court has acted in the most absurd and irresponsible manner possible by issuing arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant while there's a serious cloud of allegations hanging out over the prosecutor who sought these warrants.' 'If we do not act forcefully against the ICC after their outrageous decision to issue arrest warrants for the duly elected Israeli Prime Minister and former Minister of Defense, we are making a huge mistake, and I fear the United States is next,' he added. The immediate implication of the warrants means that Netanyahu and Gallant are effectively confined to Israel – they can't travel abroad, especially not to any of the 124 ICC member states, which include most European, African and South American countries. While Netanyahu and Gallant could potentially visit these nations, it would require convincing them not to enforce the warrants. In practice, this means Netanyahu is becoming an 'ostracized' leader. However, the U.S. isn't a member of the ICC and hasn't signed the Rome Statute that governs it, so Netanyahu wouldn't face travel issues there. Nevertheless, logistical challenges could arise regarding flight routes, as some countries might bar Israel’s state aircraft from passage through their airspace. Graham also called for an independent investigation into the prosecutor's misconduct, saying that issuing a warrant based on such work undermines any sense of fairness and the rule of law.

Czech lawmaker says ICC decision legalizes antisemitism on a glob...	Jan Bartošek condemned the ICC decision to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'Today, at a time when the world public is alarmed by the rise of antisemitism, when world politicians are condemning its violent manifestations, as in the recent attack on Jews in the streets of Amsterdam, we are witnessing an absolutely unprecedented decision that de facto legalizes antisemitism on a global level,' he posted on social media. 'Moreover, the decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Galant is an unprecedented legal act, as it concerns the democratically elected prime minister of a sovereign country. The ICC has thus contributed to the overall atmosphere of uncertainty in the current world order. It equates terrorists with legally elected state leaders, which in practical terms can only embolden terrorist movements around the world.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bktqikazjx	2024-11-21T08:20:42-08:00

Argentine President Javier Millay responded to the decision of the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Argentina 'expresses its profound disagreement with the recent decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant. This resolution ignores Israel's legitimate right to defend itself against constant attacks by terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel faces brutal aggression, inhumane hostage-taking, and the indiscriminate launching of attacks against its population. Criminalizing the legitimate defense of a nation while ignoring these atrocities is an act that distorts the spirit of international justice.

Lone soldiers reflect on reason for making aliyah, join war effor...	Sergeant First Class Eli Zivan was in Mexico when the war broke out, and just 2 days later he was in the Gaza border area; Sergeant Major Yoni Heilman joined the IDF in 2002 as a lone soldier and afterward lived in both countries, but the war made it clear to him Israel was a core part of his identity Sergeant First Class Eli Zivan and Sergeant Major Yoni Heilman have always felt a deep connection to Israel, which inspired them to serve as lone soldiers in the IDF. When war broke out on October 7, they immediately took action to join the fight, reaffirming for them that Israel was their home. Yoni, tell us a little about yourself, and how you made aliyah to Israel the first time. 'I grew up back and forth between Israel and America,' Heilman began. 'I first served in Nahal as a volunteer through the Mahal program, and I made aliyah with my wife in 2009 when we were expecting our first child. We returned to the United States for a time but made aliyah again a few years ago.' Heilman’s connection to Israel has always been strong. His initial service as a lone soldier reflected his commitment to making Israel his home. And I understand that you made aliyah as a lone soldier. What was your motivation? 'I always knew I would spend my life in Israel, but I wasn’t quite ready to make aliyah at 18. Still, I wanted to serve in the army and be ready to answer the call when needed,' Heilman explained. In 2002, shortly after Operation Defensive Shield, Heilman came to Israel as a lone soldier in the Nahal Brigade. 'I grew up in a Zionist household where Israel was a core part of my identity. For me, serving was about earning my place in this country,' he said. Eli, for you, it was a bit different because you made aliyah with your family. How was it for you? Zivan shared that he is the youngest of five brothers, all of whom served in combat units during the war. 'We were raised in a Zionist home with the understanding that Israel is our land, and this is where we live our lives,' he said. 'Every day during this war, I felt like I was fulfilling the Zionist dream I grew up with. I was doing exactly what my upbringing prepared me for,' Zivan added. Where did October 7 catch you? Zivan recalled being in Mexico on the Pacific coast between school semesters when news of the terror attacks broke. 'I saw what was happening on my phone and immediately started making calls. The Mexican consulate helped me secure a flight, and by October 9 I was back with my team,' he said. Soon after his return, Zivan and his unit were clearing the area around the Nova music festival and nearby kibbutzim, preparing for the next steps in the military operation. Heilman, already in Israel on October 7, was at home in Modi’in with his family. 'I was about to leave for an errand when I got the call. By 9:30 a.m. or 10 a.m., I was at our base, gathering gear. Thirty-six hours later, we were in the south, working in the same areas Eli mentioned, including the Nova festival and several kibbutzim,' he said. I understand that you decided to document your experience in a WhatsApp group. You have many followers. 'Yes,' Heilman confirmed. 'It started as updates to my wife, then my family. Eventually, it grew to include hundreds of people.' For Heilman, writing became a form of processing the intense experiences of war. 'Every day, I’d put my thoughts down as a way to clear my mind enough to sleep for a few hours. It wasn’t my intention to attract so many readers, but people wanted to feel connected to what was happening on the front lines,' he said. What do you share? 'Mostly, I share my feelings,' Heilman explained. 'I can’t always describe what I’ve seen or experienced, but I try to convey the emotional reality. In the first month, our unit focused on securing areas and performing the tragic but sacred duty of collecting our fallen brothers and sisters.' He also highlighted the inspiration he drew from his fellow soldiers. 'The heartbreak was immense, but the commitment of so many soldiers showing up, ready to do whatever was needed to make this country safer, was profoundly moving,' he said. A message you wish to convey, both of you. Zivan began, 'My greatest wish is for the safe return of all 101 hostages and for everyone serving to come home safely. I hope we complete this mission at the highest level, so our friends and brothers who fell for this country will not have done so in vain.' Heilman echoed these sentiments. 'There’s been a lot of discussion about the heavy burden on the nation, and while we are tired, it’s an honor to be part of this effort. We are not ready to go home until everyone is brought back, and we’ve made this country safe again.'

Is it safe to be Jewish in Spain?	Student Erica Mahler says Jewish, Israeli friends have faced 'aggression' A young Jewish woman has shared her fears about openly expressing her Jewish identity in Spain as antisemitism continues to rise in the country. Speaking to ILTV News, Erica Mahler, a student at the University of Barcelona, said, 'There have been a lot of incidents with my friends where they have shown they are Jewish or Israeli, and they have been faced with aggression.' She mentioned a recent incident in her neighborhood where a mezuzah was ripped off someone’s door. 'So, there is sort of a fear of showing openly that you're Israeli or Jewish, but at the same time, it's not stopping us from moving forward and trying to educate the people so that we can live openly within our society,' Mahler added. Watch the full interview: Spain has experienced one of the largest spikes in antisemitism since the war. According to a recent report by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 78% of Spanish Jews consider antisemitism to be a very big or fairly big problem in the country. Additionally, Spain is one of three countries, alongside Ireland and Norway, to formally recognize a unified Palestinian state under the Palestinian Authority. This recognition comes despite Israel’s parliament ruling that it will not recognize or allow such a state at this time.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sknnrtnmyg	2024-11-21T05:42:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/ryDiL63GJg/ryDiL63GJg_137_1_805_453_0_small.jpg
Ex-Israeli turns Menendez brothers' mansion into a home that host...	For years – until it was sold for $17 million shortly before the release of the series 'Monsters,' which spotlighted the infamous murder in the lavish Beverly Hills mansion – Sam Delug lived in the villa and hosted approximately 75 fundraising events in support of Israel For years, the stunning mansion on Elm Drive in Beverly Hills has been a magnet for curious onlookers and tourist buses eager to catch a glimpse of celebrity homes. Recently, interest in the property surged, thanks to Netflix’s 'Monsters' series chronicling the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez. The mansion’s dark history as the scene of one of the world’s most infamous murders has long fascinated the public. It turns out the home has a connection to a former Israeli, Sam Delug. Until a few months ago, Delug owned the property and, while he found the endless curiosity puzzling, it didn’t bother him much after the first few years. 'When I first moved in, people wouldn’t just stare from a distance – they’d knock on the door and ask to come inside as if it were a museum,' Delug recalls. 'I’d tell them, ‘If you don’t leave my property, I’ll call the police.’ But that only lasted two or three years, and then it stopped.' Delug, a warm-hearted entrepreneur, lawyer, and philanthropist, was born in Melbourne, Australia. He moved to Israel with his family at age seven and lived there for three years before relocating to New York and eventually settling in Los Angeles. The tragedy that shocked Beverly Hills and the U.S. The murders of Jose and Mary Louise 'Kitty' Menendez horrified the elite neighborhood of Beverly Hills –and the entire nation. On August 20, 1989, the couple was relaxing in the living room of their mansion, watching television, when their sons entered and fatally shot them. Jose was struck six times, and Kitty was shot 10 times. Later that night, the brothers called the police, claiming they had found their parents dead. Initially, suspicion turned toward external threats, including the local mafia. But the brothers drew attention when they began spending millions of dollars from their inheritance soon after the murders. Investigators eventually tied them to the crime when Erik confessed to his psychologist, who alerted the authorities. During their high-profile trial, the Menendez brothers claimed they had suffered years of sexual abuse at the hands of their father, which drove them to commit the murders. Despite their defense, they were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. From infamous crime scene to renovated haven The mansion changed hands for the first time in 1991 and was sold two years later to William Link, co-creator of the TV series 'Murder, She Wrote.' In 2001, Sam Delug purchased the home for $3.7 million. Before buying, Delug visited the house with his three children, then young adults, to gauge their feelings. 'I wanted to make sure they felt comfortable,' he says. 'My youngest was 19 at the time, and none of them lived with me anymore, but I still wanted each of them to have a room to call their own when they visited. They told me, ‘Dad, it’s just another house. We’re fine with it.’' Built in 1927, the house was dated by the time Delug moved in, so he hired an interior designer to renovate the entire property. The exterior, however, was left untouched, maintaining the structure’s historic charm. The infamous living room where the murders occurred was transformed into a bright, welcoming TV room with doors leading to the garden. 'Most people wouldn’t believe such a tragedy took place in that space,' Delug says. 'It’s now light, inviting and peaceful.' After the renovation, Delug began hosting charity events at the mansion, primarily for Jewish and pro-Israel organizations. Groups like Stand With Us, AIPAC, and the Maccabiah Games regularly benefitted from his gatherings. The mansion also became a venue for other causes, such as fundraisers for Beit Halochem and Israel Bonds. 'I’m 100% a Zionist,' Delug says proudly. A legacy of community and philanthropy Over the years, Delug’s home became a hub for philanthropy. Notable speakers, such as Yoseph Haddad, an activist for Israel’s image abroad, and Micky Kubi, a former senior Shin Bet investigator, have shared their stories at events there. 'I started getting involved in the community 20 years ago, and for the past 15 years I’ve hosted four to five major events a year,' Delug says. 'Altogether, I’ve probably hosted about 75 events, including a break-fast meal after Yom Kippur. Anyone without a place to go is welcome. That’s my first mitzvah of the year.' Delug visits Israel twice a year and has a deep connection to the country. After arriving for a visit shortly before October 7, 2023, he found himself stranded in Israel due to the outbreak of war. 'I was supposed to leave on October 11 and meet my son in Italy, but I couldn’t go,' he recalls. Earlier in the year, he returned to Israel with a Stand With Us delegation, organizing a barbecue for soldiers and bringing musicians to perform for them. 'They appreciated it so much,' he says. Saying goodbye to Elm Drive After 22 years in the Elm Drive mansion, Delug decided it was time to move on. 'To be honest, I was tired of people referring to it as ‘the Menendez house.’ Nobody could just say I lived in Los Angeles. Well, now they can’t say that anymore,' he says, half-jokingly. During his time there, Delug says he never felt any negative energy in the home. On the contrary, it became a vibrant space filled with joy and purpose. Still, leaving wasn’t easy. 'This house holds some of the best memories of my life,' he admits. 'But I believe in creating new memories.' The seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom estate sold earlier this year for approximately $17 million, closing a chapter in its long and storied history.

Travel to and from Israel remains difficult, but relief may be on...	Arkia and Israir have received government approval to begin operating flights to the United States in the coming weeks Since the start of the ongoing war, numerous airlines have suspended flights to and from Israel, making travel both challenging and extremely expensive. Now, two Israeli airlines have made an announcement that could ease the burden. Air travel in and out of Israel has faced significant challenges. Due to the war and escalating tensions in the north, major carriers like Lufthansa, Air France, Virgin Atlantic, and United Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv, leaving Israeli airline El Al as the sole operator connecting Israel to the United States. This lack of competition has caused flight prices to soar, making air travel an unaffordable luxury for many. But there’s hope on the horizon. Arkia and Israir have received government approval to begin operating flights to the United States in the coming weeks. Both airlines plan to lease aircraft from Europe and operate ten weekly flights with foreign crews. Their entry into the U.S. market is expected to increase competition and potentially lower fares for travelers. Meanwhile, the list of suspended flights continues to grow. Airlines such as Air France, British Airways, and American Airlines have announced delays in resuming service to Israel, with some pushing return dates as far back as late 2025 due to operational challenges and security concerns.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15syangyl	2024-11-21T05:14:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/16/rJcDGtXET/rJcDGtXET_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Ex-justice minister Ayelet Shaked claims Australia denied entry v...	Shaked slams Australian government as 'anti-Israeli' and 'antisemitic,' adding that 'These are dark days for Australian democracy' as Canberra chose 'the wrong side of history' Former justice minister Ayelet Shaked said Thursday that Australia refused to grant her a visa to enter the country, a move she attributed to political motives, namely due to her opposition to Palestinian statehood. 'The current Australian government is anti-Israeli, extremely pro-Palestinian and in some parts even antisemitic,' Shaked said. 'Because of my opposition to a Palestinian state, they won’t allow me to visit and engage in strategic dialogue between our countries. These are dark days for Australian democracy, and this government has chosen the wrong side of history.' According to Shaked, she traveled to 'participate in a strategic dialogue between the countries at the AIJAC conference.' She said the decision by the Labor government was 'a clear testament to its hypocrisy and its hostile stance toward Israel.' Like many countries around the world, the war in Gaza, which began following the October 7 massacre, has sparked heated political debates in Australia. While the left-wing Labor government has repeatedly called for a cease-fire, it has, unlike countries such as Spain, Ireland and Norway—who have been more critical of Israel—avoided recognizing a Palestinian state. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization in Australia. Throughout the summer, Australia’s political system was embroiled in debates over whether to allow Palestinian refugees to remain in the country or continue to arrive due to the ongoing war in Gaza. Canberra announced plans to extend the temporary visas of refugees who had already arrived, while the conservative opposition leader called for an outright ban on the arrival of Gazans, fearing that some might pose a security risk. According to Australian broadcaster ABC, by August, the government had granted nearly 3,000 'visitor' visas to Palestinians who had fled Gaza or the West Bank after October 7. However, only about half of them had actually arrived in Australia, and another 7,000 applications were rejected. The visas granted were temporary, and due to the ongoing war, their validity is set to expire soon. The Australian government has stated it is exploring ways to extend the stay of the Palestinian refugees.

TESTING	TESTING A Melburne woman who disappeared last month was allegedly murdered by her 'sugar daddy,' whose friend, an Israeli man, is accused of helping him dispose of her body, according to police documents released by the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Wednesday evening. The remains, believed to belong to 19-year-old Isla Bell, were found in a trash site Tuesday morning, though formal identification is pending. According to the indictment, Marat Ganiev, 53, is accused of killing Bell just after midnight on October 7, days before her 20th birthday, while his friend, Eyal Yaffe, 57, allegedly assisted in covering up the crime. Australian media reported that Bell was last seen leaving her Brunswick home on October 4. In a message sent to a friend shortly before her death, Bell described Ganiev as 'the best Russian sugar daddy' who was lavishing her with gifts and had saved her from 'sex traffickers.' Authorities believe Bell was killed in Ganiev’s apartment kitchen. Surveillance footage reportedly showed her entering his residence on October 5, with no evidence of her leaving. Police allege that Ganiev, a reported heroin addict, and Yaffe placed Bell’s body in a fridge, which was moved to other locations around Melbourne. On November 18, a man discovered the fridge on the street and, after unwrapping it, discarded a bag from inside, thinking it contained animal remains. He left the fridge on the street of a Melbourne suburb, where police found it the next day. Bell’s remains were later identified at a landfill in Dandenong, another Melbourne suburb. Ganiev faces charges of murder. Yaffe, who police say planned to flee to Bulgaria, has been charged with being an accessory after the fact. In court, Yaffe reportedly admitted to disposing of Bell’s body but denied involvement in the killing. He was seen smiling and interacting with guards and family members during his court appearance. Bell’s mother, Justine Spokes, paid tribute to her daughter on the day her body was found. 'Cherished forever and suffering no more,' she said. 'I am so sorry I could not protect you, that your experience of the world was cruel and unsafe. Despite your challenges, you lived bravely, stood up for what was right and remained the kindest human, the gentlest soul… With the deepest love and respect, your Mumma.'

Jews from across North America share stories of renewal, resilien...	Eshkol Mayor Michal Uziyahu at the event: 'Our story did not start on October 7 and for sure it did not end that day either' More than 2,500 people came together last week in Dallas for the Jewish National Fund’s annual conference, titled 'We Choose Life: Rebuilding and Reimagining Israel's North and South.' The conference focused on the land and people of Israel, emphasizing a message that transcends politics—it's not about Right or Left, red or blue, but about building a brighter future for the Jewish state. 'It’s amazing to know there are this many people who have come together with a common goal of securing Israel, dealing with obviously the issues of antisemitism and education,' said Deb Lust Zaluda, president of JNF-USA. 'These are all people that share the same values as I have.' Among the speakers were prominent Israeli leaders, including Michal Uziyahu, Mayor of Eshkol—a region ravaged by Hamas attacks—and Nisan Zeevi, Commander of the Emergency Squad in Kfar Giladi, a community under threat from Hezbollah. Both shared inspiring messages of hope and resilience. Currently, around 65,000 Israelis remain displaced from their homes in the North. This region, where JNF-USA has invested heavily for decades, has faced relentless Hezbollah rocket fire since October 8. In response, JNF-USA has not only provided critical funding but also partnered with local communities to reimagine and rebuild a brighter future. 'Our story did not start on October 7 and for sure it did not end that day either,' said Eshkol Mayor Michal Uziyahu. 'Our story is a story of light, of life and of hope.' 'Together we can - we will - make the Galilee great again,' added Nisan Zeevi, commander of the Kfar Giladi Emergency Squad. The conference also highlighted inspiring stories from students of JNF’s Alexander Muss High School in Israel. They shared how their time at the school deepened their understanding of Judaism and strengthened their connection to the land and people of Israel. In a time of rising antisemitism worldwide, including in the United States, these young leaders expressed pride in their Jewish identity and a renewed commitment to their heritage. 'Hasbara is more important now than ever. Everyone needs to use their voice. Every person who can, should speak up,' said social media influencer Emily Austin. The conference included a powerful performance by the Special in Uniform Band, earning a tearful standing ovation from the audience. Meanwhile, in the hallways, leaders held meetings to forge business deals and strengthen the Israel-U.S. connection. 'I came to call on all businessmen here in the United States, come and invest in Israel,' said Avi Bleshnikov, Israeli representative of Ron Lauder. 'This is the right time to come and build your future in Israel.' Zaluda added, 'The work continues to be urgent. It may not be emergent, but it continues to be urgent.' Outside the conference venue, demonstrators expressing opposition to the war and the State of Israel staged a Palestinian solidarity protest, including a street sit-in that led to several arrests. Despite the disruption, the conference continued undeterred, with attendees united in a spirit of strength and optimism for the future. 'It’s been an enormously roller coaster year,' said JNF-USA CEO Russel Robinson. 'The good, the bad, the ugly, the pain, the tears, the happiness. And sometimes it is so easy to get caught up in the oy vey. This gives us an opportunity to say, ‘wow, we are winning.’'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk00srdhzjg	2024-11-21T00:01:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/B1q6IuhGJl/B1q6IuhGJl_0_0_552_311_0_small.jpg
Report: Israeli strike hits Syrian army, pro-Iran militias, killi...	Opposition watchdog claims pro-Iranian militia sites and Syrian military positions targeted, leaving dozens of Syrian militia operatives, foreign fighters and Hezbollah members, including high-profile figures, dead and wounded Dozens were killed and injured in an Israeli airstrike targeting the city of Palmyra in Syria’s eastern desert on Wednesday, Syrian state media and opposition monitors reported. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks. Among the dead were 10 Syrian soldiers, with significant damage to buildings and surrounding areas, according to the Syrian Defense Ministry. The ministry alleged the strike was launched from the vicinity of the U.S. military base at Al-Tanf, near the Syria-Jordan-Iraq tri-border area, and claimed the attack targeted multiple sites in Palmyra. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, reported Thursday that at least 68 people were killed and 50 injured. Among the dead were 42 Syrians linked to pro-Iranian militias, 22 foreign nationals—primarily members of the Iraqi pro-Iranian Nujaba militia—and four Hezbollah operatives. According to the watchdog, the strikes hit three separate locations in Palmyra, including two in the Al-Jam’iya neighborhood, one of which was a weapons depot near an industrial zone. The third site allegedly hosted a meeting of pro-Iranian militia leaders, including senior figures from the Iraqi Nujaba militia and Hezbollah. Families of pro-Iranian operatives, many with Iraqi or foreign citizenship, reportedly reside in the affected area. The Observatory also noted that some of the buildings targeted were located near Palmyra’s famed archaeological sites, although the extent of any impact on the historical landmarks remains unclear. The strikes reportedly began around 1 p.m. local time, with Syrian media outlets reporting explosions in Palmyra, located in the eastern countryside of Homs province. Subsequent reports, including from the Syrian state news agency SANA, indicated strikes on residential buildings and industrial zones in and around the city. Pro-Iranian militia headquarters were also reportedly among the targets.

During the operation, an Israeli aircraft targeted and killed three armed terrorists operating in the sector, some of whom were involved in recent shooting attacks on military positions and Israeli communities. Secondary explosions were observed following the strike, indicating the presence of weapons and explosives in the area, the military said. In subsequent clashes, six additional armed terrorists were killed. Forces also destroyed four bomb-making labs and dozens of explosive devices planted under roadways, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2bavnz1l	2024-11-20T23:21:07-08:00	
Russia launches intercontinental ballistic missile in attack on U...	Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile from its southern Astrakhan region during a morning attack on Ukraine on Thursday, Kyiv's air force said, the first time Russia has used such a powerful, long-range missile during the war. The strike comes after Ukraine used U.S. and British missiles to strike targets inside Russia this week, something Moscow had warned for months would be seen as a major escalation. The Russian attack targeted enterprises and critical infrastructure in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, the air force said, at a time of escalating moves in the 33-month-old war launched by Russia in Ukraine. It was unclear from the statement what the intercontinental ballistic missile targeted and whether it caused any damage. The missiles have a range of thousands of kilometers and can be used for delivering nuclear warheads, though they can also have conventional warheads. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six Kh-101 cruise missiles during the attack.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryi53v2f1g	2024-11-20T23:18:31-08:00

Bitcoin's march toward $100,000 made further ground on Thursday as investors bet a friendlier U.S. regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies under President-elect Donald Trump will unleash a boom era for the asset class. Bitcoin prices topped $97,000 for the first time in Asia trade, touching a high just above $97,559. The cryptocurrency's price has more than doubled this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. 'While it's now firmly into overbought territory, it is being drawn toward the $100k level,' said IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the 'crypto capital of the planet' and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmz3d2mkx	2024-11-20T23:16:50-08:00

Following a joint investigation by the police and Shin Bet, authorities said they gathered evidence implicating the suspects in the plot. The indictment, submitted to a military court this week, alleges that in June 2024, the primary suspect, Ismail Ibrahim Awadi, sought to establish a cell to acquire weapons and manufacture explosives targeting security forces and senior officials. Awadi reportedly approached Hamas and Hezbollah for funding and training to carry out attacks against Israelis, including prominent figures. According to the indictment, Awadi conducted surveillance on Ben-Gvir and his son, monitoring their travel routes, vehicles and security arrangements. One scenario considered was attacking Ben-Gvir upon his arrival at a terror scene, a routine part of his ministerial duties. The suspects were apprehended earlier this year, and the arresting investigators received commendation from Judea and Samaria District Commander Moshe Pinchi. 'This case exemplifies the extensive efforts of Israel’s enemies to conduct terror operations, targeting a senior minister, his son, security forces and other officials. Arresting and indicting this terror cell represents a significant achievement in the fight against terror and efforts to protect public safety,' said Pinchi. Minister Ben-Gvir expressed gratitude to law enforcement and Shin Bet for foiling the plot. 'I thank the police and Shin Bet for arresting and indicting the terror cell that sought to assassinate me and my son. Thanks to their hard work, and by the grace of God, the enemy’s plan was thwarted,' he said. 'I will continue to push for harsher prison conditions for terrorists, enforce sovereignty and governance in Israel, distribute arms, demolish illegal homes and achieve decisive victory over our enemies. No terrorist will deter me.'

US Senate overwhelmingly rejects Sanders' proposals to halt arms ...	Three proposals by progerssive lawmaker rejected with bipartisan opposition and backing from Biden administration; while Sanders argues aid violated US laws on human rights, opponents emphasize timing, given Israel’s threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran The U.S. Senate decisively rejected overnight Thursday three proposals introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive leader within the Democratic Party and outspoken critic of Israel, to halt arms transfers to Israel amid its war in Gaza. The first proposal, which sought to block the transfer of tank shells to Israel, failed with 79 senators opposing and 18 supporting. The second, to stop the delivery of mortar shells, was rejected by a vote of 78-10. The third, aimed at halting the transfer of Boeing's JDAM kits, which convert unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, was defeated 80-17. All senators voting in favor were Democrats, while members from both parties opposed the measures. The Biden administration also came out against the proposals, sending a letter to Democratic senators ahead of the vote. 'Providing military equipment to Israel is an investment in its long-term security as it faces threats from Iran and elsewhere,' the administration wrote, adding that it is 'working continuously to improve conditions in Gaza.' Sanders introduced six resolutions in total, seeking to block approximately $20 billion in U.S. arms transfers to Israel, but only three were brought to a vote. For decades, strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress has made it nearly impossible for proposals like those introduced by Sen. Sanders to pass. Still, supporters of the measures hoped a significant showing in the Senate would pressure the Israeli government and the Biden administration to take greater steps to prevent harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Ahead of the vote, Sanders argued that U.S. military aid to Israel violates American law prohibiting arms sales to those who commit human rights abuses. He cited the high number of child fatalities in Gaza and accused Israel of blocking humanitarian aid deliveries to the territory. 'It’s time to tell the Netanyahu government that it cannot use American taxpayer dollars and American weapons to violate U.S. and international law and our moral values,' Sanders said. Opponents of the proposals argued that they were poorly timed, as Israel faces threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. 'Israel is surrounded by enemies dedicated to its destruction,' Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, said before the votes. Last month, the Biden administration issued an ultimatum to Israel, warning that failure to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza within 30 days could result in a U.S. arms embargo. Last week, at the end of the deadline, Washington announced it had determined that Israel had 'made progress' and was no longer obstructing aid deliveries to the territory. Under U.S. law, Congress has the authority to block major arms sales to foreign countries by passing resolutions like those introduced by Sen. Sanders. Although no such resolution has ever passed Congress and survived a presidential veto, the law requires the Senate to vote on any submitted resolution. Sanders, a prominent figure on the global stage since his surprising performance in the 2016 presidential primaries, is widely credited with forcing Hillary Clinton into a grueling, extended race that some believe contributed to her eventual loss to Donald Trump. An independent rather than a Democrat, Sanders is considered a trailblazer for bringing the progressive wing to the forefront of U.S. politics, garnering widespread support among younger voters. In his youth, Sanders spent time volunteering on Kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim in Israel but has since become a vocal critic of Israeli policies.

UK police arrest pro-Palestinian activists over vandalism at Isra...	British police said on Thursday they arrested 10 pro-Palestinian activists from the group Palestine Action on suspicion of vandalizing the offices of Israeli defense company Elbit Systems in Bristol, southwest England. The incident occurred in early August when the activists allegedly broke into the company’s secured production facility armed with axes and hammers, damaging weapons and other equipment. Footage released by the group shows the activists causing property damage and attacking employees who tried to intervene. One worker was reportedly struck on the head. Police officers responding to the scene were also assaulted with hammers. Six suspects were arrested on-site, while others fled. Authorities continued their investigation, leading to the recent arrests.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1sk6inm1l	2024-11-20T22:11:38-08:00

IDF identifies Golani soldier killed in Lebanon clash alongside f...	Sergeant Gur Kehati of 13th Battalion, 20, from Nir Banim, killed in Hezbollah ambush alongside Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, 70; 2 officers sustain moderate and severe injuries in incident The IDF identified on Thursday morning Sergeant Gur Kehati, 20, from Nir Banim, as one of two people killed in a clash with Hezbollah terrorists at an archaeological fortress in southern Lebanon. Kehati, a soldier in the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, died alongside Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, a 70-year-old historian and geographer known for his research on the Land of Israel. The incident also left a 13th Battalion officer seriously wounded and Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Col. (res.) Yoav Yarom moderately wounded. Yarom, who lost a leg in combat in Lebanon as a young officer, was present at the site, which lies 5-6 kilometers from the border and overlooks Tyre and Lebanon’s coastal plain. The clash occurred Wednesday afternoon in an area under IDF control since earlier operations, according to the military. Yarom and Erlich, armed and wearing protective gear but classified by the IDF as a civilian, were reportedly surveying the fortress near a mosque when two Hezbollah terrorists, who had been hiding there for days, opened fire at close range. The IDF said that Erlich’s presence at the site violated military orders and classified the event as a 'serious and unusual incident.' The military has launched an investigation into the circumstances of Erlich’s entry into Lebanon and his involvement in the operation. Erlich’s family disputes the IDF’s claim that he entered Lebanon as a civilian. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' his brother, Yigal Amitai, told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria.' Erlich was a prominent figure in Israeli historical and geographical research, particularly in Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the different regions of the West Bank. He authored several publications, including Samaria and Benjamin and Judea and Samaria Studies, and was one of the founders of the settlement of Ofra. He is survived by his wife, Tamar, six children and grandchildren.

Family of Israeli scholar killed in Lebanon disputes IDF’s accoun...	Family of Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich, renowned historian killed in Hezbollah ambush, disputes IDF claim he entered as a civilian, asserting he was formally enlisted and had military approval for his entry; 'Instead of mourning, I’m busy correcting the damage caused by the IDF spokesperson tarnishing his name,' brother says The death of Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, a 70-year-old historian and geographer from Ofra, in a clash with Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon on Wednesday shocked his family and friends. Known for his deep love of exploring every corner of Israel, Erlich, who held the rank of major in the reserves but was present as a civilian, was posthumously recognized as a fallen IDF soldier following the highly unusual incident, which also claimed the life of a Golani Brigade soldier whose name has not yet been released. While the IDF claimed that Erlich entered Lebanon as a civilian, his brother Yigal Amitai disputed this claim. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' Amitai told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria.' Amitai said he last spoke with Erlich on Wednesday morning before his entry into Lebanon. 'At 11 a.m., he told me, ‘We’re going into Lebanon.’ The IDF spokesperson is shielding senior officers while shifting blame onto mid-level ranks,' Amitai added. Amitai expressed frustration with how the family was informed. 'We were only notified at 8 p.m. today. Jabo was my eldest brother, one of three siblings. Instead of mourning, I’m busy correcting the damage caused by the IDF spokesperson tarnishing his name,' he said. The IDF acknowledged Erlich’s years of service as a reserve major and decided to grant him a military burial. Erlich, one of the founding figures of the Ofra settlement, was a prominent historian and editor of influential publications such as Samaria and Benjamin and Judea and Samaria Studies. He is survived by his wife Tamar, six children and grandchildren. 'There was nothing Jabo didn’t know about the history and archaeology of Israel,' Amitai said. 'He didn’t just teach knowledge—he conveyed the emotion and depth behind every story. He lived with a profound historical consciousness. We are in complete shock and still processing this heavy loss.' 'This is a tremendous shock. Jabo was a scholar of the Land of Israel who explored every corner,' Pinchas Wallerstein, a close friend of Erlich, told Ynet. 'His knowledge of the country’s history was astounding. We’ve known each other for over 50 years. He guided tours not only in Israel but also in Jordan and other locations. He was a classic figure, deeply familiar with the land and widely respected across all segments of society. He had connections with every senior IDF officer—there isn’t a general who didn’t know Jabo.' Wallerstein added, 'I’m still struggling to process this news. We climbed together last Friday, and he told me he was preparing to enter Lebanon, speaking about some fortress he was surveying. He was part of the founding team that established the Field School in Ofra. I truly cannot comprehend this loss. Jabo was a Renaissance man—there was almost no topic related to the Land of Israel he didn’t know. And it’s important to note that he loved the people of Israel in all their diversity.' Erlich moved to Ofra in 1977, where he worked as a guide for five years at the Field School. It was there that he met his wife, Tamar, who worked as the school’s secretary. The couple was among the first 50 families to build permanent homes in the settlement. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Jewish history and Talmudic studies but was also known for his extensive self-directed learning. Erlich’s passion was the Land of Israel and its people. He frequently traveled throughout the country, focusing particularly on remote and unconventional locations in Judea and Samaria, and often wrote articles about his explorations. Yaron Rosenthal, head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council and a friend of Erlich, told Ynet: 'It’s hard to fathom the immense tragedy of losing our dear friend Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich. Jabo was one of the founding figures in the field of tour guiding and the study of Judea and Samaria. Our generation followed his lead, hanging on his every word. For years, he guided and researched with unparalleled curiosity, exploring every nook and cranny and investigating every archaeological site. Few people had such a profound passion for the land and loved it as deeply as he did. To me, Jabo was also a dear friend and a mentor from whom I learned so much over the years. I will miss him deeply. We will do our best to follow in the footsteps of the giant he was.' Nati Malihi, a close friend of Erlich, paid tribute, writing: 'The man, the mustache, the Bible and the Land of Israel. ‘No need to stand for me,’ he would joke with a wave of his hand, smiling beneath his mustache while holding his Bible marked with hundreds of tabs, as he did every Friday evening before taking his seat two chairs ahead of mine. 'I first met him about 40 years ago when we lived on Har Bracha, Mount Gerizim. Jabo was a regular visitor, welcomed as family by our Samaritan neighbors, whom he studied, knew, loved and shared their secrets with us. Jabo and the Land of Israel. Jabo and the Bible that lived within him. You’d ask him a question and receive a scholarly answer, always with a wink. ‘You can sit down now,’ he would say to all of us. ‘I’m on duty for the study of the Land of Israel.’ May his memory be a blessing.' Moshe Gutman, chairman of the 'Preserving Eternity' coalition for protecting heritage sites in Judea and Samaria, said: '‘Jabo’ was synonymous with knowledge of the land, for hikes through every valley and ruin—a figure worthy of admiration. He was the guide of guides, the teacher of teachers, a legendary man. He loved heritage with all his heart. Wherever you found him, he was immersed in the story of the place—explaining, narrating, questioning, interpreting, connecting and inspiring thought. He was a soldier of heritage, a true Renaissance man, a man of the land. His legacy will forever walk with us, through the trails and sites, the mountains and valleys. Jabo was, and remains, a legend.' Yisrael Ganz, head of the Benjamin Regional Council, said: 'We are shocked by the sudden loss of Jabo. His name was synonymous with knowledge and love for the land. He was a pioneer of settlement and a pillar of the Ofra community. Thousands of land enthusiasts have grown, and will continue to grow, from the discoveries and insights he brought to the world, rooted in his deep love for the Holy Land, its heritage and the history of the Jewish people within it. We share in the profound sorrow of his dear wife Tamar, the entire Erlich family and the Ofra community, embracing them in their grief.' The Yesha Council also paid tribute, describing him as 'a living legend in both life and death, with an extraordinary legacy. A scholar of the Land of Israel who knew every corner and trail. For many years, he volunteered and assisted soldiers across various sectors, sharing his unmatched knowledge of villages and sites.' In the incident where Erlich was killed, a Golani soldier also fell. The soldier’s family has been notified, but his name has not yet been released. Additionally, a soldier from the 13th Battalion was critically injured, and Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Col. (res.) Yoav Yarom sustained moderate injuries. The highly unusual incident occurred around 3 p.m. in an area 5-6 kilometers inside Lebanon, overlooking Tyre and the southern coastal plain. According to the IDF, Although Erlich, a reserve major, volunteered for military service until the age of 70, he entered Lebanon as a civilian. He joined Yarom to survey an ancient fortress near a mosque on a high ridge. Erlich was reportedly armed, wearing protective gear and dressed in military-style clothing. The IDF emphasized that the investigation into the incident is in its early stages. Among the questions being examined are reports that this was not Erlich’s first entry into southern Lebanon with IDF officers in recent weeks and whether his presence was for archaeological research or operational purposes. In an unusual decision, the IDF's new Personnel Directorate head, Maj. Gen. Dado Bar Kalifa, posthumously recognized Erlich as a fallen IDF soldier with active reserve service, granting him the right to a military burial.

Hezbollah rocket strikes northern Israel kindergarten minutes aft...	Shortly after Hezbollah chief concludes speech, terror group launches rocket barrage, striking empty kindergarten in Acre, causing significant damage to building; blast also damaged dozens of nearby homes, sparking renewed fears among residents A barrage of 25 rockets launched by Hezbollah struck the Western Galilee on Wednesday, with one rocket directly hitting the fence of a kindergarten in the coastal city of Acre. No children were present at the time of the strike, but the kindergarten sustained significant damage, and dozens of nearby buildings were also impacted by the blast. The IDF reported that only some of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. Assi Abutbul, a 25-year-old local, described the aftermath. 'I heard a loud noise and went outside to see a hole in the kindergarten,' he said. 'There were children here this morning. This is not a good situation—not at all.' When asked about the prospects for a cease-fire, Abutbul was dismissive. 'There is no settlement, no security, nothing. It’s all lies. Missiles are hitting kindergartens and schools. There’s no security or agreements—just nonsense.' In response to the attack, the Acre municipality announced the suspension of classes citywide on Thursday and Friday. Mayor Amichai Ben-Shlush conducted a situation assessment at the site and determined that educational institutions would remain closed until at least Sunday. Further decisions will be made following a reassessment on Saturday night. In a conversation with Ynet, Mayor Amichai Ben-Shlush clarified that he does not intend to continue adhering to Home Front Command guidelines, which permit the reopening of classes and transportation. Instead, he ordered the closure of schools, kindergartens and daycares, many of which had only recently reopened for a limited number of students. For the past nine weeks, educational activities in the city have been almost entirely suspended due to the ongoing security situation. Ben-Shlush revealed that about 120 children had been enrolled in the kindergarten that was struck and noted that they had left the premises only about 35 minutes before the rocket hit, at 3:45 p.m. 'It’s a miracle. You can see the hole in the fence,' he said, pointing to the damage caused by the rocket. Ben-Shlush argued that the incident reinforced his belief that fully resuming the education system should be avoided and done 'patiently' and gradually, even if the Home Front Command does not impose restrictions. 'I will act according to my instincts for the safety and security of Acre’s children,' he vowed. The mayor also criticized the government’s handling of the situation. 'The education minister visited the city today and toured with me. I told him again that many educational institutions still lack safe zones,' Ben-Shlush said. 'I described the reality of dozens of schools without protected areas that I cannot safely reopen. Even if the children return, they will fear coming to schools because of the lack of shelter. The older schools are like cardboard. We’ve had a few miracles already, and this was another one. I’m calling on the Israeli government to help us—don’t forsake us.' The barrage was fired immediately after Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem delivered a speech in which he declared that the terrorist organization would continue attacking Israel until a cease-fire agreement is reached. He threatened to target Tel Aviv and central Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Beirut, which have significantly escalated in recent days amid ongoing negotiations. 'We will not leave the capital under fire from the Israeli enemy. When Beirut is under attack by the enemy, the response must target the center of Tel Aviv,' he said, seemingly referring to Tel Aviv as Israel’s capital. 'The enemy must understand that things will not remain as they are when it attacks Beirut.' In his remarks, Qassem addressed the negotiation efforts with Israel, stating that Hezbollah has submitted its comments on the American-brokered proposal and is now awaiting Israel's response. 'The success of the negotiations depends on the Israeli response and Netanyahu's seriousness,' he asserted. He outlined two conditions, which he referred to as 'limits' for the negotiations: a complete halt to what he called 'Israeli aggression' and the preservation of Lebanon's sovereignty. The latter is likely a reference to a contentious clause permitting Israeli freedom of action in response to violations of the agreement. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday evening after visiting Beirut, where he received Hezbollah’s response to an American-brokered cease-fire proposal. Hochstein described the negotiations as having made 'positive progress' and is set to meet shortly with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Talks will continue Thursday, with Israel’s Security Cabinet convening in the evening for a briefing on the developments. Senior diplomats said an agreement is 'closer than ever,' with 90-95% of the details finalized, but warned that 'the devil is in the details.' They noted that sensitive issues, including the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, remain unresolved. 'There appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, but key decisions must still be made,' one diplomat said. The proposed monitoring framework would involve significant roles for the U.S., France and Britain, aimed at bolstering the Lebanese Armed Forces through arms and advisory support. Military cooperation from Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates is also expected to play a role in strengthening Lebanon’s military capabilities. Meanwhile, the IDF continues its operations in Lebanon, with the military reporting significant strikes against Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure. On Wednesday, the IDF announced that Israeli Air Force fighter jets had killed Hezbollah’s operations commander and the commander of its anti-tank missile array in a strike on Sunday. According to the military, the two were responsible for multiple attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, including anti-tank missile strikes on the Western Galilee and central Israel. The IDF said that their elimination deals a significant blow to Hezbollah’s operational capabilities. In southern Lebanon, IDF forces uncovered ammunition depots and seized caches of weapons and equipment during ongoing ground operations. Over the past 24 hours, the Air Force struck more than 100 Hezbollah targets, including rocket launchers, weapons warehouses, command centers and operational buildings, the IDF said.

Erlich, a 71-year-old Israeli historian and geographer, was killed Wednesday by Hezbollah gunfire while accompanying Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. The incident, described by the military as 'serious and unusual,' occurred around 3 p.m. in an operational zone roughly 5-6 kilometers from the border, overlooking Tyre and Lebanon’s southern coastal plain. The IDF said Erlich, a civilian armed with a personal weapon and wearing military attire and protective gear, was present in the area alongside Col. Yoav Yarom, chief of staff of the Golani Brigade. Yarom, a veteran who lost a leg in combat in Lebanon years earlier, was visiting a site where an Israeli soldier had been killed earlier in the week. The area has been under IDF operational control since. The pair began surveying an ancient fortress near a mosque situated on a high ridge when two Hezbollah operatives, who had reportedly been hiding in the sector for days, opened fire at close range, fatally striking Erlich. The IDF said the circumstances of his presence in the area are under investigation, including whether he was there for archaeological purposes or part of an operational mission. Preliminary findings indicate that Erlich’s entry into the area violated operational orders. The military is also probing reports suggesting that this was not his first time accompanying IDF officers into southern Lebanon in recent weeks.

Man, suffering from advanced liver condition, claims enduring beatings, death threats and antisemitic harassment in prison; 'They tell him all Jews must be killed; I’m afraid he won’t survive this,' wife says An Israeli man arrested in Greece last month on a German extradition warrant has reported severe abuse by Muslim inmates while awaiting a court decision. His wife claims he has been targeted for being Jewish, enduring beatings, death threats and antisemitic harassment in prison. 'They tell him all Jews must be killed, and he’s in terrible fear,' she said. 'I fear for his life. He calls me crying every day, saying he’s being beaten and threatened. He is terrified and can’t sleep.' She added that her husband hasn’t eaten because authorities won’t allow him kosher food. 'My husband is sick, with 75% disability, and I’m afraid he won’t survive this,' she added. 'The Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Greece are not helping at all. They haven’t even visited him — I haven’t received a single phone call. We’re so disappointed in Israel for not offering help. 'He won’t survive there. He’s begging to be released, saying they hate Jews. There is severe antisemitism there.' The couple has three children, who have not been attending school since the incident. 'We’re in a financial and emotional crisis,' she said. The 42-year-old man from Rehovot, who suffers from advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, was arrested in October while vacationing on the Greek island of Rhodes. Germany has accused him of participating in a €300,000 fraud scheme, a charge that could carry a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence if convicted. Initially hospitalized due to his health condition, the man was briefly granted bail but was returned to custody after collapsing in court. He is currently detained in Athens, awaiting an appeal on the extradition decision. The man’s attorney, Mordechai Tzivin, wrote to the Foreign Ministry urging immediate intervention, citing his client’s critical health and the alleged mistreatment by Muslim inmates. 'He is being harassed, denied food and constantly threatened,' Tzivin said. 'He is so desperate he has expressed suicidal thoughts to his wife.' The Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on the case.

Devil’s in the details': Lebanon cease-fire agreement near, dipl...	Sources say '90-95%' of agreement finalized but key details, including monitoring mechanism, unresolved; Hezbollah chief confirms terror group submitted response to US proposal, warning deal hinges on Israel halting 'aggression' and respecting Lebanon’s sovereignty U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday evening after visiting Beirut, where he received Hezbollah’s response to an American-brokered cease-fire proposal. Hochstein described the negotiations as having made 'positive progress' and is set to meet shortly with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Talks will continue Thursday, with Israel’s Security Cabinet convening in the evening for a briefing on the developments. Senior diplomats said an agreement is 'closer than ever,' with 90-95% of the details finalized, but warned that 'the devil is in the details.' They noted that sensitive issues, including the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, remain unresolved. 'There appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, but key decisions must still be made,' one diplomat said. The proposed monitoring framework would involve significant roles for the U.S., France and Britain, aimed at bolstering the Lebanese Armed Forces through arms and advisory support. Military cooperation from Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates is also expected to play a role in strengthening Lebanon’s military capabilities. Hezbollah’s newly appointed leader, Naim Qassem, who assumed the role last month following the assassinations of Hassan Nasrallah and his original successor-designate Hashem Safieddine, delivered a speech Wednesday afternoon addressing ongoing negotiations with Israel. Amid threats issued during his remarks, Qassem confirmed that Hezbollah had submitted its comments on the U.S.-brokered proposal and is now awaiting Israel’s response. 'The success of the negotiations depends on Israel’s response and Netanyahu’s seriousness,' Qassem said. He emphasized two key conditions, which he referred to as the 'red lines' for the talks: a complete halt to what he called 'Israeli aggression' and the preservation of Lebanon’s sovereignty—likely referencing disputes over Israel’s demand for freedom of action in the event of violations of the agreement.

According to officials, decisions on key issues, including a monitoring mechanism, are pending. While there appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, disputes remain. The agreement is expected to involve significant U.S., French and British support for Lebanon’s military, including arms and advisory aid, as well as contributions from the armed forces of Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rklaxqjg1x	2024-11-20T07:57:31-08:00	
5th grader left outside shelter amid Hezbollah rocket attack in c...	Kfar Saba grade school student left crying and frightened outside shelter during rocket sirens after staff refused to reopen door; child was in the bathroom when the alert sounded and unable to reach shelter in time; Education Ministry: 'serious lapse in judgment' A 5th-grade student at Yitzhak Sadeh Elementary School in the central city of Kfar Saba was left outside a shelter during a Hezbollah rocket attack on Tuesday, sparking outrage from parents and prompting an apology from the Education Ministry According to parents, the student was delayed in reaching the shelter because he was in the bathroom when the sirens sounded. By the time he arrived, the door had already been closed. Educational staff reportedly refused to reopen it, citing safety procedures meant to protect those already inside in the event of a direct hit. The child was instructed to lie on the ground and cover his head as his classmates pleaded for him to be let in. 'His friends begged for him, but he was left crying outside the shelter,' parents said. 'The child is traumatized, and so are his friends and us.' A mother of another student at the school called the decision 'a terrible blunder,' questioning the protocols used. 'They claimed these are the procedures, but who set them? The child was just a minute late—he was right by the shelter. How can you leave him outside?' she said. The Education Ministry condemned the handling of the incident, calling it a 'serious lapse in judgment.' In a statement, the ministry emphasized that no child should ever be left out of a shelter during an emergency. 'We will review the incident and immediately refresh emergency procedures to ensure this does not happen again,' the statement read. Parents expressed ongoing concern over the incident, with one mother saying she now feels anxious about sending her daughter to school. 'These are little kids. They’re already dealing with daily anxiety from everything going on, and now this? If it were their child, would they leave them outside?'

US vetoes UN Security Council cease-fire resolution on Gaza	Washington rejects truce without release of hostages, including 7 Americans, emphasizing, 'Hamas, not Israel, obstructing deal'; Israeli envoy praises move, condemning resolution as enabling terrorism and reaffirming Israel’s stance against cease-fire without hostage release The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza without conditions, including the release of hostages held by Hamas. The resolution was supported by 14 council members, leaving the U.S. as the sole opponent. The U.S. representative cited the ongoing captivity of seven American citizens among the hostages held by Hamas. 'Hamas, not Israel, is obstructing a deal that could include a temporary cease-fire,' the envoy said. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon praised the U.S. for its stance, reiterating that no cease-fire would occur without the release of hostages. 'Today, we prevented a disgraceful attempt by the UN to abandon our captives. Thanks to the U.S., we upheld the critical principle: the hostages must be freed. We will continue fighting until all of them are home,' Danon said. Danon also criticized the 14 council members who supported the resolution, accusing them of enabling terrorism. 'You have reached a new low. You failed to uphold justice and peace, abandoning your basic responsibility to those who need you most. This resolution supported Hamas' terror,' he said. The vote came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz visited the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza. Netanyahu vowed that 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza' and urged Gaza residents to help locate hostages, offering a $5 million reward for information leading to their recovery. A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the vote, said the U.S. would only support a resolution that explicitly calls for the immediate release of hostages as part of a cease-fire. 'As we stated many times before, we just can't support an unconditional cease-fire that does not call for the immediate release of hostages,' the official said.

US vetoes UN Security Council resolution on Gaza cease-fire	The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for a cease-fire in Israel's war in Gaza, accusing council members of cynically rejecting attempts at reaching a compromise. The 15-member council voted on a resolution put forward by its 10 non-permanent members in a meeting that called for an 'immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' and separately demanded the release of hostages. Only the U.S. voted against, using its veto as a permanent council member to block the resolution. A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the vote, said the U.S. would only support a resolution that explicitly calls for the immediate release of hostages as part of a cease-fire.

US envoy heads to Israel as Lebanon talks show promise, but chall...	Following progress in Beirut talks, Amos Hochstein set to arrive in Israel overnight; Jerusalem officials express cautious optimism but acknowledge remaining gaps, particularly over monitoring mechanism White House special envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been in Beirut for several days mediating talks between Israel and Hezbollah, is expected to arrive in Israel overnight Thursday to present Lebanon and Hezbollah’s responses to a proposed U.S.-drafted de-escalation agreement. Following his meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is leading the talks on Hezbollah’s behalf, Hochstein described the talks as 'very constructive and very helpful' and said that the parties 'have continued to narrow the gaps.' Israeli officials believe Hochstein will push Lebanon to compromise on key issues, particularly regarding the mechanism for monitoring the enforcement of the agreement. Lebanon reportedly opposes the inclusion of Britain and Germany in the deal, preferring Arab nations such as Egypt and Jordan, while Israel insists on a framework led by a U.S. CENTCOM general. Lebanese and Arab media, including outlets affiliated with Hezbollah, widely covered the ongoing negotiations. While most reported significant progress, they acknowledged unresolved issues. Sky News Arabia cited sources close to Berri who claimed that 'nearly 80% of the cease-fire agreement has been finalized.' The pro-Hezbollah newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that there is 'understanding on all draft clauses,' but noted that discussions now focus on border-related issues, which remain shrouded in secrecy. Israel is cautiously optimistic ahead of Hochstein’s upcoming meetings in Israel on Thursday. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Israel Katz visited a military intelligence base in central Israel, emphasizing that 'the prerequisite for any political agreement in Lebanon is preserving intelligence capabilities and ensuring the IDF's right to operate and defend Israeli citizens against Hezbollah.' This point—freedom of operation—has been a significant sticking point during the negotiations. Mahmoud Kamati, deputy head of Hezbollah's political council, said that any cease-fire agreement 'must end the war quickly' while preserving Lebanon’s sovereignty. In an interview with Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar TV, Kamati said he was 'neither very optimistic nor very pessimistic' about the prospects for an agreement. Similarly, senior Hezbollah official Hassan Fadlallah told Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed TV, 'No one in Lebanon accepts a breach of its sovereignty or granting freedom of movement to the enemy. The war will not end on the enemy’s terms.' The draft agreement reportedly includes a 60-day cease-fire trial period during which Hezbollah would withdraw beyond the Litani River, leaving only the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon. If the cease-fire holds, the IDF would then withdraw from southern Lebanon. Despite broad agreement on many clauses, two key issues remain unresolved: the IDF’s freedom of operation and the composition of the monitoring committee overseeing the implementation of UN Resolution 1701. According to Lebanese sources cited by Sky News Arabia, a revised clause was agreed upon during Hochstein's visit to Beirut, stating that 'each side has the right to self-defense if attacked, provided that the U.S. ensures Israel does not conduct preemptive strikes.' If the parties reach an agreement, Washington is expected to announce the start of the cease-fire, marking the beginning of the implementation phase. This would test whether Hezbollah retreats beyond the Litani and if the Lebanese Army takes over southern Lebanon. During this period, the IDF will remain in the south of the country, though adjustments to its operational deployment are expected. Ultimately, the plan envisions only the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL forces remaining in southern Lebanon. The cease-fire announcement may also involve French participation, acting as a guarantor for Lebanon. In 2006, a similar cease-fire agreement was reached, but its enforcement mechanism collapsed on the ground. This time, however, a more robust mechanism involving the UK, Germany, France and others has been devised. Israel has retained the right, under the agreement, to enforce the cease-fire and maintain operational freedom if violations occur.

Bitcoin rises above $94,000 for the first time	Bitcoin rose to a record high above $94,000 as a report that Donald Trump's social media company was in talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt boosted expectations of a crypto-friendly regime under his incoming administration. Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has more than doubled this year. It was last at $93,521 on Wednesday, having hit a high of $94,078 in early Asian trading hours. The Financial Times said Trump Media and Technology Group , which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, which is backed by NYSE-owner Intercontinental Exchange. 'Trump's seeming interest to push further into crypto on a personal level has contributed to optimism that crypto will be a top priority when Trump takes office,' said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive officer of crypto trading firm FRNT Financial. Cryptocurrencies have soared since the Nov. 5 U.S. election as traders bet President-elect Trump's promised support for digital assets would lead to a less restrictive regulatory regime.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1n0tusgkg	2024-11-20T04:02:58-08:00

Paying the ultimate price: 800 IDF soldiers have fallen since Oct...	The war's relentless toll on Israel echoes through its fallen troops, with 800 soldiers killed since Hamas' surprise attack, marking a loss unseen since the Yom Kippur War; These are the numbers behind Israel's staggering losses Since the unexpected assault by Hamas on October 7, 2023, the toll on IDF has been profound, with 800 soldiers giving their lives to protect the nation. Among them, 757 men and 43 women have fallen, including 28 during the ongoing operation in the northern Gaza Strip, especially around Jabaliya. This staggering loss is something Israel and IDF have not confronted in over 51 years, not since the Yom Kippur War. Valiant troops have fallen every single month since the start of the war. October 2023 stands out as the bloodiest month, with 342 casualties, most of whom died on that horrific Saturday, saving countless lives and preventing Hamas terrorists from advancing deeper into Israel. In the months that followed, as the IDF has engaged in ground maneuvers in the Gaza Strip and later in Lebanon, there have been notable military achievements that will be discussed for years to come, but the cost is heavy. In December alone, 110 soldiers were killed. This October, marking a year of war, was dubbed 'Black October,' with 62 soldiers falling in combat. The current conflict is being waged on multiple fronts: The southern front since October 26, 2023, the northern front where ground maneuvers began on September 30, 2024, and ongoing security fronts, primarily in the West Bank. In the Gaza Strip, 375 soldiers, including one female soldier, have fallen since operations began, 44 in Lebanon, and 11 in the West Bank. There have also been losses on the northern front, primarily due to drone and missile attacks launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon. In this war, 272 reserve soldiers have fallen in battle. Much has been said about the mobilization of the reserves, a scale unseen since the establishment of the state. Many understood the significance of the moment on the morning of October 7 and reported for duty – many without having received call-up orders, and some beyond the age of exemption – leaving behind families, children, jobs and businesses, and paying — and still paying — an unbearable emotional and familial price. Additionally, 143 career soldiers have fallen. The rest are conscripted troops, young people under 22 who hadn't yet begun their lives, with dreams, plans and aspirations abruptly cut short. The fallen have left behind 181 widows, most of whom are mothers, including 27 women who were pregnant when their partners died. The grim statistics include 44 families suffering multiple losses, who have faced the dreadful knock on their door more than once, including siblings who became bereaved parents, bereaved fathers who are also bereaved uncles, grandparents who buried more than one grandchild, and other heart-wrenching cases. Furthermore, the 'Left Behind a Friend' organization reported that there are 327 bereaved partners since the war began. IDF commanders have been leading from the front since the fighting started, guiding soldiers to operational achievements across all fronts. When the ethos of 'Follow Me' becomes a reality, the human cost is significant. About a quarter of all casualties are officers. In the current war, the IDF has lost 69 platoon leaders, 20 deputy company commanders, 63 company commanders, seven deputy battalion commanders, five battalion commanders, and four brigade commanders. The IDF website has published the dates of death for all the soldiers, except for four – Sergeant Ron Sherman, Corporal Nick Beiser, Corporal Noa Marciano, and Master Sergeant Ori Danino. Sherman and Beiser, who were documented as being kidnapped alive, were killed in Gaza alongside Elia Toledano. Their bodies were rescued and returned by the IDF. Two months ago, the IDF determined that it is highly probable the three were killed as a 'byproduct of an IDF airstrike during the elimination of senior Hamas member Ahmed Randor on November 10, 2023.' The IDF also retrieved the body of lookout Noa Marciano, who was murdered in captivity at al-Shifa Hospital by Hamas terrorists. Danino went to enjoy the Nova Festival. He was kidnapped to Gaza and murdered in Hamas captivity along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alex Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Carmel Gat. The IDF discovered their bodies in late August.

On Sunday, the Israeli Air Force eliminated the commanders of Hezbollah’s anti-tank missile and operations unit in the coastal sector, the IDF spokesman announced on Wednesday.

The elimination of these commanders further degrade Hezbollah’s ability to carry out terror attacks from southern Lebanon against Israeli civilians. Additionally, IDF troops are continuing limited, localized, targeted raids in southern Lebanon to remove threats to Israeli civilians. The forces located weapons storage facilities and struck terrorist command centers and sites during joint ground and aerial activity.

IDF reservist Roi Sasson fell in Jabaliya, 2nd soldier seriously ...	Terrorists ambushed a building in the northern Gaza Strip, and the 21-year-old reservist was killed; His mother recalls their last conversation: 'I told him, get out of there. The day he entered Gaza, my heart fell'; 800 IDF soldiers have died since the start of the war Sergeant First Class (res.) Roi Sasson, 21, from Mevaseret Zion, a solder in the Nachshon Battalion of the Kfir Brigade fell Tuesday in an encounter with terrorists in Jabaliya, the IDF announced on Wednesday morning. In the same incident, the commander of the Nachshon Battalion, Kfir Brigade, Lt. Col. Yoel Glickman, was seriously injured, though his life is not in danger. Since the outbreak of the war, 800 IDF soldiers have died in battles, 28 of them in the current operation in Jabaliya. A preliminary investigation of the encounter reveals that the force under Glickman's command was ambushed by a terrorist squad that was waiting inside a building, and came at the end of the battalion's attack on a target in the seam between Beit Lahia and Jabaliya. 'Yesterday evening I was informed, it was the hardest thing I ever had to hear and experience in my life from the moment my son entered Gaza, and he has been a soldier for three years. That's four months of reserve that they added to the three years,' Osnat Gal, Roi's mother told Ynet. 'He was a class commander, in Lebanon he replaced a soldier who had to leave for medical reasons. There was no manpower. He was in charge of many soldiers, and fulfilled the position with distinction.' 'Then he moved to the West Bank and he was there in several places. The last place was Nablus. As soon as he told me he entered Gaza, my heart fell. I accompanied him to the entrance to Gaza on November 1. He entered happy, said he was privileged to contribute to the country and be there for those who need him. We spoke for the last time on Saturday, after a few very difficult days. I told him, 'If you can get out, please get out.' He didn't worry, he was happy to be there and felt that he was doing something, that he was contributing.' She added that Roi 'was a boy who, even if he was uncomfortable, would do things for others first. From the Scouts when he was a guide, to when he helped injured people. He was always giving. I lost the most precious thing in the world. He was a handsome boy, with green eyes .A boy with values. A true gentleman. Took care of others. He called his grandmother every Shabbat evening to ask how she is.' She said that Roi was expected to leave Gaza on Thursday, and to be released in three weeks. 'He went with dedication. He finished the regular service and then went to four months of reserve, which he did not survive. He loved his family, friends and fellow soldiers, and most of all he loved the country. I asked him to leave already, I couldn't handle all the 'permission to publish' notices of fallen soldiers , but my daughters told me that he was looking for another place to serve, even in other divisions, he was not afraid. He wanted to fight for his country. The 800th fallen, I'm sure it has meaning. I understood that they saw a terrorist in the house in Jabaliya, and proceeded to clear the area. I understood that he was shot and killed on the spot,' she said. On Sunday, the Nachshon Battalion lost two more soldiers who fell in the battle in Jabaliya, Captain Yogev Pazy and Staff sergeant Noam Eitan. A day before, Sergeant first class (res.) Idan Kenan Cohen from the battalion also fell in battle. Glickman, who was seriously injured in the encounter with the terrorists, was appointed to the position of battalion commander this year. When the war broke out on October 7, he was sent to the Gaza border area where he fought for many days in the kibbutzim, including Be'eri. Ten days later, his daughter was born. A day before he was seriously injured, Glickman recorded from the combat zone a eulogy for Pazy to be played at his funeral. 'We are continuing the mission,' Glickman said in the recording. 'It was important for you to always be first in every attack. You were an unconventional commander. We are in a war for Israel's existence, no less. We will continue on your way, Pazy.'

IDF establishes new defensive positions on Lebanon border as ceas...	Official cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah remains unfinalized, so the IDF is proactively setting up new outposts near the border with Lebanon, refurbishing old military positions and forming combat units to provide visible security and support for returning residents An official cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah remains elusive, yet the IDF is proactively establishing new outposts near border communities along the Lebanese border. The military is refurbishing former outposts and preparing to station combat units within communities, ensuring returning residents feel secure with a visible military presence. In recent weeks, the IDF has dismantled concrete walls and firing positions along confrontation line roads, which had become a gray fixture of the landscape. It has also withdrawn military forces from public buildings and evacuated areas, while working with local authorities to shape a new security framework. In Shlomi, situated right on the border, where over 7,000 residents were evacuated in October 2023, the local council has recently installed permanent firing and defense positions around the community facing Lebanon, ready for any alert. Additionally, a military outpost with at least a company-sized force will secure the community. This week, the Shlomi local council plans to approve three security tenders developed in anticipation of future needs. These include establishing an extensive camera network operated by a 24/7 active center, budgeting $6.6 million for a tactical combat unit patrolling around the clock with off-road vehicles, and forming a rapid response force of 60 volunteer fighters from the community. These measures have been approved by the IDF Northern Command and the Chief of Staff, according to Gabi Naaman, head of the Shlomi Council. In recent days, senior military commanders, including brigade leaders from Golani, Kfir and the 228th Brigade, have consistently urged displaced northern residents to 'return home now' through every available media platform. These military pressures, lacking clear and coordinated statements from political leaders, are viewed by many as unauthorized interference and a detriment to the war objectives expected in the north. Naaman also sought to temper the enthusiastic calls for residents to return home, emphasizing essential conditions: 'For us to return home, several critical things must happen,' he told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'One is for IDF to position itself north of Shlomi, on the mountain and into the Lebanese side, to prevent any certain infiltration. We also expect soldiers to be visibly present in front of us and within Shlomi itself, not behind us. The third requirement is completing the installation of defensive technological means to create a sense of security and visibility.' Amid frantic U.S.-pressured talks to reach a settlement to end the war in Lebanon, Naaman expressed hope that the government will prioritize national interests over global ones. 'We do not trust fabricated agreements, so the IDF must maintain a security zone for at least the coming years to ensure Hezbollah does not plan another attack on northern communities. These are the minimum conditions. It's important that the IDF remains assertive and does everything to empower politicians to negotiate the best possible agreement. I trust the prime minister more than anyone else,' he said. Naaman said the IDF should drive the required strategic change, not politicians. 'The IDF is our strength and, unfortunately, also our weakness. If we end the war like a month ago, Hezbollah will only grow stronger. We don't want to beg for an agreement; we want them to be the ones begging for it,' he said. On Tuesday, Naaman, along with other local authority heads from the confrontation line, met with the new minister Ze'ev Elkin, responsible for the northern and southern administrations. Authorities have high hopes that he will succeed in rallying all government ministries to the challenge of developing the area. Naaman announced before the meeting his intention to urge Elkin to create certainty for over 60,000 northern evacuees. 'I will ask him to promote a government decision to extend the stay outside the community, as well as the benefits for residents, not just until the end of December but beyond, to provide calm for residents and ensure their return is gradual, not rushed or under distress as the evacuation was. All this, of course, on the condition the IDF provides absolute security, achieving the main objective of the war in the north and not a moment before.' Keeping a visible contact line whether an agreement is reached this week or postponed, IDF troops continue daily operations beyond the border to expose more areas and 'clean' the buffer zone, previously tangled and concealed from the army's view. In the western sector, engineering forces and the 146th Division fighters lead the 'plowing' efforts on the ground. The military warns that without daily maintenance of this line – from the sea at Rosh Hanikra to Mount Dov – to ensure it remains clear, or without physically remaining there, it will be challenging to guarantee security for residents along the border line. Already now, after heavy rains, vegetation is growing again, and must be cleared. This will likely be a sticking point with Hezbollah, which will insist on withdrawing all Israeli forces beyond the border fence, potentially creating a significant obstacle in any emerging arrangement. There is concern that the Iranian-funded terrorist organization will quickly seek to cover the area again with dense, concealing foliage. Residents can no longer agree to a demand that would return the obscured view the army suffered from before October 6, 2023. Alongside targeted raids in southern Lebanon, with relatively fewer forces than those in Lebanon in recent weeks, the IDF reports that the maneuver to thwart the northern attack plan has been completed, and forces await further instructions from the political echelon. A senior military source noted that, under current conditions, residents can begin renovating damaged homes and preparing them for their return. This is based on the assumption that, following the rocket fire pushed away from the contact line with Israel, it is safer to move around evacuated communities than it was in the past year. The IDF assesses that the current rocket threat from Hezbollah is not significantly different between many evacuated communities and cities like Nahariya, Acre, or communities adjacent to Haifa such as Kiryat Motzkin, all of which are targeted daily.

France says window of opportunity open for Lebanon cease-fire	France's foreign minister said on Wednesday that U.S.-led efforts for a truce between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon had created the chance for a lasting cease-fire and he called on both sides to accept a deal on the table. 'There is a window of opportunity that's opening for a lasting ceasefire in Lebanon that would allow the return of those displaced, ensure the sovereignty of Lebanon and the security of Israel,' Jean-Noel Barrot told Europe 1 radio.

With military outposts and tacit approval from the coalition: Thi...	Analysis: After Gallant's dismissal and in view of the new US administration, Israel is working to establish facts on the ground in order to have de facto control of the strip, but without a political decision which could involve many and weighty legal consequences; This corresponds with the settlers' plans to settle in northern Gaza; 'A historic opportunity returns' Israel appears to be on its way to realizing the idea of ​​a military administration in the Gaza Strip. In view of actions on the ground, it seems that Israel has increased its activity toward implementation of the move. Netanyahu's senior coalition members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have already expressed their opinion on the matter countless times, but now things seem to be getting a push on the ground. Ynet has learned that, in the last few days, the security establishment is beginning to actively work with external companies that will handle all humanitarian aid issues in the Gaza Strip, under Israeli supervision. This is the realization on the ground of plans that previously were only on paper. In addition, the IDF has deepened its seizure of territory in the Gaza Strip, expanding the axes it holds and establishing military outposts seemingly in order to seize a wide area and apply military administration in practice in the Gaza Strip. In recent days, lively discussions have been held on the issue between the various parties, including new Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior members of the defense establishment and other senior ministers, in order to promote the policy. According to sources familiar with the details, some officials in the Southern Command are pushing from within the system for the implementation of military administration of the strip, and are creating a dialogue with the political echelon on the matter. The move comes against the backdrop of two significant changes that delayed the cabinet members to the right of Netanyahu, and have now been removed: In Israel, the replacement of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant; and in the U.S., the victory of Donald Trump in presidential elections. Sources familiar with the details say that Gallant opposed Smotrich's ideas the West Bank and Gaza, and supported the position of the security system on a variety of issues. Among other things, Gallant opposed Smotrich's position on the demolition of outposts, issuing administrative arrest warrants for extreme right-wing activists, and on the day after in the Gaza Strip. At the same time, the plans for seizing the territory as part of extracting a price from Hamas in Gaza correspond with settlers' plans to settle northern Gaza. Officials in the settlement movement claim that this is a historic period of time to change reality on the ground vis-a-vis the Palestinians, and an opportunity that will not return. The same sources claim that a decision was made to not wait for the new Trump administration to enter the White House, but to already carry out operations on the ground and build plans that will form the basis for the activities of the new administration. In this context, a senior official in the settlement movement explains that the main thing is to 'maintain the integrity of the coalition at all costs.' Although no political decision has been made regarding the day after in the Gaza Strip, the main point of which is the establishment of a military administration, the government is dealing with it and working toward its realization. Besides the economic, logistical, infrastructural and security consequences of establishing a military administration, there are also far-reaching legal consequences regarding control over millions of Palestinians and the need to treat them humanitarianly. Legal sources point to a serious lack of clarity on the question of what Israel will do with Gaza after 13 months of war. Civilian control in Gaza means that Israel will be required to provide for the needs of the population –such as humanitarian aid, electricity, communications and sanitation - and not just allow international organizations to deliver food and vaccines. In the absence of a decision by the political echelon, Israel has in recent months been forced to deal with petitions to the High Court regarding the 'occupation' of the Gaza Strip - which involves many and weighty legal consequences about the treatment of the population, and also with international proceedings such as those conducted at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Another solution that is also on the table and which is not being promoted at all is giving control of Gaza Strip to another entity in the territory, such as the Palestinian Authority. This is a solution to which Netanyahu and members of his government are strongly opposed. Alternatively, it is possible that another country will take responsibility for the strip, but most are opposed to the idea as long as Israel's fighting in Gaza continues.

Russia had been warning the West for months that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire U.S., British and French missiles deep into Russia, Moscow would consider those NATO members to be directly involved in the war in Ukraine.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b17cxbogyg	2024-11-19T21:39:16-08:00	
Extinct no more? Rare Bearded Reedling spotted in Israel after ne...	To date, Bearded Reedlings have been documented in Israel only 12 times. A rare bird, the Bearded Reedling, has been spotted by bird watcher Dov Leibowitz in the Beersheba River Park. This songbird, once thought to be extinct, is highly regarded among Israeli bird watchers as a rare and much sought-after species. Its last documented sighting in Israel was in 1995 in the Hula Valley. To date, Bearded Reedlings have been documented in Israel only 12 times, nearly all during the 1980s, making this sighting exceptionally rare.

Biden approves anti-personnel mines for Ukraine, US official says	President Joe Biden has approved provision of anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine, a U.S. official told Reuters, a step that could help slow Russian advances in its east, especially when used along with other munitions from the United States. The United States expects Ukraine to use the mines in its own territory, though it has committed not to use them in areas populated with its own civilians, the official said. The Washington Post first reported the development. The United States has provided Ukraine with anti-tank mines throughout its war with Russia, but the addition of anti-personnel mines aims at blunting the advance of Russian ground troops, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity. The U.S. mines differ from Russia's as they are 'non-persistent,' and become inert after a preset period, the official said. They require a battery to detonate, and will not explode once the battery runs out.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj1rqkom1x	2024-11-19T19:52:02-08:00

On Monday, Canada announced it had foiled a plot by the Islamic Republic of Iran to assassinate renowned human rights activist and former Canadian Attorney General and Justice Minister Irwin Cotler. Cotler is globally recognized for his critical human rights work, including advocacy on behalf of Soviet Jewry before the fall of the Soviet Union. He also served as Canada’s special envoy for combating antisemitism. According to reports, Cotler was notified in October of an imminent threat to his life within 48 hours. Canadian police have been tracking two suspects but have not confirmed if any arrests have been made. Since October 7, 2023, Cotler has been under 24/7 surveillance. He has been a target of the Islamic regime since 2008, when he lobbied to have the IRGC designated as a terrorist organization.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy6oqyofyl	2024-11-19T19:26:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/01/10/8273471/8273471_0_132_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Turkey blocks Herzog's plane from airspace, Erdogan boasts	President Isaac Herzog reportedly canceled trip to UN climate conference in Baku after Turkey barred official Wing of Zion plane from airspace Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed Tuesday that Turkey barred the Israeli presidential plane, Wing of Zion, from using its airspace en route to a UN climate conference in Azerbaijan. 'We did not allow the Israeli president to use our airspace to attend the COP summit. We suggested alternative routes and options,' Erdogan told reporters at the G20 Summit in Brazil. 'On certain matters, as Turkey, we are compelled to take a stand, and we will continue to do so,' he added. The decision follows Turkey’s withdrawal of its ambassador to Israel for consultations after the Gaza war began, though diplomatic ties remain intact, and Turkey's embassy in Tel Aviv remains operational. Erdogan also noted that Turkey has severed trade ties with Israel over the war. President Isaac Herzog had planned to attend the climate conference in Baku on Tuesday aboard the Wing of Zion, the official plane for Israel’s president and prime minister. On Saturday, Herzog’s office announced the trip’s cancellation, citing 'security reasons' following a situation assessment. Sources in Israel, however, said that the Turkish airspace ban was a contributing factor but not the primary reason for canceling the visit. Security concerns stemming from alternate flight routes due to the Russia-Ukraine war also played a role, officials said. Additionally, Herzog’s recent trip to the U.S. to meet outgoing President Joe Biden meant he would have missed key leadership discussions at the climate summit, reducing the importance of the Baku visit. Diplomatic tensions arose as Azerbaijan sought to reframe the cancellation’s narrative, expressing displeasure with Israeli media reports. While Herzog canceled, other Israeli ministers attended the conference, traveling on commercial flights through Georgia. It remains unclear why Herzog did not opt for a similar travel arrangement.

Trump opposes Israeli West Bank sovereignty move, senior Republic...	While settlers euphoric and Smotrich hails 2025 as ‘year of sovereignty,’ senior Republicans warn president-elect opposes move, fearing it could jeopardize normalization with Saudi Arabia Despite enthusiasm from the Israeli right and pro-Israel conservatives following Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president, senior Republicans say Trump opposes applying Israeli sovereignty to Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the areas of the West Bank. 'Trump will not approve annexation,' said a senior Republican senator close to the president-elect, calling such a move 'a mistake for Israel' that would worsen its international standing. The senator’s remarks follow speculation that recent Trump appointments, including Mike Huckabee as U.S. ambassador to Israel, signal support for annexation. Reports suggest Trump is concerned annexation could derail efforts to secure normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a top priority for the incoming administration. Veteran Senator Lindsey Graham is working on a deal to finalize the normalization agreement, coordinating with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, outgoing President Joe Biden and Trump himself. Sources say Graham sees bipartisan Senate approval of a U.S.-Saudi defense pact as key to achieving normalization. In Israel, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has labeled 2025 the 'year of sovereignty,' signaling annexation ambitions. However, senior Israeli political sources suggest Smotrich’s rhetoric is aimed at shoring up support among his base amid controversies over the ultra-Orthodox draft exemption law. While the settlers prepare to push annexation plans under the new U.S. administration, the likelihood of American recognition remains uncertain. Analysts say it could hinge on concessions to Palestinians as part of a broader Trump-led regional deal, raising questions about Smotrich and far-right ally Itamar Ben-Gvir’s willingness to compromise. Smotrich has expressed frustration with the outgoing Biden administration's embargo on working with him, saying, 'I look forward to working with the elected administration to strengthen economic and commercial ties.' At a faction meeting last week, he called Trump's victory 'an important opportunity for Israel,' adding, 'We were a step away from applying sovereignty, and now is the time to do it.' Smotrich reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state, citing 'broad consensus in the coalition and opposition that it would endanger Israel’s existence.'

Israel explores security partnership with US firm for Gaza aid pi...	The defense establishment is in talks with the U.S.-based security firm Orbis, led by former U.S. Army generals, to explore a potential pilot project in northern Gaza, officials said Tuesday. The proposal was discussed in a meeting convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Sources familiar with the matter said Orbis has already drafted an initial pilot plan for the region. However, the proposal faced criticism for being 'highly problematic' due to the company's lack of experience in humanitarian aid distribution, officials added. The talks come amid ongoing efforts to address security and logistical challenges in Gaza.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2hkkqfjl	2024-11-19T12:59:11-08:00

Oz, known as 'Dr. Oz', unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2022. Trump, who endorsed Oz in that race, said he would work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been nominated to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump said the pair would take on 'the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake' as well as cutting what he called waste and fraud. 'Our broken Healthcare System harms everyday Americans, and crushes our Country's budget,' Trump said in a statement. Saying Oz would be a leader in 'incentivizing disease prevention.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1tv7kqmje	2024-11-19T12:31:34-08:00

One drone was intercepted over the Western Galilee, while the others were downed before entering Israeli airspace, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b111swtqfkg	2024-11-19T12:29:07-08:00	
2 Israelis extracted from Palestinian town after being attacked, ...	Ramla residents violently attacked after entering Dayr Balut in northern West Bank; pair rescued by Palestinian police officers and then extracted by IDF, suffering mild-to-moderate injuries Two Israeli citizens from Ramla were attacked Tuesday evening after entering the Palestinian town of Dayr Balut in the northern West Bank. The pair, reportedly there for business, were assaulted by Palestinians who recognized them as Israeli. Palestinian police intervened, rescuing the Israelis and handing them over to the IDF for extraction. According to the Civil Administration, the Israeli governing body that operates in the West Bank, both sustained mild-to-moderate injuries and are under medical care. Initial reports suggested one was unconscious, but it was later confirmed that both were conscious. The IDF has launched an investigation to confirm the identities of the two Israelis and determine why they entered the town. Palestinian officials allege the incident stemmed from a financial dispute. The military has since locked down Dayr Balut to search for the attackers. In August 2023, a similar incident occurred when an Israeli man accidentally entered a Palestinian village near Ramallah. He was attacked and his car was set on fire, but other Palestinians helped rescue him and ensured his safe transfer to Israeli authorities. Dayr Balut lies within Area A of the West Bank, which is under full Palestinian Authority control and makes up 18% of the territory. The IDF has reiterated warnings against Israelis entering Area A, calling it both prohibited and dangerous.

'Turkey needed to do this,' Erdogan clarified. 'As you know, we completely severed trade ties with Israel. We also did not allow the Israeli president to use our airspace on the way to Baku. Turkey is obligated to demonstrate its position on a number of issues, and we will do so.' According to him, Herzog, who canceled the trip, had other ways to get to the conference.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjfiyoqmkl	2024-11-19T11:49:47-08:00

US ambassador-designate to Israel slams White House's 'schizophrenic' policy toward Israel; 'There’s no peace in that region until these terror groups funded by Iran are completely eliminated,' he says U.S. ambassador-designate to Israel Mike Huckabee criticized the Biden administration’s approach to Israel on Tuesday, accusing it of applying more pressure on the Jewish state than on its adversaries. 'We've put far more pressure, with Joe Biden, on Israel than we have on Hamas, Hezbollah and most importantly, the people who write those checks—the Iranians,' Huckabee told Fox News in an interview, describing the White House's policy toward Israel as 'schizophrenic.' He called for increased efforts to secure the release of American hostages held by Hamas, questioning why the administration has not applied greater pressure on the terrorist group and its backers. Huckabee dismissed calls for a cease-fire, saying that one could have been achieved immediately if Hamas ceased its attacks. 'We can have a cease-fire right now. We could have had it on October 8. Hamas lays down its arms, gives up its bombs, bullets, rockets and stops killing Jews, and lets the hostage free,' he said, emphasizing that 'breathing room' for Hamas would only prolong the war. 'They need to be suffocated and ended.' Huckabee called for the complete elimination of terror groups in the region, blaming Iran for their continued operations. 'There’s no peace in that region until these terror groups funded by Iran are completely eliminated,' he concluded.

Lebanese outlets report Avichay Adraee visited Kfarkela and Odaisseh, sparking online debate; one user accuses media of supporting him, another jokes he came to deliver evacuation warnings in person, while commenter insists he never entered IDF Arabic-language spokesman Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee posted on Tuesday a video of himself entering southern Lebanon for a tour of villages near the border, including Kfarkela and Odaisseh, sparking a heated debate among Lebanese citizens and media. Adraee, a well-known figure in the Arab world who frequently clashes with journalists and activists sympathetic to Hezbollah, said he visited 'areas Hezbollah has turned into forward military bases.' He shared a video from the tour, standing near rubble in Odaisseh, and said, 'This house was destroyed because Hezbollah used it as a terror stronghold. This is the state of many buildings in southern Lebanon and beyond. We continue to dismantle Hezbollah’s hideouts.' However, Lebanese social media users cast doubt on Adraee's claims. One user pointed out the lack of local signage in the footage, saying, 'If he really entered, he could have taken a picture next to a village sign.' Another noted smoke rising in the background, suggesting the video was filmed on the Israeli side of the border. Another user wrote: 'Avichay entered Kfarkela and Odaisseh. It seems he intends to deliver the warnings to us in person this time,' referring to evacuation warnings Adraee posts on his social media accounts to Lebanese citizens before Israeli strikes in populated areas. Lebanese media outlets reported widely on Adraee’s statements, with varying interpretations. The outlet Janoubia said Adraee aimed to deliver an 'important and clear message' in front of a destroyed home. The network LBCI cited his claims of a tour in southern Lebanon, while the newspaper An-Nahar referenced his presence in Kfarkela and Odaisseh. Another outlet, Al-Jadeed, wrote, 'Adraee from Kfarkela - Follow.' The extensive Lebanese coverage prompted criticism from some viewers, who accused the media of amplifying Adraee’s message. 'Why are they promoting Adraee? Or is it no surprise?' one user wrote, accusing outlets of inadvertently supporting his narrative.

Would Khamenei’s death bring reform or revolution to Iran?	A new leader, perhaps Khamenei’s son, could bring the illusion of reform or else spark a popular uprising; regime change, though possible, is thought to be unlikely Recent rumors surrounding Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s health have been largely dispelled, but questions persist about what will happen when the 85-year-old leader is no longer in power. The stakes are high. While many speculate on Khamenei’s successor, the broader concern centers on the nature of Iran’s impending political transition. Iranian journalist and analyst Ashkan Safaei Hakimi says there are two main scenarios: In one, a new leader attempts to mend relations with the West, likely creating only the perception of reform, and in another political instability triggers a popular uprising, potentially leading to regime change. Khamenei has served as Iran’s supreme leader for roughly three decades. Though the position is primarily spiritual, it wields immense power, with authority over major issues like foreign policy and the nuclear program. Speculation about Khamenei’s health began with an October 27 New York Times report hinting that his son, Mojtaba Khamenei, might be his successor. Over the weekend, claims surfaced that the supreme leader was in a coma. By Sunday, Iranian state media countered these rumors by publishing a photo of Khamenei meeting with Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. Dr. Liora Hendelman-Baavur, director of the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies, speculated that the rumors could be an attempt 'to instigate or stir up domestic and internal protests or demonstrations to destabilize the system from the inside.' Widespread opposition to the regime persists in Iran. The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) reported that more than 4,000 street protests have taken place across the country’s provinces over the past two years. 'This is not a flash-in-the-pan moment for Iran but a movement with an unprecedented level of support across all demographics,' wrote Jemima Shelley, a geopolitics analyst for TBI. Rumors about Khamenei’s failing health are not new. In 2006, political analyst Michael Ledeen claimed he was in a coma, with similar reports resurfacing in 2009, 2014, and 2020. In 2014, Khamenei reportedly underwent prostate surgery in Tehran, though only the procedure itself was confirmed. Prostate cancer is a common global illness. Professor Shay Golan, head of the Urologic Oncology Service at Israel’s Beilinson Hospital, noted that millions are diagnosed annually, with approximately 3,000 new cases each year in Israel and 500 deaths. Golan explained that in cases of metastatic, stage IV prostate cancer, severe complications like comas or multi-organ failure can occur. 'But that is at the end of the disease,' Golan said. 'Usually, prostate cancer grows really, really slowly, and today, we can diagnose the disease in its very early stages. If patients get diagnosed in the early stage, 90% of them can be cured of the disease.' Even in later stages, advances in treatment mean patients can 'live for years in good health and good quality of life.' However, Golan emphasized that such outcomes are primarily seen in Western countries. In low- and middle-income nations like Iran, access to advanced treatments is limited, and life expectancy in such cases may be as short as two to three years.

PM says Israeli forces 'relentless in efforts' to bring hostages home; 'Anyone who dares harm our hostages will pay with their life,' he warns and offers $5 million award to anyone who returns a captive Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday that Hamas’ rule in Gaza is over, as Israeli forces continue their campaign against the terrorist group across the Palestinian enclave. 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. We are now targeting their governing capabilities, and our mission is far from over,' Netanyahu said during a visit to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza alongside Defense Minister Israel Katz, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. The visit included a briefing from senior military officials and a discussion with reservist brigade commanders about the ongoing military campaign against Hamas. Netanyahu praised the military’s efforts in dismantling Hamas’ capabilities. 'Our forces have achieved remarkable results in eliminating Hamas’ military strength across the Gaza Strip,' he said. The prime minister reiterated Israel’s commitment to securing the release of hostages held by Hamas since the October 7 attack. 'We are relentless in our efforts to bring them home—both the living and the deceased,' he said, warning those responsible for holding the hostages: 'Anyone who dares harm our hostages will pay with their life. We will pursue you, and we will reach you.' Netanyahu also offered an incentive for cooperation, promising a $5 million reward per hostage and safe passage for anyone who aids in their release. 'The choice is yours, but the outcome will be the same: We will bring everyone back,' he said. Acknowledging the sacrifices of Israel's soldiers and their families, Netanyahu commended the resilience and dedication of reservists. 'Our soldiers and commanders are performing exceptional work. I salute our reservists and their families for their unwavering support,' he said. 'The people of Israel stand united behind you.' Katz said the government was 'committed to providing all necessary resources and making decisions that will enable our troops to complete their missions,' and praised the bravery and professionalism of Israeli forces. 'I don’t think there’s an army in the world that can point to achievements of this kind,' he added. Katz underscored that 'the most important mission is to bring the hostages home,' and echoed Netanyahu's statement about defeating Hamas and ensuring the terrorist group 'will not rule here in the future.'

Republicans for settlements: New GOP lawmakers ready to make West...	As Donald Trump prepares for return to White House, Shomron Regional Council head holds round of meetings in Congress and hears support from lawmakers advocating for Israel to apply sovereignty to West Bank West Bank settlers are preparing for President-elect Donald Trump's entry into the White House. While the heads of the settlements gathered to formulate an action plan for the president-elect's new term in office, the head of the Shomron Regional Council, Yossi Dagan, left for a visit to the United States that included meetings with senior Republicans and members of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington. The meetings were, of course, mainly concerned with the hope of applying Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, also known as Judea and Samaria. Republican House of Representatives lawmaker Claudia Tenney of New York is an ally of Dagan. 'I am a partner in the legal initiative that will guarantee the rights of Samaria and Judea and make sure that they will be recognized and not called 'the West Bank' when talking about products and other things produced in this area. I am a strong supporter of Israel. We are very excited to cooperate with you, and we will be happy to return to Samaria in the future,' she said. Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska did not address the issue directly, but expressed his support for Israel. 'After the terrible attack on October 7 and what Israel had to do to defend itself, I look forward to defending your sovereignty and your security in this new administration you will find an administration that's got friendship for Israel as opposed to what happened in the past administration.' According to Maryland Rep. Andy Harris: 'When all is said and done, the two-state solution just doesn't work. It's got to be a one-state solution, with obviously Judea and Samaria in part of the State of Israel. That's the way it has to be. This is the only solution that will ensure sustainable peace.' Dagan also met with the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy, U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, and Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, who said that it is important to maintain the 'excellent relations' between the two countries. 'The relationship between the U.S. and Israel, with an emphasis on stopping the harassment and obsessive persecution against the Jewish settlement in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria,' said Dagan. 'We presented to the members of Congress with our request and demand that the U.S. government either support or not oppose and thwart sovereignty over the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria. We have partners here who have promised to be involved in this matter,' Dagan said. 'Even if the U.S. administration cannot say that it is in favor of it, and even has to say that it is opposed, it will not fight the way the Biden administration would have fought.' He also called on the prime minister and government ministers to act. 'The ball is in your court. You can apply sovereignty immediately upon the entry of the Trump administration,' he said.

Hamas attack on Israel stirs controversy among Gaza clerics	Well-known Palestinian cleric questions harm caused by Oct. 7 attack, including high civilian death toll, while local group of religious leaders asserts Hamas assault legitimate The Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war has stirred debate among the enclave's Palestinian clerics, with some saying it was not worth the heavy civilian death toll and others declaring the October 7, 2023 assault was a Muslim duty. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed on that day, and some 251 people were taken hostage into Gaza, of which 101 hostages, both dead alive, are still held captive. It was the country's bloodiest day in its history. Israel responded with a destructive offensive in Gaza. Responding to questions sent by Gazans on an online messaging platform, prominent preacher Suleiman Al-Dayya said Muslim leaders should avoid going into battles if the harm inflicted upon civilians is greater than the gains. He said warriors should question the wisdom of fighting if it increases the harm to religion, life, honor, children or wealth or the seizure of land, let alone the destruction of the 'foundations of life.' Dayya's views are well respected in Gaza among both ordinary residents and Islamists, and he also has influence with Palestinians in the West Bank. A former senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest Islamist movement in the Arab world, he was also close to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, co-founder and leader of the Palestinian terror group Hamas, before pursuing a more moderate form of Islam. 'When it becomes highly likely that the objectives and aims of jihad will not be achieved due to the absence or deficiency of its pillars, causes or conditions, it must be avoided,' said Dayya. Late on Monday, a statement issued in the name of 'a group of clerics' in Gaza defended the assault as a 'legitimate act and a fulfillment of the duty of jihad, with no doubt about its legitimacy.' 'However, was the timing of the decision a mistake in judgment, as it led to this destructive war afterward, or was it appropriate due to specific circumstances known to the fighters, for example? This is a matter open to consideration,' the statement said. 'But such consideration and placing of blame are not appropriate during the war; they should come afterward, as it serves no purpose now and rather harms,' it added. In their statement, the clerics' group said they appreciated Dayya's opinion and religious status but they cautioned his verdict could be misunderstood and could affect the spirit of ordinary Palestinians as well as fighters. Some Gazans are also questioning the wisdom of Hamas staging an attack that led to Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza, which was already struggling with widespread poverty and high unemployment before the war erupted. For Israelis and their Western allies, Hamas is a terrorist group that has fired missiles at them and staged suicide bombings. Hamas' supporters regard its fighters as heroes leading the fight for Palestinian statehood, which had drifted off the international agenda. Israel, which has assassinated several top Hamas leaders, has vowed to destroy the group.

Rockets strike Italy's UNIFIL base in Lebanon, Italy's Defense Mi...	Eight rockets hit the headquarters of the Italian contingent of the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL in Shama, in southern Lebanon, Italy's defense ministry said on Tuesday. No injuries have been reported but five Italian soldiers are being monitored in the base's medical facility, the ministry said in a statement. Italy has long been a major contributor to the UNIFIL multinational operation. Investigations are under way to determine where the rockets originated and to identify those responsible, the Italian ministry said. The rockets hit some outdoor areas and the base's supply warehouse where no soldiers were present.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryjwgs5m1l	2024-11-19T07:54:53-08:00	
Iran offers to cap sensitive uranium stock to avoid IAEA resoluti...	Iran has offered not to expand its stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, near the roughly 90% of weapons grade, and made preparations to do that, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said in confidential reports to member states on Tuesday. The offer is conditional, however, on Western powers abandoning their push for a resolution against Iran at this week's meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors over its lack of cooperation with the IAEA, diplomats said, adding that the push was continuing. During IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's trip to Iran last week, 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed', read one of the two confidential quarterly IAEA reports, both seen by Reuters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy4szsqf1g	2024-11-19T07:50:04-08:00	
US imposes sanctions on senior Hamas officials	The U.S. on Tuesday imposed sanctions on six senior Hamas officials, the U.S. Treasury Department said, in further action against the Palestinian militant group as Washington has sought to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza. The Treasury Department said in a statement the sanctions targeted the group's representatives abroad, a senior member of the Hamas military wing and those involved in supporting fundraising efforts for the group and weapons smuggling into Gaza. 'Hamas continues to rely on key officials who seemingly maintain legitimate, public-facing roles within the group, yet who facilitate their terrorist activities, represent their interests abroad, and coordinate the transfer of money and goods into Gaza,' Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. 'Treasury remains committed to disrupting Hamas' efforts to secure additional revenue and holding those who facilitate the group's terrorist activities to account.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1iobs5mjl	2024-11-19T07:49:28-08:00	
Water is more precious than gold here': Turkey's strikes on Syri...	Report sheds light on dire consequences of Ankara's bombing campaign against Kurdish forces in Syria, leaving residents relying on water deliveries; Kurdish leaders accuse Turkey of attempted 'genocide' while legal experts suggest strikes may constitute war crime Turkey’s extensive airstrikes on Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria have disrupted the water supply to over a million residents in the region, a BBC investigation published Tuesday revealed. Experts cited in the report suggested the attacks may constitute a violation of international law. For years, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led bombing campaigns and ground invasions across the border targeting Kurdish forces, which Ankara accuses of ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK, which seeks Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, is classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S., the European Union and the UK. The Kurdish YPG militia, a key component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that governs this area—informally known as 'Syrian Kurdistan'—helped defeat ISIS during the last decade. However, Erdogan has consistently labeled the YPG as an extension of the PKK. The recent escalation follows a PKK-claimed attack on a military facility in Ankara last month. In retaliation, Turkey launched a wide-scale bombing campaign against Kurdish targets in Syria, though the YPG denied any involvement in the attack. According to the BBC investigation, accompanied by a full-length documentary, Turkey has conducted over 100 attacks on Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria between October 2019 and January 2024. These strikes targeted oil and gas facilities and power stations vital to civilians in the region. According to the report, the attacks have worsened an already dire humanitarian situation, exacerbated by years of brutal civil war and four years of extreme drought linked to climate change. The crisis escalated further in October 2023, when Turkish strikes on power infrastructure cut electricity to the region’s primary water station, rendering it inoperable. The BBC team visited the region twice and reported that residents in Hasakah province, home to around one million people, are now relying on water deliveries from sources 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Hundreds of water tankers are dispatched daily, but supply shortages force authorities to prioritize hospitals, schools and orphanages, leaving many residents without access. During one visit to Hasakah, BBC reporters observed residents queuing desperately for water and pleading with tanker drivers for supplies. 'Water is more precious than gold here,' said Ahmed al-Ahmed, a water tanker driver. 'People need more water. All they want is for you to give them water.' The report described fighting breaking out among residents waiting in line, with one woman threatening to puncture a tanker’s tires if it didn’t deliver water to her. Yahya Ahmed, co-director of the city water board, described the situation as a 'humanitarian catastrophe.' The autonomous Kurdish administration in northeastern Syria has accused Turkey of attempting to 'destroy our people’s existence' in the region. Following a new wave of Turkish airstrikes last month, Kurdish officials claimed that Ankara targeted not only military positions but also civilian infrastructure, such as power stations. 'The main goal is to weaken the Kurdish autonomous administration and force the population to flee,' said SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi. In an interview with AFP, Abdi also accused Turkey of exploiting the global focus on the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as tensions with Iran, to escalate attacks against the Kurds. Abdi criticized the U.S.-led coalition, calling its response to the strikes 'weak' and insufficient to halt the assaults. 'Pressure must be applied on Turkey,' he said. The Kurds remain a key partner in the U.S.-led coalition, which maintains around 900 American troops in Syria to combat jihadist terrorist groups. In a statement to the BBC, Turkey claimed its airstrikes target the 'sources of income and capabilities' of Kurdish separatist groups it regards as terrorists. The Turkish government denied hitting civilian infrastructure and blamed the worsening humanitarian crisis in northeastern Syria on climate change, as well as poor water management by local Kurdish authorities and neglected infrastructure. Turkey also insisted it 'fully respects international law' and said that 'Civilians or civilian infrastructure were not among our targets and have never been' a target. However, the BBC highlighted a 2022 remark by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who said that any 'infrastructure, superstructure and energy facilities' used by the PKK or YPG in Syria and Iraq are 'legitimate targets' for Ankara. In February, the UN accused Turkey of potentially committing a war crime during its October 2023 strikes on Kurdish power infrastructure, which disrupted access to water for civilians. Legal experts familiar with the BBC investigation echoed these concerns. '[T]he indications that international law was violated here are so strong that they should be investigated by a prosecutorial authority,' said Patrick Kroker, an international criminal law expert.

IDF reservist killed by Hezbollah drone strike in southern Lebano...	Sergeant First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, soldier from Golani Brigade's 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion, from Jerusalem, killed during operational approximately 2 kilometers from border; 3 other soldiers seriously wounded in attack The IDF reported that Sergeant First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, a soldier from the Golani Brigade's 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion, from Jerusalem, was killed Tuesday morning when a Hezbollah explosive drone struck an IDF unit operating in southern Lebanon. Gaeldor is survived by his wife, Adi, and their two young children, 3-year-old Neta and 8-month-old Aluma. Three other soldiers were seriously wounded in the attack and were airlifted to an Israeli hospital. Their families have been notified. The strike occurred approximately two kilometers from the border while the troops were securing operations deeper into southern Lebanon. The IDF said that Hezbollah has intensified its efforts to target Israeli forces in southern Lebanon with rockets, mortars and drones. The military is working to provide early warnings, intercept threats and disrupt such attacks. Gaeldor, formerly a resident of Neve Tzuf in the West Bank, was eulogized by Benjamin Regional Council head Yisrael Ganz. 'Today, we bear a heavy price and mourn the loss of a hero who gave his life to protect the people of Israel. The state will continue to strike its enemies until full victory is achieved. We embrace his wife, Adi, and the entire family,' Ganz said. In Gaza, the military reported Sunday the deaths of Capt. Yogev Pazy, 22, a platoon commander in the Kfir Brigade’s 90th Battalion, from Giv’ot Bar, and Staff Sgt. Noam Eitan, 21, a fighter in the same battalion, from Hadera. The soldiers were killed during a clash with terrorists in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. Another soldier was seriously injured, and his family has been notified. Pazy was the nephew of Knesset member Gadi Eisenkot, whose family has also suffered additional losses in the war, including his son, Master Sgt. (res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot, and nephew, Sgt. Maor Cohen Eisenkot. 'The heart aches for these two heroes who fell in Gaza today,' said National Unity Party leader Benny Gantz. 'Our thoughts are with Hanan, Gadi and the Pazy family during this painful time.'

The course description also discussed 'the US-backed and -funded genocide being carried out against Indigenous Palestinians by the Israeli Occupying Force.' UC Berkeley stated that 'this is a course designed by graduate students. The content of the course, including the syllabus, has not been approved by the responsible lecturer, the head of the department, the department or the academy's management. The course description was published without sufficient review and was removed from the campus websites pending the end of a strict academic review.

Lavrov said he hoped Moscow's new nuclear doctrine, in which President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike, would be attentively read.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1z7cmqm1g	2024-11-19T05:01:34-08:00	
Response is inevitable': Putin alters Russia's nuclear doctrine ...	Ukraine launches attack into Russian territory with Western-made weapons following U.S. approval, pushing the Kremlin to consider nuclear option against fellow nuclear states Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially approved changes to his country’s nuclear doctrine, the Kremlin announced on Tuesday. Under the revised framework, Moscow now threatens a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack against Russia – if such an attack is carried out with the 'aid' of another nuclear power. This is widely interpreted as a clear warning to Western nations arming and supporting Ukraine. The Kremlin's announcement coincides with Kyiv marking 1,000 days since Russia's invasion on February 24, 2022. It's viewed as a response to U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent approval, allowing Ukraine to use American long-range missiles for strikes deep into Russian territory. Over recent months, Putin has repeatedly threatened a severe response should Biden grant such permission. In September, he warned that it would alter the scale and nature of the war in Ukraine, signaling direct involvement by NATO, the U.S. and Europe, since NATO personnel and infrastructure would necessarily be involved in guiding and launching such attacks. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that the updated nuclear doctrine aims to ensure 'potential enemies' understand that Russia’s response to any attack on itself or its allies would be 'inevitable.' He stressed that any assault by a non-nuclear state on Russia, conducted in cooperation with a nuclear state, would be considered a joint attack by both nations. 'This is a very important point,' he said during a press conference. Peskov further argued that expanding the scenarios for potential nuclear use was 'essential' given the 'current state of affairs.' However, he didn’t directly respond when asked whether this was a direct reaction to the U.S. decision to allow Kyiv to target Russian territory with U.S. weaponry — a move Ukraine had long advocated for, claiming it was fighting 'with one hand tied behind its back' without such approval. Peskov also reiterated that Moscow 'always' sought to reduce nuclear threats, considering them an 'extreme' measure meant solely for deterrence. Nonetheless, the updated nuclear doctrine effectively broadens the Kremlin’s conditions for launching a nuclear strike, providing more detailed scenarios compared to the previous framework. According to the changes, which were advanced in the weeks leading up to the U.S. elections but only now formalized, Russia could respond with a nuclear attack to a conventional assault on its territory if it involves aid from a nuclear-armed state. The new doctrine also outlines the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the event of a 'massive air strike' involving ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, fighter jets, drones and other aerial munitions. Any aggression against Russia by a nation that’s part of a coalition – presumably NATO – would now be treated as aggression by the entire coalition. The new doctrine also allows for consideration of a nuclear response to aggression against Russia’s ally, Belarus. The UK condemned Putin’s decision shortly after its announcement, saying the president’s move was the 'latest example of irresponsibility from a depraved Russian government,' according to a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. When asked about the new nuclear threat posed by Russia, Starmer told the BBC that: 'We remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine.' Meanwhile, Russia has begun serial production of mobile bomb shelters that can protect against a variety of threats including shockwaves and radiation from a nuclear blast. The emergency ministry's research institute said the 'KUB-M' shelter could offer protection for 48 hours against these and other natural and man-made hazards. Among those it listed were: explosions and shrapnel from conventional weapons; falling debris from buildings; dangerous chemicals; and fires. The 'KUB-M' looks like a reinforced shipping container and consists of two modules - a room for 54 people and a technical block. More modules can be added if needed, the institute said. It did not link the move to any current crisis, though the announcement came days after the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to allow Ukraine to fire U.S. long-range missiles deep into Russia - a decision that the Kremlin said was reckless and would draw a response from Moscow. 'The mobile shelter is a multifunctional structure that provides protection for people from various threats, including natural disasters and man-made accidents,' the research institute said, calling it 'an important step towards improving the safety of citizens'. It can easily be transported on a truck and connected to water supplies, and can also be deployed in Russia's vast northern permafrost, it added.

Hochstein says there is a real opportunity for cease-fire	U.S. envoy speaks to reporters after meeting Lebanese speaker of parliament who represent Hezbollah in talks to end the war; says decisions must now be made U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein said on Tuesday that he had held 'very constructive talks' with the speaker of Lebanon's parliament in Beirut and that there was a 'real opportunity' to bring the conflict between the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah and Israel to an end. Hochstein arrived in Beirut earlier for talks with Berri who represents Hezbollah in the negotiations and with Lebanese care-taker prime minister Najib Mukati. 'This is a moment of decision-making. I am here in Beirut to facilitate that decision but it's ultimately the decision of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. It is now within our grasp,' he told reporters after the meeting. While Hochstein was visiting, Hezbollah launched a missile at the center of Israel, wounding five people as rocket fire to the north continued all morning. The Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper said in a report on Tuesday that Hochstein's visit is the final attempt to reach a deal, but obstacles remain. According to the paper the two issued that must be resolved are Israel's 'self -defense' and the make-up of the international commission that will oversea compliance with the terms of the agreement. Lebanon says self-defense is already recognized under international law and therefore does not have to be a part of the cease-fire deal and that Israel's insistence to include it is an attempt to legitimize any future military action it would take. Lebanon therefore rejects it. Beirut also opposes the participation of the UK and Germany in the international commission overseeing compliance of the agreement, but sources told the publication that that matter could be more easily resolved. Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel in its report on Tuesday, quoted sources who said the U.S. wanted Lebanese agreement to American supervision of the Beirut International Airport and the sea ports as well as its supervision of the borders to prevent the influx of arms for Hezbollah arriving from Syria. According to the channel Hochstein was negotiation an agreement that would encompass all of Lebanon and not only the south.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1d5px5fjx	2024-11-19T02:45:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/Syd0mxczJl/Syd0mxczJl_0_152_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israel proposes sanction relief for Assad, to stop flow of arms t...	Lebanese paper says Strategic Affairs Minister raises possible lifting of sanctions from Russian and Syrian companies after meetings in Moscow Israel proposed that some U.S. sanctions should be lifted from Syrian President Bashar Assad in exchange for his involvement in preventing the flow of arms to Hezbollah across the Syrian border with Lebanon, the Lebanese daily Al Jounhouria reported on Tuesday. According to the paper, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer raised the possibility of sanction relief to ensure Russian involvement in the effort to block the smuggling of arms from Syrian territory into neighboring Lebanon and block what has been termed the 'Iranian highway,' connecting the Dahieh in Beirut to Iran via Syria and Iraq. Dermer committed to request the Biden administration to freeze sanctions on Assad as well as Russian and Syrian companies. The idea was discussed during the first Trump term and may have come up now after his reelection. Dermer was in Moscow earlier in the month on a secret visit to try and promote the matter. Israeli officials said there was an understanding that Russia can influence Hezbollah, Syria and Iran and that Moscow was hoping for a cease-fire in the war in Lebanon. The Wall Street Journal reported in an article on Tuesday that Russian-made weapons were found in by troops in Hezbollah's weapons stores in South Lebanon and that new, even recently produced weapons made in Russia were transferred through Syria recently and replace old Soviet-era armaments.

Russian-made weapons found in Hezbollah arsenal, report	Anti-tank missiles produced as recently as 2020, among stocks found by troops in South Lebanon delivered via Syria, raising concerns of deepening Moscow-Tehran cooperation; 70% of seized Hezbollah weapons are Russian made The IDF found Russian-made weapons in Hezbollah stores in South Lebanon, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday. Among the weapons made in Russia were anti-tank missiles sent in recent years to Lebanon via Syria which had been receiving Russian weapons for years. Israel had not been able to confirm the flow of Russian-made weapons to the Iran-backed terror group until its forces were on the ground in South Lebanon, the journal said. According to the outlet, citing a Syrian security official, some of the munitions, including anti-tank missiles manufactured as recently as 2020, were sent to the country from Russian stocks located in Syria. The news contradicts earlier Israeli assessment that the terror group only used Soviet era weapons from the 2006 Second Lebanon War in 2006. The discoveries also increased fears in Israel, according to the Wall Street Journal, that Moscow was deepening relations with the Iran-backed group despite its insistence on neutrality in the conflict. 'Israel needs to be more assertive and defend its interests,' Arkady Mil-Man, a former Israeli ambassador to Russia, told the outlet. 'We must explain and convey to the Russians that we will no longer stand any assistance to Hezbollah and Iran that could hurt Israelis,' Mil-Man, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said. Both the Russian government and the Syrian foreign ministry refused to comment on the inquiry made by the Wall Street Journal. Russia's focus on the Middle East According to the article, Russia's stance in the Middle East has shifted since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, despite Israel’s efforts to maintain friendly relations with Moscow, so as to avoid conflicts in Syria, where Russia has a strong military presence. Analysts told the outlet that Russia was now actively seeking to harass the U.S. and its allies wherever possible. The report also detailed how the Russians provided aid in the form of munitions and military intelligence to Yemen’s Houthis, who have taken an active part in attacking Israel since the outset of the Gaza war on October 7. Moscow has also allegedly delivered anti-air defense systems to Hezbollah, thoughthere was no confirmation of the transaction, according to the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ detailed Russia’s warming relations with Hamas since the start of the war, hosting its political leaders several times in Moscow while seeking to reconcile the terror group and Fatah. Russia’s growing support comes against the backdrop of its deepening relations with Iran, who delivered the same drones and ballistic missiles to Moscow as it did to its proxy Hezbollah. According to a report, Russia's involvement in Syria has had a ripple effect on the region’s military dynamics, particularly concerning Hezbollah's access to advanced weaponry. Russia deepened its ties with Syria following the outbreak of Syria’s civil war in 2011, intervening militarily to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The outlet reported that Russia not only provided weapons to Syria but also maintained its own stockpiles in the country. Around 2015, Russian forces began collaborating with Hezbollah fighters on the ground, strengthening ties between the two groups. Russian weapons make 70% of seized arms in Lebanon ground operation According to Syrian security officials and an Arab official cited in the report, this relationship facilitated Hezbollah's access to Russian arms in Syria, including advanced weapon systems like antitank, antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles. The frequency with which Hezbollah obtained Russian weapons remains unclear, according to the Wall Street Journal. Traditionally, much of Hezbollah's arsenal has come from its patron Iran. However, Israeli officials have reportedly found a significant number of Russian-made weapons in southern Lebanon during recent operations. The outlet detailed a visit to Israel's National Munition Disassembly Lab, where seized materials from southern Lebanon are analyzed. The lab revealed an array of Russian weaponry, including Kornet and other guided antitank missile systems like Metis, Konkurs, Fagots and Saggers. These weapons were discovered in Hezbollah bunkers both above and below ground, less than a kilometer inside southern Lebanon an Israeli major told the Wall Street Journal. According to the Israeli officer, Russian-made arms comprised 60-70% of the weapons seized in the early days of Israel’s recent invasion of southern Lebanon. IDF Reservists reportedly continue to encounter Russian weapons in the area. From Moscow to Lebanon via Syria While the exact methods by which Hezbollah acquired these arms remain uncertain, some of the captured weapons bore markings linking them to Russia’s shipments to Syria’s defense ministry. The outlet reported that markings on some weapons, such as the Kornet, confirmed their Russian origin rather than being Iranian copies. One set of rockets even had labels in Russian indicating shipment to Syria. However, not all seized weapons carried such identifiers. The timeline for these deliveries is unclear, but the report noted that some weapons were manufactured as recently as 2020, while others, like the Saggers, date back to the 1980s. Fabian Hinz, a military research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, highlighted the importance of reliable, short-range missiles like the Kornet to Hezbollah’s operations. According to the Wall Street Journal, Hinz said these weapons have enabled Hezbollah to carry out a more efficient campaign against Israel compared to Hamas, which primarily relies on less reliable Iranian-made versions. Adam Rousselle, a researcher at Militant Wire, noted that the Kornet and two other Russian-made antitank missiles seized by IDF forces have featured prominently in Hezbollah attack videos since October 7, 2023 and have played a significant role in Hezbollah’s military tactics. An Israeli staff sergeant involved in medical evacuations in Lebanon described anti-tank missiles, including Kornets, as the most effective tools for targeting IDF soldiers and noted that these missiles can strike from a range of 7–8 kilometers (4.3–5 miles). While Hezbollah has suffered setbacks from IDF military actions, the sergeant stressed its strength relative to Hamas, largely due to its advanced arsenal. The Wall Street Journal reported that the IDF has displayed weapons seized from Hezbollah during ongoing combat operations in Lebanon. Israeli officials have pointed to two key objectives of their operations: neutralizing the threat posed by anti-tank missiles near Israeli communities and forcing Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force back north of the Litani River. The report also noted growing concerns among analysts and officials regarding Israel's diplomatic approach toward Russia. While many Western nations have provided military aid to Ukraine in its war against Moscow, Israel has limited its support to non-military aid, a stance believed to be influenced by its desire to avoid provoking Moscow. Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the INSS, criticized this approach. 'We need to sober up from this approach. It’s no longer just Russian support for the axis of resistance that is unconnected to Israel. We are meeting this in the battlefield and it is extracting casualties,' she said.

Hamas enforces rule by punishing aid theft in Gaza	The terror group claims to have executed at least 20 thieves who looted aid trucks, leading Gazans to hope prices of basic goods will drop as a result Gaza-based terror group Hamas announced on Monday it had carried out a 'successful elimination operation' against 20 looters who have allegedly taken over humanitarian aid in the enclave and claimed they were the ones who oversaw prices of stock being sold to remaining markets in the Strip. The report comes against the backdrop of efforts to prevent the group from taking over aid being delivered to Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s directive asking the IDF to 'make plans to diminish Hamas’ political and governing capabilities.' 'A 25-kilogram (55-pound) sack of flour, which feeds one family for a day, costs 400 shekels ($100). The situation has become unbearably dire,' A Gazan staying in one of Khan Younis’ camps said. 'Thieves began stealing massive amounts of goods and aid, driving up prices.' 'This group of criminals had been sentenced to death but escaped Hamas prisons after the war. However, Hamas managed to regain control and eliminate them in one swift operation. We're relieved that we'll finally receive food and water,' he added. Sources within Gaza's Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry claimed that over 20 gang members involved in thefts of aid trucks were killed during a 'high-quality security operation' carried out by the terror organization's security services in collaboration with tribal committees east of Rafah. As part of Hamas' efforts to solidify its rule in the Strip after over 13 months of fighting and heavy losses, sources told Hamas' Al-Aqsa channel that 'the operation marks the beginning of an extensive and carefully planned security campaign that will continue to target all involved in the theft of aid trucks, which significantly impacted civilians' lives and led to hunger in southern Gaza.' Hamas’ Interior Ministry said that the operation wasn’t aimed at specific tribes but asked to eliminate the phenomenon of truck looting. On Sunday, the 'popular committees,' a body established by Hamas to 'protect' aid, announced the execution of four thieves. 'The field executions are part of an integrated plan to address the crimes of aid truck robberies,' the ministry said. 'We will continue to pursue lawbreakers and thieves who steal the food of the Palestinian people.' Meanwhile, the German government announced on Monday of €6 million ($6.5 million) in financial aid to enhance the UN mechanism for expediting humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza. The funds will be delivered under an agreement with the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), tasked with overseeing secure aid distribution. The financial aid is part of Germany's humanitarian commitment to support international efforts to address Gaza's worsening crisis, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2720 (2023), aimed at improving aid distribution through UN-monitored humanitarian corridors. Despite reports of Hamas stealing and reselling aid at inflated prices, displaced Gazans are now anticipating price reductions that will enable them to purchase basic goods. Estimates suggest that about 500 thieves, operating in gangs, have been stealing aid since the war began. Senior Israeli officials have instructed the security bodies to intensify actions against aid looters in Gaza, asking to ensure that aid doesn’t fall into the hands of hostile elements like criminal syndicates and Hamas terrorists. Ynet learned that approximately 15 aid trucks were looted on Monday in the area by armed individuals. The IDF responded by opening fire at others attempting to loot additional trucks, foiling their efforts. While no official government directive has been made regarding the aid distribution, the IDF and the security officials have recently taken measures to tighten control over its delivery. According to security officials, certain points and junctions have become hotspots where looters attack and rob the trucks. Some Hamas terrorists have also managed to seize portions of the aid.

Shin Bet Chief's secret visit to Turkey amid Hamas developments	Ronen Bar's visit highlights geopolitical tensions as Qatar reportedly expels senior Hamas officials to Turkey; Israeli official says Turkey will get involved in hostage deals, leaving Egypt as the sole mediator following Qatar's announcement it was stepping back Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar recently made a clandestine visit to Turkey, meeting with Ibrahim Kalin, head of Turkish intelligence agency Millî İstihbarat Teşkilatı (MIT). This meeting occurred amid reports that Qatar expelled senior Hamas leaders who subsequently arrived in Turkey. An Israeli official clarified that Turkey will not serve as a mediator in any hostage negotiations. Instead, their role might involve exerting pressure on Hamas, with Egypt emerging as the primary mediator following Qatar's announcement. Earlier, a Turkish diplomatic source refuted claims that Hamas had relocated its political offices to Turkey, stating that members of the organization were merely visiting. 'Members of Hamas' political branch visit Turkey from time to time. Claims that Hamas moved its offices to Turkey do not reflect reality,' the source asserted. Bar's secret visit followed the cancellation of Israeli President Isaac Herzog's planned trip to the climate conference in Baku, partially attributed to Turkey's refusal to allow Herzog's plane to fly through its airspace en route to Azerbaijan. Local Azerbaijani media initially reported on this, feeling slighted by Israel's announcement citing 'security considerations' for the cancellation. Azerbaijani sources confirmed this to Ynet, and Israel acknowledged Turkey's refusal as a factor, though not the sole or primary reason for the cancellation. Herzog was scheduled for a brief visit to Baku on Tuesday, with plans to use the 'Wing of Zion' aircraft, designated for official overseas visits by the Prime Minister and President. A statement from the President's residence mentioned, 'Due to a situational assessment and for security reasons, the President has decided to cancel his trip to the climate conference in Azerbaijan.' Israeli sources noted security alerts; however, Jerusalem clarified that at no point was there a claim of a security issue within Azerbaijan itself. The Azerbaijani response to Israel's announcement was less than favorable. A senior source in Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry informed the 'Caliber' website that the reason for Herzog's visit cancellation was unrelated to security but was instead due to Turkey's prohibition of the use of its airspace by Herzog's aircraft. 'Unfortunately, intensive negotiations through diplomatic channels over several days did not yield results. Azerbaijan provides an overall concept for holding the conference and creates conditions for the participation of all parties. However, the situation regarding the Israeli president's visit arose for reasons beyond our country's control,' the source added.

Hezbollah fires missiles at central Israel as Hochstein arrives i...	IDF says at least 5 projectiles launched some intercepted; Lebanon opposes IDF freedom to operate on its territory, opposes participation of UK, Germany in international commission overseeing compliance of the deal, Hezbollah-affiliated publication says Hezbollah fire targeted central Israel's Sharon Plains on Tuesday after a missile launched at the greater Tel Aviv area on Monday, causing damage and some injuries. U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Tuesday to advance negotiations for a cease-fire to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Hochstein is expected to receive Lebanon's final response to the proposed deal and deliver it to Israel. The Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper said in a report on Tuesday that Hochstein's visit is the final attempt to reach a deal, but obstacles remain. According to the paper the two issued that must be resolved are Israel's 'self -defense' and the make-up of the international commission that will oversea compliance with the terms of the agreement. Lebanon says self-defense is already recognized under international law and therefore does not have to be a part of the cease-fire deal and that Israel's insistence to include it is an attempt to legitimize any future military action it would take. Lebanon therefore rejects it. Beirut also opposes the participation of the UK and Germany in the international commission overseeing compliance of the agreement, but sources told the publication that that matter could be more easily resolved. Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel in its report on Tuesday, quoted sources who said the U.S. wanted Lebanese agreement to American supervision of the Beirut International Airport and the sea ports as well as its supervision of the borders to prevent the influx of arms for Hezbollah arriving from Syria. According to the channel Hochstein was negotiation an agreement that would encompass all of Lebanon and not only the south. The success of the negotiations would open the way to a final drawing of the international border between Israel and Lebanon. But the envoy's success is not guaranteed, Al Hadath said. Nabih Berry, Lebanon's speaker of parliament who was negotiation on the part of Hezbollah wanted to pressure the Iran-backed terror group to agree to American's proposed terms.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjpovnfzje	2024-11-18T22:03:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/rJf7vnYGke/rJf7vnYGke_0_0_640_533_0_small.jpg

Israel had not been able to confirm the flow of Russian-made weapons to the Iran-backed terror group until its forces were on the ground in South Lebanon, the journal said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyyusjfgjx	2024-11-18T21:11:10-08:00	
Would the Iranian regime collapse if Khamenei dies?	Prof. Shai Golan: Advanced prostate cancer can lead to severe complications like coma and multi-organ failure Iran has released a photo of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei amid widespread rumors on social media claiming he is either in a coma or has died. The image shows Khamenei in his office speaking with Iran’s Ambassador to Lebanon, who was injured in Beirut during Israel’s September strikes on Hezbollah. Speculation about Khamenei’s health began with an October 27 New York Times report suggesting he was 'seriously ill' and that his son might succeed him. On Saturday, claims surfaced that the 85-year-old had fallen into a coma. Experts have cast doubt on these reports, suggesting they could be true or false. Khamenei’s health has been under scrutiny for two decades, with recurring rumors of illness and potential succession. Officials consistently deny such claims, often releasing photos to refute them. A similar pattern occurred last night with the ambassador’s meeting. Rumors date back to 2006 when political analyst Michael Ledeen claimed Khamenei was in a coma. Similar reports emerged in 2009 and 2014, when Khamenei underwent prostate surgery believed to be for cancer. Speculation resurfaced in 2020. Prof. Shai Golan of Beilinson Hospital told ILTV News that advanced prostate cancer can lead to severe complications like coma and multi-organ failure. However, prostate cancer typically grows slowly and has a 90% cure rate with early detection. Iran’s healthcare challenges, however, could shorten survival to two or three years if Khamenei has advanced cancer—though this remains unconfirmed. Khamenei cannot unilaterally name his successor. The Assembly of Experts, comprising 88 Shia clerics, must elect the next Supreme Leader. Would the regime collapse if Khamenei dies? Iranian journalist Ashkan Hakimi outlined two theories: a new leader could seek better relations with the West, or public unrest could lead to regime change. For now, these scenarios remain speculative until Khamenei’s health status is clarified.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry8crjymkl	2024-11-18T20:50:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/By2x9til1e/By2x9til1e_0_35_2295_1292_0_small.jpg

Doctors warn: Hostages at severe risk of life-threatening illness...	Report says need for immediate humanitarian intervention As Israel's hostages endure over 400 days in captivity, medical experts are raising urgent alarms about their heightened vulnerability to severe illnesses and diseases, particularly with winter fast approaching. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has issued a humanitarian report detailing the dire health conditions many captives are likely facing. According to the report, some hostages have lost up to 50% of their body weight, significantly compromising their immune systems. This leaves them at increased risk of contracting diseases, as well as facing potential complications such as frostbite, hypothermia, cardiovascular conditions, and respiratory infections in the coming months. The report underscores the pressing need for immediate humanitarian intervention to address these life-threatening risks.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1yyiktg1g	2024-11-18T18:51:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/07/ryATF11Wk1x/ryATF11Wk1x_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
‘Israel should control Gaza for at least two or three years’	Yoni Ben Menachem: More security forces are needed to find the hostages, not a ceasefire deal Israel should control Gaza for at least two or three years to eradicate Hamas from the area, according to Yoni Ben Menachem of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. Speaking to ILTV News, Ben Menachem said that only if Israel takes over Gaza and 'works freely' could it kill all the terrorists, dismantle Hamas’s military infrastructure and destroy the tunnels. 'This is a long process,' Ben Menachem said. 'We cannot do it now without the full control in Gaza and also controlling the civilians.' As such, he said it is premature to sign any ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which he anyway does not believe will bring Israel’s hostages home. On Monday, G20 leaders, the leaders of the world’s biggest economies, called for 'comprehensive' ceasefires in both Gaza and Lebanon in a joint statement at a summit in Brazil. But Ben Menachem said that Hamas has no intention of signing a deal and that Israel has not done enough militarily to bring the hostages back. 'The IDF did not apply enough pressure, military pressure, in Gaza in order to find the hostages, and they did not make enough intelligence effort to locate the hostages,' he told ILTV. 'What is needed is to bring more forces into Gaza and intensify the intelligence gathering in order to get to the hostages.' He said Hamas would continue to blame Israel for not signing a deal, but if ultimately something was signed, he does not believe the hostages would come home anyway. 'This is why we have to do it ourselves,' he said.

British commander Richard Kemp: Talk of ceasefire with Hezbollah ...	Kemp says 'the handcuffs are going to be taken off Israel' under US President Donald Trump It is 'premature' for Israel to sign a ceasefire deal with Lebanon, according to British commander Richard Kemp. He told ILTV News last week that the ceasefire efforts are being driven by the Biden administration, which wants to see some conclusion to the war before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office. However, he said that Israel's work against the terror organization Hezbollah is not done. 'Israel needs to do much more damage to Hezbollah, and it effectively needs to create a situation where Hezbollah becomes demilitarized as a longer-term objective, and that there is a very significant buffer zone between the Israeli border and the southern part of Lebanon, to the extent that there is no longer a direct threat to the residents of Northern Israel who can then return home,' Kemp said. 'That is not necessarily going to happen overnight.' Overnight, Reuters reported that Lebanon and Hezbollah have agreed to a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire with Israel, with some comments. Israel did not comment. Kemp stressed that Iran drives all seven battlefronts on which Israel is fighting. He has been a strong advocate for a U.S. administration that would take action against Iran alongside Israel or at least untie Israel's hands so it can cut off Iran, which he referred to as the head of the octopus. 'Israel can't do that without the support of the US,' Kemp said, referring to the ability to cut off Iran where it is at literally. 'Israel can inflict severe damage on the Iranian regime and the Iranian nuclear program, but it can't do that without the backing of the U.S. 'In the ideal world, I think the US would also go in and attack Iran with Israel,' he continued. However, he said that he does not envision that happening even under newly elected President Donald Trump. 'I do think is going to happen is the handcuffs are going to be taken off Israel to allow it the freedom to do what it needs to do and inflict significant damage on Iran so that Iran is no longer in a position to run all of these different proxies around the region against Israel and against the West,' Kemp concluded.

Look me in the eyes': Ex-Hamas hostage leaves pro-Palestinian ac...	Newly surfaced debate video shows Moran Stela Yanai, abducted by Hamas on October 7 and later released, sharing her story to clearly speechless pro-Palestinian activist; 'I respected them even when they abused me,' she said of her captors A debate event held last June in Los Angeles featured participants such as Mosab Hassan Yousef ('The Green Prince'), Moran Stela Yanai—a survivor kidnapped and held captive by Hamas, UCLA Y&S Nazarian Center for Israel Studies Director Prof. Dov Waxman and pro-Palestinian activist Aidan Dewolf, the organizer of a protest encampment at the same university. This event went viral on Monday following the release of the second part of the interview, where Yanai directly addresses and speaks with Dwolf. In this newly released second segment, published four months after the initial interview, Yanai is seen addressing the pro-Palestinian activist, saying, 'I really want to talk to you on eye level and tell you a story, if you want to hear it. '...When I was kidnapped to Gaza, I was caught three times. The last time, I was caught by 13 Hamas terrorists. Thirteen. I want you to acknowledge the facts as they are, truly. I’ve visited the U.S., have you ever been to Israel? Have you visited Gaza before? Probably not,' she recounts. 'On October 7, and this is what they (the terrorists) told me, they had no idea about the Nova festival, they didn’t know there were 3,000 people there. They planned, and this is what they told me, to continue onward and kill as many people as possible. In Be'er Sheva, Tel Aviv, Haifa—they wanted to slaughter everyone. 'And you know what, maybe you won’t believe me, but I can show you the videos that I have. Do you know how many bodies were there? Do you know how much violence I experienced firsthand? I was caught in the middle of the lynch; I was portrayed as a soldier because I chose that day, unintentionally, to wear olive-green clothes that looked like a uniform. That was enough to classify me as a soldier. 'And they treated me like a soldier. I’m 40 years old, look at me, I’m 40. I have a cat and a dog; I had two cats, I lost one that day. I have a mom and dad, and a brother, who left their whole lives to try and help me. My mom found out I was kidnapped through my 12-year-old niece, who saw a video on TikTok and recognized me. That’s how they found out I was kidnapped. Did you know that?' Yanai continued her dialogue with Dwolf for several more minutes, during which it was clear that he felt very uncomfortable with the direct yet calm way she presented her story to him, even struggling to maintain eye contact. Social media reactions quickly followed, with many praising Yanai's quiet strength and the way she shared her story and words with Dewolf. It should be noted that Yanai is a jewelry designer who went to the Nova Festival near Kibbutz Re'im on October 7, 2023, to sell her jewelry. During the Hamas attack on the festival, she was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and taken to the Gaza Strip, where she was held captive for 54 days. During her captivity, Yanai had to endure harsh conditions, including humiliation and abuse. She recounted in several interviews how she was forced to beg for food and her captors' demand that she look them in the eyes, which left her with deep psychological scars. After her release, Yanai underwent a lengthy rehabilitation process. In January 2024, she returned to her home in Be'er Sheva and has since continued to share her story to raise awareness about the situation of hostages and encourage the public to advocate for them.

Pro-palestinian activists vandalize home of University of Washing...	University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce's home and car vandalized with pro-Palestinian graffiti ahead of regents meeting on campus protests; university and ADL condemn act as crime; law enforcement investigating The home and car of University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce were vandalized with spray-painted messages, including 'Free Palestine,' 'Blood on Your Hands,' and 'Ana Mari is Complicit in Genocide.' The incident occurred the night before a Board of Regents meeting to discuss campus policies and responses to ongoing pro-Palestinian protests. A pro-Palestinian student group shared footage of the vandalism on Instagram, claiming the act as a form of protest. The video shows masked individuals stenciling messages on Cauce’s front door and car, accompanied by a caption accusing her of complicity in 'Palestinian genocide.' Flyers with protest demands were distributed in the neighborhood, alleging the university’s ties to Boeing enable war crimes. The protesters claimed Boeing supplied half of Israel's missiles from 2021 to 2023, including those used in refugee camps. They accused the university of whitewashing Boeing’s image, citing donations exceeding $100 million and its influence in career fairs and on the university's Board of Regents. The protesters condemned Cauce, who has led the university for nearly a decade, for dismissing prior demands to sever ties with Boeing. They referenced a past statement attributed to her: 'Someone that you barely know does something pretty awful, you make one set of decisions. Someone that has been a close friend of yours since you were two (Boeing) does something pretty awful, you look at it a little bit differently.' In a statement, the protesters vowed continued action, declaring: 'So while Palestinians cannot experience peace, neither can she!! Neither can anyone who serves genocide.' University spokesperson Victor Balta condemned the vandalism, calling it 'a crime' and saying that university policy would not be influenced by threats or criminal acts. He confirmed that multiple law enforcement agencies are investigating. The Seattle chapter of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) also denounced the incident, labeling it 'vandalism, threats, and property destruction by masked activists.' The ADL called for those responsible to be held accountable and warned against escalating anti-Israel rhetoric turning violent.

Hamas' sexual crimes: Uncollected evidence come to light	Previously undocumented indicators of sexual violence by Hamas during October 7 attacks now emerging through new report compiling evidence and survivor testimonies; findings aim to shed light on scope of atrocities Warning: This article contains content some readers may find disturbing In the chaos at the IDF's Shura base on the days following the October 7 massacre, bodies of the murdered – soldiers, civilians and the occasional body that, after examination, turned out to be that of an abominable Nukhba terrorist, were piling up. On one body alongside grenades, they found an open packet of condoms. 'I read about this in the newspaper. It was part of a journal kept by a guy from Shura,' says leading Israeli lawyer, Prof. Yifat Bitton. 'Our investigator contacted him and asked, ‘Tell me, did you report this to anyone?’ He said, ‘No. We had to deal with neutralizing the grenades. Why should I be dealing with condoms?’' What might have been regarded on the ground as a rather marginal detail, for Prof. Bitton leading the struggle for recognition of Hamas’s sexual offenses, it was a warning sign. 'For me, a terrorist with condoms indicates sexual offense. Maybe the packet of condoms was on him because he’d had consensual sex just before that, and the box had simply remained in his pocket. 'However as, in the wave of terrorist incursion incidents, we have no way of verifying this, and as we know that when armed men are in an environment where women are helpless, there’s a very high risk of sexual harm, these condoms may attest to sexual assault. If Hamas can, they’re welcome to prove otherwise. Until October 7, we hadn’t seen sexual assault as part of organized Hamas operations. This perception, however, needs to change.' What does this story prove in terms of our investigations? That condoms are marginal to grenades? 'Not just marginal. It’s about seeing an outright indication right before your eyes, and erasing it from your mind. Not just because it’s not important. 'Yes, some people thought it was less important - like the senior Division of Identification and Forensic Science (DIFS) official who told me, ‘Listen, when I have the worst crime of all, murder, I don’t have to, and can’t, deal with this too.' But what they were looking at was sexual offense. Conditions also play a role: under any other circumstances, I’d examine the body in great detail, but I had 500 more bodies waiting in line.' The mass of bodies meant you couldn’t tell the whole story. 'Yes. Everyone in the Hell that was Shura had a very specific task in identifying the bodies. They remained within the area and didn’t leave it. Either their eyes didn’t look over the entire body, or they did, and decided that they couldn’t really see it and couldn’t deal with it. Psychologists we interviewed told us that this is how it works – so as to protect the workers’ mental health from permanent damage. But this, apparently minor, story is a new way of looking at what happened here.' 'The dead are dead' December 2023, a few months prior to that conversation, Bitton gave a speech at a conference she had initiated at the UN to promote world awareness of the horrific massacre’s incorporation of systematic gender-based violence. On returning home to Herzliya, however, she felt something wasn’t right. Something in the way the story was framed was distorting the big picture. 'A lieutenant colonel told me that he saw a woman tied to a pole, naked from the hips up. When I asked him what he did, he told me that he took her off the pole and completely covered her up.' 'I revisited my speech’s opening sentence in which I said that nothing in my 20 years of representing victims of sexual offenses and researching the issue, had prepared me for this moment. I asked myself why I’d opted for this sentence. Why had nothing prepared me for this? After all, it’s no surprise that women are harmed on the battlefield. Why weren’t we prepared for this moment? I felt I knew only parts of what had happened. The entirety of what happened, however, was unprecedented and so demanded new decoding tools. 'We’re trying to use existing tools to understand something that hasn’t happened in the past. This is severely detrimental to our professional ability to prove what happened and explain why the evidence is so sparse relative to the scope of attacks. I realized it would be best to listen to people who were on the ground at the time, and through them, identify the true scope of sexual offenses on October 7.' This realization led Bitton, President of Achva Academic College and head of Israel's Public Colleges Association, to an almost year-long quest resulting in an extremely comprehensive, in-depth report on October 7 sexual offenses. Alongside attorneys Vardit Avitan and Shir Burka and lawyer, Hodaya Shaked, she questioned and interviewed dozens of people from the field who saw the worst things a person could imagine. This culminated into 80 pages in Hebrew, translating into 100 English pages, to serve Israel - not just in Hasbara terms, but also for international legal purposes. In their own personal time, and modestly funded by two foundations, the researchers set out with a clear mission. 'I asked myself, why this had gotten me so much. Why couldn’t I just deal with the other horrors that occurred there? I eventually realized that the situation I was now seeing, is one so often exposed when it comes to assaults - mainly against women – and that are sidelined. This isn’t very different from what we know about sexual violence in general. It needs working on, pushing, and explaining why it matters. 'The last thing I wanted was for the sexual offenses to be used as yet one more tool with which to goad the enemy. I was looking for a way to forge recognition for the victims. I was looking to find out how, knowing what we do about these incidents, we could set up dedicated treatment and investigation structures. This was my prime motive. And no one really wanted to do it.' Did exposure to these materials affect you personally? 'The material was, obviously, very difficult. I am sadly, however, very experienced when it comes to the horrors of sexual offenses. Although it was unprecedented in terms of its scope and malevolence, I must stress that as soon as the project was about means for identifying and gathering evidence, that’s what we focused on. 'It’s also been very hard to prove the degree to which the interviewees were repressing what they’d seen or felt or were experiencing secondary trauma - that arose from the interviews. Some felt guilty, and it was important for me to explain to them that, considering the shock and chaos of what happened to us, there was nothing to feel guilty about.' The report - whose findings were forwarded to officials at Israel’s National Security Council (NSC), terrorism specialists and the authorities at the United Nations Security Council responsible for dealing with sexual violence - reveals obstacles faced by various systems, that have prevented widescale documentation of the scale of the sexual assaults. These obstacles are expressed by 'first respondents,' professionals who, on October 7, encountered what we couldn’t have imagined in our worst nightmares. These include Zaka, police and Border Police, personnel as well as doctors at Camp Shura. This failure touched on not only gathering evidence, but also the preliminary inquiry. It turns out that Israeli combatants in the massacre areas weren’t asked questions about sexual offenses. A senior police officer says in the report that this was sometimes a conscious decision, 'so as to keep soldiers’ spirits robust, as they were returning to the battlefield.' Another senior ranking Border Police officer told the investigator that she saw, 'Loads of bras and underwear strewn around the party ground.' Bitton says, 'She hadn’t told anyone before, as she wasn’t asked questions about indications, but rather about sexual offenses. 'If you ask, ‘Did you see sexual assaults,’ the answer would be no. But if you were to ask, ‘Did you see anything relating to women that looked odd to you,’ she’d say, ‘Actually yes.’ For me, this constitutes an indication of sexual offenses. That same officer did not photograph what he saw, and also instructed her subordinates not to photograph them either.' Why? 'Because they were told, ‘We need to focus on the people who are alive. The dead are dead.' I heard this cited by both soldiers and psychologists. ‘This is what matters,' ‘This is what’s relevant.' These are the quotes. We’re now talking about an accumulation of almost 500 pieces of digital evidence. 'I remember two burned bodies whose legs were spread. In real time, we wanted to identify the bodies, not find out what had happened to them.' 'In the videos, you don’t have to look for gang rape. You need to look for pictures of underwear on the ground. Understanding that we have to ask about indications, rather than the sexual offenses themselves, is groundbreaking.' Many interviewed said that they didn’t forward the evidence they had photographed on their personal phones. 'For example, pictures including very serious indications of sexual offenses, not passed on for fear of violating the victim’s privacy,' says Bitton. A senior Zaka official, who was present at the massacre scene, said he had a whole gallery of pictures he’d taken on his phone that he didn’t know what to do with.' 'A lieutenant colonel told me that he saw a woman tied to a pole, naked from the hips up. When I asked him what he did, he told me that he took her off the pole and completely covered her up. ‘It was important for me to put an end to her denegation, and certainly not document her in this horrific condition.' I understand the compassion by which he was guided, but that shouldn’t negate the importance of documentation, as long as there are clear and ethical guidelines as to how to do it.' Hodaya Shaked, who collaborated on the report alongside Prof. Bitton, says, 'One interviewee told me that, while surveying and clearing the bodies, he found a used condom on a bed in a house in the Gaza Periphery. He didn’t think to report it, and only thought about it differently when we talked about it.' From these examples, we learn of the lack of readiness for terrorism that incorporates sexual violence - not just in the field, but afterward too, at Camp Shura. 'Naked, or partially naked, bodies were showing up at Shura, and no one documented it,' says Bitton. 'At Shura, they photographed operational injury. They didn’t, for example, photograph bruising adjacent to sexual organs.' Coining a term: Sexual terror attack Dr. Naama Samet, oral and maxillofacial surgery specialist, who has been volunteering with the IDF’s victims’ identification unit for the past 15 years, encountered this in the six weeks she spent identifying hundreds of bodies at Shura. She supports Prof. Bitton and her investigation team’s grim conclusions. 'The thought of sexual assault didn’t cross our minds,' she says. 'We just opened up the top part of the body bags. On the second or third day, a Zaka guy rolled in a body in a cart. Helping him bring it in, I said, ‘There’s something strange here.' I thought there was another body inside. We then removed the body bag and saw that the pelvis was very clearly broken. This is how we understood that sexual assaults had occurred.' Did it change the rest of the examinations? 'No. There wasn’t time for that. At some stage, you close up, just to get through. I remember two burned bodies whose legs were spread. In real-time, we wanted to identify the bodies, not find out what had happened to them. That was a mistake, but it would have taken months had we acted otherwise. There were horrific stories there.' Bitton continues, 'We suddenly realized that burning the houses and bodies or shooting the sexual organs was, in part, means to conceal the sexual assaults. Pramila Patten (United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, who came to Israel in January and then compiled a report concluding that sexual assaults by Hamas had indeed occurred), confirmed there had many gunshots at sexual organs, mainly but not only, of women.' 'At first, we viewed it as some kind of sexual obsession of theirs or efforts to eliminate sexuality. I now tell myself that this, in and of itself, constitutes sexual assault and that I can perhaps use this as an indication of covering up acute sexual assaults.' In hindsight, we understand that assaults were on a greater scale, that so much evidence has been buried. 'Definitely. We’re proving that very clearly.' Legal research and security expert Capt. (res.) Att. Shir Burka, who has been serving as war room commander at the Gaza Division for over a decade, was called on the afternoon of October 7 to the Northern Brigade’s improvised war room in the south of the country. 'As a war room officer, I experienced first-hand the tremendous chaos on the ground in the first days after the attack. Our priorities were clear: protecting human life, evacuating the dead and wounded, and preparing for an attack. At no stage were we briefed about sexual offenses.' 'With my background representing victims of sexual assault, as our work on the report progressed, I saw evermore gaps in the evidence and I could only scream out against the omission and the possibility that so many forces on the ground could have contributed toward identifying and documenting sexual offenses. But hindsight‘s 20/20. Had there been any awareness of it, things would have certainly looked different.' Bitton: 'Visiting one of the Gaza Periphery communities, I asked a local man to show me where the horrors had taken place. I wanted to be there, to smell it, hear the silent voices of the people I’m trying to make heard. As he was talking, I realized that he was, inadvertently, showing me a strong, horrific indication of the acute sexual abuse of two women. 'Realizing this, and not wanting to upset him, I asked him questions around the subject. With my tools, I continued the investigation in the house, went back to my interviewees, reconfirmed that what I had heard was correct, and learned that I was correct in my assessment. Talking to a police representative, I found that the police didn’t know about it.' What did he say constituted an indication? 'He said that something just didn’t hang together about the house we were in. It was clear that what happened here, wasn’t what he had thought, and that he had no explanation as to what had happened, and that was telling himself the same story everyone probably tells themselves: They see an indication, but don’t regard it as demonstrating a high chance of sexual assault.' Didn’t that put you in the position of police investigator? 'Definitely not. I’m not here to replace the police. We always forwarded new stories or evidence to which we were exposed. That’s not my role, and shouldn’t be anyone else’s role. That’s the state’s role.' 'It’s critical the state should adopt this report, the bodies mentioned in it read it, understand what’s missing in their work, and make corrections accordingly.' In their report, Bitton and her partners present new perceptions. Firstly: the obstacles faced in collecting and documenting evidence of sexual offenses, are rooted in this being a totally different kind of attack. And secondly: it may well happen again. Let’s start with the first. The investigators called the October 7 terrorist attack an 'incursive incident.' Bitton says, 'This short-term attack on the land of a sovereign Westen state is a world-first. It’s an incursive terrorist incident in that they were invaders, they wandered around in the field, caused destruction, and left. 'Sexual offenses in Ukraine, for example, were part of an ongoing war. This is in no way similar to an incursive incident whose main purpose was killing as many people as possible, in which the victims were killed systematically.' Prof. Boaz Ganor, President of Reichman University and the founder of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT), who ranks among the world’s top terrorism experts, reiterates this. 'I don’t remember any similar incident in modern times. Perhaps, the Boko Haram attack in Nigeria where they kidnapped girls from school, hurt them, and sold them as concubines. We also saw ISIS do this to the Yazidi women.' Ganor addresses another terrifying report conclusion regarding the likelihood of a second such attack in the wider world. 'In the history of modern terrorism, attacks carried out against the State of Israel, serve as a model copied by other organizations. In the 1960s, Israel ranked among the countries suffering most from airplane hijackings. 'We then saw it spread to other places, among other things, because Israel found ways to better address the issue. It was similar with suicide attacks that started here in 1992, and a decade later became familiar in Europe and the U.S. So, one must ask whether October 7 could serve as a model to be imitated in other Western countries.' And what do you think? 'I think that an incursive terrorist attack like this can be imitated in places adjacent to territories over which the state has no effective control. If we look at Europe and the US, it doesn’t seem likely. However, we’re beginning to see areas over which the state has little, or no, effective control. 'Even in Europe, there are areas - like Brussels’ Molenbeek neighborhood, that the police and law enforcement authorities seldom, or fear to, go. Paris also has quarters like this. I believe we’ll probably see incursive terrorist attacks from such neighborhoods in Europe, similar in essence to the October 7 incursion attack.' What do you feel this report contributes? 'It has two important aspects. Firstly: casting light on the horrific sexual offenses committed on October 7. Secondly: addressing the challenges faced by first respondents arriving at the scene of such a huge incursive terrorist attack, who are busy dealing with other issues like saving lives, fighting, and obviously not collecting the facts required to prove sexual offenses. 'In the wider world, some people are still saying that these claims are some kind of Israeli scam. This report says that, alongside other activity, it’s also important to have clear guidelines and operating methods to gather the evidence, not only for indictment purposes, but also to show the world.' Challenges in making sense of evidence 'It was important for me to investigate how these various structures operated,' says Bitton. 'Was there any kind of awareness, and what did they do? The answer is that people on the ground were not aware of it, and so did almost nothing. I’m not criticizing them. It’s Hell. Guilt must rest on Hamas who caused the chaos.' The report, however, presents the state’s failures. 'We have to view them as shortcomings - the inability to imagine. I call it, ‘When the unimaginable becomes a reality.' It’s a nightmare. It no use judging in hindsight.' Att. Vardit Avidan, Bitton's team’s sexual protection expert, supports this. 'It was important for us to cast blame on Hamas. Yes, a response could have been better in some cases, but if we prepare correctly, we’ll be able to get better evidence in the future.' How? Bitton: 'I learned that the DIFS is the only organization that can identify dead civilians in Israel. This is the only body in the country authorized to conduct this procedure. The identification process involves taking fingerprints, dental photos and conducting DNA tests. This means that Israel’s number one investigation body was conducting an activity that’s very easy to train people on the ground to do.' 'The sheer workload meant that that it was a month before DIFS got into the field, by which time the crime scenes had been corrupted, damaged or destroyed. This was the case for the Nahal Oz outpost where dozens of male and female soldiers - and the highest number of women - were murdered. 'The army’s surveillance unit, with its forensic documentation expertise (which it may utilize in the future) didn’t manage to get there at all. Instead, Zaka evacuated the bodies from the scene to another kibbutz. One interviewee told me ‘By that stage, you couldn’t understand who was who.'' 'These are evidentiary problems from Hell. There was also a lack of collaboration between the various respondents who were working under fire and the fear of being kidnapped. And yet, when we finally come to talk about sexual offenses, they have the tenacity to ask us, ‘Where’s your evidence?.'' Has anything changed in procedures since then? 'The answer is not yet. That’s why I believe it’s critical the state should adopt this report, the bodies mentioned in it read it, understand what’s missing in their work, and make corrections accordingly. We know that this doesn’t generally happen on its own, so we need a body to handle these incidents and oversee that it really does happen.' 'As for overseas, I’m supposed to meet international organizations in the United States soon to explain to them what this means for them. I’m working with the embassy to present it at Congress. The German parliament’s representative to the United Nations has also asked me to forward the report to her, and there’s a coalition of sorts of politicians from across the globe, set up by Yesh Atid MK Shelly Meron, who want to address the matter at an international level.' This is impressive, but how willing is the world to listen to Israel while the war is still ongoing? 'Our story isn’t making waves - to say the least. I think the world isn’t listening to the story from the Israeli angle, or even the women’s angle. It might be of interest to various terrorism experts and anyone fighting terror. 'Transferring the burden of proof to the terrorist organizations in a structured manner, as the report does, is of great interest to them. In this respect, I think they are listening, as it’s a story with universal implications. Explaining that this is a universal story, rather than just an Israeli story, is part of the issue. And as a universal feminist, it’s important for me to protect women – whoever they may be.' Although the world’s women’s organizations messed up. 'Lots of them behaved shamefully because, among other things, I think, it’s connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they believe it couldn’t happen to women in the middle of Europe. In my dealings with these organizations, I don’t behave as if I’m angry with them, but rather I’m critical of their failure to fulfill the role they’ve been mandated to perform. 'This professional report, which explains how these situations should be managed, is a strong tool to address the international community’s disgraceful conduct and one that can be relevant later for indictment purposes. Presenting this to the world is, essentially, part of the new challenges that terrorism poses to humanity. Under no circumstances should this story be sidelined.'

Lebanon and Hezbollah have agreed to a U.S. proposal for a cease-fire with Israel with some comments on the content, a top Lebanese official told Reuters on Monday, describing the effort as the most serious yet to end the fighting. Ali Hassan Khalil, an aide to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, said Lebanon had delivered its written response to the U.S. ambassador in Lebanon on Monday, and White House envoy Amos Hochstein was traveling to Beirut to continue talks. 'Lebanon presented its comments on the paper in a positive atmosphere,' Khalil said, declining to give further details. 'All the comments that we presented affirm the precise adherence to (UN) Resolution 1701 with all its provisions,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkfb4vfm1x	2024-11-18T12:40:40-08:00

The IDF said Monday that an investigation into the impact site in Ramat Gan determined the damage was caused by debris from a rocket intercepted by air defense systems. According to a preliminary assessment, the interceptor struck a surface-to-surface rocket launched from Lebanon at a high altitude, breaking it into several fragments. Some of the debris fell to the ground, causing damage and injuries, the IDF said.

Berlin police advise LGBTQ and Jews to avoid Arab-majority areas	Berlin Police Chief Barbara Slowik urges visibly Jewish and LGBTQ individuals to exercise caution in Arab-majority neighborhoods, citing open antisemitism and sympathy for terrorism; police recorded 6,200 antisemitic incidents since October 7 Once regarded as a bastion of inclusivity and cosmopolitan culture, Berlin is increasingly reflecting broader trends sweeping Germany: rising radicalization among Muslim migrants, a political shift to the right and heightened antisemitism and fear of violence. Berlin Police Chief Barbara Slowik acknowledged these changes in an interview with the Berliner Zeitung daily, saying that while the city does not have 'no-go zones,' certain areas may be unsafe for visibly Jewish individuals or members of the LGBTQ community. 'There are, unfortunately, neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds where there is open sympathy for terrorist organizations and very blatant antisemitism,' she said. Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Berlin police have launched investigations into 6,200 antisemitic incidents, including physical assaults, online hate speech and attacks on police during pro-Palestinian protests. Antisemitic incidents have surged by 50% compared to 2022, with two-thirds occurring after October 7. LGBTQ individuals in Berlin have also reported a growing fear of violence in neighborhoods with significant Arab populations. Many members of the community now conceal their identities, avoid public displays of affection and seek escorts when leaving bars in these areas. In a notable incident, the owner of a prominent LGBTQ pub in Kreuzberg opposed the establishment of a refugee shelter nearby, citing ongoing physical assaults against her patrons by local residents. Slowik warned that Berlin’s police force is stretched thin, citing increased responsibilities since October 7, including daily pro-Palestinian protests and heightened security for Jewish and Israeli institutions. 'Our resources are being tested to their limits,' she said, calling for greater support to address the mounting challenges.

FM Sa'ar urges UN to address attacks on Israel by pro-Iran militi...	Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar announced Monday that he has sent a letter to the president of the UN Security Council, urging immediate action to address the activities of pro-Iranian militias operating in Iraq, whose territory has been used for attacks on Israel. Sa’ar emphasized in the letter that the Iraqi government is responsible for any actions occurring within or from its territory. He stressed Israel's right to self-defense, as enshrined in the UN Charter, to protect itself and its citizens. 'I called on the council to act urgently to ensure that the Iraqi government fulfills its obligations under international law and to put an end to these attacks on Israel,' Sa’ar said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skvec7kmjx	2024-11-18T12:14:26-08:00	
Achtung! Germany, other EU nations set to tighten entry due to im...	European nations tightening border controls as far-right influence rises; Germany, Netherlands lead with stricter checks citing illegal immigration and security concerns; from 2025, biometric data and new entry protocols will apply for non-EU citizens The resurgence of populist far-right movements across numerous Western nations is a well-documented trend. However, in recent weeks, this tide of anti-immigration, anti-democratic and anti-European Union sentiment has been accompanied by a reimplementation of stringent border security measures. Once emblematic of a peaceful, integrated Europe characterized by open borders and seamless cross-national movement, these ideals now seem distant as border protections are being re-enforced. This shift challenges the very relevance of the Schengen Agreements, a treaty that led to the creation of Europe's Schengen Area, in which internal border checks have largely been abolished. Countries like Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Austria and Denmark have heightened border security, with some extending these measures into May and June 2025. Germany spearheaded this initiative, responding to growing opposition to illegal immigration and concerns over radical Islam by reinstating strict border checks with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark. The right-wing Dutch government announced similar measures last week. Despite a post-COVID-19 rebound in European tourism throughout 2024, escalating illegal immigration, expanding criminal networks and terrorism fears are likely to result in prolonged border crossing times, especially for non-European passport holders. While existing regulations, such as the allowance for stays of up to 90 days every six months for non-EU passport holders remain unchanged, enforcement is set to intensify, particularly at land borders. This will impact those traveling between Schengen countries by car, bus or train. Starting in 2025, those entering Europe without an EU passport will undergo biometric registration, including fingerprinting, with data stored for three years. Additionally, from the beginning of next year, all foreign nationals exempt from visa requirements will need to complete an online form with a nominal fee to stay in Europe, akin to the U.S. ESTA system. Under the Schengen Agreements, EU member states are not meant to enforce border crossings but can temporarily intensify border checks with four weeks' notice if they substantiate that such measures will mitigate a genuine security threat. This must be a last resort under the agreement. It appears many European countries now regard this as their final option.

Criminals steal machine guns from IDF troops in northern Israel	3 MAG machine guns stolen from IDF troops near Lebanon border, as criminals increasingly target military weapons; Military Police probe underway Three MAG machine guns were stolen from IDF infantry forces stationed near a village in northern Israel, the military confirmed Monday. The theft occurred last week while the soldiers were taking a break in a designated assembly area near the Lebanon border. The weapons were taken from military vehicles left unattended. The IDF said that the Military Police has launched an investigation, and its findings will be reviewed by the Military Advocate General. 'Naturally, we cannot share details of an ongoing investigation,' the statement added. Local police in Israel’s northern district said they were unaware of the incident. The theft highlights an ongoing issue of military-grade weapons being targeted by criminal organizations. MAG machine guns, which are highly sought after in the criminal underworld, were reportedly valued at up to half a million shekels ($135,000) on the black market before the war. Experts believe prices have since risen. This is not the first instance of weapon theft from military assembly areas. In November last year, grenades, explosives, ammunition and M16 rifles were stolen from IDF positions in the Galilee. The thieves had distributed food and clothing to soldiers as part of a diversion tactic before stealing the weapons. Three suspects, Arab-Israeli residents of nearby villages, were later arrested and charged. In October, shortly after Hamas’ attacks in southern Israel, a MAG machine gun was stolen from soldiers who had left it behind while seeking shelter during a rocket alert in the town of Avdon. In another incident, criminals stole a LAW anti-tank missile from a reservist battalion stationed along the northern border. Police have warned that since the start of the war, criminal groups have increasingly targeted military personnel, exploiting moments of inattention to steal weapons and equipment. Investigations into these incidents are ongoing.

Trump taps oil industry leader as energy secretary	Chris Wright lacks political experience but aligns with Trump's positions, seeking to expand US oil and gas industries despite climate crisis November 2024 marks the hottest on record for eastern U.S. residents in places like New York, Vermont and even Maine, who are experiencing weather that might have been considered fitting for summer just a few decades ago. Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Chris Wright, a senior figure in the oil and gas industry and a climate change skeptic, as his energy secretary. Wright is the founder and CEO of Liberty Energy, a Denver-based drilling company. He is expected to back Trump's agenda to maximize oil and gas production and explore ways to boost electricity output, which is seeing rising demand for the first time in decades. Last year, Wright shared a video on his LinkedIn profile declaring, ' There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.' He labeled climate activists as 'hysterical' and likened Democratic efforts to combat global warming to Soviet-style communism. He has also written extensively about the need for increased fossil fuel production 'to lift people out of poverty.' Wright’s appointment isn’t surprising, as Trump raised hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions from the oil and gas industry and pledged to free it from regulations, despite the U.S. reaching record-high oil production under U.S. President Joe Biden. Though Wright has no political experience, his style aligns with Trump’s. In 2019, he famously drank a liquid used in drilling on camera to prove it wasn’t harmful. He will replace outgoing energy secretary Jennifer Granholm, an advocate for electric vehicles and green energy. Trump also announced that one of his personal attorneys, Will Scharf, will serve as White House chief of staff. Scharf, a former federal prosecutor, was part of Trump’s legal team in his successful bid to secure broad immunity from the Supreme Court. The day after Trump’s victory, Scharf tweeted 'Bye Jack,' referring to special counsel Jack Smith, who is concluding investigations against Trump.

Saudi festival featuring J.Lo criticized amid Gaza war, destructi...	As Gaza war rages, Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Season, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, comes under fire; performance by Jennifer Lopez in revealing outfit sparks accusations of undermining country's cultural values and sanctity Saudi Arabia hosted the Arab-Islamic Summit last week and has been holding a vastly different event for over a month. On Oct. 12, the kingdom launched 'Riyadh Season,' a massive festival that runs through March 2025. Featuring concerts, cultural shows, fashion events, culinary experiences, and sports activities for all ages, the festival spans multiple zones in Riyadh, each offering attractions such as theme parks, restaurants, exhibitions, and manicured gardens, including a zoo. Launched in 2019, Riyadh Season is part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, an initiative to diversify the kingdom’s economy by promoting tourism and reducing reliance on oil revenue. Each year, the festival draws millions of visitors. During its first month this year, it has hosted prominent Arab and international celebrities. The festival is spearheaded by Turki Al-Sheikh, chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority. While widely praised online, this year’s event has drawn sharp criticism due to ongoing wars in the region and the festival’s content. Critics argue that holding such celebrations amid the prolonged wars in Gaza and Lebanon is tone-deaf. A similar backlash arose during Riyadh Season 2023, which launched last October during the early days of the Israel-Hamas war. Critics used hashtags like 'Gaza is destroyed, Riyadh celebrates' to condemn the festivities. Despite this, last year’s festival reached a record 20 million visitors. This year’s criticism intensified after a fashion show by Lebanese designer Elie Saab, one of the season’s highlights, sparked controversy. Titled '1001 Seasons of Elie Saab,' the show fused modern aesthetics with Arab heritage, drawing inspiration from One Thousand and One Nights. It featured performances by global stars Céline Dion, Camila Cabello, and Jennifer Lopez. Lopez, in particular, faced online backlash for her revealing attire and dance routines, which some argued clashed with Saudi Arabia’s religious character as the 'Land of the Two Holy Mosques.' Critics accused the event of desecrating the kingdom’s sanctity, targeting both Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turki Al-Sheikh for hosting such performances. A user on X (formerly Twitter) shared a video of Camila Cabello from the fashion show, writing: 'Forgive us, Prophet of God, for this video. Forgive us for celebrating Riyadh’s ‘season of porn’ while Gaza fights. Where are Saudi Arabia’s free people to stand up to Turki Al-Sheikh and his thugs?' Another account criticized the event, stating, 'Where are the real stars? In the sky,' referencing the wars in Gaza and Lebanon.

Iran planned to assassinate former Canadian justice minister, rep...	Canadian authorities say foiled plot against human rights and anti-IRGC advocate Irwin Cotler, whose daughter served as a Knesset member in Israel; Tehran denies allegations Canadian authorities foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate Prof. Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian justice minister and the stepfather of former Knesset member Michal Cotler-Wunsh, the Foreign Ministry's special envoy for combating antisemitism and delegitimization. Cotler, who currently chairs the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and is a vocal critic of Iran, received a warning about an immediate threat to his life on October 26. According to the Globe and Mail, Canadian police identified two suspects in the plot, though no further details about the investigation have been disclosed. The 84-year-old Cotler has been under tight security since the October 7 massacre due to his vocal support for Israel. Serving as Canada’s justice minister from 2003 to 2006, he retired from politics in 2015. His daughter was elected to the Knesset in 2020 as part of the Blue and White party, serving less than a year. Since October 7, Cotler's security has included armored vehicles and an escort of armed officers. However, the alert he received at the end of last month was clear and unambiguous saying his life was in danger and an assassination attempt could be made against him by Iranian agents operating in Canada within 48 hours. While Cotler is accustomed to threats due to his pro-Israel stance, the incident has placed him at the center of an international saga involving terrorism, diplomacy and the ongoing fight for human rights. Since stepping down as justice minister, Cotler has become a prominent figure in combating antisemitism and hate crimes. The Raoul Wallenberg Centre he leads — named after the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust — focuses on fighting oppressive regimes and institutionalized violence. Cotler’s activism includes extensive campaigns to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. These efforts culminated in June when Canada officially classified the IRGC as such — a move that was met with outrage in Tehran. Cotler has also long represented Iranian political prisoners, including prominent activists opposing the Islamic regime. Allegations against the Iranian regime aren’t without precedent, as several Iranian plots to target political leaders and activists worldwide have been uncovered over the past year. Just this month, the U.S. Department of Justice revealed a foiled Iranian plan to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump prior to the elections. Iran’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the allegations, labeling them a 'reprehensible fabrication' attributed to Israel and regime opponents, without providing detailed responses to the claims.

IDF reserve officer flees Cyprus over possible war crimes allegat...	Authorities advise IDF officer to leave Cyprus and return to Israel after pro-Palestinian groups use social media footage from his service in Gaza to request arrest on alleged ‘genocide’ charges An IDF reserve officer who served in Gaza was forced to leave Cyprus and return to Israel over the weekend at the urging of the Foreign and Justice Ministries, fearing that pro-Palestinian organizations in the country might pursue arrest warrants against him for alleged war crimes. The decision followed revelations that the officer had uploaded videos from Gaza to social media over the past year, including footage in which he appeared to boast about his actions. In one video, for instance, he said, 'We're here in Rafah — we won’t stop until we burn all of Gaza.' The reservist, identified as A.L., posted videos documenting his service in Gaza during the war. Last week, he also shared that he and his wife were traveling to Cyprus for a vacation. This announcement became the basis for pro-Palestinian organizations, including the Belgian group March 30, to seek an arrest warrant. The group tracks Israeli soldiers with the intent to prosecute them in Europe for alleged war crimes. The group filed an official complaint with Cypriot authorities accusing the soldier, based on the videos he posted, of war crimes and 'genocide' in Gaza. 'We demand his arrest and investigation,' the group said. Other organizations, such as the Hind Rajab Foundation, joined the complaint and provided links to the reservist’s videos as evidence. Israeli authorities closely monitored the situation. The Foreign Ministry, in coordination with the Justice Ministry and Israel’s embassy in Cyprus, contacted A.L. and advised him to leave the country. Ultimately, it was decided he should return to Israel immediately to avoid potential legal complications. The urgency may have been heightened by an X post from the Hind Rajab Foundation, which read, 'Cyprus has officially opened an investigation into the case and has communicated this to our legal team. This is a step in the right direction. We now hope that Cyprus will stand firm against the inevitable political pressure and hold/interrogate the suspect.' After returning to Israel, A.L. posted on social media: 'We’ll share later what we’ve been through and what a miracle it is that we’re back here, two days earlier than originally planned.' Sources familiar with the case criticized A.L. for acting irresponsibly by posting incriminating footage from his reserve service, reportedly in violation of IDF orders. They also faulted the IDF for failing to enforce stricter guidelines to prevent such posts, which they said expose Israel to legal challenges and harm its international standing.

Hezbollah rocket kills 1, injures 5 in northern Arab town	Emergency services report firefighters rescued woman trapped in apartment hit by rocket, but she later succumbed to her wounds; several others sustained minor injuries in attack A Hezbollah rocket struck the northern Israeli town of Shfar’am on Monday, killing one woman and injuring at least five others, Magen David Adom (MDA) Director Eli Bin reported on Monday. Paramedics rescued the woman from an apartment hit directly by the rocket but were unable to save her despite resuscitation efforts. 'Unfortunately, a woman was killed as a result of a direct hit on a residential building,' said Rami Suwaed, a United Hatzalah paramedic who responded to the scene. 'We also assisted over 20 residents with various injuries, some of whom were evacuated by ambulance.' The IDF reported that approximately five projectiles were launched from Lebanon, with interception attempts made. The IDF confirmed that some projectiles hit Israeli territory. The rocket attack comes as the military intensifies its campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut, with airstrikes pounding the capital’s Dahieh district. Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that damage in Dahieh has reached an estimated $630 million, with rebuilding across Lebanon after Israeli strikes projected to cost $3 billion—matching the toll of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. The ongoing fighting continues against the backdrop of efforts to secure a cease-fire deal in Lebanon mediated by the U.S., to which Israel has agreed. Hezbollah submitted its response to the cease-fire proposal presented by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, Lebanon's LBCI channel reported late on Sunday. Hochstein is due to arrive in Beirut as early as Tuesday and receive the official Lebanese position.

Ben-Gvir says AG out to get him in alleged ‘criminal scandal'	National security minister claims Gali Baharav-Miara instructed aides to ‘find something’ on him; Smotrich calls for her dismissal over ‘hostile conduct’; Netanyahu, who had previously opposed efforts to remove her, reportedly reconsidering dismissal National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir accused Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara on Monday of orchestrating politically motivated investigations against him, escalating his ongoing clash with the judiciary. Speaking at a meeting of his Otzma Yehudit party, Ben-Gvir claimed to expose a 'serious criminal scandal,' alleging that Baharav-Miara sought to target him for his controversial policy of distributing firearms. According to Ben-Gvir, a deputy in the attorney general’s office visited the police’s Lahav 433 anti-corruption unit months ago to initiate a probe into his firearm distribution initiative. When investigators reportedly found no grounds for an inquiry, Ben-Gvir claimed Baharav-Miara demanded a more aggressive approach, allegedly instructing her deputies to 'find something' against him. The Attorney General denied the accusations, calling them baseless and unsupported by evidence. 'There is no truth to these claims,' Baharav-Miara said in a statement. In a social media post following his remarks, Ben-Gvir challenged Baharav-Miara to take a lie detector test. 'Gali, let’s you and I go to a polygraph,' he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Ben-Gvir accused the attorney general of weaponizing investigations against politicians, alleging that her actions amount to a 'targeted assassination' of his political career. He further claimed she aims to undermine the government and democracy itself, pointing to past investigations of officials close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as evidence. 'She allowed the previous government to do whatever it wanted,' Ben-Gvir said. 'As a government, we have no choice but to dismiss her. She is persecuting us.' Baharav-Miara, who has frequently clashed with Ben-Gvir and other members of Netanyahu’s coalition, has faced repeated calls for her removal amid accusations of overreach. However, her office insists its actions are strictly professional and impartial. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich launched a scathing attack on the attorney general, accusing her of consistently undermining the government’s agenda. 'The hostile conduct led by the attorney general is designed to challenge the government at every turn,' Smotrich said during a Cabinet meeting. He cited an incident where Baharav-Miara opposed a government decision to limit the tenure of legal advisers to seven years—a policy established in 2009. 'As always, she fights decisions to serve her personal interests, protecting her friends and funneling millions of shekels into their pockets at the expense of Israeli citizens,' Smotrich claimed. Smotrich called on Baharav-Miara to resign, accusing her of abusing her authority for political purposes. 'If you have a shred of integrity, step down as attorney general, take off your judicial robes and pursue your political battles in a democratic manner from Kaplan Street,' he said, referring to weekly anti-government protests in Tel Aviv. 'Only then can we prevent the erosion of public trust in the justice system and stop the deepening divide among the people.' A senior government official told Ynet that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had previously resisted efforts to remove Baharav-Miara from her post, may now be reconsidering. 'Something has changed,' the official said. Netanyahu is reportedly emboldened by recent military successes in Gaza and the change of administration in the United States. He also noted the relative calm following the controversial dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant earlier this month. Advisers close to Netanyahu are urging him to act, describing Baharav-Miara as a 'major obstacle' to advancing key legislation, including proposed laws related to military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men.

Saudi prince's 'genocide' accusation against Israel 'intended to ...	Over-the-top anti-Israel statement' result of Saudi recognition normalization and possible defense treaty with Washington won't be achieved soon due to ongoing war in Gaza and presidential transition in US, security expert says Arab and Muslim leaders concluded a landmark summit in Riyadh last week, where they addressed the pressing issues facing the region, including the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and southern Lebanon and the evolving roles of Iran and the United States following Donald Trump’s recent reelection. In their closing statement, all 57 leaders participating in the Extraordinary Arab and Islamic Summit called for a return to the 1967 borders and unanimously emphasized the importance of establishing a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite his country’s ongoing efforts to bridge gaps and pursue normalization with Israel, which has long been a goal of the United States, referred to Israel’s actions in Gaza as a 'collective genocide.' 'The over-the-top anti-Israel statement of the summit was a result of the Saudi recognition that normalization and a possible defense treaty with Washington will not be achieved soon due to the ongoing war in Gaza and the presidential transition in America,' explained John Hannah, senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). 'This rhetoric is functional to placate the public and Iran. These regimes are experts at providing something for public consumption and then doing the exact opposite way later on.' Following the summit, Hamas called on Arab and Muslim nations to translate their pledges into concrete actions, urging immediate efforts to halt Israeli aggression. 'The establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital would require more immediate efforts and practical solutions to force (Israel) to stop its aggression and genocide against our people,' Hamas declared in a statement. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati cautioned that his country is enduring an 'existential' crisis and subtly criticized foreign interference, with an implied reference to Iran. Meanwhile, Israeli officials such as Prime Minister Netanyahu dismissed the idea of a Palestinian state, calling it 'unrealistic.' On Monday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich went further by pledging to push for annexing parts of the West Bank by 2025, stirring additional controversy. 'These meetings were just another example of trying to whitewash Saudi’s position by talking about Palestinian rights, but in reality, Saudi Arabia has proven to be on Israel’s side, as well as America’s,' argued Hugh Miles, founder of Arab Digest. 'Qatar has stolen the limelight diplomatically over these months, so Saudi Arabia is looking for ways to please Donald Trump and Israel—Saudi shares strong ties with Trump and his family, particularly his son-in-law Kushner. So, the kingdom feels shielded in many ways with this administration,' he added. Saudi Arabia occupies a unique position, balancing its strong ties with the U.S. while simultaneously reopening dialogue with Iran, a nation it has traditionally viewed as a regional threat. 'Saudi Arabia is clearly afraid of Iran, and these meetings are a way to please it somehow and avoid a bigger threat to the country, which could jeopardize the existence of the monarchy directly,' commented Joshua Teitelbaum, professor at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. 'Iran is in a very powerful position. They can close the Strait of Hormuz and plunge the world economy into crisis with one press of a button. They can also affect Saudi’s economy and even drag the kingdom into a regional war if they want to. Everything is intertwined right now: If Israel somehow loses the war, the Saudi monarchy might not survive either,' added Miles. Despite claims of retaliatory intentions over the past month, Iran has yet to respond directly to Israel, raising questions about its strategic calculus under increasing American pressure in the region. 'No doubt Iranians are nervous and shaken by Trump. The regime is more vulnerable than ever, and its ‘insurance policies’—such as its proxies—have been gradually weakened. The Iranian attacks didn’t manage to damage Israel at all, while Israel succeeded in harming the regime’s air defenses. Even the country’s economy is in shambles, and the regime has lost legitimacy in front of its people. So, of course, from now on, they must be very careful,' concluded Hannah. 'The Arab and Muslim world is winning, while Israel is slowly losing the war, both due to its internal divisions and the impact of BDS and criticism against its war crimes,' Miles concluded. 'The Middle East is about to change drastically, and Zionism could cease to exist in the process.' The story is written by Giorgia Valente and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.

Can war bring security to the north? Ynet's senior defense analys...	Ron Ben Yishai says success of the military's ground offensive to remove an immediate threat from the Galilee is evident, but Israel must insist on extensive authority of the international community to ensure Hezbollah's compliance with terms of the cease-fire While the IDF completes its mission in South Lebanon, assigned to it by the government, and amid advanced negotiations for a cease-fire that would end the war in the north and allow residents evacuated from their homes to return after more than a year, and allow rebuilding of destroyed communities to begin, questions mount about what the day after the war will look like. 'Before traveling to Washington and Moscow, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer should have come here to see the reality on the ground, Metula Mayor David Azulay said recently. Ynet's senior defense analyst Ron Ben Yishai says the IDF has been removing roadblocks that prevented civilians from approaching areas near the border, that were under Hezbollah anti-tank missile fire. This, he explains, indicates the military's operations in South Lebanon have been successful in removing the immediate threat. The IDF has neutralized most of Hezbollah's armaments but, more than that, the troops have prevented the flow of arms to the south. What remains a problem is Hezbollah's use of attack drones. Ben Yishai says Israel is under attack from Lebanon but also Iraq and Yemen. Those drones can be intercepted because they are detected early and are intercepted away from Israel's borders, but the drones launched from within Lebanon are more of a challenge. Even when a drone launch is detected and followed as it makes its way through Israeli territory, there is a risk of shooting it down over populated areas because of the explosives it carries. The cease-fire agreement nearing its final stages, that would end the fighting in Lebanon, is a good one, according to Ben Yishai. But Israel must insist that an international commission is set up to oversee the implementation of the cease-fire terms. If such a commission is given the proper authority, there is no need to insist on written assurances from the U.S. that the IDF would have the freedom to operate against Hezbollah if the need arises. Ben Yishai criticized the new defense minister for his lack of understanding of the current situation after Israel Katz announced that elimination of Hezbollah is one of the objectives of the war. 'What he should have said was that Israel must demand that Hezbollah is relieved of its heavy weapons south of the Litani River,' according to Ben Yishai. He said when Lebanese villagers return to the south, Hezbollah operatives, many who are themselves residents of those villages, will return with them. What must be prevented is Hezbollah's ability to rebuild its infrastructure under the homes in those villages. The IDF operation caused the destruction of over 60% of the homes in the villages because they were used as launch pads for attack or had tunnels and fortifications build bellow them where Hezbollah sored their massive arsenal or rockets and missiles.

This is Iran's next supreme leader, Ali Kamenei's 2nd son	Reports from Tehran suggest that Mojtaba Khamenei, the second son of Iran’s current supreme leader, was secretly chosen to succeed his father following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, previously considered the frontrunner Mojtaba Khamenei, 55, the second son of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has reportedly been secretly chosen as his father’s successor, according to a report by opposition-affiliated news outlet Iran International. The report published on Sunday suggests Mojtaba could assume the role even before his 85-year-old father’s death, as the elder Khamenei is rumored to be gravely ill. The supreme leader is traditionally selected by the Assembly of Experts, an 88-member clerical body elected every eight years by the public but vetted by the Guardian Council, whose members are directly or indirectly appointed by the supreme leader. Speculation over Khamenei’s successor intensified in May after a helicopter crash involving former President Ebrahim Raisi, who had been considered the frontrunner for the role. While Raisi had not denied ambitions for the position, the crash is believed to have altered the political landscape. A powerful but controversial figure Mojtaba Khamenei, a cleric like his father, was born in Mashhad and is married with two children. He is a shadowy figure with significant influence among his father’s loyalists. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the family moved to Tehran, where Mojtaba attended a high school for children of the leaders of the revolution. His father’s political rise culminated in his presidency in 1981. Mojtaba served in the Iran-Iraq War during the 1980s, forging ties with individuals who would later become prominent figures in Iran’s security apparatus, including Hossein Taeb, a senior official in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Over the years, Mojtaba has drawn international attention. In 2019, the United States accused him of collaborating closely with the IRGC and the Basij, a paramilitary volunteer force under the IRGC, to further his father’s destabilizing regional ambitions. Domestically, Mojtaba has faced allegations of suppressing dissent. In 2009, he backed Taeb, then the Basij commander, in the violent crackdown on Green Movement protesters. He was also targeted by demonstrators during the protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being detained by the morality police for allegedly failing to properly wear her hijab. Critics in Iran argue that Mojtaba lacks the religious credentials and managerial experience to succeed his father. Some clerics and commentators have dismissed the idea of dynastic succession as un-Islamic, likening it to monarchy. While Mojtaba is seen as a leading candidate, other figures have been mentioned as possible successors, including cleric and politician Mohammad Mehdi Mirbagheri and cleric Ali Reza Arafi. Former President Hassan Rouhani and Sadeq Larijani, the former judiciary chief, have also been named as having ambitions for the role. The reliability of the Iran International report is unclear. The outlet, which broadcasts in Persian and has ties to Saudi Arabia and Iranian opposition groups, often focuses on anti-regime narratives. However, the secrecy surrounding succession planning in Tehran makes the situation opaque. Analysts suggest the IRGC will likely work to block any candidate it deems unsuitable.

Palestinian NGO to ask UK court to block sending F-35 parts to Is...	Britain is allowing parts for F-35 fighter jets to be exported to Israel even though they could be used in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza, lawyers for a Palestinian rights group told a London court on Monday. West Bank-based Al-Haq, which documents alleged rights violations by Israel and the Palestinian Authority, is taking legal action against Britain's Department for Business and Trade at London's High Court. Al-Haq's case comes after Britain in September suspended 30 of 350 arms export licenses, though it exempted the indirect export of F-35 parts, citing the impact on the global F-35 program. Al-Haq argues that decision was unlawful as there is a clear risk F-35s could be used in breach of international humanitarian law. A full hearing of Al-Haq's legal challenge is likely to be heard early in 2025.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj4ssn00m1g	2024-11-18T03:39:34-08:00

Hezbollah demands changes to proposed cease-fire deal	Terror group rejects terms including German, UK participation in commission overseeing implementation of agreement; Lebanese outlet opposing Hezbollah says commission to have vast authority over Lebanon's airport, sea ports and borders Hezbollah is demanding modifications to the cease-fire agreement being negotiated by U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein, local media reported on Monday. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper, the Iran-backed terror group submitted its response to the proposal to Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and care-taker Prime Minister Najib Mikati. The newspaper claimed Israel was hoping that Hezbollah would reject the deal so that the war could continue. Sources told al Akhbar that the wording of the Lebanese response to Hochstein is nearing completion and will be delivered to the American embassy in Beirut ahead of the envoy's expected arrival on Tuesday. 'The positive ambiguity is Lebanon's way to deal with the American proposal,' sources reportedly said. The questions that were expected to upend the negotiations were resolved and there is a wide birth left. 'The negotiations became serious and Netanyahu was under doubled pressure to stop the fighting,' according to the report. Political sources told the publication that Hezbollah's response was in line with the 2006 UN resolution 1701 and that Hochstein will not announce an agreement during his visit and will only relay the Lebanese response to the Israelis. But officials in Lebanon believe that even if a deal can be agreed, there would be difficulties in implementing it. Hezbollah rejected the participation of Germany and the UK in the committee overseeing the implementation of the cease-fire deal but agreed to American and French involvement. 'This is a critical week, there will either be a cease-fire agreement within days or the fighting would continue until mid-January,' the officials said, referring to the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Western officials said they believe the 'positive openness in Lebanon will help pressure Israel to implement the deal.' According to the Lebanese daily Nidaa al-Watan (Call of the Nation), which does not support Hezbollah, the pending deal delivered to Lebanon includes: • The establishment of an international commission to oversee the implementation of UN resolution 1701, headed by an American general and with the participation of a French general. • The demolition of Hezbollah military structures north and south of the Litani River. • Preserving Israel's right to intervene in case of violations of the agreement that cannot be resolved in negotiations. • Implementation of the deal either through dialogue or through force. The newspaper also reported Berri's response may not be a resounding yes or no, which would not be enough for the Americans or the Israelis, who insist on a positive Lebanese response, and that even if a cease-fire is agreed upon, there would be complications as a result of the agreement and the difficulties would continue. The Al Joumhouria newspaper, which opposes Hezbollah, revealed more information about the proposed deal than previously reported, including a Hezbollah withdrawal north of the Litani while the IDF would withdraw its troops from south Lebanese villages, the return of displaced civilians on both sides of the border and the strengthening of peacekeeping forces and the Lebanese army. The newspaper also reported the establishment of an international commission but said that, in addition to the U.S., France and the UK, an unnamed Arab country also would participate. The commission's authorities will be vast and will include oversight of strategic instillations in Lebanon, including the international airport, the ports and border crossings. The newspaper raises the question of whether the agreement could be reached before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump assumes office, or if there is a risk of a dangerous escalation in the war. It also reports that the initial Lebanese response was already delivered but more comments would be added.

Faith meets diplomacy in Portugal with new Israel Allies Caucus	Madelena Barata: ‘The Jewish people will no longer tolerate being the scapegoat of humanity’ The Portugal Parliamentary Israel Allies Caucus launched on Monday, according to the Israel Allies Foundation (IAF). This is the organization’s 54th pro-Israel parliamentary caucus worldwide. 'The Jewish people will no longer tolerate being the scapegoat of humanity, targeted as a lightning rod for social frustration. Israel stands as the guarantor that no Jew will ever be without defense or a home,' said Madelena Barata, director of the new caucus. 'That's why it's crucial to build networks that support and protect Israel. It is especially significant that the IAF is now active in Portugal, further strengthening this global effort.' These caucuses primarily focus on faith-based diplomacy, engaging Christians and others who support Israel for religious reasons. The Portugal caucus will be bipartisan, led by representatives from two major political parties: Liana Reis of the Social Democratic Party, and Pedra Frazão of the Chega Party. Frazão emphasized Portugal’s support for the Jewish people. 'As a sovereign state, Israel ensures that no Jewish person will be left unprotected or without a homeland,' Frazão said. 'Israel's existence is a deliberate choice, embodying the strength and resilience of the Jewish people and their right to self-defense. This is not just symbolic—it is a steadfast promise to protect every Jew's right to live in peace and security.' MK Sharren Haskel, co-chair of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus and now Deputy Foreign Minister, attended the caucus launch event in Lisbon. She remarked, 'I view interpersonal diplomacy as a critical tool for building global support for Israel. 'By attending the launch of the Portugal Israel Allies Caucus in Lisbon, we are sending a powerful message of solidarity between our nations,' she continued. 'At a time when support for Israel is more vital than ever, this initiative broadcasts the voices of parliamentarians who stand with Israel. I look forward to thanking the members of the caucus for their commitment to strengthening our bilateral relationship, reinforcing our shared values, and contributing to Israel’s security.' The network of allied caucuses began in 2004 with the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus and expanded in 2006 when the U.S. Congress launched its bipartisan Congressional Israel Allies Caucus, now the largest of its kind. Today, the network spans parliaments on six continents, offering a powerful platform to strengthen ties with Israel. 'IAF Europe is evolving into a movement, acting as a diplomatic 'Iron Dome' protecting Israel from international lawfare,' said Leo van Doesburg, executive director of IAF Europe. 'Our mission is to shift politicians from anti-Israel rhetoric to fact-based dialogue. With our 20th European caucus now in Portugal, we expand our reach across Europe and look forward to strengthening partnerships.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1vvwk00zjx	2024-11-18T00:07:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/SJQvmtuMyg/SJQvmtuMyg_92_0_1443_812_0_small.jpg

Iranians divided on election of Donald Trump	Tamar Eilam Gindin: ‘On the one hand, they are afraid of Trump. On the other hand, there is a lot of happiness.’ Iranians are divided over whether the election of U.S. President Donald Trump will be beneficial or detrimental to them. 'On the one hand, they are afraid of Trump,' explained Tamar Eilam Gindin, an Iran specialist at the University of Haifa. 'On the other hand, there is a lot of happiness on social media.' Gindin noted that it’s unclear how much of the optimism comes from Iranians living inside the country versus those living abroad, but she believes there is genuine hope among some Iranians. Khamenei’s Health: Rumors Resurface Gindin also addressed reports about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's health during an interview with ILTV News on Sunday. She urged caution regarding unverified claims that Khamenei is in a coma or on his deathbed. Fresh rumors about Khamenei’s deteriorating health and the potential transfer of power to his son, Mojtaba Khamenei, last surfaced in early December 2020. As in the past, these claims were quickly denied and ultimately proved untrue. These rumors often originate from a single source that is quick to release scoops but slow to verify them, Gindin told ILTV News, adding that speculation is growing but remains unconfirmed. 'It’s not the first time we’ve heard these rumors. I would not rejoice or worry until we have confirmed reports,' she emphasized. Who Will Succeed Khamenei? If the rumors about Khamenei's health turn out to be true, the question of succession looms large. While many online speculate that Mojtaba Khamenei is the likely successor, Gindin urged caution here as well. She explained that a team of 88 experts, known as the Assembly of Experts, is responsible for selecting the next Supreme Leader. Their meetings and decisions are highly secretive, meaning it is entirely possible that someone else could emerge as the leader.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjlvkk00myg	2024-11-17T23:54:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/07/14/r1aMsEiyv/r1aMsEiyv_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg
Russian former spy warns 'start of WWIII' coming	Maria Butina, now a politician, says she hopes Trump will reverse Biden administration decision to allow Ukraine to use American missiles to attack deep inside Russian territory; 'I guess there are some people in the US who have nothing to lose, don't care' Russian lawmaker and former spy Maria Butina said on Monday that the administration of President Joe Biden was risking World War III if it had allowed Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia. 'These guys, Biden’s administration, is trying to escalate the situation to the maximum while they still have power and are still in office,' Butina said. 'I have a great hope that (President-elect Donald) Trump will overcome this decision if this has been made because they are seriously risking the start of World War III which is not in anybody’s interest,' she told Reuters. The New York Times reported on Sunday that the Biden administration has made the decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to strike deep into Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on September 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean 'the 'direct involvement' of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine' because NATO military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles. In late October, Putin said that Russia’s defense ministry was working on different ways to respond if the United States and its NATO allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with long-range Western missiles. 'I guess there are some people in the United States who have nothing to lose for whatever reason or who are completely off the grid so much that they simply do not care,' Butina, who spent 15 months in U.S. prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent, said. Donald Trump Jr., the son of president-elect Trump said in a post on X that the American 'military industrial complex' hoped to start WWIII before his father took office and had the chance to bring world peace. Leonid Eduardovich Slutsky, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Russia's lower house, the Duma, said late on Monday that the American approval of Ukraine's use of the ATACMS missiles to attack deep in Russian territory will result in a severe response and will 'lead to an inevitable escalation that will have a threat of far greater implications.'

Iran backs Lebanon’s decision to secure ceasefire with Israel	Ali Larijani: ‘We support the Resistance (axis) under all circumstances’ Iran has expressed its support for any decision taken by Lebanon to secure a ceasefire with Israel. This was conveyed by Ali Larijani, a senior advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during a visit to Damascus. Larijani emphasized Tehran's desire to see an end to a conflict that has inflicted significant damage on Hezbollah, Iran's key ally in Lebanon. 'We are not seeking to disrupt anything. We are seeking to resolve issues,' said Ali Larijani, a senior Iranian official. 'Under all circumstances, we stand in support of the people of Lebanon. 'Those who create disruption are [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and those like him. Let us recognize our friends and enemies,' he continued. 'Hezbollah is a wise movement, and the people of Lebanon are also a wise nation. They know what they are doing. 'We support the Resistance (axis) under all circumstances, but they themselves know what actions they need to take,' he concluded. Israeli Strikes Reportedly Hit Iranian Nuclear Facility Meanwhile, Axios has reported that the Israeli Air Force targeted a secret Iranian nuclear research facility during extensive airstrikes last month. Citing current and former U.S. and Israeli officials, the report claims the strikes dealt a significant blow to Iran’s nuclear program. The Parchin military complex, located about 20 kilometers southeast of Tehran, was reportedly the target. This site is believed to have been used for testing explosives necessary to trigger a nuclear device. Iran’s Delayed Retaliation and Khamenei’s Health Concerns Iran has indicated that it will delay its promised retaliation against Israel until after the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in January. Despite the delay, Tehran has vowed that an attack will occur. Over the weekend, the Islamic regime unveiled some of its latest missile and air defense systems. Adding to the tension, unconfirmed social media reports surfaced over the weekend claiming that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader, is in a coma following a serious illness. Three weeks ago, The New York Times reported that Khamenei was gravely ill, suggesting a succession battle is underway in Tehran. However, no official confirmation has been released regarding the Ayatollah's health. Khamenei was last seen publicly on November 7.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h188addz1g	2024-11-17T23:46:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/14/HJmvKgtUT/HJmvKgtUT_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Families of U.S. victims of Hamas massacre sue Iran	Forty-six American citizens, including children, were killed on October 7, 2023 and 12 others, both living and dead, are still held in Gaza; Lawsuit filed in US District Court cites Hamas documents discovered in Gaza Families of victims of the Hamas massacre on October 7 who hold American citizenship are suing Iran for it part in supporting the deadly attack on Israel. The victims include those who were killed, injured or suffered mental anguish due to the massacre. The lawsuit, filed on Sunday in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeks compensatory damages under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act, the New York Times reported. It names Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , which all appear on the U.S. list of designated foreign terrorist organizations. Forty-six American citizens, including children, were killed on October 7, 2023. Some 12 Americans were also among the 250 people taken hostage by Hamas. Seven of them still remain in captivity, at least thee who are believed to be dead. More than 30 American Israeli citizens serving in the IDF have been killed in Gaza, and some of their families also are parties to the lawsuit. The lawsuit cites Hamas documents discovered in Gaza, as well as documents obtained by the Americans' lawyers regarding a secret meeting of Hamas leaders in December 2022m, in which Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar requests an additional $7 million a month from the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps for the 'big project,' referring to the October 7 attack, according to the New York Times, which reviewed the documents. The lawsuit was filed by several lawyers, including Lee Wolosky, and Gary M. Osen, who once represented Nazi victims. Lawsuits are frequently filed against Iran in U.S. courts, and the cases are often won via default judgements.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvujdumje	2024-11-17T23:18:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/21/H1C9Jlfwa/H1C9Jlfwa_0_216_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham in region to jumpstart Saudi norma...	Graham expected to travel to Riyadh after meeting in Israel with Netanyahu and other officials; Says establishing Saudi-Israel ties vital to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham arrived in Israel for talks with officials. Graham, a close ally of president-elect Donald Trump, plans to travel to Saudi Arabia later as part of his tour of the region. The senator, who touched down in Israel over the weekend, hopes to restart negotiations for a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that has stalled after the October 7 massacre and the ensuing war, even before Trump takes office, to ensure a two-thirds Senate majority to pass the U.S.-Saudi defense pact. Graham met with former defense minister Yoav Gallant and the two discussed the threat from Iran and normalization with Riyadh. 'It was an important meeting,' Gallant said. 'Lindsey Gram is a true friend and avid supporter of Israel who invests many efforts to strengthen Israel's regional position and bolster its security amid threats primarily from Iran. We discussed the vital need to use the short window of opportunity that has opened for forging agreements that would strengthen Israel and weaken Iran and help reach a path that will enable the return of the hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza.' Graham met earlier with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Expressing his concern about Iran's breakthrough to nuclear capability, Graham told the prime minister: 'Do whatever you must to prevent the Iranian ayatollahs from obtaining nuclear weapons,' the Prime Minister's office (PMO) reported after the meeting. In Graham's view 'an Iranian ayatollah armed with nuclear weapons is an existential threat to Israel and a nightmare for the world. They consistently refer to the United States as the 'big Satan.' It is in the interest of the U.S. to ensure the Iranian regime does not possess nuclear weapons. This is a critical and dangerous time for our friends in Israel and in the entire world. It is vital for the United States to be seen and heard having Israel's back amid the threats from Iran.'
