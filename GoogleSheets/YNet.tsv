Iran says 2025 'important year' for nuclear issue	Tehran braces for renewed US 'maximum pressure' policies under Trump administration; amid concerns over potential sanctions and military actions, Iranian rial hits all-time low, reflecting growing economic uncertainty Iran, bracing for a possible re-imposition of incoming U.S. president Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' policy, said on Saturday that 2025 would be an important year for its nuclear issue. Trump in 2018 reneged on a deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of U.S. and UN economic sanctions. '2025 will be an important year regarding Iran's nuclear issue,' Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Beijing, adding in remarks aired by Iran's state TV that he had discussed the issue in talks with his Chinese counterpart. He did not mention Trump by name, however, or spell out how the year might be significant. Iranian leaders' main concern may be that Trump could empower Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its crucial oil industry. The Iranian rial on Saturday hit a new all-time low against the U.S. dollar amid uncertainty about Trump's arrival in the White House on Jan. 20.

IDF arrests over 240 terror suspects in raid on northern Gaza hos...	Military says forces encountered resistance, including anti-tank fire from terrorists, during targeted operation against Hamas command center located inside Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya The IDF announced Saturday that it had arrested more than 240 suspects during a targeted operation against a Hamas command center located inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. The military said the operation, coordinated with the Shin Bet, was based on intelligence indicating the hospital was being used for military activities in violation of international law. The detainees included members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), as well as 15 individuals implicated in the October 7 attacks on Israel. Among those arrested were engineering and anti-tank missile operatives and the hospital's director, who is suspected of being a Hamas operative. Some detainees reportedly attempted to evade capture by posing as patients or fleeing in ambulances. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF said that prior to the operation, 350 patients, medical staff and caregivers were evacuated from the hospital in coordination with the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). The hospital had been supplied with tens of thousands of liters of fuel, food and medical supplies in recent weeks to ensure its functionality. During the operation, another 95 patients and staff were relocated to the Indonesian Hospital, which received additional fuel, generators and medical equipment. Civilians in the vicinity were also evacuated through designated routes for safety. According to the IDF, the 401st Armored Brigade secured the hospital perimeter, while Shayetet 13 special forces conducted precision operations inside the facility, confiscating weapons, including grenades, guns and other military equipment. Troops faced resistance during the operation, including anti-tank fire from terrorists. IDF forces neutralized the attackers, and the Israeli Air Force struck terrorists attempting to flee. No Israeli casualties were reported. The IDF said that intelligence gathered during the initial questioning of detainees confirmed their involvement in terrorist activities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfpgjpryg	2024-12-28T07:29:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/28/Hk11oTzipr1e/Hk11oTzipr1e_169_2_1112_627_0_small.jpg
Report: Iran’s Revolutionary Guard plotted to lure and kidnap Isr...	Former political prisoner in Armenia reveals IRGC planned to lure Iran International reporter Babak Eshaghi and another journalist to Turkey-Iran border region; Eshaghi to Ynet: 'I trust my country’s intelligence and security services' The opposition news outlet IranWire reported Saturday that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) planned to kidnap Babak Eshaghi, an Israeli journalist working for the Saudi-funded opposition channel Iran International. According to IranWire, the IRGC devised a scheme to lure several Iran International journalists to a border region near Iran and abduct them into Iranian territory. The outlet based its report on details from the interrogation of Mohammad Hashemzadeh, a former Iranian political prisoner currently detained in Armenia. The investigation revealed that members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard pressured Hashemzadeh and an associate to lure several Iran International journalists to a border city near Iran, where they would be abducted into the Islamic Republic. Hashemzadeh, originally from the southeastern Iranian city of Bandar Abbas, relocated to Armenia after working in Antalya, Turkey. During his interrogation in Armenia, he disclosed that while imprisoned in Iran, Revolutionary Guard operatives tried to persuade him and his cellmate—who was formerly a friend of Eshaghi—to entice Eshaghi and another Iran International reporter to travel to the border city for the abduction. According to the report, the plan failed due to the refusal of Hashemzadeh and his cellmate, Mehdi Behnam, who had been sentenced to five years in prison in Iran. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response to Ynet, Eshaghi said: 'This is not the first time the Islamic regime in Iran has tried to harm Iran International journalists. We are the free, true and independent voice of news in Iran and the world. A few months ago, regime operatives stabbed my colleague Pouria Zarati in London, and last year, there was a revealed plan to attack our channel’s building and harm our journalists. As an Israeli journalist, I trust my country’s intelligence and security services. I will continue my work with the channel.' Iran International has long been a target of the Iranian regime, particularly since its intensive coverage of the widespread protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. The channel’s satellite broadcasts allowed it to reach audiences inside Iran, further amplifying its influence. According to the Daily Mail, Tehran labeled the channel a 'terrorist organization' in December 2022. That same month, British broadcaster ITV revealed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had plotted to assassinate two Iran International TV hosts, Sima Sabet and Farhad Farahzad, in 2022, in knife attacks outside their homes, similar to the stabbing of Zarati. The Daily Mail reported that the assassins were offered more than £150,000 for the job, but the plot was thwarted when one of the would-be attackers turned into a double agent. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by72h9ahyl	2024-12-28T06:42:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/28/SJPVMKpByl/SJPVMKpByl_200_109_1016_572_0_small.jpg

Cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah on verge of collapse?	Hezbollah accuses Israel of exploiting the fragile ceasefire as Israeli forces continue targeting southern Lebanon's terror infrastructure; Amid rising tensions, Lebanon warns of the agreement's collapse while Hezbollah hints it may intervene if Israeli operations persist, threatening renewed conflict in the region Lebanese network Al-Akhbar, closely aligned with Hezbollah, reported on Saturday morning that concerns over the fragility of the ceasefire are growing as it enters its second month, citing Israeli military activities in border villages as a potential tipping point. Serving as a mouthpiece for the Lebanese militant group, the network stated that while Hezbollah remains committed to the ceasefire, it has begun signaling that it will not hesitate to act on Lebanon’s 'right to self-defense' as stipulated in the agreement. According to Al-Akhbar, Hezbollah has warned that if Lebanon’s official security forces fail to curb what it describes as Israeli 'attacks,' the group will intervene directly. Hezbollah’s representative in the Lebanese parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, accused Israel of exploiting the ceasefire to implement plans for destruction and aggression in the border villages. He placed responsibility on the Lebanese state, the international monitoring committee established after the ceasefire, UNIFIL, the Lebanese Army, and the various countries involved in the agreement. 'We, the people of southern Lebanon, the resistance, Hezbollah’s supporters across Dahieh and the Bekaa, have never needed proof that resistance is a national necessity,' Fadlallah declared. In a morning editorial, Al-Akhbar’s editor, Ibrahim Al-Amin, argued for the necessity of resisting what he called Israeli violations. He claimed that a loophole in the ceasefire allows Israel to act with impunity while the monitoring forces lack the authority to stop its actions in border areas. Al-Amin further alleged that while the Lebanese Army has expressed concern to the Americans over Israel’s actions, the U.S. has dismissed these complaints. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati reportedly told the U.S. that Israeli operations threaten the agreement but received no meaningful response. Similarly, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri conveyed concerns to Washington, warning Israel’s actions could legitimize military responses from Hezbollah. According to Al-Amin, Israel has destroyed twice as much in border villages over the past month as it did during 14 months of prior conflict, preventing residents from returning to their homes and restricting ambulance and civil defense teams from recovering bodies. He asserted that Israel’s actions are restoring the legitimacy of resistance, whether by Hezbollah or other groups, adding that while people are weary of war, the cost of confrontation with Israeli forces would be less than the cost of continued Israeli actions. IDF operations continue across the border Hezbollah’s grievances arise from the fact that, despite the ceasefire, IDF has continued ground operations aimed at clearing southern Lebanese villages of terrorist infrastructure. IDF announced on Friday that the 226th Brigade, under the command of the 146th Division, remains active in the area while adhering to the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon. Forces are currently operating in the westernmost village of Al-Naqoura, where dozens of Hezbollah terror infrastructures used for attacks against Israel have been uncovered. Troops discovered military equipment and weapons stored in civilian buildings, including a building disguised as a pharmacy that contained explosives, RPG missiles, and AK-47s. Additional finds included rockets, mortars, and launchers aimed at Israeli territory, as well as a truck carrying 40 rocket tubes. All the equipment was confiscated and destroyed. Al-Akhbar regularly reports on Israeli operations in southern Lebanon, where, under the ceasefire agreement, armed forces not officially affiliated with Lebanon’s military are not permitted to operate. Nonetheless, IDF continues to identify and target terror-related sites in the region, with occasional airstrikes resulting in casualties. Recent strikes have targeted rocket launchers, significant weapons caches, smuggling routes, and armed militants. A delicate agreement on shaky ground Hezbollah has largely refrained from responding to Israeli strikes since the ceasefire, with the exception of one mortar attack on Mount Dov earlier this month. The group suffered significant losses during the conflict, particularly in its final months, which included the elimination of senior leadership and IDF ground maneuvers in southern Lebanon. While IDF operations have continued post-ceasefire, their intensity has decreased substantially, likely contributing to Hezbollah’s apparent interest in preserving the current status quo to avoid reigniting the conflict. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Lebanese Army, now deployed in villages across southern Lebanon, claims to have dismantled terrorist infrastructure in recent days. Meanwhile, IDF remains in border areas, actively targeting Hezbollah operatives who violate the ceasefire. In the past month alone, over 40 Hezbollah operatives have reportedly been killed, adding to the approximately 3,000 militants killed and 7,000 wounded over the past year—roughly a third of Hezbollah’s estimated 30,000 combatants. In areas where the Lebanese Army has established control, IDF has withdrawn back to Israeli territory. However, Israeli forces continue engineering operations to destroy Hezbollah bunkers and internal combat tunnels. IDF clarified this week that the initial 60-day ceasefire period is not a 'sacred deadline' and that implementation of the agreement’s stages will proceed gradually under U.S. oversight. For the first time, the United States is leading the enforcement mechanism for the ceasefire, described as operating under an 'American umbrella.' The fragile ceasefire remains precariously balanced, with both sides closely monitoring each other’s actions. While Hezbollah appears to be avoiding direct confrontation, its rhetoric and warnings suggest that any perceived overreach by Israel could risk pulling the region back into conflict. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byifdrpbje	2024-12-28T00:59:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/ByffmWGnSyl/ByffmWGnSyl_1_124_1601_901_0_small.jpg

WZO Chairman speaks about one of the most challenging times to be...	Following the loss of his brother-in-law during the Nova party on October 7, the head of the World Zionist Organization has taken on a project of revitalizing the Gaza border region by introducing not only evacuated residents, but bringing those who wish to make aliyah as well, because overseas, 'Jews are afraid to walk the streets' Yaakov Hagoel, Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, lost his brother-in-law, Assaf Schlesinger, a paramedic at the Nova music festival, on October 7. In an interview with 'Mamon' section of Yedioth Ahronoth, he speaks for the first time about the painful family tragedy, shares insights on a complex $407 million project to rehabilitate the north and south of Israel and addresses why the World Zionist Organization is still relevant 76 years after the establishment of a Jewish state. And what does Hagoel, a longtime Likud member, have to say to Miki Zohar, who is working to replace him? 'Miki's attempts are a testament to the influence and power I hold. It’s unfortunate that during a time of war, when there is so much to do, I’m dragged into dealing with this.' How do you cope with such a situation? 'These were the hardest days our family has ever faced. We went from hospital to hospital amidst the terrible chaos. During the shiva, the rabbi who came to visit me mentioned that it was his seventh shiva that day. My brother-in-law left behind twins, a boy and a girl. My personal experience with this family tragedy connects me to the suffering of the families of those kidnapped. When I speak with them, I’m reminded of the heavy sense of uncertainty and fog that envelopes you. It’s extremely difficult. My eldest son served over 100 days in Gaza, took a brief leave to attend his son's Brit Milah, and returned to reserve duty. My daughter-in-law’s family also suffered a loss during the war—a cousin who was killed at Nahal Oz. We went from one funeral to the next. Our nation is in trauma.' Yaakov Hagoel assumed his role four years ago for a five-year term, amid one of the most difficult and challenging times for Jewish communities around the globe. 'Since October 7, attitudes toward the World Zionist Organization have shifted. There is greater awareness of our activities and goals. Antisemitic incidents worldwide have surged dramatically. We are witnessing an eightfold increase in Antisemitic events, amounting to hundreds of such incidents per day globally. The most troubling issue is that many Jews in the diaspora are beginning to accept this situation as normal. 'They view it as ‘the price of being Jewish outside Israel.’ Even worse, many have lost faith in the ability of law enforcement in their countries to protect them. One of the most shocking recent events was the pogrom against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam. The Israeli government managed to evacuate most of the fans back to Israel in record time, but the Jewish community that remained there is experiencing a deep crisis. I sent a team to Amsterdam, and they spent Shabbat with the Jewish community. The situation was extremely distressing—they were afraid to leave their homes. 'As Israelis, we fail to grasp how deeply the sense of security for our brothers and sisters in the diaspora has been shaken. I am in daily contact with representatives of Jewish communities worldwide, and I hear repeatedly that their fears today are far greater than they’ve been in years past. Jews are afraid to walk the streets, reluctant to place mezuzahs on their doorposts. Over the past year, Jewish students have felt unsafe standing out on U.S. campuses or have preemptively chosen not to send their children to such campuses at all.' Any silver linings? 'One of the things that has strengthened me the most during this past challenging year has been witnessing thousands—literally thousands—of Jews from around the world coming here to volunteer and help, despite travel warnings and the ongoing war. They’ve been willing to assist with anything, from agricultural harvests to any task we’ve asked of them. The Jewish diaspora has also contributed an enormous sum of nearly two billion dollars over the past year to various projects in Israel. This moves me deeply and is far from something I take for granted.' What can we expect for the relationship between world Jewry and Israel after the war? 'Based on the number of immigration files that have been opened, we estimate that around 100,000 immigrants are expected to arrive in Israel after the war. Since October 7, despite the complex security situation, approximately 33,000 people have already made Aliyah. As the chairman of the Zionist movement, of course, I would be delighted if everyone chose to make Aliyah, but I respect each individual's right to decide where to live and raise their children. On one hand, I encourage Aliyah, but on the other, I support strengthening Jewish communities in the diaspora because they have the right to exist and thrive anywhere in the world.' 25 years together The World Zionist Organization (WZO) was founded in 1897 by Theodor Herzl at the First Zionist Congress. The organization owns the Jewish National Fund (Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael), holds a 50% stake in the Jewish Agency for Israel and Keren Hayesod (United Israel Appeal), and manages around 20 subsidiary companies, including the rehabilitation organization HaMashkem. With an annual budget of approximately 150 million shekels and a workforce of about 500 employees—240 of whom are emissaries stationed worldwide—the WZO oversees subsidiaries that generate millions more. 'As Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, I essentially serve as the head of a massive holding company,' says Yaakov Hagoel. It’s no surprise that numerous political figures, both within Likud and beyond, have their sights set on gaining control over the WZO. Hagoel was elected to his position following a heated internal battle within World Likud, and political circles are already preparing for the next elections slated for October 2025. This battle revolves around control of enormous budgets, high-ranking positions with significant salaries, and considerable power. Hagoel is seen as a close ally of Danny Danon in World Likud. Danon's control over World Likud and WZO institutions has drawn rivals like Miki Zohar and David Bitan, who have set their sights on these centers of power. Zohar has already signed agreements with political opponents such as Benny Gantz, Avigdor Lieberman, and even Meretz, dividing control over roles and influence in the various bodies under the WZO’s purview. 'I view Miki Zohar’s attempts to take my place as a significant indication of the influence and power I hold in this position,' says Hagoel. 'I was elected four years ago after a very intense battle. Even then, Miki Zohar, along with the Prime Minister and other senior ministers, tried to sway the elections. That battle taught me to value this role even more. I am a democrat and respect the rules of the game. It saddens me, however, that during a time of war, when there is so much to be done, I am being drawn into election matters a year ahead of time.' Could your connection to Danny Danon be working against you? 'Danny is my close friend, a dear person. We’re the same age group, and we first met in the Beitar Movement. We’ve shared a journey of over 25 years together. It’s rare in Israeli politics to have friendships that last this long. I have tremendous respect for Danny, and he reciprocates. There aren’t many people who would leave the Knesset, as Danny did, and say, ‘Friends, if I’m not a senior minister and find myself on the backbench, I’ll return to the place where I’ve made a real impact.’ And that’s what Danny did. Danny is made of the same material I am: the place where we know we can make a difference is the place we strive to be. And I’ll do everything I can to be re-elected. Once every five years, the Jewish world holds elections. Seven hundred delegates are chosen, representing the Jewish people both in Israel and the diaspora. It’s like the parliament of the Jewish people—it’s my sacred space.' Why do we still need an organization like the World Zionist Organization when a Jewish state has existed for decades? 'The State of Israel is a state for all, including the Arabs, and that’s perfectly fine. However, there are specific Jewish interests that we are responsible for, both in Israel and in the diaspora: combating Antisemitism, encouraging Aliyah, and rescuing Jews in distress. The World Zionist Organization leads projects aimed at strengthening the connection between Jews in the diaspora and the State of Israel. It actively promotes Aliyah and helps with the absorption of immigrants in Israel, supports settlement efforts, and contributes to the development of infrastructure across the country. Additionally, the WZO serves as a representative and authoritative body for the Jewish people in the international arena. It continues to play a vital role in mobilizing donations and resources for national causes.' A life of service and Zionist commitment Yaakov Hagoel, 53, is married to Tchiya and the father of four (a 16-year-old son, a 19-year-old daughter who serves as a paramedic in National Service, a 22-year-old son, and a 27-year-old son). He is also a grandfather to two. Born in Tel Aviv, his family moved to Arad when he was seven. 'My parents were true Zionists,' he says. 'Back in the 1970s, moving from the center of the country to the periphery was considered a significant step.' Hagoel began his public service career in the Betar Movement in Arad. 'As a teenager, I founded Betar in the city,' he recalls. 'Later, I was one of the first non-kibbutz members to do a year of service in Ofakim, where I founded a Betar branch when I was 18. Afterward, I joined a Betar Nahal group at Kibbutz Misgav Am. Back then, doing a year of service was something only kibbutzniks did. My whole life has been dedicated to Betar. I’ve held every position imaginable in the movement, eventually becoming its global CEO. Everything I’ve accomplished has been through my own hard work. I even met my wife through Betar. I’ve always wanted to go into politics to make an impact, though I didn’t think it would be in the Jewish world. At the time, I imagined becoming a mayor.' Leading rehabilitation efforts in the wake of the war Since the war, a central focus of the World Zionist Organization has been assisting displaced residents from northern and southern Israel and rehabilitating destroyed communities. The WZO is managing 1.5 billion shekels from the Israeli government for this extensive project. 'We’ve helped establish seven new neighborhoods for evacuees: Shfayim and Kibbutz Ruhama for residents of Kfar Aza, Karmi Gat for evacuees from Nir Oz, Hazerim for residents of Kibbutz Be’eri, with caravans for 300 families and a separate dining hall, Mishmar Ha’emek for those displaced from Nahal Oz, Ashalim for residents of Kerem Shalom, Ramat HaNegev for evacuees from Kibbutz Holit. We worked on tight schedules to ensure children could begin the school year in September. Additionally, the Settlement Division of the WZO is assisting six evacuated regional councils, encompassing a total of 47 communities.'

We turned to Jews around the world and asked for their help. The response was incredible—we received 500 keys to apartments in Israel owned by Jews living abroad. We took full responsibility for these properties, including insurance and property management, in a heartwarming project we named ‘My Home is Your Home.’ These apartments were used not only by evacuees from the Gaza border communities but also by residents of Netivot, Ofakim, and Ashkelon seeking temporary shelter. Jews even offered us their luxury homes in Rehavia, Jerusalem, for the evacuees. Some stories were incredibly touching. One Jewish family offered a home filled with valuable art pieces. I declined that offer, but it illustrates the profound solidarity among Jews worldwide.' How much have you invested in helping evacuees? 'In addition to our assistance for southern evacuees, we invested 28 million shekels in aid for evacuees in the north. It’s painful to say, but during a tour of the north, we saw that there is almost nothing left of Metula. On the way there, I also saw the Roaring Lion memorial—a landmark I know intimately from my days in the Betar Movement. It was heartbreaking to see the area in its current state. It feels just like when our parents arrived here, starting from scratch in the wilderness. A few months ago, we took on an additional responsibility: providing support to the families of hostages and returnees. This is perhaps the most sacred mission we’ve undertaken. Until then, the families of the hostages were cared for by a directorate under the Prime Minister’s Office. The WZO essentially civilianized this directorate. Colonel (Res.) Yaron Cohen, who knows every family that has experienced this unimaginable nightmare, remained in his role, joined by our appointed director, Ilan Or.' What is your vision for the future if you’re re-elected as chairman? 'In my view, the real dream isn’t just to return the residents to the Gaza border region but to bring dozens of families of new immigrants to the area to strengthen it. Immigration is not just an economic growth engine—it’s a message of hope and faith in the State of Israel. When people choose to come here despite everything, it strengthens us all. I sit in Herzl’s chair, in an office where Ben-Gurion once sat. It’s a great privilege to continue this legacy and lead the World Zionist Organization into the challenges of the 21st century.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkvjvmthkl	2024-12-27T23:01:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/07/r1Ph8NfbJJx/r1Ph8NfbJJx_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Sara Netanyahu under the scope over alleged witness harassment in...	Sara Netanyahu, the Prime Minister's wife, is under scrutiny for allegedly intimidating a key witness in her husband’s corruption trial; A TV investigation revealed messages where she reportedly pushed for a campaign against the witness, raising severe legal and ethical implications Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing potential legal trouble after allegations surfaced that she may have tried to intimidate a key witness in a corruption case against her husband. The controversy stems from an investigative report by the TV program 'Uvda,' which revealed text messages allegedly sent by Sara Netanyahu to Hani Blivis, a close aide to the Prime Minister, who was known as a powerful figure in his office. In these messages, Sara Netanyahu reportedly urged Blivis to 'go after' Hadas Klein, a key witness in Case 1000, involving accusations of the Prime Minister and his wife receiving expensive gifts, such as champagne and cigars, from billionaire Arnon Milchan in exchange for political favors. In her messages, Sara Netanyahu reportedly wrote, 'We need to go after Hadas Klein, Arnon Milchan’s secretary, who has been defaming us for years. She lies, slanders, and is vile.' Shortly after these messages were sent, negative posts about Klein began appearing on social media, raising suspicions that Sara Netanyahu may have been involved in witness harassment and obstruction of justice. This prompted Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and State Attorney Amit Isman to instruct the police to open an investigation. For the police to pursue charges, they will need to prove Sara Netanyahu had 'criminal intent'—in other words, that she intended to intimidate Hadas Klein. They will also need to establish a clear connection between the messages allegedly sent to Bleiwis and the social media posts that followed. Witness harassment, the potential charge in this case, is a criminal offense under Israeli law, punishable by up to three years in prison. To convict someone of this offense, prosecutors must demonstrate two main components: intent to harass and evidence linking the harassment to the defendant. A recent example of such a case occurred in 2018, when a man was convicted of harassing Nir Hefetz, a former spokesperson for Netanyahu and a state witness in another case. The man had sent Hefetz a threatening letter, calling him a 'snitch,' and was later sentenced to community service and a fine. This investigation into Sara Netanyahu faces a unique challenge: the phone that allegedly contained the incriminating messages belonged to Hani Blivis, who has since passed away. While the police may still use the messages as evidence if they can establish their authenticity, the defense could argue it’s impossible to verify the circumstances under which the messages were sent, creating potential doubts about the evidence’s reliability. If the investigation progresses, Sara Netanyahu will likely be summoned by the police first for an open testimony and, depending on the evidence, could face formal questioning under caution. The investigation could take months, as the police will need to gather evidence, coordinate with witnesses, and verify findings. There’s also a possibility that the investigation could expand to include other individuals who may have assisted or been involved in the alleged harassment. The investigation is further complicated by the police’s prior criticism of the 'Uvda' report, describing it as 'distorted and false.' Despite this, the investigation will be handled by the Lahav 433 anti-corruption unit, with close oversight from senior prosecutors to ensure objectivity, particularly given its connection to Sara Netanyahu and the ongoing corruption trials involving her husband.

For standard cases of witness harassment or obstruction, the statute of limitations is five years. However, if it’s found that Sara Netanyahu conspired with others to harass Hadas Klein, the statute of limitations could extend to ten years. This case could have significant implications—not just for Sara Netanyahu but also for the broader legal battles surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trials, which have been a focal point of Israeli politics in recent years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy7dpzahyg	2024-12-27T21:57:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/SyU7S7jSJe/SyU7S7jSJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How IDF uses explosive-laden APCs to clear booby-trapped areas in...	IDF develops a new method using the old M-113 armored personnel carriers, packing them with explosives, and remotely detonating them to clear booby-trapped areas in Gaza; method was also used in Lebanon against Hezbollah Explosions heard across central Israel on Thursday evening originated from a unique IDF tactic initially developed at the start of the current war and previously used in southern Lebanon. The method involves old M-113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) loaded with tons of explosives, which are remotely detonated to clear booby-trapped areas before troops enter. Residents reported feeling intense blasts as far away as Tel Aviv, Hod HaSharon, and Jerusalem. One Tel Aviv resident described the explosions as 'earth-shaking,' while another in Hod HaSharon said, 'The windows shook twice.' The IDF has not issued a formal statement on the incident, though police attributed the noise to military activity in Gaza. Led by the 401st Brigade under the 162nd Division, the operation followed intelligence from the Shin Bet and Military Intelligence Directorate. The IDF claimed the site housed terrorists, terror infrastructure, and ongoing hostile activity. Footage from Gaza showed partially clothed residents with hands raised being escorted by IDF forces surrounded by tanks. Additional visuals from the hospital showed signs of fire damage. According to Palestinian sources, the IDF gave hospital occupants 15 minutes to evacuate before communication with the facility's management ceased. 'Throughout the war, Hamas has used the hospital as a key operational center, sheltering militants and conducting terrorist activities,' an IDF spokesperson stated. The military had previously operated in the area in October and warned against using the facility for military purposes. The IDF emphasized efforts to avoid harming civilians, patients, and medical staff. 'We are operating in a focused manner to minimize harm to uninvolved individuals,' the spokesperson said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas accused the IDF of committing war crimes, alleging the forces 'burned' Kamal Adwan Hospital and mistreated patients, staff, and displaced individuals during the operation. 'The decision to burn the hospital after storming it and abusing its occupants is a war crime and a flagrant violation of international laws and humanitarian values,' a Hamas statement read. The group claimed the IDF systematically targets medical facilities and infrastructure in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry, managed by Hamas, said the fate of medical staff and patients remains unknown following the operation. The ministry added that the IDF had recently forced evacuations at the Indonesian Hospital under similar circumstances, calling it a further display of 'contempt for global humanitarian values.' The IDF rejected Hamas’ accusations, asserting its compliance with international laws regarding medical facilities. Military officials stressed their efforts to facilitate the evacuation of patients and staff from Kamal Adwan Hospital to other facilities. 'The IDF, in coordination with international organizations and local health officials, has ensured defined evacuation routes using ambulances to guarantee continued medical care,' a military statement read. The IDF highlighted ongoing actions to deliver medical supplies, food, and fuel to hospitals in the area. Despite the IDF’s efforts, the military condemned Hamas for its alleged systematic violations of international law. 'Hamas exploits civilian infrastructure and endangers lives by embedding military operations within medical facilities,' the spokesperson added. As the war continues, the IDF’s operations in Gaza and their impact on medical facilities remain a focal point of global scrutiny. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkt16f3hje	2024-12-27T11:58:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/HyeNraDnSJe/HyeNraDnSJe_0_1_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Israel's future mediator with Iran? The sultan who keeps his door...	One of Sultan Haitham of Oman's first actions upon taking office was ensuring his son would succeed him, securing his legacy; Oman’s strategic location forces the Sultan to navigate delicate diplomacy, maintaining good relations with both Iran and the US while offering medical aid to Yemen's Houthis; Could Trump’s entry pave the way for Israelis to visit Muscat? Haitham bin Tariq Al Said is the Sultan and Prime Minister of Oman, Yemen’s thriving neighbor, and ranks among the Middle East’s most important brokers, always operating beneath the radar. He took power only five years ago on the death of his cousin, Qaboos bin Said who ruled Oman for 49 years – almost half a century. He maintains good relations with Iran, the US, and the Houthis, and conducts covert relations with Israel. Sultan Qaboos died in 2000 after battling cancer for 6 years. He had no children of his own but was close to his cousins, one of whom became the new sultan. Didn’t publicly declare his successor, but rather recorded a statement that was kept in a sealed envelope. After Qaboos’ death, Oman State TV reported that the envelope had been opened and that the family had 'accepted his wise advice' and vision. The TV channel soon after declared Haitham sultan. Qaboos conducted overt relations with Israel for years: In 2018, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a rare visit to Oman, meeting with the sultan at his palace in the capital, Muscat. Former President Shimon Peres visited Oman in 1996, as did then prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1994. Oman was the first Gulf state to approve Israeli diplomatic presence in its territory. Further diplomatic representation was then set up in other countries in the region. This momentum, however, came to a halt in the first two decades of the 21st century due, inter alia, to the stalemate on the Palestinian issue. Oman is very different from its neighbor to the west. 'Qaboos revolutionized his country,' Gulf expert Dr. Shaul Yanai tells Ynet. 'He took a country replete with never-ending civil wars and stabilized it. He managed to keep Oman out of regional wars, and the Arab Spring all but bbypassedOman. Almost nothing happened there.' Although Sultan Haitham has introduced some changes, since assuming power, he has promised to adhere to the sultanate’s policy of neutrality and non-intervention in both regional and international conflicts. 'Unlike Qaboos, Haitham is pareve. Haitham is following in Qaboos’ footsteps. He was chosen and trained by him to continue the tribal distribution of wealth and deal with minorities' says Dr. Yanai. 'He’s carrying on the traditional line, nd is even taking steps bacbackwardaboos was a cultural revolutionary of sorts. Haitham isn’t like that. He’s calmer.' Little is known about Sultan Haitham’s private life. He was born in 1955 in the capital Muscat and is married to Ahad bint Abdullah bin Hamad Al Busaidiyah with whom he has four children. His father was Sayyid Tariq bin Taimur who served as prime minister 1970-1972. Haitham graduated from Oxford in 1979 and before assuming power, served in various official roles in Oman, most recently as Minister of Heritage and Culture from 2002 through to his inauguration. In the 1990s, he served as Secretary General for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Special Envoy for Sultan Qaboos. He also headed Oman’s special committee overseeing the country’s future planning through 2040. He’s known for his love of sports and soccer and served as president of the Oman Football Association. In his first days as sultan, he made efforts to stabilize his rule, turning Oman for the first time, into a 'dynastic monarchy.' As mentioned, his predecessor had no children to inherit the position, and there was fear of a monarchy crisis and internal struggles. Haitham, however, declared that the crown prince would be the Sultan’s firstborn son, thereby fortifying his family’s position. 'Haitham appointed a successor. He already has a designated, heir, providing him with a certain stability' says Dr. Yoel Guzansky, senior researcher and head of the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). 'In the meantime, he’s doing good things for Oman that have contributed to stability, most importantly turning Oman into a dynastic monarchy - essentially toeing the line with other such Gulf states.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In his first speech after taking office, Sultan Haitham promised to continue his predecessor’s foreign policy of peace and economic development and hasn’t implemented any revolutionary measures. 'He’s pretty much continuing Qaboos’ regional policies in terms of relations with Iran and quiet, discreet mediation with the Americans', says Dr. Guzansky. 'He understands Oman’s strength and capabilities, cultivated by Qaboos for years. He’s now reaping the rewards.' Haitham’s four-and-a-half years in office have been generally stable with no serious crises. Despite Oman’s economic development in recent decades, making the country a world success story, Oman is still regarded as relatively poor. 'Oman exports around 10 million barrels,' says Dr. Guzansky. 'Oman is poor in natural resources in Gulf terms. This makes things hard as there were years when oil prices were low.' Like other monarchs, Haitham’s solution wasto increaseg the burden shouldered by the citizens. 'All of the Gulf states have done that,,' says Dr. Guzansky. 'He’s levying VAT and has slightly reduced fuel subsidies, so everything became slightly more expensive. It’s not very significant as it’s still low, but this change is common in many Gulf states that are ‘rentier states’ in that they provide their citizens with nearly everything in exchange for not participating in the political process. There are no political parties, but rather absolute rule.' In Qatar, for example, citizens receive education, health, education, cheap housing and further benefits. Oman, however, can give its citizens less, and its population is larger. 'Haitham isn’t rich like the Emir of Qatar or the President of the UA, E,' says Dr. Guzansky. Another problem facing Oman, which has become a big problem for the sultan in recent years, is the Houthis who have taken control of much of the country’s territory. Prof. Uzi Rabi senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, Tel Aviv University tells Ynet, 'Historically, and now too, there’s enormous concern that practically and realistically, Yemen is becoming a haven for extremely dangerous terrorist organizations. Tensions must be reduced and stability established. The least healthy thing for Oman is having a dangerous Yemen next door.' Oman and its leader are very worried about the terrorist organizations operating in Yemen. 'It’s not a dangerous country in the sense of increased terrorist trends. Oman believes that, as a monarchy in the Gulf, it will become a target for terrorism. Oman is very concerned about the situation in Yemen' says Prof. Rabi. Despite the implications for Oman of the fighting in Yemen, the country has conducted and still conducts, good relations with the Houthis. 'The Houthis receive medical care in Oman. It’s been reported that their contraband comes via Oman - which turns a blind eye, - and that Omani planes are used to fly the senior ranking Houthi wounded' says Dr. Guzansky. He further says that these activities have ultimately been good for Oman in that it has assisted the Saudis in negotiations with the Houthis and also helped the Americans in mediation. Oman isn’t making any great declarations. It is, however, a very important country. I mediate between Iran and the United States, Iran and Saudi Arabia, and before the current war, almost reached an agreement between the latter who are fighting one another in Yemen. Although not regarded as such in Israel, Oman is an important broker, the mediation conducted behind the scenesfocusesg primarily on the Gulf and the Middle East. Haitham visited Tehran in May 2023 and discussed various diplomatic, defense, and regional matters – two days after Oman mediated a Belgium-Iran hostage release. Haitham’s visits to Saudi Arabia, Qatar,r anBritainan are viewed as part of maintaining good relations with all his important partners. His 2021 visit to Saudi Arabia was the Omani sultan’s first political visit to the kingdom in over a decade. 'This is a country that is very good at maintaining good relations with everyone, be on a high or low light, never completely closing the door,' says Dr. Rabi. He says that the Omanis understand that, they talk to the Houthis and Iranians, they’re very important in the eyes of America and the West. 'They’re brokering the Qatari version, with much less toxic aroma of the Muslim Brotherhood, and more on a functional level. They’re not shouting about it. Oman is quietly accruing lots of credit points.' Oman and its leader have very good relations with Tehran. Both Iran and the US trust Oma. 'The problem is that Qatar is competing with Oman on this front and has greater economic capabilities, 'says Dr. Guzansky. 'Qatar also mediates in Africa, and South America, and helps the Americans in Afghanistan. Oman has a global presence, operating on a slightly different scale.' Dr, Guzansky adds, 'I’m not sure the Haitham has the capabilities Qaboos had. Qaboos was Oman and Oman was Qaboos. The country was molded in his image.'Inn tribal societies, mediators are very important and attain a very special status. 'Mediating honestly and correctly serves as a protection of sorts for the country, as regional powers will come to her to resolve issues that can avert war,' says Dr. Yanai. Oman has always maintained neutrality, never, for example, joining in sanctions on Iran. So, Iran can use Oman as a back door for selling oil, goods, and banking systems much more freely than Qatar can' says Dr. Yanai. 'Qatar has gotten itself into trouble with other Gulf states,s,' says Dr. Yanai. 'The Americans need Oman to mediate with Iran due to the endless friction in the Strait of Hormuz that connects the Gulf of Oman in the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf.' If the strait closes, much of the world’s daily energy can’t pass through, so it’s important for all sides that Oman remains neutral and Oman is very happy in that role.' Now, with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, the region is starting to wonder what would happen to Iran if the tough sanctions policy is reinstated. 'I’m not sure the Omanis are as happy as other countries, es,' says Prof. Rabi. 'If Trump imposes tough sanctions on Iran, and he may well do that, Oman will have to follow suit rather than playing backhand. If anyone’s thinking of attacking Iran or hindering Iran’s production capabilities, Oman can serve as a base for, quite quickly, restoring these capabilities.' So, despite foreseen regional changes, says Dr. Yani, the clear rule over the past century in the Gulf has been that oil must flow. World economic stability is dependent on oil flowing and on a neutral Oman cooling Riad and Tehran. Oman and the sultan have acquired a very important position in the Gulf and the entire Middle East without placing themselves in the center like Qatar. 'This all due to Qaboos and then Haitham,' says Dr. Yanai. Amid efforts to remain neutral, Haitham must sustain a very delicate tribal balance within Oman. Oman is home to a great deal of Shiites from a variety of countries, including Iranians immigrating for work. There are considerable sized communities, keeping up their relationships with their home countries and Muscat encourages inter-cultural and inter-religious tolerance. Dr. Yanai explains 'Any of the parties can use the western tribes, in the desert near Yemen, to instigate riots if Oman takes a clear side. The embers are always burning, and the regime is sure to subdue them.' Regional conflicts, such as the Houthis in Yemen or Iran’s involvement in Lebanon, have taught Haitham that he must ensure his country doesn’t become pa awn in political games. Oman’s unique ethnic makeup also has a great impact on Haitham’s desire to act as a quiet mediator, without standing out. Most of Oman’s residents are Ibadis, Islam’s third largest sect - a moderate faction, distinct from both Shiites and Sunnis. 'Traditionally, the Ibadi’s haven’t wanted to attract too much attention. Saudi Arabia and Iran are both extremist, theocratic powers - in Saudi Arabia, Wahabi, in Iran, Shiite. The Ibadis could easily be declared heretics if they were to upset anyone. They have always kept a low religious profile' says Dr. Yannai. Israel and Oman conduct informal relations, with covert ties between the countries since the 1970s, including covert, and later overt, visits. Following the Abraham Accords, Oman published an official statement of support, though later stressed that it did not intend to normalize relationsshortlye. In February 2023, Oman announced it would allow Israeli airlines to fly in its airspace. This decision, however, was reversed due to the war.' Then Transport Minister Israel Katz visited Oman in 2018 and received a warm public welcome. With swords, he joined his hosts in an Omani traditional dance to the sounds of a familiar folk song. Minister Katz presented his hosts and Arab ministers with his plan for a rail connection to the Gulf states. The future of relations between the countries, however, is unclear. 'The future is shrouded in fog. It very much depends on the Palestinian issue' says Dr. Guzansky. 'The matter concerns them greatly. There’s a tendency to go in the anti-Israel direction. It started before the war and has since intensified. There are covert talks, but I’m looking ahead. The day will come that Israel needs a conduit to Iran, for all kinds of reasons. Oman could be the address for that.' Over the years, Israel has had good relations with Oman, albeit behind the scenes. 'Israel is remembered for its past assistance in stabilizing Qaboos’ power. Now everything’s more complicated' says Dr. Guzansky. 'In recent years, there have been calls from parliament to scale down ties. When the war broke out, this was true for the entire Arab region. Oman has publicly gone in this direction. It should be noted, however, that there are also quiet, covert, channels.' During Haitham’s reign, however, there’s been a retreat of sorts, explains Prof. Rabi. 'The attitude to Israel is slightly less open and more critical than in Qaboos’ time. We’re seeing an attitude taking the back seat, leaving all doors open.' He says there’s less enthusiasm about promoting moves with Israel, and certainly not the countries who signed the Abraham Accords, but also not like during his predecessor’s time. Qaboos was the first to make efforts to develop diplomatic relations with Israel following the Oslo Accords' says Prof. Rabi. 'In 2000, following the First Intifada, there was a regression. This taught Oman to tread carefully. We’re seeing a deliberate, partial, retreat, telling Oman not to be as bold as in the past. Ultimately, this is demonstrated by having a special relationship with the US, but the Strait of Hormuz means that Iran is also very important to Oman which is revisiting its policy from Qaboos’ time. Let’s just hope some war doesn’t break out in the Gulf. Haitham has toed the line with Arab consensus on questions concerning the Palestinian story. 'Haitham is now in a very interesting position, with Trump on his way back and rumors flying about promoting Israel-Saudi normalization', says Prof. Rabi. 'Much of what Haitham is doing, is preparing lots of bargaining chips for the sultanate for the shifts in the Middle East’s geopolitical sands – such as sanctions on Iran and normalization with Saudi Arabia. If this does happen, Oman will go there, albeit crawling – without ruining what it’s already built up with other parties. Oman’s pace has always been very slow. Oman won’t be waking up one morning and doing a 180 turnaround. It will stand in what it feels is a comfortable middle ground, and tilt the pendulum slightly in the direction the Middle East is going.' Prof. Rabi says that we are facing great changes in the Middle East. Trump wants to complete the Abraham Accords and Oman is on the list, after Saudi Arabia. The Americans assume Saudi Arabia is a game-changer in terms ofitss power and size, and that this will be finalized through Oman. Prof. Rabi sums up: 'The sultanate wants calmam and stable Middle East. I want to think Oman won’t make deals with the devil, as ultimately, it fears it could swallow her up.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybcmf2rje	2024-12-27T10:54:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/01/11/9713818/9713818_1_243_980_552_0_small.jpg

Israel awaits Hamas decision to finalize the hostage release deal	Hamas has yet to provide the lists of hostages held for 448 days, as Jerusalem officials say 'Hamas needs to make a decision to finalize the deal'; US officials have presented hostage families with analyses suggesting that Hamas should agree to a deal before Trump takes office Senior Israeli officials said Friday that Hamas has yet to provide lists of hostages, and while negotiations continue, Jerusalem is urging Hamas to make a decision. 'Hamas needs to make a choice and open the door to finalizing the deal,' they said. The families of Israeli hostages have been waiting for official word on a potential deal as they mark 448 days since 100 hostages, both alive and deceased, were taken by Hamas terrorists to Gaza. Meanwhile, U.S. officials expressed optimism that a hostage deal could be reached, or at least an initial step, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. 'There are signs it's coming together, and there’s still a good chance for a deal,' they told family members’ representatives. The U.S. also outlined why Hamas might consider reaching an agreement now, ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent comments, blaming Hamas for reneging on previous agreements, have not fazed U.S. officials. They understand Netanyahu’s political constraints, they said. In the meantime, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker has launched a crowdfunding campaign to support her fight for his release. 'I can’t rely on anyone else,' she said. 'I need the public’s help.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zangauker, a leader of the families’ protest movement, voiced her frustration with the government’s actions. 'I see the government abandoning some hostages and leaving them to die in Hamas captivity,' she said. 'I’m furious. They’re playing with my son’s life. Israeli citizens have become pawns in the government's political game.' Despite the ongoing struggle, Zangauker clings to hope. 'I picture hugging Matan every night before I sleep and every morning when I wake up,' she said. 'The knowledge that he's alive and knows what I’m doing for him is my light in this dark time.' While hopeful, Zangauker remains determined to reach a comprehensive deal. She criticized Netanyahu for proposing only a partial deal, arguing it involved 'selecting between the lives of citizens.' She also claimed the government had not authorized the negotiators to address ending the war, a key Hamas demand for releasing all hostages. 'Our fight will not end with the first deal,' Tsangoker stressed. 'It will only end when Israel agrees to end the war in exchange for Matan and all the hostages.' She vowed to continue her struggle, even if it meant using more radical tactics. 'We will apply all possible pressure until the government commits to ending the war in exchange for a full deal,' she said. 'We are planning more radical actions.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hylqdvns1x	2024-12-27T09:21:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/09/Bke40uLz86/Bke40uLz86_0_82_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

US defense system intercepts Yemen missile for the first time sin...	Deployed in October, the U.S.-supplied THAAD air defense system successfully intercepted its first ballistic missile early Friday, launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen; 'We’ve waited 18 years for this' says one of the American soldiers operating the system The U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, deployed in Israel since October, successfully intercepted a ballistic missile launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen early Friday—marking its first operational use in the country. The missile launch occurred against the backdrop of Israel's extensive air operation, 'Operation Sounds of the Vineyard,' targeting Houthi positions in Yemen on Thursday night. The operation, described as Israel's most significant strike against the terror group to date, prompted the missile launch in retaliation. Sirens blared across central Israel, including the Tel Aviv area, Sharon, and Shfela regions, at 3:29 a.m. The interception prevented any casualties or direct damage. However, Magen David Adom (MDA) reported treating 18 people for injuries sustained while rushing to shelters. Two others were treated for anxiety. The missile launch briefly disrupted air travel. Four El Al flights en route to Ben Gurion Airport from Paris, Athens, Berlin, and Munich were rerouted over the Mediterranean. Landings resumed approximately 30 minutes after the sirens ceased. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, France condemned the Houthi attacks, including the ballistic missile launch and ongoing drone strikes against Israel. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the attacks 'unacceptable,' stating they undermine regional stability and must stop. France reaffirmed its commitment to Israel’s security and regional stability. The THAAD system, operated by approximately 100 U.S. soldiers stationed in Israel, is designed to intercept missiles at high altitudes, even outside the atmosphere, using kinetic energy. Similar in capability to Israel’s Arrow missile defense system, THAAD can target various stages of an enemy missile's flight path. The U.S. deployed the THAAD system to Israel at its request, both as a strategic deterrent and a display of military support in the region. Israeli officials view THAAD as a significant enhancement to the country’s multi-layered air defense systems, particularly in light of escalating threats, including from Iran. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkbscb2bjg	2024-12-27T07:16:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2017/07/30/7940246/7940246_0_0_1300_730_0_small.jpg

Italian journalist arrested for over a week in Iran, Italy says	Rome accuses Tehran of taking journalist Cecilia Sala, 29, under arrest and placing her in solitary confinement; Iran fails to respond to claims An Italian journalist has been under arrest in Iran for more than a week, Italy's foreign ministry said on Friday, adding it was following the case with the 'utmost attention'. Cecilia Sala, 29, works for the newspaper Il Foglio and for podcast company Chora Media. She was arrested by police in Tehran on December 19, the ministry said in a statement. Italy's government 'has worked with Iranian authorities to clarify Cecilia Sala's legal situation and verify the conditions of her detention', the statement said. Chora Media said in a separate statement that Sala was being held in solitary confinement in the Evin prison in Tehran and that no reason had been given for her arrest. There was no immediate confirmation of the arrest by Iranian officials. It was not clear whether it might be linked to tensions between Rome and Tehran after Iran last week summoned a senior Italian diplomat and the Swiss ambassador, who represents U.S. interests in the country, over the arrest of two Iranian nationals. One of the men was arrested in Italy at Washington's request. Chora Media said Sala had left Rome for Iran on December 12 with a valid journalist visa and had conducted several interviews and produced three episodes of her 'Stories' podcast. She had been due to fly back to Rome on December 20. The Italian ambassador to Iran visited Sala in prison on Friday, the ministry and Chora said. The journalist has also been in phone contact with her family, they said. Chora said news of her arrest was not immediately made public as her family and Italian authorities had hoped that keeping it quiet could help secure her swift release. The foreign ministry urged the media to exercise 'maximum discretion' over the case, while Chora launched a #FreeCecilia hashtag. 'Her free voice has been silenced, and neither Italy nor Europe can tolerate this arbitrary arrest. Cecilia Sala must be freed immediately,' Chora said.

Israel remains vigilant': A month into cease-fire agreement with...	Military officials recount Hezbollah violations treated by the IDF and stress forces are ready to act against terror group if needed; US enforcement mechanism aids in easing tensions The cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah on the northern border came into effect a month ago. Despite skepticism, suspicions, violations and mutual accusations, it's holding for now. IDF forces remain deployed in most of the areas where they operated during the ground operation. However, the agreement’s enforcement mechanism isn’t fully functional yet. Lebanon has expressed doubts about Israel's willingness to withdraw from its territories at the end of the 60 days stipulated in the agreement. The IDF also doesn't regard the deadline as sacred. During a Security Cabinet meeting held at the IDF Northern Command this past week, security officials reported a decrease in Hezbollah's attempts to violate the agreement. Simultaneously, there’s been improvement in the work of the cease-fire enforcement mechanism, headed by a U.S. general. Cooperation between Israel, the IDF and the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) has been described as excellent. Still, violations of various kinds take place. Israel is allowing the mechanism to address them while continuing to act independently when immediate threats are identified. 'That’s why we work alongside it, but we still enforce it ourselves at this stage,' an Israeli official said. 'It looks better now than it did before, but like in Syria, Israel remains vigilant.' According to IDF data, the IDF has eliminated 44 terrorists, conducted 25 strikes in Lebanon and documented 120 Hezbollah violations since the cease-fire began. Conversely, Lebanon accused Israel of violating the agreement in An-Naqoura, citing airstrikes, the raising of the Israeli flag in a Lebanese village and roadblocks, excavation work and explosions in areas like Yaroun and Kfar Kila — actions seemingly intended to achieve unfulfilled war goals. Lebanese officials, meanwhile, doubt Israel's readiness to withdraw from Lebanese territories as stipulated. If Israel fails to to so, Hezbollah might respond with force, claiming Israel breached the agreement which could reignite regional escalation and place the Lebanese army in a precarious position against the Shiite terror organization. The Lebanese drew criticism the 'slow pace' of the agreement’s enforcement mechanism, which they argue allows Israel to continue its operations in the country’s south. Beirut fears Israel aims to provoke Hezbollah into retaliating, thereby framing it as responsible for collapsing the cease-fire. Hezbollah, though battered, has so far exercised relative restraint while issuing warnings about time running out. The IDF remains prepared to stay in locations beyond the border if the Lebanese army fails to meet its commitments or achieve full control over the area. For now, Israel is dismantling weapons caches and tunnels in approximately 15-20 villages near the border while driving back Lebanese civilians attempting to return to the area. Meanwhile, the IDF enforces the cease-fire and has targeted dozens of terrorists approaching the border or preparing rocket launches against Israel. One significant from which the IDF withdrew during the first month of the cease-fire was the Al-Khiyam region, the northernmost area where Israeli forces operated in, extending into Lebanon from the Upper Galilee and paralleling the northern Hula Valley. The IDF drew back after the Lebanese army deployed in the area and began searching for and confiscating Hezbollah rocket launchers in the Litani and Saluki Valleys. The cease-fire’s implementation is meant to proceed gradually for the IDF, with the withdrawal date — while set — not taken as immutable. The possibility of an extended presence in parts of southern Lebanon is being considered. In recent days, most IDF activity has been focused on destroying underground complexes in the western sector, near villages where Lebanon has claimed violations. Attack helicopter strikes against identified Hezbollah operatives have also been reported in these areas. Unlike the 2006 cease-fire under UN Resolution 1701, which ended the Second Lebanon War, this time, the enforcement mechanism is led by an American general rather than weak UNIFIL inspectors. This change means that immediate strikes will be carried out with minimal bureaucratic hurdles if the IDF detects preparations by Hezbollah for attacks against Israel or short-term threats. For less immediate threats, such as the construction of observation posts or bunkers, the IDF will report the location to the American enforcement mechanism. A drone will verify and document the violation and the Lebanese army will be required to address it. Failing to do so will enable the IDF to act. This approach also extends to arms smuggling from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah. By collaborating with the American-led enforcement mechanism, Israel aims to address potential threats effectively while maintaining the option to act unilaterally if necessary.

IDF officer holds son’s bris at kibbutz where harrowing October 7...	Moshe Barsheshet and his wife Renana hold their newborn son’s circumcision ceremony at Kibbutz Holit where he bravely fought terrorists during Hamas' attack 'When I heard about the chaos in the south, I immediately knew it was something big,' recalls Moshe Barsheshet, reflecting on the day that changed the course of Israel’s history — and his own life. 'I was an IDF company commander when a soldier named Rafael Hayun connected us with two people from Kibbutz Holit.' 'They told us the kibbutz was devoid of military presence and infiltrated by Hamas terrorists. Although I was instructed not to head in, I decided to go anyway. On the way, we witnessed horrifying scenes,' he recounts. When Barsheshet and his team arrived at Holit, the situation was dire. 'We discovered around 60 terrorists in the kibbutz,' he says. 'Houses were burning and there were many wounded. We engaged in a fierce battle, during which some of our comrades were injured. But by dawn we regained control of the kibbutz with the help of additional military forces.' Barsheshet and his unit worked tirelessly to evacuate the wounded to the kibbutz gate, clear homes, and rescue survivors. The experience left a profound mark on him. 'I feel a deep connection to the kibbutz, its people, and the place itself,' he says. 'A person who experiences battle or a significant event either becomes repelled by the location or deeply attached to it. My life could have ended there and terrorists cruelly took the lives of so many. But for me, it was essential to return to that place, find closure and raise a new generation where there was once so much sorrow and blood.' A moment of closure Last Friday, Barsheshet and his wife, Renana, returned to Holit but for their son’s brit milah (Jewish circumcision ceremony) — a symbolic act of renewal. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Holit remains a closed military zone, largely uninhabited except for soldiers and a few kibbutz members maintaining the site. Despite this, Barsheshet secured the necessary permissions from both the military and the kibbutz. 'We brought catering, invited the soldiers who were with me that day, kibbutz members and security personnel,' he shares. 'It was an incredibly emotional and joyful moment — to bring new light to a place once shrouded in darkness. It truly felt like closing a circle.' Barsheshet shared a deeply personal message. 'I’m a settler from Kiryat Arba and they’re kibbutz residents from Holit. Before October 7, our paths rarely crossed. But the terrorists’ bullets didn’t discriminate between us.' 'We need to set aside our divisions,' he says. 'We all know how fractured the nation was before. I want to raise my children with certain values and holding the Brit milah at Holit is part of that. It’s a testament to our shared humanity and resilience.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1zjjrjh1g	2024-12-27T01:30:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/By0I9Z00S1x/By0I9Z00S1x_460_196_759_427_0_small.jpg

New Damascus governor wants 'peace' with Israel, says its fears a...	Maher Marwan, appointed by Syria's de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, says many Syrians wish for coexistence as Israel remains skeptical Maher Marwan, the new governor of Damascus appointed by Syria’s de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), made a surprising statement calling on the United States to establish peace between Syria and Israel. 'There exists a people who want coexistence. They want peace. They don't want disputes. We want peace, and we cannot be an opponent to Israel or an opponent to anyone,' he said in an interview with U.S. public radio network NPR. However, he acknowledged Israel’s concerns, saying, 'It's natural for Israel to be worried about certain factions.' He added, ' Israel may have felt fear, so it advanced a little, bombed a little, etc. We have no fear towards Israel, and our problem is not with Israel. And we don't want to meddle in anything that will threaten Israel's security or any other country's security.' A U.S. official confirmed that the new Syrian administration's message was relayed to Israel but noted that the White House isn’t urging either side to take steps toward establishing relations at this time. Direct dialogue between the U.S. and the Syrian rebels has been ongoing since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, culminating in the removal of the $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa’s head due to his past jihadist activities. Israeli officials have indicated that while the Americans understand Israel’s security needs and concerns, they believe Israel should give the new regime a chance. Conversely, Israel maintains a far more skeptical stance. Syria’s transitional government, led by al-Sharaa, recently announced several appointments, including new governors for the country’s provinces, one of whom is Maher Marwan. The governors will serve for three months in the timeframe allocated to form the new government. According to reports in Arab media, Marwan was born in Damascus in 1979. He actively participated in the protests in Syria starting in 2011 and has lived in Saudi Arabia, Damascus the city of al-Qaryatayn in the Homs countryside and later in Idlib. He studied at Idlib University and held various positions under the Syrian opposition, which now controls the country. Israeli officials appear unfazed by the governor's remarks. Sources in Jerusalem told Ynet earlier this week, 'The burden of proof is on al-Sharaa and his people. We mustn’t forget their ideological foundations.' According to these sources, the 'warm' messages from Damascus’s new leadership remain an enigma as no one knows which direction the new regime will take. While al-Sharaa and his team are saying the 'right things,' the post-October 7 mood in Israel is marked by skepticism and fears of a 'charm offensive' meant to deceive the West. Al-Sharaa isn’t affiliated with the Islamic State (ISIS). He was once active in al-Qaeda but left the organization years ago, pivoting toward other jihadist yet more Syrian nationalist-oriented paths. In the past, he also led al-Nusra Front during its affiliation with al-Qaeda and the group itself maintained ties with Israel.

He claimed he seeks no confrontation — not with Israel, nor with the Druze, Alawites or Turks. For now, it’s clear that he and his team are working to calm tensions, whether out of genuine intent or as a calculated manipulation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryygiasbyx	2024-12-26T23:15:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/r1BYMpsBJe/r1BYMpsBJe_198_75_923_520_0_small.jpg

What do Christian Zionists need to do to support Israel?	‘Liquid Prophecy’ and Loud Voices: Experts weigh in on how Christians can stand with Israel today What does Israel need from Christian Zionists? This was one of the questions that three experts on Israel-Christian relations sought to answer this week on Christmas Eve. During ILTV’s Insider, Maj. (Res.) A.Y. Katsof, founder and director of The Heart of Israel; Ilse Strauss, news bureau chief of Bridges for Peace; and Pesach Wolicki, executive director of Israel365 Action, shared their Christmas messages with North American evangelicals, who, according to recent reports, make up about 25% of the population. 'Pray for Israel,' was Katsof’s message. 'I see there are so many churches praying for Israel, reading Psalms, praying for the peace of Jerusalem, praying for the peace of Judea and Samaria,' he said. On the other hand, he urged them to visit and 'put boots on the ground.' Katsof runs 'Settlers’ Cellar' in Eish Kodesh, where he grows grapes harvested by Christians and produces what he calls 'liquid prophecy'—wine made in the ancient tradition of the Israelites, whose first kingdom was in the area. 'Come to the land. See it for yourself,' Katsof said. 'We’re waiting to greet you and let you taste some liquid prophecy.' Wolicki encouraged Christians to stand up for Israel and the Jewish people in their own communities. 'Be loud. Be proud,' he said. 'The pro-Hamas supporters are a tiny, little fringe minority, but they’ve taken to the streets. We need Christians not only to pray for Israel but to be out there in public, standing up, making their voices heard.' He emphasized that such actions would 'matter a lot to the Jewish community,' adding, 'You’ll see more and more Jewish arms open to the relationship if Christians do that.' Strauss, however, focused on empowering Christians to strengthen themselves. 'Educate yourself,' she advised, addressing ILTV’s Christian Zionist audience directly. 'Make sure you have the facts. You can’t stand in front of someone who comes with an accusation of genocide, and your answer is, ‘Yes, but it’s God’s chosen people.’ Have the facts on the ground. Listen to people in the know. Make sure you are an expert.' She concluded, 'Your voice matters. So make sure that when you have that 30 seconds, you use it wisely.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjl6inssjg	2024-12-26T20:42:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/11/rkbGP1gxGyg/rkbGP1gxGyg_0_0_1000_563_0_small.jpg
The 'diplomatic Iron Dome' Israel didn't know it needed	MK Moshe Tur Paz and Josh Reinstein predict Trump’s Christian Zionist-backed administration will usher in a transformative era for Israel A sea change is expected on January 20, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, and Israel is poised to feel its impact, according to Joshua Reinstein, President of the Israel Allies Foundation. 'When Trump comes in, he is going to sign a variety of executive orders. I don’t think you’re going to see any more lawfare like the International Criminal Court. I think you’re going to see the end of UNRWA [The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]. You’re going to see Jerusalem embassies opening up one after another,' Reinstein told ILTV News on this week’s podcast. 'It’s a new dawn. And this is thanks to our Christian allies. This is what we’ve been working for over the last 21 years—to mobilize Christians around the world to stand with Israel and create real political action. 'I think the best is yet to come for faith-based diplomacy,' he added. Reinstein spoke with ILTV shortly after MK Moshe Tur Paz was appointed co-chair of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus. This caucus, one of 54 worldwide, is designed to mobilize political support from lawmakers who stand with Israel out of faith. While the caucus is open to all, it primarily includes Christians who view Israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Tur Paz, a member of the centrist Yesh Atid party, has been involved with the caucus for four years. Reflecting on the challenges Israel has faced, he said, 'In the past year, we have confronted Iran in ways we never have since the country’s founding.' He emphasized the importance of U.S. support, saying, 'Now, we need the Americans there with us. We have faced antisemitic voices around the world. When we have Donald Trump and his administration on our side, it’s a completely different battle—a stronger way to fight.' Tur Paz also expressed optimism about the future. 'We know we may have new challenges ahead, but we have a strong friend in the United States—in Congress and the White House. That’s a big, big thing for Israel.' Reinstein believes the Trump administration will be 'the most pro-Israel administration in the history of American-Israel relations, even more so than the last Trump administration, which was probably Israel’s greatest supporter to date.' He attributes this to the Republican Party’s strong base of Bible-believing Christians and Trump’s selection of like-minded individuals for key positions. 'For example, Peter Hegseth, nominated to be Secretary of Defense, is an evangelical Christian. The U.S. Ambassador to Israel nominee, Mike Huckabee, is also an evangelical Christian,' Reinstein said. 'These individuals, and many others, support Israel not just for political or economic reasons, but because of their faith. That’s a kind of support that doesn’t waver,' he stressed. Reinstein anticipates a wave of embassies opening in Jerusalem soon after Trump takes office, with countries from Africa, Latin America, and even Europe expressing interest. While he did not confirm specifics, he suggested Argentina might be next, followed by nations like Fiji, Malawi, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Romania. 'As the Trump administration works with Israel, there could be a package of benefits for countries that recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. This aligns with official U.S. policy and, of course, Israel’s policy,' Reinstein explained. A Diplomatic Iron Dome The role of Christian Allies Caucuses has grown significantly since the October 7 Hamas massacre. Reinstein described them as 'the diplomatic Iron Dome of the State of Israel,' with around 1,500 legislators advocating for Israel in their own parliaments since the war began. 'We’re seeing faith-based diplomacy in action worldwide,' Reinstein said. 'For example, Australia’s parliamentary Israel caucus passed legislation banning antisemitic symbols in public. This is crucial in a country that has seen an unprecedented spike in antisemitism.' In another case, the Dutch parliament decided to phase out funding for UNRWA, following advocacy by former caucus co-chair and Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel. She visited the Netherlands twice to highlight how UNRWA had been infiltrated by terrorists. Even at the International Criminal Court, when a case against Israel was publicly presented, 500 Christians stood outside waving Israeli flags. Some Jews have historically been hesitant to work with Christians due to a history of antisemitism and persecution. However, both Reinstein and Tur Paz said these attitudes are shifting. 'Eighty percent of our diplomatic successes now come from faith-based diplomacy,' Reinstein said. 'People are realizing there’s nothing more powerful than Christian support for Israel. There are 15 million Jews in the world and a billion Christians.' Tur Paz agreed. 'Faith-based diplomacy is great for Israel and the world. I’d like to see similar partnerships with Muslims,' he said. 'It’s about people-to-people and faith-to-faith. If we can work together in this way, it’s a great path for the world.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aixhohye	2024-12-26T19:56:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/04/Bkv1FQiga/Bkv1FQiga_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Attack comes hours after Israel conducted its largest air raid against Houthi targets in Yemen; IDF says investigating incident; 4 El Al flights en route to Ben Gurion Airport temporarily redirected to circle over Mediterranean before receiving clearance to land Air-raid sirens blared across central Israel, including the Gush Dan area, the Shephelah region and parts of the West Bank, following a missile launch from Yemen, the IDF reported Friday morning, less than a day after Israel launched its largest air raid against Houthi targets in Yemen to date. According to an initial statement from the IDF, the sirens were triggered due to a missile crossing into Israeli airspace. Later, the military clarified that the missile was intercepted before entering Israeli territory, and the alarms were activated as a precaution against debris from the interception. The incident disrupted air traffic, with four El Al flights en route to Ben Gurion Airport from Paris, Athens, Berlin and Munich temporarily redirected to circle over the Mediterranean Sea before receiving clearance to land.

IDF officer killed in combat in northern Gaza	Maj. Hod Shriebman falls in battle in Jabaliya; another Multidimensional Unit soldier seriously wounded; unit has faced heavy losses, including its commander and 3 soldiers in Jabaliya; tank soldier severely wounded by sniper The IDF reported on Thursday that Major Hod Shriebman, 27, a company commander in the Multidimensional Unit (888), from Tzofit, was killed during combat operations in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. Just three months ago, Shriebman married his partner, who shared photos on Facebook, celebrating their 'happy day.' In a separate incident early Thursday, Captain (res.) Amit Levi was killed in the central Gaza Strip. Since the outbreak of the war, 823 Israeli soldiers have lost their lives. During the encounter in which Major Shriebman fell, another soldier from the Multidimensional Unit, also known as the Ghost Unit, was seriously wounded. Additionally, a tank commander from the 401st Armored Brigade's 9th Battalion was severely wounded in northern Gaza due to sniper fire. In October, a battle in Jabaliya claimed the lives of an officer and three soldiers from the Multidimensional Unit: Captain Yehonatan (Joni) Keren from Moshav Moladot, Staff Sergeant Nisim Meital from Hadera, Staff Sergeant Aviv Gilboa from Neve Tzuf and Staff Sergeant Naor Haimov from Rosh HaAyin.

In line with its mission, the unit comprises a diverse group of fighters from various branches, including Golani, Armor, Engineering and elite units like Sayeret Matkal and Shaldag. On October 7, the unit lost its commander, Colonel Roi Levy, who was critically injured during Operation Protective Edge and later fell in combat in the Ramim area. In the afternoon, Captain (res.) Amit Levi, who was killed in the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, was laid to rest. The incident occurred around 5 a.m. during a routine nighttime battalion raid aimed at locating anti-tank missiles, weapons and intelligence materials belonging to Hamas.

In the crosshairs: The children of Hamas officials who were assas...	Since the outbreak of the war, Israel has intensified its focus on targeting the children of senior Hamas officials, many of whom hold significant roles within the terror organization; this strategy has reportedly escalated in recent weeks The children of senior Hamas leaders remaining in Gaza have reportedly been in Israel's crosshairs since the outbreak of the war. However, according to Arab media reports, targeted killings of these individuals have only intensified in recent weeks. 'Being the child of a Hamas leader grants significant social status in Gaza, even amid public anger against them,' sources in Gaza said. 'These families often have access to resources, know how to hide effectively and can secure food and shelter. They are also well-acquainted with Gaza's infrastructure, some of which Israel has yet to reach.' The first reported assassination occurred on December 28, when the IDF killed Muhammad Issa, the son of Marwan Issa, then deputy head of Hamas’ military wing and the organization's third-ranking leader. Both father and son were killed in separate strikes. Muhammad, who had been battling cancer for years, had unsuccessfully sought medical evacuation from Gaza prior to the war. In April, Israeli forces struck a significant blow by eliminating three sons and three grandchildren of Ismail Haniyeh, the former head of Hamas' political bureau. The six were killed in a targeted strike on the Shati refugee camp in western Gaza. Haniyeh himself was later reported killed in Tehran. In November, Ala’a and Baha’a Barhoum, sons of senior Hamas figure Fawzi Barhoum, were killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Taba’in school in Gaza City. According to local sources, they were there to deliver salaries to Hamas personnel. August saw the killing of Ismail Nofal, the son of Ayman Nofal, a commander in Hamas' military wing and a close associate of Mohammed Deif. Both father and son were killed in separate airstrikes, with Ayman Nofal eliminated early in the war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sources told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that Israel conducted a drone strike in the Jabaliya refugee camp last month, killing Taher Ghandour, the son of Ahmed Ghandour, the commander of northern Gaza and head of Hamas' rocket program. Ahmed Ghandour was killed in November 2022 in a tunnel strike in Jabaliya. Other recent casualties include Imad Salman, son of Rafat Salman, a former senior military operative in northern Gaza; Sohaib and Hassan Rajab, sons of Wael Rajab, a deputy commander who was also killed in Jabaliya; and Ahmad Abu Askar, son of Mohammed Abu Askar, Hamas' administrative chief in the camp. Broader operations Among other targeted killings, Israel eliminated Mohammed Al-Sharafi, son of Youssef Al-Sharafi, a senior Hamas political bureau member; Ibrahim Harb, son of Yasser Harb, another political bureau member; and Sohaib Al-Biyari, son of a prominent commander in Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, and Ibrahim Mohammed Sinwar, a nephew of Yahya Sinwar. Israel has reportedly attempted to assassinate Muamin Al-Jabari, son of Ahmed Al-Jabari, a former deputy of Mohammed Deif who was assassinated in 2012. That attempt was unsuccessful. Additionally, Asharq Al-Awsat reported that Israel recently killed one of Deif’s brothers in a strike on his Khan Younis residence. The intensifying campaign reflects Israel’s strategy of targeting the inner circle of Hamas leadership, aiming to disrupt the organization’s infrastructure and command network while also addressing the families’ roles in Gaza’s conflict dynamics. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syp0z11sbyg	2024-12-26T09:20:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/10/HyPQu74lC/HyPQu74lC_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Inside Israel’s largest Yemen strike: Control tower, power statio...	Israel’s Air Force launches largest Yemen strike yet, targeting Sanaa Airport and other key locations; 'No Houthi leader will escape Israel’s reach,' Katz says Israeli officials confirmed the country’s largest airstrike in Yemen since the war began, targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Sanaa and other key locations. The operation involved 25 aircraft, including fighter jets, reconnaissance planes and tankers, and hit infrastructure critical to Houthi operations. Targets included Sanaa International Airport, where the control tower and landing aids were destroyed to prevent Iranian supply shipments. Civilian aircraft used by the Houthi government were also hit. Additional strikes targeted Hodeidah’s port, a power station with five turbines and oil facilities. Damage reports from Yemeni media indicated the airport’s runways, terminal buildings and the Haziz power station south of Sanaa were also struck. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz observed the operation from the Israeli Air Force command center alongside IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar. 'We are determined to cut off this terror arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' Netanyahu said. Katz added, 'Those who harm Israel will be hunted. No Houthi leader will escape Israel’s reach.' Halevi emphasized the IDF’s long-range strike capabilities, saying, 'Once again, we’ve shown we can reach and eliminate any threat to Israel’s citizens, with precision and power.' Houthi-affiliated Yemeni network Al Masirah reported three deaths and 16 injuries from the strikes on Sanaa airport. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was at the airport during the strike. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Writing on X (formerly Twitter), he said, 'The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge – just a few meters from where we were – and the runway were damaged.

A source described the operation as a 'Hanu-Christmas' collaboration, underscoring the partnership between the two nations. The strikes follow a series of Houthi ballistic missile launches, with four incidents in the past week alone. These attacks triggered widespread nighttime alarms across central Israel, causing destruction at a school in Ramat Efal and in Tel Aviv.

Pro-Palestinian leaders removed from Michigan’s student governmen...	University of Michigan student government president Alifa Chowdhury removed alongside vice president after blocking funding to pressure university to cut ties with Israeli companies, supporting harassment of Jewish students and encouraging meeting disruptions The University of Michigan’s Central Student Government has removed its president, Alifa Chowdhury, and vice president, Elias Atkinson, citing misconduct tied to their controversial pro-Palestinian activism and incitement of violence against Jewish students. Chowdhury and Atkinson, elected in April amid a wave of campus protests against Israel, spearheaded initiatives that included boycotts targeting Israeli companies or firms allegedly profiting from the Gaza conflict. Their actions put them at odds with university administrators and the Jewish community on campus. The 40-page resolution outlining their dismissal accused the two leaders of failing in their roles, eroding trust within the student body of approximately 50,000. 'Their decisions not only harmed student organizations but also undermined the community’s confidence in its elected leadership,' the resolution stated. 'Their inability to protect student representatives, coupled with their endorsement of violence and harassment, represents a severe breach of duty.' Chowdhury and Atkinson ran on a platform titled 'Shut It Down,' promising to sever the university’s ties with companies they claimed supported the Gaza conflict. Early in their tenure, they suspended $1.3 million in annual funding for student clubs—ranging from debate teams to dance groups—until the university complied with their demands. The funding freeze crippled hundreds of student organizations, prompting backlash from students who accused the duo of disregarding the broader campus community. The funds, derived from mandatory student fees, were blocked at the governance level, leaving clubs scrambling for resources. University administrators attempted to mitigate the fallout with temporary loans, but tensions escalated. Protests disrupted student government meetings, with reports of physical threats against council members. Chowdhury and Atkinson frequently skipped meetings to avoid reversing their decisions. 'The campus became a political battleground, leaving students to bear the brunt,' said the president of one major student club. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The unrest peaked on Oct. 8, when Chowdhury and Atkinson encouraged protesters to storm a meeting discussing the funding freeze. Jewish council members reported threats, verbal assaults and even spitting incidents during the disruption. Additional allegations against Chowdhury included unauthorized changes to the student government’s official Instagram account credentials. The Jewish student population at the University of Michigan is among the largest at U.S. public universities, with roughly 6,500 members, including 5,000 undergraduates and 1,500 graduate students. In tandem with their removal, pro-Palestinian students filed a lawsuit this week against the university, alleging constitutional rights violations stemming from the administration’s handling of anti-Israel protests. Filed in Michigan’s district court, the lawsuit accuses the university of disproportionately targeting pro-Palestinian students with disciplinary actions, including campus bans, job terminations, and employment restrictions. The lawsuit details incidents such as arrests during a 2023 sit-in at the university president’s office, where law enforcement from 10 counties was present. Protesters reported physical mistreatment, including one instance where a student’s hijab was forcibly removed. The university has not commented on the allegations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknxkyorkl	2024-12-26T06:53:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/06/SJAQvPIfA/SJAQvPIfA_1_407_719_405_0_small.jpg
Israeli officials: '100 aircraft took part in Yemen air raid'	Israeli officials confirmed that the Air Force carried out its largest strike to date in Yemen, targeting key infrastructure, including Sanaa International Airport. The control tower was rendered inoperable, and civilian aircraft used by the Houthi administration were also hit. The strikes extended to Hodeidah’s port and a power station. Officials noted that 100 aircraft participated in the operation, which was coordinated in advance with the United States. 'We said the Houthis would pay a heavy price. If they don’t understand force, they’ll understand even greater force,' an Israeli source said, adding that this strike will not be the last. Lebanese network Al Mayadeen, affiliated with Hezbollah, alleged the strikes targeted sick passengers at Sanaa Airport. Meanwhile, Sky News Arabia reported that the Israeli military has heightened its air defense and Air Force alert levels, anticipating a possible Houthi response.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy1p4lsb1l	2024-12-26T06:24:06-08:00

An Israeli official confirmed to Sky News Arabia that Israel carried out strikes on Sanaa International Airport, marking its response to a series of ballistic missile launches by the Houthis targeting Israel. According to Yemeni sources, the strikes hit the airport’s control tower and damaged aircraft stationed there. Some reports claim all targets were civilian, with casualties reported, though exact numbers remain unclear. Additional strikes reportedly hit the Haziz power station near Sanaa and locations in the port city of Hodeidah. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi-owned Al Hadath TV later reported that the strikes targeted seven sites in Sanaa, including energy and oil facilities, and three more in Hodeidah, including its port and power stations. This attack follows last week’s Israeli strike on Yemen—the first to target Sanaa since the war began and the third Israeli operation in Yemen since October 7. The Houthis have launched multiple missile attacks on Israel. The strikes occurred as al-Houthi delivered his regular Thursday speech, a platform often used to boast about attacks on Israel. The reclusive leader, who has been in hiding for years, delivers speeches exclusively via television. Despite the reported strikes, Houthi-controlled TV channels continued broadcasting his address uninterrupted. *This is a breaking news story.

IDF changed rules of engagement shortly after October 7 attack, r...	International outlet's extensive investigation, citing Israeli military commanders, claims IDF approved 'unprecedented' strikes against Hamas in Gaza with up to 20 civilian casualties approved per attack; Military denies accusations An investigation has revealed that the IDF dramatically changed its rules of engagement and restrictions on targeting civilians in Gaza immediately following Hamas' terror attack on October 7, 2023, the New York Times reported on Thursday. The shift led to what has been described as one of the most intense bombing campaigns in contemporary warfare. According to the investigation, at exactly 1:00 p.m. on October 7, 2023, for the first time in the history of conflicts with Hamas, a senior IDF command issued an order granting mid-ranking officers extensive authorization to target thousands of locations in Gaza. These included lower-priority Hamas operatives who had not been high-value targets in previous operations. Under these orders, officers were allowed to approve strikes that could risk the lives of up to 20 civilians — significantly more than the restrictions that had previously been in place. Most strikes in past operations were only approved after officers determined there would be no civilian casualties. In some cases, up to five civilian casualties were permitted and rarely was the threshold raised to 10 or more. According to a senior IDF officer interviewed by the newspaper, the military changed its engagement rules because it believed Israel faced an existential threat during the initial hours of Hamas' surprise attack which resulted in the massacre of 1,200 Israelis and the kidnapping of 250 others to Gaza. This was while terrorists were still present inside Israel. The senior officer said that it was imperative to exert significant force to neutralize the threat, executing thousands of strikes in a short time. This necessitated decentralizing strike authorization, typically reserved for senior command. These critical hours were further complicated by the looming fear of a potential Hezbollah invasion from Lebanon, which required the IDF to divert considerable forces to that front. The investigation claimed that in its effort to dismantle Hamas' capabilities in Gaza, Israel significantly weakened oversight mechanisms meant to prevent harm to civilians. It adopted 'flawed' methods for identifying targets and assessing risks to innocents, ignored warnings from IDF officers and U.S. officials about deficiencies and failed to conduct thorough post-strike investigations or punish wrongdoers. The American outlet noted that its findings were based on the review of dozens of military documents and interviews with over 100 soldiers and other sources, including over 25 individuals involved in strike approvals. The report said that in order to significantly expand the target pool in Gaza — part of the pledge to counter the attack on Israel and destroy Hamas — the number of Palestinian civilians who could be endangered in each strike was also increased. The outcome, according to the investigation, was the IDF dropping nearly 30,000 bombs and munitions on Gaza — more than the total used in the subsequent eight months combined. The investigation found that another order issued by IDF command at 10:50 p.m. on October 8 indicated the scale of civilian casualties deemed acceptable during those early days of the war. According to the order, strikes on military targets in Gaza could cumulatively risk the lives of up to 500 civilians daily. This limit was reportedly removed two days later, allowing officers to approve an unlimited number of strikes they deemed lawful. A 500 casualty limit: precaution or quota? IDF sources told the outlet that the removed restriction was actually a precaution meant to limit the number of strikes per day. However, Professor Michael N. Schmitt of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, argued that mid-level officers might have interpreted it as a 'quota' of permissible civilian deaths per day. Following the limit’s removal, Hamas-controlled authorities in Gaza often reported daily death tolls exceeding 500, though it remains unclear how many were civilians, terrorists or casualties from previous days. The investigation highlighted Shaldan al-Najjar, a senior Islamic Jihad terrorist, as an example. During Operation Protective Edge in 2014, the IDF reportedly took numerous precautions to keep civilians away from his house before attacking it. These included calls to neighbors warning of the impending strike and implementing the 'roof knock' procedure, commonly used before targeting buildings suspected of containing weapons or tunnel entrances. As a result, everyone, including al-Najjar himself, evacuated with no casualties. However, when the IDF targeted a house he visited on October 10, 2023, no prior warnings were issued. The strike killed al-Najjar along with 20 of his extended family members, including children and a two-month-old baby. In some cases targeting Hamas leaders, senior IDF officers approved strikes knowing they could endanger over 100 civilians each — actions the outlet described as ' crossing an extraordinary threshold for a contemporary Western military.' The IDF reportedly conducted strikes at such a rapid pace that the pre-war target database was depleted within days. As a result, the military adopted a new and 'unproven' system for identifying targets, relying on artificial intelligence heavily. According to the report, a system called 'The Gospel' was used to cross-reference information from various sources, including phone calls, satellite imagery and cellular tracking. The IDF also maintains extensive databases, one of which is known as 'Lavender,' containing phone numbers and addresses of suspected terrorists. A chaotic mood Israel's control over Gaza's communication networks allowed for the monitoring and tracking of Palestinian phones. However, six IDF officers told the outlet that these databases sometimes contained outdated information, increasing the risk of misidentifying civilians as terrorists. The investigation further alleged that the IDF frequently relied on a simplistic statistical model to assess risks to innocents during strikes. Sometimes targets were bombed just hours after being identified, allegedly increasing the likelihood of errors. The model mainly estimated risks based on cellular activity in broad areas near strike zones rather than detailed intelligence tracking of specific structures as was customary in previous Israeli operations. The IDF’s air campaign was most intense during the initial weeks of the war. Palestinians claim that 15,000 people were killed in the first two months — a figure reported by Gaza's Hamas-controlled Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and terrorists and has faced skepticism over its data. Regardless, amid international outrage during that period, the IDF reportedly reduced its use of bombs from November 2023 onward to conserve munitions and tightened strike protocols, including halving the number of civilians allowed to be endangered in low-priority strikes. Despite this, the death toll in Gaza continued to rise, with Palestinians claiming over 45,000 fatalities to date. The dramatic and extensive investigation comes as Israel faces allegations of genocide in Gaza, including a lawsuit filed against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Israel firmly denied these accusations, stressing its compliance with international law and its efforts to minimize civilian harm, such as mass evacuation orders for entire cities, leaflets dropped from the air and warnings via social media. Israeli officials frequently highlight Hamas and other terror groups' use of civilians as human shields, embedding terrorists and weaponry in residential buildings and hospitals. According to the outlet, IDF officers must ensure that the risks posed by airstrikes are 'proportional' to the military value of the target and take feasible precautions to protect innocent lives under international law. However, the investigation stressed that officers have considerable discretion because the rules of warfare are ambiguous regarding what constitutes a feasible precaution. The report, citing about a dozen sources who spoke to the New York Times, claimed that some IDF officers involved in the bombing campaign became far less stringent about adhering to military protocols after the shock of the October 7 massacre. While some commanders worked hard to maintain compliance, five senior officers reportedly described the mood in the military using the term 'harbu darbu' (A Hebrew slang expression coined from the Arab harb wadarb: Battles and war). The outlet noted it received a 700-word response from the IDF and included excerpts of it alongside interviews with senior officials to understand the policies. The IDF confirmed that the rules for approving strikes changed after October 7 but stressed that its forces have 'consistently been employing means and methods that adhere to the rules of law.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: IDF representatives explained that the changes to strike protocols were made in the context of an 'unprecedented and hardly comparable to other theaters of hostilities worldwide.' The response cited the massive scale of Hamas' deadly terror attack, the terrorists’ use of civilians as human shields and the extensive tunnel network as factors influencing military target selection and the ability to take various precautions before strikes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryi00s09r1x	2024-12-26T05:10:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/22/SyVUNsj4T/SyVUNsj4T_0_124_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Moshe disappeared in Israel's 'Bermuda Triangle', and he's not th...	Searches still continue for several Israelis who went missing in the area between Safed and Meron including Moshe Eliezer Ilovitch, whose family refuses to give up efforts to find him The area between the northern Israel cities of Safed and Meron has earned the nickname 'Bermuda Triangle' for good reason. Its dense, open terrain, spiritual aura and holy sites intertwine with years of poverty and neglect, culminating in the tragic disaster that has claimed the lives of 45 people. The region's nature attracts shady figures and cult members who seem to find it a lawless space, leaving the price to be paid by tens of thousands of law-abiding citizens. This phenomenon has also led to a troubling pattern of disappearances — ranging from a young girl to an elderly man. On Wednesday morning, the Israel Police’s Canine Unit, Safed police station and other organizations launched yet another operation to locate some of the missing individuals: Moshe Kleinerman (16 at the time of his disappearance) missing since March 25, 2022, near the Tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai; Haymanot Kasau, 9, who vanished in Safed on March 25; Raphael Chaim Hadad, 60, last seen in the Safed area on November 18, 2022; David Israel Padida, 28, missing since October 15, 2024, also from Safed, and Moshe Eliezer Ilovitch, 37, who disappeared on May 18, 2019, near Meron just before the Jewish holiday of Lag B'Omer. The missing individuals’ families assisted in the search, which focused on caves, pits, thickets and hiding spots. Yet, like many previous efforts, this operation ended with no breakthroughs. 'It’s been a long time since searches took place,' said Aharon, Moshe’s son. 'It’s always relevant to try finding something new, there’s been no trace of my dad since he disappeared.' The list of the region’s missing extends even further. It includes, for example, Yoram Fliter, 32, a Safed resident who disappeared under mysterious circumstances on October 8, 2023, though his car was later found near Beit Shemesh; Shalom Dahan, 60, missing since February 15, 2017, in Hatzor HaGlilit; and even Haviv Ben Abu, 80, who went to Meron on Lag B'Omer eve in 1995 and has not been seen since. The home burned down during the searches Aharon, who was 16 when his father Moshe disappeared, still recalls the shock and fear when his father didn’t answer the phone on that Saturday night. Since then, his family has lived with one question looming over them: What happened to him? 'I have no answers, only hope,' he says. Moshe was 42 at the time of his disappearance. He lived on Mount Meron after his divorce and worked in Safed. He was last seen at the Tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai on the morning of May 18, a few hours before he vanished. 'There were no prior indications, nothing unusual,' Aharon says, describing his father as someone who loved the area and handled personal struggles just like anyone else. Aharon, now 21, is the second of Moshe's five children. He was supposed to spend that Sabbath with his father, but Moshe stopped answering his phone as early as Thursday. 'I was waiting for him to call me Saturday night, but it never happened,' he recalls. Concerned, Aharon went to his father’s home the next day, but five and a half years later, Moshe is still missing. The family had lived in Mevo Modi’im, but Moshe had moved to Meron a few months earlier following his separation from his wife. The children frequently visited him for Sabbaths and holidays and were planning to spend Lag B’Omer with him. Aharon recounts that his father and friends were evicted from their rented apartment days before the holiday to make way for foreign visitors willing to pay high sums for accommodations near the celebration. This common practice in the area forced them to camp in tents nearby. On May 17, about an hour before the Sabbath, a friend drove Moshe from Safed to Meron, reporting nothing unusual in his behavior. CCTV cameras recorded Moshe at the tomb at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday. He then walked toward the tents. Since then, no trace of him has been found. The area, a dense forest with pits and rugged terrain, has caused others to lose their way in the past. Despite extensive searches, no sign of Moshe or the other missing individuals has been found. According to Aharon, his father struggled after the divorce but showed no worrying signs. 'It was a mutual decision and everything ended amicably,' he says. 'We even visited him together with my mom.' On Sunday evening, May 19, Aharon and his younger brother went to Meron to investigate. 'I went to the tent where he stayed and all his belongings were there — except for him,' he says. The next day, the family reported him missing to the police. Amid their anguish, the family faced another tragedy when their home in Mevo Modi’im burned down completely. 'I was out searching for my dad when a friend told me the town was on fire. My sister called, saying the younger siblings had been evacuated,' Aharon recounts. Homeless and overwhelmed, they rented an apartment in Safed to stay close to the search area. 'He might have wandered into a forest' Eli Ben-Tovim, a veteran search volunteer in northern Israel, has known Aharon since his father's disappearance. 'I met the family the day they reported Moshe missing. Aharon was only 14 and seeing his mother running around with a baby stroller to search for her husband was heartbreaking,' he says. Ben-Tovim noted that recent searches resumed in previously restricted forested areas following the war. 'If someone’s lost, injured or worse we should’ve found them. It’s unusual if we don’t.' Meron, he adds, attracts individuals seeking solitude or refuge. 'But Moshe wanted to see his family. I don’t think he intended to disappear. He might’ve wandered into a forest, fallen or gotten hurt.' Initially, the family felt the police weren’t making enough effort but they saw improvement after Israel’s Canine Unit joined the case. 'They’ve supported us ever since,' Aharon says. 'Police involvement felt dismissive before that.' Even after Moishi Kleinerman’s disappearance in the same area, Aharon remains skeptical of law enforcement’s dedication. 'Every few months, they’d call my mom to ask if we found him and hang up,' he says. 'They would have found him if they truly wanted.' Monetary reward leads to tips, not breakthrough The family even offered a monetary reward — first 50,000 NIS ($13,628), then 100,000 ($27,256) — but every lead ended in disappointment. Aharon recalls traveling to Jerusalem after receiving an unclear photo suggesting Moshe had been spotted. 'I rushed there before Sabbath, but a video later confirmed it wasn’t him.' Aharon has taken on his father’s role, supporting the family and strengthening bonds among his siblings and extended relatives since May 18, 2019. 'We’ve grown closer. We’re a strong family, and we’re all waiting for him,' he says. 'He’s missing from everything — Sabbaths, meals, daily life trips,' Aharon says, his voice heavy with emotion. 'He wasn’t there for my younger brother’s bar mitzvah three years ago. My brother initially refused to celebrate without him. 'We had to convince him and it was a very charged event. We went to the Western Wall with our grandparents and the whole family — but my dad wasn’t there. I hope he’s back in time for my wedding,' Aharon said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I don’t know what happened to him,' Aharon concludes. 'I’ve considered every possibility over the years. After all this time, all I have left is hope. I feel he’s alive but I can’t explain why he hasn’t contacted us. 'If he’s listening, I want him to know that we’re still strong and waiting for him no matter what — me and the rest of the kids. I’ve even imagined waking up one morning and seeing him smiling next to me. That would be a joy beyond words.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bji5x69sjg	2024-12-26T04:23:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/HkwheOZSye/HkwheOZSye_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

The women were questioned for hours after they placed the leaflets featuring pictures of hostages under the heading 'Let My People Go' on seats in the synagogue where a member of Knesset prays The Attorney General's Office has closed the case against the three women who were arrested in September for placing leaflets in the synagogue where Knesset member Yuli Edelstein prays in Herzliya. The leaflets placed on seats in the synagogue featured pictures of several hostages, including the Bibas family, under the heading 'Let My People Go.' The police said at the time that 'three suspects, residents of Herzliya, were arrested for questioning on suspicion of trespassing into a synagogue in the city and distributing leaflets there.' It was also reported that 'during the investigation, the police noticed flyers scattered inside the synagogue with pictures of the hostages.' The suspects were arrested and brought to the police station for questioning.' The women were then interrogated for about eight hours and released to their homes under restrictive conditions. They were also banned from being up to 300 meters from Edelstein's house or synagogue for 15 days.

Journalists are mishandling critical evidence in Syria needed for...	Absence of capable personnel to safeguard institutions after the Assad regime’s collapse has led to the mishandling of documents and potential criminal evidence that journalists, in a race for exclusives, have found in prisons and security branches From the collapse of the Syrian regime and the flight of former President Bashar Assad, a deluge of news stories has emerged from a nation struggling to recover. Syria, described as a vast prison under the Assad regime, has revealed dozens of detention centers and security branches rife with evidence of war crimes. Many media professionals have observed that much of this reporting lacks proper oversight, partly due to the chaotic handling of sensitive documents left in these facilities. Journalists, in a race for exclusives, often accessed these sites without authorization, mishandling materials that could serve as critical evidence in prosecuting crimes. Arab media, for example, widely reported on documents retrieved from security branches implicating former officials in war crimes. Yet many of these documents subsequently disappeared, erasing evidence vital for accountability. Syrian political analyst Wael Al-Khalidi criticized journalists entering government facilities without authorization from the new Syrian administration. He stressed that any handling of documents should occur under the supervision of national authorities, warning that journalists otherwise risk being perceived as 'thieves' pilfering sensitive material – a scenario that has indeed occurred. Ibrahim Hussein, director of the Syrian Center for Media Freedoms, highlighted the need for professional standards, urging reporters to prioritize their safety and ethical integrity. 'Journalists must also be familiar with local and international laws regarding handling forensic evidence. It is essential not to tamper with, move, or alter evidence unless necessary to preserve it,' he explained. Similarly, Mohammad Al-Sattouf, a member of the Journalists’ Association, emphasized the importance of verifying the authenticity of documents and preserving their integrity. He advised consulting experts to validate evidence and maintain confidentiality, particularly when dealing with sensitive investigations or witness testimonies. Ethical violations have also recently extended to the treatment of former detainees. Some media outlets, such as Al Jazeera, were criticized for bringing former prisoners back to their cells and asking them to reenact the conditions of their detention. Observers condemned this as a severe breach of journalistic ethics, turning reporters into interrogators. Al-Sattouf pointed out that journalists have an ethical duty to respect privacy and avoid publishing graphic images or content that violates the dignity of victims and their families. Instead, he stressed the need for balanced coverage that delivers the facts while upholding humanitarian principles. Journalist Ahmed Alayan condemned such practices as a descent into 'media madness.' He attributed these ethical breaches to the lack of professional standards in many media organizations, calling for immediate reform to prevent further harm. The proliferation of misinformation in Syria, compounded by years of violence and suppression, represents another significant challenge. Misleading narratives have fueled hatred and distorted facts, both locally and globally. Ahmed Primo, director of the verification platform Taqat, warned of the dangers of misinformation in the context of detention and imprisonment. He cited examples of well-intentioned misinformation that undermined the credibility of verified testimonies, videos and photos. Primo highlighted a case involving the BBC, where the network misled the public by claiming its correspondent in Damascus facilitated the release of a former detainee, who later turned out to be a security officer complicit in crimes. He also emphasized the critical role of the new Syrian authorities in maintaining evidence integrity. 'While we advocate for media freedom, there must be guidelines to ensure responsible reporting,' he said. The mishandling of evidence, Primo argued, risks obstructing justice. Sensitive materials must be preserved for prosecuting perpetrators rather than exploited for journalistic scoops. Since the collapse of the Syrian regime, the state-run media has remained largely paralyzed. Officials cite a lack of qualified personnel to manage even basic operations, such as running the state television network. Despite widespread public demands for a robust national media to report on ongoing developments, Syrian state media remains conspicuously absent, leaving a vacuum of reliable information. A source close to the Ministry of Information in the new Syrian government stated that the level of chaos in state institutions following the fall of the regime was not as extensive as might have been expected, considering the magnitude of the event. The source noted that the fall of the regime in such a manner could have resulted in even greater disorder. The source, who requested anonymity, highlighted the severity of the mishandling of documents, which could serve as criminal evidence, that occurred in prisons and security branches. However, this occurred due to the absence of capable personnel to safeguard these institutions after the regime’s collapse. In this context, Ibrahim Al-Qaddah, a member of the Syrian military cadre, said that the situation has now reached an acceptable level of stability. He affirmed that all institutions and their documents are currently protected, and the government has expressed its willingness to cooperate with any international body seeking to investigate crimes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Previously, the head of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria requested access from the new authorities to begin on-the-ground investigations into atrocities. The UN has expressed concern over the potential loss or destruction of critical evidence. While sufficient evidence exists to prosecute those responsible for crimes in Syria, preserving these materials requires coordinated efforts among all stakeholders, according to the Commission. Remote evidence collection by the UN’s International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism has supported approximately 230 investigations in 16 jurisdictions, including Belgium, France, Sweden and Slovakia.

He advised consulting experts to validate evidence and maintain confidentiality, particularly when dealing with sensitive investigations or witness testimonies. Ethical violations have also recently extended to the treatment of former detainees. Some media outlets, such as Al Jazeera, were criticized for bringing former prisoners back to their cells and asking them to reenact the conditions of their detention. Observers condemned this as a severe breach of journalistic ethics, turning reporters into interrogators. Al-Sattouf pointed out that journalists have an ethical duty to respect privacy and avoid publishing graphic images or content that violates the dignity of victims and their families. Instead, he stressed the need for balanced coverage that delivers the facts while upholding humanitarian principles. Journalist Ahmed Alayan condemned such practices as a descent into 'media madness.' He attributed these ethical breaches to the lack of professional standards in many media organizations, calling for immediate reform to prevent further harm. The proliferation of misinformation in Syria, compounded by years of violence and suppression, represents another significant challenge. Misleading narratives have fueled hatred and distorted facts, both locally and globally. Ahmed Primo, director of the verification platform Taqat, warned of the dangers of misinformation in the context of detention and imprisonment. He cited examples of well-intentioned misinformation that undermined the credibility of verified testimonies, videos and photos. Primo highlighted a case involving the BBC, where the network misled the public by claiming its correspondent in Damascus facilitated the release of a former detainee, who later turned out to be a security officer complicit in crimes. He also emphasized the critical role of the new Syrian authorities in maintaining evidence integrity. 'While we advocate for media freedom, there must be guidelines to ensure responsible reporting,' he said. The mishandling of evidence, Primo argued, risks obstructing justice. Sensitive materials must be preserved for prosecuting perpetrators rather than exploited for journalistic scoops. Since the collapse of the Syrian regime, the state-run media has remained largely paralyzed. Officials cite a lack of qualified personnel to manage even basic operations, such as running the state television network. Despite widespread public demands for a robust national media to report on ongoing developments, Syrian state media remains conspicuously absent, leaving a vacuum of reliable information. A source close to the Ministry of Information in the new Syrian government stated that the level of chaos in state institutions following the fall of the regime was not as extensive as might have been expected, considering the magnitude of the event. The source noted that the fall of the regime in such a manner could have resulted in even greater disorder. The source, who requested anonymity, highlighted the severity of the mishandling of documents, which could serve as criminal evidence, that occurred in prisons and security branches. However, this occurred due to the absence of capable personnel to safeguard these institutions after the regime’s collapse. In this context, Ibrahim Al-Qaddah, a member of the Syrian military cadre, said that the situation has now reached an acceptable level of stability. He affirmed that all institutions and their documents are currently protected, and the government has expressed its willingness to cooperate with any international body seeking to investigate crimes.

The UN has expressed concern over the potential loss or destruction of critical evidence. While sufficient evidence exists to prosecute those responsible for crimes in Syria, preserving these materials requires coordinated efforts among all stakeholders, according to the Commission. Remote evidence collection by the UN’s International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism has supported approximately 230 investigations in 16 jurisdictions, including Belgium, France, Sweden and Slovakia.

Hamas official says situation in Gaza makes compiling hostage lis...	Arab outlet cites official as saying talks between Israel and the terror group continue; Israel denies receiving list detailing live hostages in Hamas captivity A senior Hamas official told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed Thursday overnight that claims suggesting Mohammed Sinwar was inflexible and refused to provide a full list of living Israeli hostages as part of efforts to ensure a hostage and cease-fire deal are false. According to the official, Hamas has provided such a list — including those its members managed to contact through the factions responsible for holding them. Israel has consistently denied that such a list was delivered throughout the talks. The official added that the terror organization has held talks with other factions holding hostages, but that it was impossible to communicate with all of them due to the situation in Gaza. He further said Hamas has affirmed during negotiations its willingness to provide a complete list of living hostages once the situation in Gaza stabilizes and after a cease-fire is achieved. The official also noted that the local leadership of the Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, operates in 'harmony' with the terror group’s political leadership, asserting there’s 'complete agreement' between them. He said Khalil al-Hayya, who served as former leader Yahya Sinwar’s deputy, has effectively been authorized to make decisions in the negotiations as the head of Hamas's negotiation team. Al-Hayya is part of a leadership council Hamas established following Sinwar’s assassination, which includes four other key Hamas figures: the movement’s leader abroad Khaled Mashal, Hamas leader in the West Bank Zaher Jabarin, the head of Hamas’s Shura Council Muhammad Darwish and senior official Nizar Awadallah. The outlet also reported that one unresolved issue pertains to the release of Palestinian prisoners. According to the report, the release of some 'high-profile' prisoners — including Marwan Barghouti, Ahmad Sa’adat, Abbas al-Sayed, Abdullah Barghouti, Ibrahim Hamed and Hassan Salameh, along with two senior Islamic Jihad officials — would be postponed to the final stage of the deal.

Shocking report on hell experienced by hostages rescued from Gaza...	A draft report by the Ministry of Health, based on testimonies from hostages who were released or rescued from Gaza, describes the difficult time they spent in captivity and the consequences. The immune system weakened by the lack of food, the mental state deteriorated due to the abuse they experienced - and the fear of 'immediate feeding syndrome after starvation' for hostages who return in the future Neglect, torture and humiliation: The Ministry of Health has recently completed work on a draft special report that includes hard-hitting testimonies from the hostages who were released in the previous deal or rescued from Hamas captivity in Gaza. Once the work on the report is complete, it will be transferred to the Justice Ministry and presented to the United Nations committee that deals with torture. 'It contains materials that tell the story of those who returned from captivity over the past year, some in the major return operation in the last week of November 2023, and some in other cases of rescue,' a senior official at the Health Ministry said of the report. The Health Ministry was careful to word the information provided in the report in a way that would prevent identification of the freed hostage and there is no mention of ages or family composition. The senior official at the Health Ministry added that the report 'includes information that the returning hostages did not share in the first weeks after returning home. As time passed, they allowed themselves to share more. It describes many aspects of neglect, torture, humiliation, and physical and mental abuse.' According to the draft, some of the hostages experienced a very large weight loss, and they experienced starvation and malnutrition. In adults, this was reflected in a loss of 8 to 15 kilograms, and in children there was an average loss of 10% of their pre-captivity weight, in some cases a loss of 18% of their weight. The report noted that this loss has significant consequences, such as 'muscle breakdown and a weakened immune system. As a result of appalling hygiene, and unclean water, hostages suffered from stomach pains and diarrhea during their time in captivity. All of this has serious psychological consequences, certainly when it comes to children.' It was also noted that, in preparation for the return operation last year, the captors fed the hostages. This was reflected in the blood tests of the survivors of captivity. The report describes the fear in Israel of what is defined as 'immediate feeding syndrome after starvation.' After 446 days in captivity, the fear that the captors will give the hostages still in Gaza to food gain weight - putting their lives at risk - is even greater. According to the draft report, the hostages were held alone in the dark for days, tied hand and foot, and given very little food. They were beaten all over their bodies, some had their hair pulled out, and in some cases their skin was burned with an iron heated over a hot fire. Others testified to a lack of showers and to being forced to defecate on themselves. It is also noted that several hostages described having their bandages changed without painkillers, and that they experienced immense pain under medical treatment. The hostages who were released were in very poor sanitary conditions, and sometimes it took days and hours before they were allowed to go to the bathroom. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The purpose of publishing the report is to tell the world what the hostages went through in Hamas captivity, given that the health of some of them has deteriorated in the long time that has passed since the previous hostage return deal. A senior official in the Health Ministry concluded: 'The most important thing is that those who can influence, certainly in the world, will understand that they need to put pressure on Hamas and make them return the hostages home.' Health Minister Uriel Bosso told Ynet: 'I see this as a significant report that describes the horrors the hostages endured and will expose to the world the cruelty of the enemies we face. The evidence presented in it is a wake-up call for the world to put more pressure on Hamas and its supporters to release everyone, now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b13c0kqskg	2024-12-25T23:32:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/16/r1gfuE008Mke/r1gfuE008Mke_0_96_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Ben-Gvir visits the Temple Mount and 'said a prayer'	Minister of National Security announces that he prayed at the holy site in honor of the Hanukkah holiday, contrary to the status quo; Prime MInister's Office responds that there is 'no change in the status quo'; Minister has called for the establishment of a synagogue on the Mount National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the Temple Mount this Thursday morning and, according to his office, 'offered a prayer' there, in defiance of the status quo. According to Ben-Gvir's office, his ascent to the Mount was in honor of Hanukkah, and he prayed there for the peace of IDF soldiers, the return of the kidnapped alive and the fallen, and 'complete victory' in the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was informed of Ben Gvir's intention before he visited the Temple Mount, and the Prime Minister's Office was quick to respond to his announcement that 'the status quo on the Temple Mount has not changed.' In previous cases where Ben Gvir ascended the Temple Mount, the Prime Minister's Office was forced to disavow his statements. In the past, it has even stated that 'the determination of policy on the Temple Mount is directly subordinate to the government and its head.'

Syria tried to erase its Jewish history, but the fall of Assad ha...	Justice for Jews from Arab Countries uncovers the systematic displacement and cultural destruction of Syria’s Jewish population, and tells the story of a community even older than the Arabs themselves and Islam A systemic and deliberate elimination of the vibrant 2,500-year-old Jewish community in Syria took place largely between the first decades of the 20th century and 1958. In addition to constituting a brain drain and cultural loss to the country, it carries receipts of more than $10 billion by contemporary measures in seized property, assets and holdings. These are among the many findings in a blockbuster report released by Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC), a group representing Jews from the Middle East and North Africa. The report is the product of six years of painstaking forensic reporting, quantifying the theft and total erasure of a multi-faceted centuries-old indigenous culture of nearly one million people that existed in the Middle East for 1,500 years before the advent of Islam. With the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, JJAC released its first report – out of 11 – as part of this historic project. Its contents are available now for the first time. The remaining reports will be released over the coming months. According to Rabbi Dr. Elie Abadie, co-president of JJAC, the publication of this data perfectly fulfills the organization’s mission. 'We want to educate everybody, especially people who are the descendants of Jews from Arab countries, then the Jewish community and then everybody else,' Abadie said. 'With the revelation of this history comes a recognition of the injustice that was visited upon the indigenous Syrian Jewish community,' he added. 'It’s a story that very few people know about it. What [the Syrian government] did was uproot a community that goes back to the time of the destruction of the First Temple. They uprooted a community even older than the Arabs themselves, older than Islam. And they did it with impunity. They covered up the story and never really were taken to task for what they did,' Abadie asserted. The erasure of the Syrian Jewish culture is especially dramatic. 'The community was renowned for its substantial economic contributions. Jewish merchants played a role in foreign trade, managed significant banking networks, and engaged in international commerce connecting Syria with Baghdad, Persia and India,' states the report. However, from the 1930s onward, the Jews’ situation in Syria was imperiled by Arab nationalist movements that were targeting the local Jewish community. This took the form of 'fascist-inspired movements, the emergence of Nazi-style youth groups, increasing physical attacks, and growing antisemitic rhetoric,' according to the report. 'The post-World War II era saw the most aggressive persecution, including comprehensive property confiscation, severe movement restriction, systematic economic marginalization, violent incidents, and government-sanctioned harassment,' according to the report. The report’s 94-page Historical and Economic Analysis of Syria’s Jewish community details the researchers’ scope and methodology in uncovering and documenting seized assets; included is a breakdown of economic losses by category, such as rural assets, urban assets, and valuation of personal property and moveable assets. It also explains how the present-day valuations were calculated. Born in Lebanon, Abadie is the son of Syrian Jews from Aleppo. 'My parents suffered persecution,' he said. 'They escaped Aleppo – my mother in 1948 and my father in 1950 – and found safe haven in Lebanon, bribing immigration officials, train conductors,' and others along the way. But they suffered twice, he said, as they were eventually driven out of Lebanon in 1971. According to Abadie, Syria went into a tailspin after kicking out its Jewish population. 'It is not a matter of opinion but fact,' he stated. 'Bereft of creativity, money, finances and culture, what was left of Syria? Or Yemen? Or Lebanon? These countries became backward countries. They lost.' The JJAC report recounts that the Jewish community of Syria, mainly in Damascus and Aleppo, numbered 50,000 in the early 20th century but fell to 30,000 by 1948 and 5,000, some ten years later. By 1991, only 100 Syrian Jews remained in their native land, and of those, only four Syrian Jews are believed to be living there today. The cause of this dramatic attrition was 'continuous state-sponsored persecution and discriminatory policies,' according to the report. The timing of the report is significant given the abrupt regime change in Syria, said JJAC co-president Sylvain Abitbol, who serves with Abadie. 'The current narrative is that the Jews are Europeans and colonizers and that there is only one set of refugees because Jews have never been part of the landscape of the Middle East. We are coming out with a report that documents the presence of Jews in the Middle East for thousands of years,' he explained. The newly released report on Syria’s vanquished Jewish community is only the first in the series. It aims to prove that Jews are an indigenous people of the Middle East, having lived in the region continuously for millennia, fully 1,500 years before the advent of Islam. 'Occurring in the latter part of the 20th century, the breadth and scale of the near-total displacement of Jews from eleven Muslim countries ranks among the more significant cases of mass displacement in modern history. For over 75 years, the world has ignored some 1,000,000 Jews uprooted from the totalitarian regimes, dictatorships and monarchies of Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, Yemen, and Aden, as well as Iran. Today, less than 1% of those Jews remain,' states the report. 'We have been expelled from all those countries,' reiterated Abitbol, a Moroccan Jew who was forced to leave his country in 1967 at the age of 18. He went to France and then settled in Canada. Telling the truth about the expulsion of nearly one million Jews from Arab lands does not negate the Palestinian narrative, he said. 'But it does expand the lens to include the Jewish refugee saga.' Echoing Abadie, Abitbol spoke about the losses of the Jewish communities driven out of Arab lands and the vacuum that was left behind. 'We left assets, businesses, our homes, communal organizations,' he recounted. Despite the losses incurred by the Jewish community, he wishes to tell the leadership of the countries who drove out their Jews, 'Look at what you’ve lost! Imagine what would have been if we stayed in your country and prospered. Look at what we did in Israel. In France. We came and built. We contributed to society. We built houses. We built back.' The contemporary progressive argument that views Palestinian terrorism as an inevitable outcome of the establishment of the State of Israel is countered by the example of Jews like Abitbol, who were expelled and went on to excel in their adopted countries, eschewing vengeance. Abitbol received his engineering degree, built businesses, and went on to win Canada’s coveted Queen Elizabeth Jubilee Award for contributions to his new country. 'Did we scream? No. Did we stay angry? No. We got an education and worked hard. We are the People of the Book. One of the only things we were able to take with us was our education,' he said. But even within the global Jewish community, the story of the expulsion of the Jews from Arab lands is largely unknown. The reason for this is complicated, explained Abadie. Occurring on the heels of the Holocaust, the plight of the expelled Middle Eastern Jews appeared to pale in contrast to the murder and persecution of millions of European Jews, many of whom were also arriving in the new Jewish state at the same time. However, there are other reasons why this important narrative was suppressed internally. According to Abadie, the young State of Israel was eager to convey that the great influx of Jews from Arab lands was arriving motivated by Zionist zeal. And while this was not entirely untrue, the Zionism of the Middle Eastern Jews was spiritual and religious in nature, not political. 'Our early leaders wanted to pretend that the Arab Jews were coming of their own volition, not as refugees,' he said. 'They believed in Zion but in the sense that they had a connection to Israel, which they understood as the land that God promised to our forefathers. They understood Zionism as part of being a Jew, part of Jewish destiny.' And Israel was the country at that time that was opening her arms to them In fact, so stubbornly did the Israeli government resist embracing the truth that it took JJAC 10 years to convince it, in 2014, to recognize the Middle Eastern refugees by creating Yom HaPlitim, Jewish Refugee Day, which is now observed every year on November 30. The funder for JJAC’s ambitious project is anonymous. In addition to the timeliness of forensics reporting on the seizure of assets and property of Syria’s historic Jewish community, there is an important lesson to be learned from the true, unvarnished history and resilience of Syrian Jews whose worldwide community, numbering more than 100,000, now live primarily in the United States and Israel. One of those lessons is national pride Noam Harary is an independent film director and actor who lives in Brooklyn. 'Syrian is my primary signifier; it is how I identify, it is how I am portrayed, it is the food I lean to, it is the songs I like, the music I sing, the accents in my synagogue,' he explained. Harary’s father, Ralph, was a Syrian Jew born in Brooklyn. His family lived in Aleppo until 1909, when his grandfather came to the United States and worked to bring his family over. His mother, Miriam, is Israeli. While Harary also feels a kinship with his Israeli heritage, his heart and soul are Syrian, he stated. He said that growing up, he felt 'Arab first, Jewish second.' He laughed, considering how radically the world has changed in just a couple of decades since that time, and added that such a statement sounds absurd today. Harary gets emotional as he speaks about his father’s heritage and his own and his family’s history. 'It was only later in life that I started to understand that being a Syrian Jew was second-class,' he explained. 'The expulsion was slow and deliberate and deliberately ambiguous. We were purposely made to feel uncomfortable. There were anti-Jewish riots. It was hard to do business. We experienced Pharaoh’s hardened heart,' he said, using a biblical analogy. 'We were told, ‘You cannot leave my land!’ and then ‘Get out of my land!' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The expulsion of the Jews of Syria was indeed a nakba of sorts, Harary said, using the Arabic word for 'catastrophe' that Palestinians commonly use for the displacement of Palestinian refugees during Israel’s War of Independence. 'The Arab lands kicked out 1 million Jews over the last 100 years. It is remarkable as a Syrian Jew to understand that.' But emphasizing what Abitbol said, Harary described how Syrian Jews built vibrant communities of their own in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side, in Deal, New Jersey, and elsewhere. As an adult, he understands the once-annoying instruction Syrian parents gave their children to marry only other Syrian Jews to preserve their culture in the diaspora. When asked what made him proudest to be a Syrian Jew, Harary responded instantly: 'We are Jews from the cornerstone of civilization. Jews existed [in Syria] for centuries. As a people who are told we have to go home, I find it hard to understand what that means when my people were expelled from our home. I am proud of my Arabic heritage. I am proud of my Arabic food. We’re spicy people, the Latinos of the Middle East.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bkkylw9hye	2024-12-25T20:59:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/Skez9YeqSJg/Skez9YeqSJg_0_0_360_270_0_small.jpg
Israel considers a significant attack on Yemen targeting Houthi l...	After the fourth missile launch in a week toward Israel, Jerusalem admits that the Houthis are a tough nut to crack and understands that another air strike on Yemen will not lead to a solution; However, a fundamental change is expected only after the Trump administration takes office next month. Security sources: 'They will pay a heavy price, there will be an escalation' The series of missile launches from Yemen toward the territory of the State of Israel may change the balance of terror: After hundreds of thousands of Israelis woke up to sirens during the previous night overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday following a ballistic missile launched by the Houthis for the fourth time in the past week, and the second night in a row, Jerusalem is considering a significant attack deep inside Yemen, including harming the leadership of the Islamist terrorist organization. The issue of the possibility of a significant attack on Yemeni territory is being raised in talks with the Americans, and the parties are closely coordinating the continuation of the campaign. There is an understanding in Washington that the attacks must be intensified, and that the Yemenis are drunk on power and will not back down. Israel admits that the Houthis are a tough nut to crack, because they are clearly feeling good about themselves. Unlike the other elements of the Shiite axis, who have all suffered a morale blow, the Houthis are on a high because many in the world did not really know about their existence, and today they constitute a militant factor with great sympathy among the Arab public. The understanding in Israel is that another attack will not solve the problem, and therefore a fundamental and profound change is needed. In Jerusalem, they estimate that this can only happen after the Trump administration takes office on January 20, in the hope that the new-old president will take a tough stance against the Houthis. 'The Houthis will pay a heavy price, there will be an escalation in Israeli attacks,' according to security sources. 'But that's nothing compared to what will happen to them after the Trump administration takes office. The Americans are preparing to impose an embargo and heavy sanctions on them.' At the same time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to spread threatening messages toward the East. 'Today we are lighting the first candle of Chanukah to mark the victory of the Maccabees then, and also the victory of 'the Maccabees of today',' Netanyahu said Wednesday night at a candle lighting event with his office employees and their children. 'Like then, we are striking at our enemies, and those who thought they could cut the thread of our lives here then, this will apply to them all. The Houthis will also learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned, and this will also take time. This lesson will be learned across the Middle East, I tell you, in those days at this season,' he added. Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also addressed the issue. Galant, who was dismissed from his post last month, said at the lighting of the first candle of Hanukkah at the Ramat Efal school, which was severely damaged last week by a missile launched by the Houthi militias , that there is now a real opportunity to act against the terrorist organization in Yemen and to concentrate Israel's efforts there, in the shadow of the increasing launches from this arena , as well as against the leadership of the terrorist organization. According to Gallant, joint Israeli-American action against the Houthis should be pushed for, which would constitute preparation for action against Iran 'in a short time.' Gallant hinted that the Houthi leaders should be targeted: 'At this time, new conditions remain. It is possible and necessary to concentrate more effort against them. It is possible to achieve different results against their leadership. We need to join the American effort, because joint action by Israel and the U.S. has a practical effect - and no less than that, it will constitute preparation for future actions that we will be forced to take against Iran in the not-too-distant future.'

Mideast expert says diplomacy not enough to address Houthi threat...	Dr. Nir Boms says 'we need to put as much pressure as possible' on the Houthis and calls on incoming US administration to help Diplomacy alone cannot resolve Israel’s challenges with the Houthis, according to Dr. Nir Boms, a research fellow at the Moshe Dayan Center. 'We need to put as much pressure as possible,' Boms told ILTV, 'and some of this pressure is in the form of targeted military strikes on the relevant infrastructures.' Boms explained that while military action is essential, it comes with significant limitations. Given that Yemen is approximately 2,000 kilometers from Israel, such operations cannot occur frequently. 'This is a campaign that needs to get the help of other stakeholders that hopefully will help bring Yemen to a different place,' he said. Boms emphasized that the Houthis are not acting independently. 'This is not the Houthis on their own. This is one of the last fronts that remains in Iranian hands. That is why they are getting all the equipment and all the latest technology. This is not their doing. It’s Iran,' he explained. Looking ahead, Boms expressed cautious optimism about the role of American leadership. 'We need to hope that [the new] American leadership will be more assertive,' he said, referencing President-elect Donald Trump.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk0v11iqsyx	2024-12-25T18:47:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/05/rkUdBF3rp/rkUdBF3rp_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Why does Hanukkah remind us never to give up hope?	Rabbi Ariel Constantine talks about the light of Hanukkah amid difficult times in the State of Israel Hanukkah is a holiday of light and a reminder that 'you should never give up hope,' according to Rabbi Ariel Constantine of the Tel Aviv International Synagogue. 'We have special celebrations throughout the holiday to bring light to Tel Aviv, to the world,' the rabbi told ILTV on Wednesday, the first night of the eight-day Hanukkah holiday. 'Indeed, Hanukkah is a holiday light, a festival that is here to bring some light in dark times.' Constantine explained that Hanukkah falls in the month of Kislev, the darkest month of the year. The days are shortest and coldest, and it is often a time when people may feel like giving up hope. However, he said, 'the holiday teaches us that you should never give up hope. We should always have faith and always look for that little light.' In the Hanukkah story, the Maccabees found that little light amidst the ruins of the violated and desecrated temple during those dark times. They decided to light the menorah in the temple despite not having enough oil, believing that even a little light could make a big difference. 'God appreciated their efforts and extended that light throughout the eight days until they could bring new oil and the light could grow brighter and brighter,' the rabbi said, adding that today, in honor of that miracle, Jews add a new candle each night of the holiday. 'These are indeed trying times,' Constantine said. 'One hundred hostages still in Gaza, soldiers out there fighting for freedom. But we, the Jewish people, our national anthem is ‘The Hope’ – Hatikvah. We will never give up hope. We're always going to seek a better future.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sygmtv5bkx	2024-12-25T17:04:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/08/HyT7b2e8p/HyT7b2e8p_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israel summons Vatican ambassador over Pope's criticism, but says...	Following harsh remarks by Pope Francis accusing Israel of targeting children in Gaza, the Foreign Ministry summoned the Vatican ambassador to express its displeasure; Despite the summons, Foreign Ministry have said they do not view this as an official reprimand Following harsh statements made by Pope Francis against Israel in the past week, and under the directive of Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Foreign Ministry Director General Eyal Bar-Tal summoned the Vatican's ambassador to Israel, Archbishop Adolfo Tito Yllana, for a meeting. The meeting, held on Tuesday at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem during the approach of the Christmas holiday, was not classified as a reprimand. However, Bar-Tal expressed Israel’s strong displeasure with the Pope’s comments. In response to the pope’s remarks, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein issued a rare and strongly worded statement, saying: 'Cruelty is when terrorists hide behind children while trying to kill Israeli children. Cruelty is holding 100 hostages for 442 days, including infants and children, and abusing them,' Marmorstein wrote in Israel’s official response. 'Unfortunately, the pope chose to ignore all of this, as well as the fact that Israel’s actions were directed at terrorists who used children as human shields. The pope’s comments are particularly disappointing, as they are disconnected from the real and factual context of Israel’s fight against jihadist terrorism – a multi-front war imposed on Israel since October 7.' On Saturday, Pope Francis accused Israel in a sermon to Vatican officials of spraying Palestinian children in Gaza with machine guns and bombing schools and hospitals. 'With great pain, I think of Gaza, of so much cruelty, of children sprayed with machine guns, of the bombings of schools and hospitals. Such cruelty,' the Pope said. On the following day, he escalated his tone, repeating in his weekly Mass that Israel is cruelly spraying children with machine guns.

Radwan documents uncovered in Lebanon reveal guidelines, and fear...	The Radwan Force documents found during operations in southern Lebanon add to understanding of elite unit, which gave its operatives detailed instructions on how to camouflage themselves in the field and avoid Israeli surveillance; 'The enemy must be made to think that we are on high alert,' states the document, which dealt with 'fear of Israeli eavesdropping' In addition to the many weapons that IDF forces located in southern Lebanon, it also found personal documents of the Radwan Force, the elite unit of the Hezbollah terrorist organization that suffered many losses during the war. The documents reveal, among other things, the unit's methods of operation, and some of them contain detailed instructions for operatives regarding camouflage in the field: 'It is forbidden to smoke hookahs or light a light,' and, due to concerns about Israeli eavesdropping, 'one must speak in encrypted form.' The documents are handwritten and, in addition to names, numbers and personal details about elements in the unit, we can learn about the unit's activities, whose goal before the October 7 massacre was to penetrate Israeli territory and take control of areas near the border. For example, one of the documents details the dimensions of six Hezbollah firing positions. Another page details instructions for the terrorist organization's operatives - 'How to avoid detection?' Among other things, it states that camouflage and cleanliness must be maintained during work, that hookahs are prohibited, and that lights must not be turned on while in bed. The operatives are also told that they must keep records at all times, and that they are not allowed to leave their shift before submitting a situation assessment. One of the documents seized was written in August 2020, and one section states that 'the enemy must be made to think that we are on high alert.' The same document also mentions a fear of Israeli eavesdropping: 'We must talk in encrypted form about internal affairs, because the Israelis are monitoring everything.' The page also dealt with the outbreak of the coronavirus, which was relevant at that time. In recent months, the IDF spokesman has revealed the Radwan Force's method of operation. In October, about a month after the start of the ground operation in Lebanon, Brigadier General Daniel Hagari said that 'for years Hezbollah has been planning how to invade our territory on command - and now we are revealing the method.' He noted that the forces had turned civilian villages in southern Lebanon into fortified combat complexes and fortified staging areas under dense vegetation. 'The organization built a system of underground combat complexes under dense vegetation, in which it kept various weapons,' he said.

Netanyahu set to attend Trump's inauguration in Washington DC	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, alongside global leaders including Argentina’s Javier Milei and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán; This marks Netanyahu’s first trip abroad since the ICC issued an arrest warrant against him Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to travel to the United States aboard the official Wing of Zion airplane to attend the second inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, according to sources close to the prime minister. Trump has invited 50 guests to his inauguration, including Netanyahu, with whom he reportedly speaks every two days. Other notable attendees include Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, both strong supporters of Israel. In addition, sources close to Netanyahu estimate that his wife, Sara, will return to Israel from Miami in the coming days. She traveled to the U.S. on November 27 and extended her stay by several days. Sara Netanyahu is expected to return to Israel after Christmas. Last month, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. If Netanyahu travels to the U.S., it will mark his first trip abroad since the warrants were issued. The warrants require all 123 member states of the ICC to arrest Netanyahu or Gallant upon their arrival and transfer them to the court. However, Netanyahu can safely visit the U.S., which is not a member of the ICC, though the flight route typically passes through the airspace of ICC member states.

Jewelry for survival: The dark role of the Houthis' female brigad...	In a region plagued with a severe humanitarian crisis, the Houthis have devised a method to enforce terror and 'raise funds.' Houthi women, known as 'Zainabiyat,' compel other women, teenage girls and young children to attend 'Support Gaza' events and surrender their remaining jewelry 'for the cause.' A human rights organization report concluded: The women's brigades have carried out sexual assaults, beatings and rapes in detention centers Arbitrary arrests, looting, torture, and rape: The Houthis continue their attacks on Israel and, in the name of 'Support for Gaza,' impose terror on the territories they control in Yemen – a region already suffering from a severe humanitarian crisis. This terror is enforced, among other means, through a military arm composed entirely of women. The Houthi women, known as 'Zainabiyat,' work to recruit more and more women for 'war effort' activities using threats, theft, assaults and, at times, torture. The 'Zainabiyat' are essentially a tool for oppressing Yemeni women, forcibly recruiting them, and stealing their money – now under the pretext of supporting Gaza. The female Houthi militias are, in effect, a Yemeni version of similar phenomena seen in other Shiite-axis countries: whether it’s the Iranian regime's attempts to suppress and persecute the public, or Hezbollah's female arm in Lebanon. Saudi Arabia's Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper reports that the 'female arm' of the Houthis forced hundreds of Yemeni women and girls in the capital Sana'a, its rural areas, and the provinces of Hajjah and Ibb to participate in recruitment activities aimed at supporting the Houthis' missile and drone forces. Girls were documented carrying weapons, and even young children were 'recruited' in the name of the 'Support for Gaza' effort. Each year, Shia Muslims commemorate the birthday of Fatimah al-Zahra, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, who is considered a revered figure. Over the years, this date has become 'Women's Day' in several Muslim countries, marked by festive events. Yemen also celebrated this occasion last weekend, with the Houthis releasing footage of large-scale women's activities. However, these recordings fail to reveal the terror happening behind the scenes at events held under the banner of 'Women's Day.' Sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that, this year, the Houthis established dozens of women's field teams under the directive of their leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, to force Yemeni women to participate in recruitment activities for the war effort. Women from Sana'a, which is under militia control, told the newspaper that the Zainabiyat conduct surprise home visits to 'encourage' them to join these activities and donate any money or jewelry they possess, claiming that the support is directed to Gaza and is essential for confronting 'American and Israeli attacks.' The women, living in severe poverty, reported that the Zainabiyat use threats and intimidation during these 'recruitment attempts' — even targeting teenage girls. Um Abdullah, a housewife from the Al-Qa'a neighborhood in Sanaa, told the Saudi newspaper that she and other women were forced to attend a 'recruitment event.' She expressed her dissatisfaction with the fundraising, which is supposedly intended for Gaza and Lebanon, but in reality funds the Houthis' warfare while ignoring the dire living conditions in Yemen. Yemeni women, vulnerable to the Zainabiyat's threats, accuse the Houthi leadership of exploiting the Palestinian cause and the suffering of Gazans to enrich themselves through these so-called 'donations.' Reports indicate that the nucleus of the Houthi women's unit began to form in the city of Saada in northwestern Yemen, even before Sanaa fell to the Houthis in 2014. Over the years, they have played a central role in arresting and prosecuting opponents of the rebels. Their missions have expanded since the Houthis took control of the capital: They are now responsible for organizing protests, distributing food supplies, spreading the militia's ideology among women, spying on women's councils, and have even been entrusted with security and intelligence operations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sky News Arabia reported several years ago that the first female operatives received training from Iranian and Lebanese experts. The Houthi women are trained to use weapons and drive military vehicles. They typically wear regular clothing with the traditional Muslim veil.

According to some reports, they have also participated in planting landmines and explosive devices. In 2022, a human rights report revealed 1,444 violations committed by the military arm of the Houthi women's militia between December 2017 and October 2022.

Nearly a month after the northern cease-fire began, the IDF on Wednesday showcased the significant collection of weapons and equipment Hezbollah had prepared for a large-scale invasion of Israel. The plan, described as far deadlier than the October 7 massacre in southern Israel, was thwarted during IDF ground operations. IDF forces confiscated at least 85,000 weapons and intelligence items, with additional findings still being uncovered along the Lebanon border. Tens of thousands of other pieces of weaponry were destroyed in Lebanon during the campaign but were not retrieved due to logistical limitations. The display, open to foreign media, featured anti-aircraft guns mounted on jeeps, hundreds of advanced anti-tank missiles (including long-range models), modern AK-47s, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles from both Eastern and Western manufacturers, explosives of varying sizes, and ammunition boxes on a scale suitable for a small, advanced army. The exhibition also included chemical warfare masks intended for use by Hezbollah fighters in gas and smoke-filled conditions, as well as GoPro cameras meant to document the planned invasion of the Galilee. According to IDF, the confiscated arsenal includes approximately: 6,840 RPG launchers, rockets, and anti-tank missile systems (including 340 Kornet missiles) 20 military vehicles 9,000 explosives and explosive devices 60,800 pieces of electronic equipment, communication devices, computers, and documents 2,250 artillery shells and high-trajectory missiles 2,700 light weapons 2,860 additional weapons and equipment 60 anti-aircraft missiles 300 observation tools and binoculars The IDF reported that ground maneuvers were conducted in about 30 Shiite villages along the 130-kilometer border, stretching from Rosh Hanikra to Mount Dov. However, Hezbollah still retains hundreds of thousands of weapons, including heavy rockets, precision missiles, and drones, although the majority of its arsenal was destroyed during Operation 'Northern Arrows,' according to the IDF. The IDF clarified that it did not enter approximately 50 additional Shiite villages used by Hezbollah, located on both sides of the Litani River. In recent weeks, Israeli forces in southern Lebanon have continued targeting Hezbollah operatives who violate the cease-fire agreement. Over the past month, more than 40 operatives have been eliminated, in addition to the approximately 3,000 Hezbollah fighters killed and 7,000 injured over the last year out of the group’s estimated 30,000 military personnel. Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army has begun deploying along the border, and IDF has withdrawn to Israeli territory from those areas. Engineering operations to destroy Hezbollah bunkers and internal combat tunnels are ongoing. The IDF emphasized that the initial 60-day period of the agreement does not represent a 'sacred deadline' and that the stages of the agreement will be implemented gradually under an 'American umbrella.' This is the first time the U.S. is leading the enforcement mechanism, which is already operational as Israeli residents return to evacuated Galilee communities.

Houthis claim its security services exposed 'network of Mossad sp...	Houthis say the 'spies' were recruited by a wanted figure who passed information to Israel and the US; Claim network was tasked with passing information on the locations of forces and weapons, tracking senior officials, and gathering information on the whereabouts of the rebel leader A few hours after launching another ballistic missile toward central Israel in the middle of the night, the Houthis issued an unusual statement Wednesday, reporting that the group's security services had exposed and arrested several spies in recent days who had been passing information to the Mossad. According to an official statement from the Houthis, the spies were recruited by a wanted figure named Hamid Hussein Fayed Majli, who would pass the information on to Israel and the US. 'The enemy tasked the spies with carrying out intelligence activities, including tracking and determining the locations of missiles, UAVs, naval forces and other military sites,' the Houthis claimed. According to their statement, the spies were also tasked with tracking and locating military, political and security leaders and social figures, and information was also collected on experts, laboratories, and missile and UAV launch vehicles. They also claimed that the location of the Houthi naval forces, their bases and weapons depots was monitored, and there was even an attempt to track and collect information on the whereabouts of their leader in Yemen, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. According to the Houthis, the spies were asked to pass on coordinates to Majli, so he could pass them on to the Mossad. 'Enemy intelligence asked the spies to infiltrate, recruit and plant agents and spies in the ranks of the security forces and the army,' claimed Iranian envoys in Yemen. Majali, the Houthi statement noted, was recruited by Saudi intelligence in 2008 and is linked to American and Israeli intelligence agencies. The same agencies 'tasked him at the beginning of the 'Al-Aqsa Flood,' the Palestinian name given to the war with the surprise attack on October 7, to carry out operations 'to attract and recruit spies.' 'The enemy intelligence wants to use espionage to stop the Yemeni people's support for Gaza, by attacking the Houthi military forces and senior officials,' the Houthis claimed. The Houthis said they would 'fulfill their responsibility to secure the home front and protect against infiltration attempts by the Americans and Israelis,' and threatened the death penalty for anyone who cooperates with them. 'We warn of the risk of working for the American and Israeli intelligence services - the penalty for doing so could be death. We call on everyone who is and was a partner in passing intelligence to the enemy to surrender themselves to the legal authorities. We will be able to reach them wherever they are. We call on everyone to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement or activity.' This is not the first time the Houthis have claimed to have captured spies. In June, the rebels claimed they uncovered an intelligence network 'linked to the Mossad and U.S. intelligence services.' They claimed that 'there is a lot of evidence and we are talking about dozens and perhaps hundreds of elements from various organizations and institutions taking part in the intelligence network.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network reported in June that the Houthis claimed that the network had been operating in the country since 2015, gathering information and also working to influence the economy. It was also reported that the network had succeeded in influencing decision-makers 'and in penetrating the state's mechanisms.' The Lebanese network said at the time that the network had 'provided American and Israeli intelligence with military information in order to weaken the army and its capabilities.' The Houthis later released videos showing the 'spies' who had been caught. The Saudi Asharq Al-Awsat reported that the Houthis raised their state of alert to the highest level, and 'moved most of their forces to the areas of the lines of contact with government forces' and ordered shipping companies to evacuate their warehouses in the port of Hodeidah, in preparation for an imminent Israeli attack, 'which will be different from its predecessors.' Local sources told the newspaper that the Houthis are also preparing for the possibility of a popular uprising against them. Houthi intelligence services have conveyed messages to residents in various areas to avoid talking on the phone or on social media about the sites that were hit by Israeli and U.S. attacks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjbzc6th1x	2024-12-25T10:05:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/15/BkQx600Vp0/BkQx600Vp0_0_234_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Syrian police impose curfew in Homs after unrest	yrian police have imposed an overnight curfew in the city of Homs, state media reported, after unrest there linked to demonstrations that residents said were led by members of the minority Alawite and Shiite Muslim religious communities. Reuters could not immediately confirm the demands of the demonstrators nor the degree of disturbance that took place. Some residents said the demonstrations were linked to pressure and violence in recent days aimed at members of the Alawite minority, a sect long seen as loyal to former President Bashar Assad, who was toppled by Sunni Islamist rebels on Dec. 8. State media said the curfew was being imposed for one night, from 6 p.m. local time until 8 a.m. on Thursday morning.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjn7qath1e	2024-12-25T09:10:00-08:00	
Defense Minister visits Philadelphi Corridor: 'We will ensure the...	Defense Minister Israel Katz visited the border between Gaza and Sinai, emphasizing Israel’s commitment to maintaining security control in Gaza, establishing buffer zones and creating control posts; His visit comes as negotiations with Hamas for a hostage deal face significant obstacles Defense Minister Israel Katz visited the Philadelphi Corridor, the border region between the Gaza Strip and Sinai, and reiterated Israel’s commitment to maintaining security control in Gaza. Amid challenges in the hostage negotiations with Hamas, Katz on Wednesday announced plans to establish buffer zones and 'control positions' to ensure long-term security. Katz was accompanied by the Southern Command chief, Major General Yaron Finkelman, and Gaza Division commander, Brigadier General Barak Hiram. According to his office, the minister received an operational and intelligence briefing from field commanders regarding IDF activities in the area. 'I came to Gaza to meet the commanders and fighters who are doing extraordinary work with courage, ingenuity and determination,' Katz said. 'Their mission is clear: to create the conditions for the release of the hostages and to ensure the security of the State of Israel.' He continued: 'Security will remain in the hands of the IDF, which will act decisively to eliminate threats, prevent tunnel activity, dismantle terrorist infrastructure, disrupt enemy organization efforts and thwart any attacks on Israel or its soldiers. We will ensure the threats we’ve seen – such as infiltrating tunnels and other dangers – do not return. IDF will retain security control and will have the authority to operate anywhere necessary to neutralize threats. 'We will guarantee that just as we have on the borders with Lebanon, Syria and in the east, no new threats will emerge against Israeli communities, citizens, or IDF troops. In Gaza, we will establish security zones, buffer areas, and control positions to protect our communities. Alongside these measures, we will pursue the two main objectives of this war: to bring all the hostages home and to defeat Hamas.' Katz underscored that 'there will no longer be a governing or military Hamas here. A new reality will emerge thanks to the daily fighting that continues even now. I met with soldiers, including reservists, all of whom are determined and saying, ‘Keep going, let us finish the mission to ensure security and bring the hostages home.’ That is exactly what we will do.' Katz’s remarks came shortly after Hamas accused Israel of introducing new conditions that allegedly delayed progress in the negotiations. 'Talks around a cease-fire and prisoner exchange are ongoing in Doha, with Qatari and Egyptian mediation. Hamas has shown responsibility and flexibility,' the terror group claimed. It accused Israel of introducing new demands, including withdrawal from Gaza areas, new cease-fire terms, names of hostages, and the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza. These demands, according to Hamas, are delaying an agreement that is 'within reach.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office responded, stating, 'The Hamas terrorist organization continues to lie, is reneging on understandings that have already been reached, and is continuing to create difficulties in the negotiations. However, Israel will continue its relentless efforts to return all of our hostages.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Philadelphi Corridor has been a focal point of contention in the negotiations for months. Israel captured the corridor in May, with Netanyahu repeatedly emphasizing its strategic importance, as it serves as a critical route that Hamas could use to smuggle weapons for future rearmament. Recent reports suggested Israel had agreed to a significant withdrawal from the corridor as part of a potential deal. However, an unnamed Israeli official denied these claims, stating, 'Israel has not agreed and will not agree to withdraw from most of the Philadelphi Corridor, as our presence there prevents Hamas from rearming and strengthening itself.' Earlier this month, Katz himself commented that the Philadelphi and Netzarim Corridors would not pose obstacles to reaching a deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ja82ksyl	2024-12-25T08:51:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/Hygjqf9FHkx/Hygjqf9FHkx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Over 85,000 weapons, missiles and military items belonging to Hezbollah have been confiscated by the IDF in Southern Lebanon, according to the IDF. At the beginning of October 2024, the IDF began limited, localized, targeted ground raids to dismantle Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon. As part of the operations led by the IDF Northern Command, the forces operated against Hezbollah in more than 30 areas across southern Lebanon. The troops identified and destroyed terrorist infrastructure, eliminated terrorists, and located and confiscated numerous weapons. The IDF confiscated over 85,000 weapons, missiles, and military items, including rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, RPGs, rifles, explosives, munitions, anti-aircraft missiles, observation devices, and military vehicles. The confiscated weapons were used by Hezbollah to attack Israeli civilians and were intended to be deployed as part of Hezbollah’s 'Conquer the Galilee' invasion plan. Hezbollah’s military capabilities have been significantly degraded as a result of the IDF’s ground raids, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1i4xhtbyx	2024-12-25T07:20:36-08:00	
98-year-old Holocaust survivor, whose 3 granchildren were killed ...	Yosef Viner, a Holocaust survivor who rebuilt his life in Israel, died at the age of 98, just a year after his grandchildren were killed in the Hamas massacre at Kibbutz Kfar Aza; His life, marked by resilience and tragedy, ended as the pain of unimaginable loss overwhelmed him once again Yosef Viner, a Holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to building a family in Israel, died on Wednesday morning at the age of 98, just a year after three of his grandchildren were killed in Hamas' brutal massacre at Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7. Viner’s life, as a grandfather and great-grandfather, began in the shadow of the Nazi atrocities and unfolded in the rebuilding and establishment of a life in Israel. However, his journey ended as the unbearable pain of loss struck him once more. Viner arrived in Israel after losing his entire family in the Holocaust. Following the massacre on October 7, Joseph penned a haunting account of his life journey and personal grief: 'I am Yosef Viner, 97 years old. I survived the fire of the Nazi beasts; my entire family perished. Disconnected from my roots, I built a memorial from basalt stones in their memory. Exhausted and despairing, I held onto the land and planted myself in Zion.' A family member of Joseph shared with Ynet today: 'Joseph was a strong man, a true survivor. But when they came to tell him about the murder of his grandchildren, it was the first time I ever saw him cry.' Here is the full text Joseph Wiener wrote, describing the horrors after the massacre: 'I am Yosef Viner, 97 years old. I survived the fire of the Nazi beasts; my entire family perished. Disconnected from my roots, I built a memorial from basalt stones in their memory. Exhausted and despairing, I held onto the land and planted myself in Zion.'

The horrifying sights of fire and ash, murder, and the ruthless killing of innocents came back to me once again. My beloved grandson Yahav, may his memory be a blessing, was murdered while protecting his wife, Shai-Li, and their one-month-old daughter, Shiya. My dear granddaughter Hadar and her husband Itay were murdered while defending their 10-month-old twin sons, Roi and Guy. Once again, I am utterly exhausted, in despair, drowning.

Hamas claims Israel imposes new conditions on cease-fire; Netanya...	Terror organization claims cease-fire and hostage release talks are 'serious,' but accuses Israel of setting new conditions on several issues. Prime Minister says 'Hamas is reneging on the understandings that were reached' A day after Israel's team negotiating a cease-fire and hostage deal returned from Qatar, Hamas issued a statement at noon on Wednesday claiming that the negotiations were progressing 'seriously,' but accused Israel of 'imposing new conditions' on several issues, which allegedly has delayed reaching an agreement. Shortly before the terrorist organization's statement, families of hostages held captive in Gaza delivered a statement from Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, on the 446th day of the war. After Hamas' statement, the Prime Minister's Office issued its own statement which said that 'The Hamas terrorist organization continues to lie, is reneging on understandings that have already been reached, and is continuing to create difficulties in the negotiations. However, Israel will continue its relentless efforts to return all of our hostages.' Hamas addressed the negotiations, claiming that 'negotiations on the cease-fire and prisoner exchange are continuing seriously in Doha, with Qatari and Egyptian mediation, and the movement has shown responsibility and flexibility.' In addition, the terrorist organization claimed that Israel 'has posed new issues and conditions related to withdrawal (from areas in Gaza), a cease-fire, hostages, and the return of displaced persons (to the northern Gaza Strip), which is delaying the achievement of the agreement - which was achievable.' At the same time, Egyptian sources claimed to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that 'the cease-fire negotiations in Gaza are 'steps away from the finish line.' Agreements have been reached on the points that were in dispute during the last negotiation period.' According to the sources, 'one of the points that is expected to be resolved is the one related to the lists of hostages and prisoners,' and they added that 'there is a proposal to delay the release of a list of 10 prisoners with heavy sentences whose names were provided by Hamas, including Marwan Barghouti.' Earlier, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum announced that the statement by their representatives comes 'against the backdrop of various reports regarding negotiations for the return of their loved ones.' 'There will be no victory and no security until they return' In her statement, Yishi Miren Lavie, wife of hostage Omri Miren, emphasized that '446 days ago, Omri was kidnapped in front of my eyes and in front of our little daughters' eyes, after we were held hostage for a few hours as a family. Some 446 days ago, I joined the community. A community that no one wants to be a part of. A community of more than 200 families. The community of the families of the kidnapped. Some 446 days ago, I did not even understand the magnitude, I did not even know how long this terrible journey together would continue.' 'Today, after 446 days, I know that I will never be able to disconnect from this community,' she added.. 'But I also know that the terrible journey that was forced upon us must end and the journey of rehabilitation must begin. For everyone. Everyone must be saved, everyone must return, whether it is to the embrace of the family or to a proper burial in an Israeli grave. I call out to the decision-makers - think of Roni and my mother. Hear them in your head as I hear them every day - 'Where is Dad?' 'When will Dad come back?', 'I want Dad.' Think of all the little children who are just waiting for a hug from their father, grandfather, aunt. Think of all the children of the State of Israel who have been denied the right to lead a normal life and who have been living in a state of war for more than a year. 'And my Omrili, if this reachesyou - like 446 days ago, today too: I love you, I'm waiting for you and I'm watching over our girls. I promised you with a farewell look then and I promise you today too, we will do everything until you return, until you see Roni and Alma running toward you. Until you hear the word 'father' again. We don't give up, we don't despair and we won't stop as one community fighting until everyone is here.' Shir Sigal , Keith's daughter, said she is making the statement 'as the daughter of Keith, who over a year ago was certain that he would be the next to be released home - a moment after he and my mother were brutally separated when she was returned to Israel in a deal.' According to her: 'There are moments in history when every decision is fateful, and these days are exactly like that. Every moment of postponement or hesitation, every delay in negotiations or in the process of returning our brothers and sisters home - could cost human lives and prevent us from being able to return the murdered and fallen for a proper burial in our country.' Shir added that 'from the stories of my mother and other hostages who were returned, and also according to all professional sources - it is absolutely clear: the hostages do not have time. We must return them home before the harsh winter in the tunnels. My mother, Aviva, survived 51 days of hell in Hamas captivity - and miraculously returned home. Since she was returned, she has been breathing this pain every moment. Her pain has no respite - pain for my father, her husband, and for all the children, parents, brothers and sisters who are still there.' Yuval Or, whose son was killed and whose grandchildren were kidnapped to Gaza, said: 'We did not choose to lose our son. We did not choose for our grandchildren to be kidnapped. But now we have a choice - to continue the cycle of blood or to stop it. We choose to stop.'

The possibilities range from an immediate deal within a few days, to no deal at all. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said regarding the return of the negotiating team from Doha that 'the negotiating team, which includes senior officials from the Mossad, Shin Bet and IDF, will return to Israel from Qatar, after a significant week of negotiations. The team returned for internal consultations in Israel regarding the continuation of negotiations for the return of our hostages.' The statement did not provide further details. In Israel, officials emphasized that the return of the team after 10 days in Qatar does not indicate a breakdown in talks. Following a prolonged negotiation process, the team now needs to conduct consultations. Israeli officials are placing blame on Hamas in Gaza, particularly on the leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Sinwar, for creating difficulties and refusing to provide a full list of hostages, allegedly in an attempt to extract further concessions. 'There’s no collapse of the talks, but we’ve reached a point where decisions need to be made in Israel whether to continue with a deal without the lists,' said an Israeli official familiar with the details. 'Hamas has consistently lied. Even last time, Hamas claimed it had no women among the hostages, which was false. The question now is whether to play into their hands. We need a solid foundation to proceed with the deal, to determine whether we are releasing prisoners in exchange for bodies or live hostages. The terms are different, and we won’t start an agreement based on lies.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjz6ccys1e	2024-12-25T06:51:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/S1Q8MpPYHJl/S1Q8MpPYHJl_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Bombardment by the Pakistani army in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province on Tuesday killed at least 46 people, most of whom were children and women, said the Afghan Taliban on Wednesday, while, vowing to retaliate against their neighbor. The bombing occurred at four locations in Afghanistan, deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said on Wednesday, adding that six people were also injured.

TTP pledges allegiance to, and gets its name from, the Afghan Taliban, but is not directly a part of the group that now rules Afghanistan. Its stated aim is to impose Islamic religious law in Pakistan, as the Taliban have done in Afghanistan.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyotysfs1g	2024-12-25T06:09:24-08:00

Houthis say arrested spies employed by Israel	The Houthis in Yemen claimed in an official statement that they had arrested a number of 'spies,' who they said were employed by Israeli and American intelligence. According to the Houthis, 'the enemy assigned the spies intelligence activity tasks, including monitoring missile force sites, drones, naval sites and other military sites.' The Houthis also said that 'the spies monitored military, political and security leaders,' and that 'the enemy tried to recruit and plant agents and spies in the ranks of the security forces and the army.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxgxqkhkx	2024-12-25T05:15:20-08:00

Israel expands rocket alert zones as Houthi missile attacks persi...	Houthi missile launches trigger growing alarm zones, from 68 localities last Thursday to 169 overnight; following failed Tel Aviv interception, IDF expanded alerts, sending over 300,000 more residents to shelters compared to previous night For the fourth time in a week, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered alarms across central Israel overnight. Millions of residents in 169 localities, including Beit Shemesh, Modiin, Ra’anana and Ramat Hasharon, were awakened by sirens at 4:22 a.m., marking the broadest alert coverage yet. The expanded alert system follows a failed interception on Saturday night, when a Houthi missile struck a school in Ramat Efal. The IDF acknowledged the delayed alert in that incident and announced adjustments to ensure wider warning zones. 'Lessons have been learned and implemented,' the military said. The new policy’s impact has been immediate. Compared to 143 localities affected the previous night, alarms were heard in 169 localities early Wednesday morning. This policy aims to mitigate risks from falling interceptor debris, which in recent incidents caused damage in residential areas, including Be’er Ya’akov. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF said that the latest missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, with alarms activated as a precaution against potential falling debris. However, the expanded alert zones meant over 300,000 additional residents were directed to shelters compared to earlier missile launches. Until recently, alarms were not sounded for missiles intercepted outside Israeli territory. For example, two Houthi missile launches earlier this month were intercepted without triggering sirens. The IDF explained that the change was prompted by recent incidents, including the Ramat Efal strike, where a missile warhead breached the defense system and caused significant damage. The new approach reflects a balancing act between safety and the disruption caused by frequent alarms. 'The updated alert policy ensures maximum protection,' the IDF said, but it has also led to millions of Israelis being awakened almost nightly. As the Houthi missile campaign intensifies, Israeli authorities face growing challenges in managing both security risks and the psychological toll on the population. For now, the sirens—and the sleepless nights—are unlikely to abate. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r14ezkfhkx	2024-12-25T04:13:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/HkAe0NtSyg/HkAe0NtSyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Houthi leadership in Israel’s sights as some push for action on I...	Israeli lawmakers weighing 2 strategic approaches as tensions escalate; IDF advocates targeting Houthis directly to hold them accountable for their actions, while Mossad contends striking their Iranian patron in Tehran would send far more decisive message Many Israelis were forced to rush from their beds to the bomb shelter in the dead of night for the fourth time in a week. Although the ballistic missile launched from Yemen Wednesday morning was successfully intercepted, the Houthis continue to establish themselves as a central threat following the cease-fire in the north and the dismantling of much of Hamas' capabilities in the south. The combination of missiles and drones in this sector has created a reality where sirens sound every other day and even at night. As anticipated in Israel, the third Israeli Air Force strike in Yemen has only increased the Houthis' appetite to continue launching attacks. The Houthis even added a new drone infiltration route to the one they previously used — via the Mediterranean, crossing the Sinai Peninsula to Gaza and then to the western Negev. Meanwhile, Israel is still debating whether to strike Iran, as proposed by Mossad Director David Barnea, or Yemen, as suggested by the IDF. Barnea presented his proposal to the Security Cabinet, arguing that such a move could deter the Houthis and pressure Tehran to rein in their Yemeni branch. However, a senior IDF official countered, claiming that Iran's influence over the Houthis is not comparable to its hold over Hezbollah, describing the Houthis as 'a kind of independent and unruly child.' According to the official, such a strike would not achieve the goal of deterring the Houthis and could instead reopen a direct front with Iran. Barnea believes Iran is currently deterred by Israel, especially after the latest strike and even more so on the cusp of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Defense Minister Israel Katz addressed the issue twice within 12 hours, reiterating that Israel would target the Houthis without mentioning Iran. 'We won’t tolerate the Houthis continuing to fire on the State of Israel,' Katz said. 'We’ll deal with the Houthi leaders in Sanaa and across Yemen.' Indeed, targeting the organization's leadership is a potential option, aligned with a policy where indiscriminate fire from Yemen toward Israel may be met with a similarly broad response. The challenges in this sector are well-known, with intelligence gaps being the foremost issue — not because the IDF’s intelligence and Mossad have neglected the threat but because they’ve faced far more urgent missions in Lebanon, Syria, Iran and Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The second challenge is the distance, which makes strikes complex and costly. On the other hand, these operations serve as live training for potential strikes in Iran. Throughout the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has almost always sided with the Mossad chief's position over the military's when disagreements arose. These decisions have proven effective, as seen in operations like the pager operation and Hassan Nasrallah’s elimination. It’s possible Netanyahu will align with Barnea’s approach again. In the meantime, nighttime alarms courtesy of Yemen are likely to continue. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkuradfskx	2024-12-25T03:54:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/Hk4TtDtSyx/Hk4TtDtSyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel concerned Syria’s 'charm offensive' fooling the West	IDF demands Syrian villagers surrender weapons; Israel warns US about extremist Islamists in Syria’s new government despite Ahmad al-Sharaa’s conciliatory tone; The 'Houthi dilemma' adds further challenges As Donald Trump avoids commenting on U.S. operations in Syria, Israeli officials express concern over what they perceive as excessive enthusiasm from the outgoing American administration toward Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani. Direct dialogue between the U.S. and the rebels has been ongoing since the fall of the Assad regime, culminating in the lifting of a $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa’s head, once placed for his jihadist activities. While Washington acknowledges Israel’s security concerns, it advocates giving the new Syrian government under al-Sharaa a chance. Israeli officials, however, remain cautious, saying, 'The burden of proof is on al-Sharaa and his team. We must not forget their ideological roots.' The IDF is currently active in the buffer zone and the Syrian Golan Heights, areas it secured after Assad’s fall. Tensions in local villages have risen, despite some cooperation. In Jubata al-Hashab, IDF troops reportedly demanded residents surrender their weapons, promising military action if compliance was not met within 48 hours. Similar incidents occurred in other villages, including Khader and Maariah, where protests over the weekend led to clashes. Israel’s immediate priority is securing its northern border communities. Officials believe the IDF should maintain its presence while monitoring the new Syrian government’s alliances and regional dynamics. Al-Sharaa has publicly emphasized inclusivity, pledging parliamentary representation for all ethnic groups and avoiding conflict with Israel, Druze, Alawites or Turks. However, Israeli skepticism runs high, especially following the October 7 attacks, with concerns over a potential 'charm offensive' masking ulterior motives. Al-Sharaa, formerly affiliated with al-Qaeda and once the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra, has distanced himself from extremist Sunni terror groups, embracing Syrian nationalism instead. While he speaks of a unified, democratic Syria, Israeli officials question his ability to deliver on these promises. Meanwhile, Israel anticipates eventual tension with the new Syrian government over its presence in the buffer zone, particularly as al-Sharaa consolidates power. Observers suggest that adherence to the 1974 Disengagement Agreement could stabilize the region if Syrian forces refrain from threatening Israel, a dynamic that held for nearly five decades under Assad. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar expressed doubts during a classified session of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee: 'The new Damascus government mirrors Idlib’s extremist leadership. They present themselves as moderate to the West, which is eager to legitimize them to facilitate refugee repatriation.' Israel continues quiet dialogue with Turkey, whose interests in Syria are significant. Talks between Israeli intelligence agencies, including the Mossad and Shin Bet, and Turkey’s MIT intelligence service are underway. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for a policy review on relations with Turkey amid these discussions. The Houthi challenge The Houthis have intensified their missile launches toward Israel, with millions in central Israel awakened by alarms four times in the past week. A missile struck a school in Ramat Efal, while another landed near residential buildings in Tel Aviv, causing significant damage. Israel faces a strategic dilemma amid these attacks, with factors including the upcoming U.S. administration change on January 20, the Houthis' distant location complicating military action and the broader desire to address threats from Iran. Currently, U.S.-Israeli cooperation against the Houthis remains close. The U.S. leads a coalition of 12 nations targeting Houthi operations at sea, but its effectiveness has waned. With fewer commercial ships traversing the Red Sea and Suez Canal, the Houthis have largely shifted focus away from maritime attacks. Israeli officials note the Houthis are emboldened, in contrast to low morale among other Iranian-aligned groups, which have faced significant setbacks. Once obscure, the Houthi militia is now gaining support in the Arab world and has been sustaining operations against Israel for over a year. Israel plans to engage with the incoming Trump administration on addressing both the Houthi threat and the broader Iranian issue. Meanwhile, Sa’ar has launched a diplomatic campaign to expand the international designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization. Already labeled a terrorist group in the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the UAE, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Israel, Sa’ar emphasized the global risk they pose. 'The Houthis are a threat not just to Israel but to the region and world order. Their direct attacks on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes challenge international stability. Declaring them a terrorist organization is the first and necessary step,' he said. Amid this backdrop, Defense Minister Israel Katz visited an Arrow missile defense battery with Air Defense Command head Brig. Gen. Gilad Biran. Katz praised the unit for their success in intercepting a ballistic missile launched by the Houthis overnight. Katz received an operational briefing from 136th Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Eyal Frankel and other officers. 'Israel has the best air defenses in the world,' Katz said. 'Millions rely on you. They wake up to alarms but trust you to handle the threat. We won’t tolerate continued Houthi attacks on Israel. Just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will deal with Houthi leaders in Sanaa and across Yemen.' Katz added, 'We will target their infrastructure and leadership to eliminate the threat. Those sponsoring Houthi terror in Hodeidah or Sanaa will pay the full price. We trust only the IDF to protect our citizens and won’t allow new threats to emerge. Today’s missile warfare is the first of its kind, and you will continue defending Israel’s skies while we strike decisively to remove these threats.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyeproks1l	2024-12-25T03:38:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/rkIrxquBJl/rkIrxquBJl_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg

Death or imprisonment': Syrian media workers fear new regime	While Syrian opposition channels that broadcast outside of the country celebrated Assad's fall, pro-regime channels and workers say they fear changes that could negatively impact them During the decades of Assad family rule in Syria, local media was mobilized to promote regime propaganda, while outlets supporting the opposition often operated outside the country, particularly after the civil war. The coup in Syria also shook the country’s media landscape, especially channels affiliated with the ousted president, Bashar Assad, who fled the country to Russia. These outlets suddenly found themselves without a regime or directives imposed from above. Some channels quickly replaced the old Syrian flag with the opposition’s flag on their social media profiles and continued reporting. Others took longer to process the dramatic developments and resume operations. This transition is marked by significant fear among journalists who covered the war from the regime’s perspective, as they now face the new government led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who’s attempting to reform his public image domestically and abroad. Freedoms in Syria were severely restricted under the Assads — both Hafez and his son Bashar — including freedom of expression and the press. The regime controlled the media to propagate its messages, limited the entry of foreign journalists, restricted independent newspapers and ceased the publication of printed newspapers entirely by 2020. Today, Syria ranks second-to-last in Reporters Without Borders' 2024 Press Freedom Index, just ahead of Eritrea. During the civil war, channels closely aligned with Assad’s regime operated alongside opposition outlets that offered their own narratives about the events in Syria, such as the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The launch of the Syrian rebels’ Operation Deterrence of Aggression, which ultimately led to the toppling of the Assad regime, further intensified the contrast between pro-regime and opposition media. Opposition outlets reported on the rebels’ progress, the capture of key sites and maps detailing their advances, while pro-regime media focused on portraying the 'resilience of the Syrian army' and echoed statements from the Syrian Defense Ministry. These channels repeatedly warned viewers against 'unverified rumors' circulating online, urging them to rely only on official reports. Eventually, these 'official' updates ceased altogether, with the Defense Ministry halting announcements on December 7, as the rebels approached Damascus. In a live broadcast on Syrian state television during these critical moments, one studio speaker paused mid-sentence as the rebels took control of the facility, remarking, 'There’s noise and the door is open.' Shortly thereafter, the rebels delivered a message to Syria and the entire world: 'We’ve won.' On December 8, as the rebels entered Damascus, the official Syrian news agency SANA suspended its reports; Syrian state television displayed the message: 'The rebels have won, the Assad regime has fallen,' and the pro-regime radio station Sham FM announced that it was ceasing broadcasts due to the situation on December 9. 'Sham FM is temporarily halting its programming and coverage until the general situation stabilizes, enabling us to provide reliable daily news for our people at home and abroad,' the station announced after the regime's downfall. 'The station sees itself as a Syrian institution committed to anything that will bring Syria to safety and restore normalcy to people’s lives. For now, we’ll broadcast Fairuz’s songs and plays by the Rahbani brothers.' Despite the temporary halt, Syrian media outlets gradually resumed operations, now reporting on the new leadership. SANA’s Telegram channel updated its logo and resumed activity under the rebels' flag, while Sham FM also returned to broadcasting, aligning its coverage with the new de factor leader’s meetings. However, despite the gradual return to work under the new flag, journalists who worked for the regime remain fearful for their lives. Syrian journalists who covered the civil war and Assad's regime now express deep concern about the new government. According to Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, fears stem from the new Syrian administration's decision that anyone who covered the war and served as part of the Assad regime’s propaganda machine — thereby directly or indirectly contributing to its crimes and massacres — will face fair trials under transitional justice. A Syrian journalist told the Lebanese paper that, for the first time in 14 years, she’s afraid not for herself but for her family, who could be harmed. 'My crime is being a journalist and my family’s crime is being related to a journalist,' she said. Another journalist added: 'We survived covering battles, but this time it seems our fate is inevitable — death or imprisonment — because of the profession we love and depend on for our livelihood.'

Israeli cities face sleepless nights of alarms amid Houthi missil...	Nearly half of Israelis awoke to alarms overnight, the fourth time this week amid Houthi missile attacks; interceptor fragments damage Be’er Ya’akov home and found in Modiin; UN Security Council to meet on Houthi attacks: 'Hold Iran accountable' In less than a week, half of Israel’s population has been jolted awake four times by alarms triggered by Houthi missile launches from Yemen, marking what appears to be a new campaign of attrition. While Israel's missile defense systems have intercepted the rockets outside its territory, the fallout is disrupting daily life and causing property damage. Early Wednesday, shrapnel from an interceptor damaged a home in Be’er Ya’akov. 'We ran to the shelter when the alarm sounded. Minutes later, we heard a loud boom,' said Mor Steinberg, a resident. 'A one-meter fragment landed on our balcony, damaging it and the air conditioner. It was hollow, but its size caused significant damage.' Her grandfather, Moshe, who worked on Israel’s Arrow missile system, reflected on the irony: 'I helped develop these systems, and now it feels like they’re chasing me,' he quipped. Be’er Ya’akov Mayor Nissim Gozlan praised the family for adhering to safety guidelines. 'Staying in the shelter for 10 minutes saved them from injury,' he said, urging residents to follow similar protocols. The attacks have prompted Israel to push for an emergency UN Security Council session on Monday. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon called for accountability, urging the Council to condemn the attacks and enforce international law. Meanwhile, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the latest launch, boasting that their 'Palestine-2 hypersonic missile' targeted a 'military site in Jaffa.' The pre-dawn alarm at 4:22 a.m. disrupted residents in Tel Aviv, Herzliya, Rishon Lezion and several other cities. The missile was intercepted, but falling fragments caused several people to suffer shock and minor injuries. Magen David Adom reported nine injuries from falls while seeking shelter and two cases of shock. Defense Minister Israel Katz visited an Arrow missile battery and vowed action: 'We won’t tolerate continued Houthi attacks. Just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will deal with Houthi leaders in Sanaa and across Yemen.' Katz also warned Yemen’s Houthi backers: 'Those sponsoring Houthi terror will pay the full price.' The IDF concluded its investigation into a missile strike in Tel Aviv last week, citing a delayed alert due to unspecified reasons. Lessons have been learned, the military said, as Israel braces for further escalation. Not stopping, for Gaza The Houthis continue to pose a growing threat not only to Israel but also to the U.S. and international security. Earlier this week, in one of the most dangerous incidents for U.S. forces in the Middle East since the Gaza war began, a U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jet was accidentally shot down over the Red Sea by an American warship. The Pentagon confirmed the two pilots ejected safely but declined to clarify whether the misidentification stemmed directly from ongoing clashes with the Houthis. The incident underscores the challenges posed by Iran-backed Houthi forces, whose operations have escalated dramatically since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel. Labeling their campaign as 'support for Gaza,' the Houthis have launched numerous missiles and drones not only at Israel, causing fatalities and damage, but also at civilian ships in the Red Sea, disrupting critical trade routes and even seizing vessels. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Biden administration faces a dilemma. While seeking to end Yemen’s civil war and ease tensions between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia—where years of Saudi airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians—the U.S. has avoided large-scale attacks on Houthi forces. President Biden removed the Houthis from the U.S. terror list upon entering office, and a UN-brokered cease-fire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia was reached in 2022. Over the past year, the U.S. has launched targeted strikes to disrupt Houthi operations in the Red Sea but refrained from attacking strategic infrastructure, frustrating Israel. Despite these limited measures, the Houthis’ attacks persist, presenting a severe threat to regional stability. Israel, which had avoided directly targeting the Houthis for months, conducted its first airstrike in July and has since struck twice more, including last week. These operations targeted strategic facilities, such as ports and energy infrastructure. Yet the Houthis have shown little sign of deterrence, continuing to fire missiles and drones. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai notes the Houthis are undeterred by economic and infrastructure damage, as evidenced by their prolonged war against Saudi Arabia from 2015 to 2019, during which tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians died from bombings and famine. He argues that only a decisive blow to Houthi leadership and weaponry—similar to Israel's strategy against Hezbollah—could shift their stance. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Israelis to remain patient, emphasizing that Israel is not confronting the Houthis alone—a possible nod to hopes that the U.S. and its allies will intensify their strikes. Netanyahu vowed continued action: 'We will act with strength, determination and ingenuity. Even if it takes time, the result will be the same as with other terror groups,' he said Sunday, promising Monday that the strike in Yemen would not be the last. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ovsnfbkl	2024-12-24T23:20:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/Byman8XKByl/Byman8XKByl_0_372_961_541_0_small.jpg

Holy Land exodus: Why Bethlehem’s Christians are vanishing	Pope Francis criticized Israel’s actions in Gaza for the second time in two days, accusing Israel of cruelty and the killing of children This week, ILTV visited the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, one of Christianity’s oldest and holiest sites, believed to be the birthplace of Jesus. Yet, instead of holiday cheer, the church stands in a somber state, just as it did last year. There are no trees, no lights, and no decorations as the community mourns the challenges brought by 15 months of war. Bethlehem’s Christian population is struggling to endure. Separately, Pope Francis criticized Israel’s actions in Gaza for the second time in two days on Sunday, accusing Israel of cruelty and the killing of children. Israel responded by condemning the pope’s statements, calling them disconnected from the reality of its fight against jihadist terrorism. The controversy had already escalated last week with backlash over a nativity display at the Vatican. The display featured Jesus wrapped in a keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism. This sparked outrage, including an open letter from Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli, who accused the pope of perpetuating a 'dangerous blood libel' and distorting history. Amid these debates, new data highlights the precarious situation of Christians living under Palestinian Authority and Hamas control. A recent report from the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs revealed a sharp decline in the Christian population in these areas, citing violence, weak law enforcement, and religious coercion as the primary causes. In 1922, Christians made up 11% of the population in Palestinian Authority-controlled regions. Today, they account for less than 1%. In Gaza, the Christian population has dropped from 5,000 before Hamas seized power in 2007 to just 1,000 as of October 2023. Bethlehem’s plight mirrors these trends. In 1950, Christians represented 86% of the population in Bethlehem and its surrounding villages. Today, that number has dwindled to about 10%. The survival of Bethlehem’s Christian community depends heavily on tourism.

Explosions were heard in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area as the air defenses engaged the threat. The IDF confirmed that one missile launched from Yemen was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace. Sirens were activated as a precaution against potential debris from the interception, though no direct impact was reported.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkhgyxthjg	2024-12-24T17:38:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/ryvUJgYrkg/ryvUJgYrkg_1_86_640_361_0_small.jpg

How Israel’s Christian communities are keeping the Christmas spir...	Christmas festivities continue in Israel despite ongoing war On Christmas Eve, Israel's Christian population stands at 180,300 people, making up about 1.8% of the total population. Over the past year, the Christian community has grown by 0.6%, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics. Despite the ongoing war, the Christmas spirit remains vibrant in the Holy City of Jerusalem. At the YMCA, a stunning Christmas display is attracting visitors. The area features a beautifully decorated tree, festive lights, carol singing on various evenings, and even a lively bazaar. In the Christian Quarter of the Old City, hundreds of worshipers are expected to gather at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher for Christmas prayers. Nearby, the New Gate hosts a bustling Christmas market filled with festive cheer. The celebrations and decorations highlight Jerusalem's unique status as a holy city for all three monotheistic faiths—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This distinctiveness makes it a special place during the holiday season. In Jaffa, the community is also preparing for Christmas with authentic and festive experiences. The Jaffa flea market, known for its vibrant atmosphere, has transformed into a holiday bazaar. Although the streets are less crowded this year due to the war and a drop in tourism, the celebrations persist. A large Hanukkiah and a Christmas tree, lit by the Orthodox Scouts of Jaffa on December 15, stand as symbols of the season. Jaffa is celebrated for its rich culture, where Jewish and Arab communities come together—particularly as Hanukkah and Christmas overlap. The area is famous for its food, crafts, and unique gifts, drawing visitors seeking a blend of traditions. This year marks the second Christmas since the war with Hamas began. Just last week, Jaffa experienced a missile attack after the Houthis launched a missile from Yemen. The attack injured 16 people and caused damage to a public playground after the Iron Dome failed to intercept it. Despite these challenges, the festivities in Jaffa and Jerusalem continue, bringing light and unity during the holiday season. The celebrations are expected to conclude around January 19.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1c5ayyskg	2024-12-24T17:32:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/BkHoRyKBJe/BkHoRyKBJe_34_0_1125_633_0_small.jpg
Houthis threaten global stability: How long can the world ignore ...	Dan Fefferman: 'It's a threat that must be dealt with in an international coalition manner' The Houthis pose a significant threat to regional stability and must be addressed through an international coalition, according to Middle East expert Dan Fefferman. 'They've been a threat to regional stability for a number of years now, since they came on the scene,' Fefferman told ILTV News. 'They've fired multiple and very sophisticated ballistic and cruise missile attacks at Riyadh, at major oil facilities, at Abu Dhabi. A couple years ago, they fired over 400 missiles and drone strikes at Israel, primarily at the Tel Aviv area. And they've also severely interrupted international shipping going through the Red Sea. They've halted Suez Canal shipping by over 60% in the last year. So this is not just a threat to Israel. This is a threat to regional stability. This is a threat to international stability. And so it's a threat that must be dealt with in an international coalition manner.' Fefferman explained that the Houthis are a rebel group that has seized control of much of Yemen's territory and are increasingly supported by Iran. The group reportedly has around 20,000 fighters. Initially a smaller organization, the Houthis have expanded their influence and capabilities with Iranian backing and access to Russian arms. They now possess advanced technologies, including drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. Their maritime operations have disrupted vital shipping lanes, including the Red Sea, and they have even launched attacks on U.S. and other international naval vessels near Yemen’s coast. 'It's significant enough that it must be dealt with, and its capabilities keep growing from year to year, so long as they're allowed to grow,' Fefferman emphasized. The Houthis' growing influence and military power have made them a pressing concern not only for the Middle East but also for global stability, underscoring the urgent need for international action.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1rn5yfhje	2024-12-24T17:17:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/15/yk13718211/yk13718211_0_0_658_371_0_small.jpg
Erin Molan: Israel cannot coexist with the people who carried out...	Comment: 'It’s only a matter of time before we see October 7 over and over again' This monologue was delivered by former Sky News correspondent Erin Molan during her appearance in the ILTV News studio. I didn’t need to come to Israel in person to believe… To see evidence firsthand of the unthinkable atrocities committed on October 7… To hear firsthand what survivors were forced to endure… To feel firsthand the ground shake as bombs explode nearby… To convince myself that I’m on the right side of history… I already know that I am… But I’m so glad that I came… because even in my pre-existing state of unwavering conviction… I underestimated the level of depravity… The extent of the evil that occurred… The caliber of enemy that surrounds this tiny democratic nation fighting desperately for its life… I had read and seen and heard… but I couldn’t fully comprehend… until now… I stood inside the room where three beautiful little children—two my daughter’s age—watched their parents being murdered before suffocating and burning to death themselves… I walked where thousands of innocent young people ran for their lives at a music festival devoted to peace… I watched the raw footage from October 7… all of it… A dad desperately trying to save his two young boys… sprinting with them away from terrorists… before being killed in front of their eyes… then witnessed their shock, fear, and trauma… while the killers casually rummaged through their fridge like nothing had happened… I watched the sadistic beheading of a young Israeli man… hacking—again and again and again… I stepped onto the porch where two babies were kidnapped and still remain in Gaza—their toys lying untouched for hundreds of days… But do you know what cripples me more than anything… what scares me even more than what they did? Their reaction… in real time… That’s what I can’t comprehend—no matter how hard I try… The glee… the joy… the pure elation at what they were doing… The sick laughter and cheering when an innocent teenage girl was shot in the back… Their actions on that day were evil personified—but their reactions to it were even worse… The enemy of Israel, the Jewish people, and let’s be frank—all of us who believe in life and freedom and peace—they are not human. They can’t be. It is not possible. You cannot co-exist—ever—with the people I watched carry out October 7. None of us can… and unless we figure that out, as a world, and quickly, then it’s only a matter of time before we see October 7 over and over again… but next time… it will be in our own backyard…	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkanbythjx	2024-12-24T16:54:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/rJyQSQIr1l/rJyQSQIr1l_0_192_2176_1226_0_small.jpg
Could these Jewish doctors solve Israel's medical crisis?	The whole purpose of this great venture is to help physicians from all over the world make Aliyah' An event took place in Los Angeles, marking a significant step in strengthening Israel's healthcare system. MEDEX LA, the first program of its kind on the U.S. West Coast, brought together dozens of Jewish doctors considering Aliyah to help address Israel’s critical shortage of medical professionals. 'We're super excited to help anyone who's in a better professional world, especially doctors,' said Tony Gelbart, chairman of Nefesh B'Nefesh. 'We're incredibly humbled to have all these great people come to join us in Israel.' This initiative is part of a nationwide campaign led by Nefesh B’Nefesh, in collaboration with Israel’s Ministry of Aliyah and Integration, the Ministry of Health, and the Jewish Agency for Israel. The goal is to streamline the Aliyah process, ensuring Jewish doctors can seamlessly join Israel’s medical workforce. 'The whole purpose of this great venture is to help physicians from all over the world make Aliyah,' said Aflalo. 'To help them with the licensing process, specialty recognition, and Hebrew.' Since its founding in 2002, Nefesh B’Nefesh has facilitated Aliyah for over 80,000 North American Jews, boasting a remarkable 90% retention rate. The organization offers comprehensive services, from licensing assistance to relocation grants, to ensure a smooth transition for new immigrants. MEDEX LA is a flagship component of their new International Medical Aliyah Program, designed to address Israel’s urgent need for medical professionals. At the event, representatives from leading hospitals conducted real-time interviews, offering attendees employment opportunities. The personalized approach ensures doctors receive guidance tailored to their needs, especially for those relocating to underserved regions in Israel. 'This event gives them the ability to get their specialty recognized, but also to see how they can apply their specific talent to hospitals in Israel,' said Marc Rosenberg. 'They even get to meet potential supervisors or teammates.' Alongside MEDEX LA, an Aliyah fair organized by Nefesh B’Nefesh drew over 300 potential immigrants. The fair offered workshops on benefits, employment, and on-site fingerprinting services to simplify the immigration process. 'MEDEX event offered me the opportunity to do that kind of one-stop shop, and it's been amazing so far today,' said Kathryn Wolf, an attending doctor. 'We're hoping this will make the transition and job search easier as we make the big leap to Israel.' Powered by Nefesh B’Nefesh, MEDEX LA serves as more than just a job fair—it’s a bridge connecting Jewish doctors with Israel’s future. Similar events are planned in cities worldwide to meet the growing demand for medical professionals in Israel. 'In France, in London, Argentina, and now the West Coast of the U.S.—for the first time—it’s awesome,' said Rabbi Yehoshua Fass, executive director of Nefesh B’Nefesh. 'We’re expanding and reaching hundreds of physicians who are interested in making Aliyah.' For many attendees, MEDEX LA marks the beginning of a new chapter—a journey of healing, resilience, and Aliyah.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skabqktrkg	2024-12-24T16:49:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/05/S1vEJFDZyl/S1vEJFDZyl_64_0_937_527_0_small.jpg

Bethlehem’s residents think Donald Trump is the answer to ending ...	Many residents of the West Bank town hope that the incoming US president can usher in a renewed era of peace for Israel and the Palestinian Authority Arab Christian and Muslim residents of Bethlehem are pinning their hopes on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. They believe his inauguration could usher in a renewed era of peace for Israel and the Palestinian Authority – one that allows their communities to thrive once more. 'Trump will solve these problems,' Father Spiridon Sammour said this week. Sitting on the chancel in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the priest lamented the absence of public Christmas celebrations for the second year in a row, overshadowed by the ongoing Gaza war. The city, once bustling with tourists, now lies empty and silent. Rocket attacks from Gaza have led to the cancellation of most international flights to Israel, leaving Bethlehem economically shattered and struggling to recover. 'Trump has promised to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine, and he will also stop the war between Hamas and Israel. We pray for that to be extinguished,' Sammour said. The priest emphasized the church’s prayers for world leaders, adding: 'God should let them lead people to peace. We pray for peace in the Holy Land.' Across Manger Square, the courtyard in front of the Church of the Nativity – believed by Christians to be the birthplace of Jesus – Muslims and Christians alike expressed hope in President-elect Donald Trump. Tour guide Abood Sobha, wandering the nearly empty square searching for tourists, was eager to share his thoughts. 'Hopefully, he will help us,' Sobha said about Trump. 'Trump said, ‘I want this war to end before I’m back as president.’ Hopefully, when Trump is president, he will help us stop this war and get our freedom.' Sobha’s brother, Alan, echoed his sentiments. 'I’m just praying for a cease-fire,' he said. He described Trump as a strong leader, adding: 'The Middle East needs a strong leader in America. Trump speaks our language.' Such statements are surprising, considering how many analysts have noted that Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza tend to dislike two leaders more than any others: Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In June, after Trump was convicted of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, Middle East analyst Khaled Abu Toameh said that Palestinians were 'elated.' 'Their biggest fear is that [Trump] will return to power, and they don’t want him back,' Abu Toameh said at the time. But in Bethlehem, the grim realities of 15 months of war and economic devastation have shifted some perspectives. Residents, worn down by conflict and hardship, are hungry for change. This week, as Christmas approached, Bethlehem was eerily quiet. Once again, public celebrations were canceled. The towering Christmas tree that typically adorns Manger Square was absent, as were the lights and festivities that usually draw crowds. Instead, Father Sammour shared somber reflections. He said that on Christmas Eve visitors from nearby West Bank communities and Israel would join His Beatitude Patriarch Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, for midnight Mass and then leave soon after. He expected another quiet Christmas similar to last year. 'Every year, you need a special ticket to get in,' Sammour explained, recalling how thousands of Christian tourists generally flock to the Holy Land for the holiday and visit Bethlehem on Christmas Eve. 'This year, it’s free because there are no tourists. There is no tree, no lights. As you see outside in the square - nothing. We hope and pray the situation will change soon.' Sammour described the current year as even worse than the last. 'No tourists, the hotels are closed, the restaurants are closed, the shops and factories are closed. Everything is broken down. It is very sad,' he said. When asked how residents survive, Sammour shrugged and replied, 'God is big.' The Church of the Nativity, built in 326 CE under the orders of Roman Emperor Constantine I and his mother, Saint Helena, has endured centuries of turmoil. Destroyed by the Samaritans in 529, it was rebuilt in 540 by Emperor Justinian. Now nearly 1,500 years old, it is one of the oldest churches in the world and the oldest in the Holy Land. Today, it is controlled by the Greek Orthodox Church, with sections also managed by Armenian Christians and Catholics. Although many in Bethlehem claim that Muslims and Christians live in harmony, the demographics suggest otherwise. A report published this week by the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs highlighted a sharp decline in the Christian population under Palestinian rule. In 1950, Christians made up 86% of Bethlehem’s population. By 2017, that figure had dwindled to just 10%. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Christian journalist and analyst Brian Schrauger noted that the Muslim majority has, at times, co-opted Christian narratives for political purposes. It was in Bethlehem around 10 years ago that the first baby Jesus lying on a keffiyeh was depicted – the same imagery that sparked controversy this year at a seasonal nativity scene at the Vatican, Schrauger said. He added that Christians in the region often avoid speaking out against their Muslim neighbors. 'They don’t want to be persecuted; they want to be able to do business,' Schrauger explained. However, many Christians are quietly leaving. 'During the Second Intifada, many fled. Now they are leaving again, partly because of the war but mostly because they feel trapped – by Israel, which has barred Palestinian workers from entering since October 7, 2023, and by their Islamic neighbors.' For those who remain, the desire for peace is unwavering. 'I want to ask just for peace,' one church visitor said. 'We don’t want any more problems; we don’t want any more wars.' -This article is written by Maayan Hoffman and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1qhisorjl	2024-12-24T12:48:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/BkJrqiuB1e/BkJrqiuB1e_0_228_1600_901_0_small.jpg

The Iranian delegation to the UN addressed the Security Council in the wake of Defense Minister Israel Katz's remarks, which acknowledged for the first time that Israel had assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and called for punishment. 'Katz publicly and shamelessly admitted that Israel was responsible for the assassination of Haniyeh, while he was visiting Tehran,' according to the Iranian delegation. 'This bold and shameless confession of the murder of a political leader on the sovereign territory of a UN member state once again emphasizes Israel's responsibility for its acts of terrorism and aggression. It also confirms the legitimacy of Iran's response on October 1. The UN must not allow impunity for a regime that blatantly defies international law.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcgbouhkg	2024-12-24T12:21:32-08:00	
Negotiating team returns from Qatar: Israel struggles to understa...	Team returns after a 'significant week' of negotiations, Prime Minister's Office says, without providing further details; Most deal components are nearly finalized, but Hamas continues to refuse to provide a complete list of living hostages The Gaza cease-fire negotiating team, which includes senior officials from the Mossad, Shin Bet, and IDF, 'will return to Israel from Qatar after a significant week of talks,' the Prime Minister's Office reported on Tuesday evening. 'The team is returning for internal consultations in Israel regarding the continuation of the negotiations for the return of our hostages,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement, with no further details provided. Negotiations for the release of hostages held by Hamas, who have been held in captivity for 445 days, are ongoing, but it remains unclear whether an agreement will be reached. The possibilities range from an immediate deal in the coming days to no agreement at all. In Israel, officials emphasized that the return of the team after 10 days in Qatar does not indicate a breakdown in talks. Following a prolonged negotiation process, the team now needs to conduct consultations. Israeli officials are placing blame on Hamas in Gaza, particularly on the leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Sinwar, for creating difficulties and refusing to provide a full list of hostages, allegedly in an attempt to extract further concessions. 'There’s no collapse of the talks, but we’ve reached a point where decisions need to be made in Israel whether to continue with a deal without the lists,' said an Israeli official familiar with the details. 'Hamas has consistently lied. Even last time, Hamas claimed it had no women among the hostages, which was false. The question now is whether to play into their hands. We need a solid foundation to proceed with the deal, to determine whether we are releasing prisoners in exchange for bodies or live hostages. The terms are different, and we won’t start an agreement based on lies.' Ruby Chen, the father of soldier Itay Chen, who is among the hostages, expressed his frustration, saying he is waiting for Hamas' response. He also noted that Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent statement in The Wall Street Journal – saying he would not agree to a cease-fire until Hamas is removed – did not help foster trust between the parties. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The gap between Israel and Hamas on the terms of the deal reportedly is not large, which allows for the possibility of an agreement. Both sides seem to agree on certain issues, such as the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah Crossing, as well as the terms of the cease-fire and the gradual release of hostages. There is also consensus on what is required from Israel in the deal. What is required Hamas, however, is to release a full list of live hostages, which would include categories such as women, children, soldiers, the elderly, sick and injured. A previous list of 33 hostages included some who have since died, and Noga Argamani, who was rescued. Israeli officials estimate that a significant number of hostages will be released in the first phase of the deal, a demand to which Hamas is refusing to agree so far. A delicate negotiation The key question now for Israel is whether Hamas truly wants a deal. This remains the primary point of contention in the talks and, with no clear resolution in sight, the outcome remains uncertain. It could happen tomorrow – or never. Israeli officials believe Hamas will not give up. But the group may find it difficult to relinquish its hold on such valuable assets – its living hostages — even though its members face no real danger. If some of the hostages are released, Hamas will be left with what is often called a 'Gilad Shalit' situation, referring to the Israeli soldier released in a 2011 deal in exchange for 1,027 prisoners. This leaves many wondering what Hamas intends to do next. It is possible they believe Israel lacks the strength to press its demands. Egyptians, Qataris and Americans are all putting pressure on Hamas, but so far, it has not responded. While there had been optimism in recent days due to ongoing daily communication with Hamas and some progress in talks, it is now difficult to predict what will happen. According to sources, if an agreement is reached, the release of hostages would happen immediately once a cease-fire begins, with the first phase likely to take place within a day or two. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skcrz9os1x	2024-12-24T12:14:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/H1YTDzPS1e/H1YTDzPS1e_0_103_1280_721_0_small.jpg
IDF releases probe into murder of 6 hostages in Rafah tunnel: 'As...	The IDF presented the families of Hersh, Uri, Eden, Alex, Almog and Carmel with the final investigation into their murders while in Hamas captivity; Military finds that its activities in the area had a 'circumstantial influence on the terrorists' decision to murder the 6 hostages' The IDF on Tuesday afternoon presented the families of Hamas hostages Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino with the final investigation into the incident in which they were executed by their captors in a tunnel in Rafah in August, while IDF forces were operating in the area. The investigation presented by the Southern Command indicates that the IDF had assessed that the likelihood of hostages being present in the area was medium to low. However, the troops were instructed to operate under the assumption that hostages were in the area and to act with the necessary caution. They conducted ongoing situational assessments on the matter in coordination with relevant professional officials. At the same time, it appears that if such information had been available, the forces would not have operated in the area or would have operated in a completely different manner. However, the IDF spokesman's statement noted that 'the IDF’s ground activities in the area, although gradual and cautious, had a circumstantial influence on the terrorists' decision to murder the six hostages.' The IDF says that, since the incident, changes have been made and lessons learned regarding ground operations methods in fighting in the Gaza Strip, the utilization of weapons and intelligence, and additional technologies introduced to prevent such incidents from happening again as much as possible. The affair further illustrated the assessment in the IDF that Hamas executes Israeli hostages as a regular policy if it hears IDF forces approaching the cells holding them. The findings also show that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was accidentally killed about a month and a half after the murder of the hostages, was in the area near the six hostages, but did not necessarily meet them or hold them himself. Farhan Qadi, the hostage who was found alive in a nearby tunnel a few days prior to the execution of the six hostages, also testified, according to the findings of the investigation, that he did not encounter Sinwar or meet other hostages. Farhan testified that he did not see Sinwar and that he was required to stay in place and not move by his captors who escaped from the tunnel in which he was being held. On August 27, 2024, Qadi was rescued from an underground compound, having been found alone and without prior intelligence regarding his location. Following the rescue, the troops conducted a dedicated situational assessment regarding the possibility of finding additional hostages in the area, and halted operations for the next 24 hours. Even after the rescue, the IDF did not possess intelligence indicating the presence of additional hostages in the area at that time, according to the investigation. After Qadi was found alive and before the bodies of the kidnapped were located, three terrorists were identified who were moving in the area, according to the IDF. The soldiers did not fire at them for an extended period of time, but did everything possible to capture them alive. On the afternoon of August 31, 2024, the troops of the division located the six hostages in the underground tunnel. The hostages were no longer alive and had signs of gunshot wounds on their bodies. According to the findings of the pathological report, the estimated date of the murder of the six hostages was August 29, 2024. IDF troops discovered the tunnel shaft where the six hostages were found on August 30, 2024, after they had been murdered. The final investigation reiterates a significant finding that already emerged in the initial investigation, which was made public, which found that two terrorists who were eliminated in the area at that time by forces from the Nahal Brigade were very likely, according to forensic findings that were located, to be the ones who held and murdered the six hostages. The IDF Spokesperson's Office said this evening that 'the investigation indicates that on August 15, 2024, troops of the 162nd Division launched an operation to defeat Hamas's al-Tel Sultan Battalion, following approximately three months of operational activity in Rafah. The troops engaged in intense combat with Hamas terrorists deep inside the area of Tel al-Sultan, during which they located a central underground tunnel system in the area.' The statement continues that 'in order to continue operations in the area, including the investigation and location of the underground tunnel system, a dedicated command center was established, led by Shayetet 13 and the 162nd Division, in collaboration with other security authorities. The command center integrated special forces, various intelligence units, precise underground operational capabilities, and the use of specialized equipment and technology, including for the potential location of hostages in the area.' Although there was a low-medium probability of hostages being found in the area, the IDF said that the forces were instructed to operate under the assumption that there were hostages in the area, to act with the necessary caution, and carried out ongoing situation assessments on the subject in cooperation with the relevant professional bodies. On August 31, IDF forces located the bodies of the six hostagesin a tunnel 20 meters deep in the Tel Sultan neighborhood of Rafah, which is a kilometer away from the one where hostage Farhan Qadi was found. The IDF did not know exactly where the six were in the months before, but it knew that there were hostages in the area, and therefore the operation in Rafah was 'gradual and slow' since the ground fighting began there. During the operation, there was no encounter with the terrorists who murdered the six and fled, but they were apparently eliminated in the fighting that continued there above ground. The hostages were found with gunshot wounds to the head and other places. They were murdered about 24 hours before IDF forces arrived at the tunnel. Severe neglect was evident on their bodies. Among other things, it was evident that they had not showered for a long time, and signs of being tied up were found on one of the hostages. In addition, there were indications that the hostages had sustained injuries during the kidnapping, which were treated over time. The bodies of the six were found scattered in the tunnel in clusters, and they were not lying side by side. It is not possible to determine whether there was any struggle before they were murdered by the terrorists. The hostages were held in a very small and narrow tunnel, where they had difficulty standing upright, and only two of them could lie in it horizontally at the same time. There were no air vents in the tunnel, and the hostages had difficulty breathing in it. In addition, the hostages had no toilets or showers, and they were given bottles of water that were used for showers as well as drinking. They had very little food in captivity, and lost significant weight. Eden Yerushalmi's body was found weighing only 36 kg (about 79 pounds). Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: IDF Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Herzi Halevi, summarized the findings of the investigation and said that this was 'a painful and tragic event, with the extremely difficult outcome of the brutal murder of six hostages by Hamas.' The Chief of Staff also determined, based on the investigation, that the hostages were murdered by gunfire from Hamas terrorists during IDF forces' operations in the area, 'however the circumstances of the events that took place in the tunnel that led to the murders are unclear, and the likelihood of these circumstances becoming clear in the future is low.' The IDF also stated that the Chief of Staff ' emphasized the moral obligation to investigate the event for the hostages' families, as well as for operational learning purposes. He affirmed that the IDF will continue to make every effort to fulfill the national mission and war objective of bringing home the hostages.' The Families' Headquarters for the Return of the Abductees said in response: 'We are pained by the renewed pain of the families when they are presented with details from the shocking and heartbreaking investigation.

Defense Ministry purchased a new stock of Arrow-3 interceptors from the Israel Aerospace Industries to enhance protection against ballistic missile threats; Each interceptor costs approximately $4 million, and the move follows an uptick in missile attacks by the Houthis from Yemen The Defense Ministry and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) signed a major production contract Wednesday to expand the supply of Arrow-3 missile defense interceptors for the Israeli military. The deal, valued at billions of shekels, marks a significant boost to Israel’s air defense capabilities. The agreement, led by the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) within the Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D), will provide the IDF with a large number of Arrow-3 interceptors. The signing ceremony, held at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv, was attended by Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, director general of the ministry; Brig. Gen. (Ret.) Dr. Daniel Gold, head of the DDR&D; IAI CEO Boaz Levy; and other senior officials. The Arrow system, which includes the Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 interceptors, was jointly developed by Israel and the United States to counter long-range ballistic missile threats. During recent conflicts, the system demonstrated exceptional performance, intercepting ballistic missiles with high success rates. The Arrow-3 achieved a historic milestone during the current war, becoming the first system to conduct an operational interception in space. It played a critical role in defending against missile barrages from Iran and the Houthi militia in Yemen, including on April 14, 2024 and October 1, 2024. 'The Arrow-3 system has proven to be an unparalleled defense asset,' Zamir said. 'With this agreement, we reaffirm our commitment to Israeli innovation and the security of our nation.' Strengthening defense and economy The Arrow-3 program is a cornerstone of Israel’s multi-layered missile defense strategy, which also includes David’s Sling and Iron Dome. IAI leads the system’s development through its MLM Division, with support from U.S. partner Stark Aerospace and Israeli firms such as Elbit Systems, Tomer and Rafael. Zamir emphasized the dual benefits of the deal, noting that it would not only bolster national security but also inject billions into the local economy, supporting thousands of jobs. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Boaz Levy, CEO of IAI, highlighted the technological achievements of the system. 'The Arrow-3 is a testament to Israel’s innovative spirit and strategic cooperation with the U.S. It operates at exceptional altitudes with unmatched precision, reinforcing our defense capabilities and ensuring a technological edge over adversaries,' Levy said. Defense Minister Israel Katz called the agreement a 'strategic milestone,' adding: 'This deal reflects the strength of Israel’s defense industry and the groundbreaking capabilities of the Arrow-3 system, which has set a global standard in missile defense.' Gold praised the Arrow-3 as 'the pinnacle of Israeli technology,' noting its role in countering extensive ballistic barrages during the war. 'This system is not just a technological marvel but a symbol of Israel’s resilience and strategic superiority,' Gold said. The agreement underscores the Ministry of Defense’s commitment to advancing Israel’s defense infrastructure while supporting its technological independence, the ministry said in a statement. Officials say the deal will ensure the IDF remains prepared for emerging threats and maintains its qualitative edge on the battlefield. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj94ruubyg	2024-12-24T10:40:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/30/BJeYn36P0C/BJeYn36P0C_0_0_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Suspect in New York City subway fire killing charged with murder,...	The man accused of killing a woman on a New York City subway train by setting her on fire was charged with murder and arson in an initial court appearance on Tuesday. Sebastian Zapeta, a 33-year-old man who police say lives at a homeless shelter in Brooklyn, was charged with three counts in a criminal complaint at the Brooklyn criminal court: first-degree murder, second-degree murder and first-degree arson. According to the police account, Zapeta used a lighter to ignite the clothes of a woman who appeared to be sleeping on a stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station on Sunday. He then used a shirt to fan the fire until the woman was engulfed in flames, the complaint said.The woman was pronounced dead at the scene after the fire was extinguished. The city's medical examiner said the cause of death was smoke inhalation and thermal injuries. Police are still working to identify her, according to the complaint. During the arraignment, Judge Jung Park ordered that Zapeta be held in jail. He is due back in court on Friday where he is due to enter a plea. All three crimes with which Zapeta is charged are felonies that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkjkkyuhkx	2024-12-24T10:18:42-08:00

IDF presents results of inquiry into deaths of 6 hostages	The IDF presented the families of killed hostages HCarmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino with the final investigation into their execution in a tunnel in Rafah in August, while army forces were operating in the area. The investigation shows that the IDF assessed that the likelihood of hostages being present in the area was medium to low. However, it also shows that if such information had been available, the forces would not have operated in the area or would have operated completely differently. It also shows that after hostage Farhan Qadi was found in a nearby tunnel about two weeks earlier, a freeze and reassessment was carried out regarding the presence of hostages, but the fighting did not stop.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rysend00bjg	2024-12-24T09:26:20-08:00

US journalist missing in Syria since 2012 is believed to be alive...	American journalist Austin Tice is believed to be still alive, according to the head of an international aid group. Nizar Zakka, who runs the Hostage Aid Worldwide organization, said there has never been any proof that Tice, who has been missing since 2012, is dead. Zakka told reporters in Damascus on Tuesday that Tice was alive in January and being held by the authorities of ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad. He added that U.S. President Joe Biden said in August that Tice was alive. Zakka said he believes Tice was transferred between security agencies over the past 12 years, including in an area where Iranian-backed fighters were operating. Asked if it was possible Tice had been taken out of the country, Zakka said Assad most likely kept him in Syria as a potential bargaining chip. Biden said Dec. 8 that his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, although he also acknowledged that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvjvd00syl	2024-12-24T09:05:06-08:00

Father of former hostage Emily Hand will not return to Ireland af...	Thomas Hand, whose 10-year-old daughter was released after 50 days in Hamas captivity, may never return to the country of his birth; 'They were really instrumental in getting Emily back,' he acknowledges, but 'recognizing Palestine as a state, very soon after their massive terrorist attack was almost a reward' The Irish father of a young girl kidnapped by Hamas has said he would think twice about returning to the country of his birth given the deepening tensions between Israel and Ireland. Thomas Hand, whose daughter Emily spent 50 days in Gaza after she was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, will always be deeply grateful to the Irish government for helping to bring her home. 'They were really instrumental in getting Emily back – they did a hell of a lot,' he said in an exclusive interview this week. Emily, now 10, was initially thought to have been killed in the October 7 attacks, but just under a month later Hand was informed that his daughter was still alive and being held hostage in Gaza. 'Within a few days of finding out that Emily wasn’t dead but kidnapped, the first trip we took was to Ireland,' the 64-year-old told the Jewish News. 'We met with the Prime Minister, president and lots of MPs – it was purely a political visit to make them put pressure on Hamas and they definitely did.' And yet despite his gratitude, Hand said he would 'hesitate' to return to his birthplace given the current situation. It comes just days after Israel announced the closure of its embassy in Dublin due to the worsening relations between the two countries. Defending the move, foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar earlier this week accused the Irish government of 'antisemitism based on the delegitimization and dehumanization of Israel.' In recent months, Ireland has formally recognized the State of Palestine, said that it would execute an arrest warrant on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and backed South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ. News of the embassy’s closure did not come as a surprise to Hand. 'I expected them to do it a lot earlier,' he said, because Israel regards Ireland as doing 'too many anti-Israel things.' Father and daughter are from Kibbutz Be’eri, which was the site of some of the worst horrors on October 7 and where 101 people were murdered. That day Hand was at his home on the kibbutz, while his daughter was on a sleepover at a friend’s house nearby. Ireland’s recognition of a Palestinian state has come in for some harsh criticism from Hand. 'Recognizing Palestine as a state, very soon after their massive terrorist attack – it was almost a reward,' he said. 'They [the Irish government] must have seen all the atrocious videos that Hamas put online themselves and yet they were recognised. For me personally, it looked like they were being rewarded for what they did.' Hand, who like his daughter is a dual Israeli-Irish citizen, was not happy about the embassy’s closure as he believes cutting the lines for diplomacy is 'never a good thing.' 'But I guess they had to show some kind of sign that we’re not very happy with the decisions being made by the Irish government,' he said. Born and raised Catholic he now describes himself as an atheist and said he would 'probably hesitate' before returning to Ireland due to the strength of anti-Israel feeling. 'I’m pretty well recognized nowadays. I could be very easily attacked,' he said, as he recalled coming face to face with anti-Israel demonstrators while in Ireland. The problem, he believes, is deeply entrenched. 'They [the Irish] simply don’t understand the history of the place. Myself, before I came here, I had Palestinian sympathies – I was a sympathizer.' But living in Be’eri, just a few kilometers from Gaza, changed his outlook. 'They fired thousands and thousands and thousands of rockets at us continuously,' he said. 'Ireland mistakenly sees Israel as the super power, the strength, the oppressor and of course they have sympathies for the Palestinian people,' he said. 'Well, if they understood the history of the place, they’d realise there is no comparison.' Emily is 'fantastic,' he said, and just like a 'normal little girl'. Hand and his daughter were reunited just over a year ago, when she was released by Hamas on November 26. Like so many other residents of Beeri and other kibbutzim in the area, the pair spent months living in hotel accommodation by the Dead Sea – until recently. Back in September, they – along with many others affected by the crisis – were moved to live in 'prefab houses' on another kibbutz close to Beer Sheva. 'The kibbutz expanded their fence and then new housing was built pretty rapidly, amazingly,' he said. When asked if he would return to Be’eri, he said: 'In a heartbeat. If I didn’t have Emily, I would have been back months ago.' He said that at least 150 residents, many of whom are older and without children, have returned to Be’eri but that the overall reconstruction work has not yet begun. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We’re still demolishing the houses that are irreparable in Beeri. There’s no new building going on yet – to build up again that amount of housing is going to take time. But that’s the dream one day, just to go back there,' he said. Would he not feel nervous? 'We were always nervous,' he said. 'Constantly being attacked by missiles, rockets, on a weekly basis. That’s been our norm for the last 20 odd years, since Hamas came into power. 'We’re used to living with that and I don’t believe the Israeli army will ever let that happen again. Hopefully. Everything will depend on the state of the army, the state of Hamas and whatever government is in power at the time, in the future.' -Reprinted with permission from Jewish News >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hktoxudsje	2024-12-24T08:58:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/26/HJO70Mgr6/HJO70Mgr6_0_109_576_325_0_small.jpg
Kurdish-led forces launch counterattack against Turkish-backed Sy...	Spokesperson of the Women’s Protection Unit, an all-female militia fighting under the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, says they are just over seven miles from the center of the key city of Manbij in their counter-offensive; 'We will not be pushed out of negotiations on the future of Syria' The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Tuesday they have launched a counter-offensive against the Ankara-backed Syrian National Army to take back areas near Syria’s northern border with Turkey. The SDF is Washington’s critical ally in Syria, targeting sleeper cells of the extremist Islamic State group scattered across the country’s east. Since the fall of the totalitarian rule of Bashar Assad earlier this month, clashes have intensified between the U.S.-backed group and the Syrian National Army (SNA), which captured the key city of Manbij and the areas surrounding it. The intense weekslong clashes come at a time when Syria, battered by over a decade of war and economic misery, is negotiating its political future following half a century under the Assad dynasty’s rule. Ruken Jamal, spokesperson of the Women’s Protection Unit, or YPJ, under the Syrian Democratic Forces, told The Associated Press that their fighters are just over seven miles away from the center of Manbij in their ongoing counter-offensive. She accused Ankara of trying to weaken the group’s influence in negotiations over Syria’s political future through the SNA. 'Syria is now in a new phase, and discussions are underway about the future of the country,' Jamal said. 'Turkey is trying, through its attacks, to distract us with battles and exclude us from the negotiations in Damascus.' The Britain-based opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says since the SNA’s offensive in northern Syria against the Kurds started earlier this month, dozens from both sides have been killed. Ankara sees the SDF as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which it classifies as a terrorist organization. Turkish-backed armed groups alongside Turkish jets for years have attacked positions where the SDF are largely present across northern Syria, in a bid to create a buffer zone free from the group along the large shared border. While the SNA was involved in the lightning insurgency – led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – that toppled Assad, it has continued its push against the SDF, seen as Syria’s second key actor for its political future. On Monday, the SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami said the group’s forces pushed back the Turkish-backed rebels from areas near the Tishrin Dam on the Euphrates, a key source of hydroelectric power. He said the SDF also destroyed a tank belonging to the rebels southeast of Manbij. The British-based war monitor said on Tuesday that the Kurdish-led group, following overnight fighting, has reclaimed four villages in the areas near the strategic dam. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Turkish jets also pounded the strategic border town of Kobani in recent days. During Syria’s uprising-turned-conflict, the Kurds carved out an enclave of autonomous rule across northeastern Syria, never fully allying entirely with Assad in Damascus nor the rebels trying to overthrow him. Even with the Assad family out of the picture, it appears that Ankara’s position won’t change, with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan’s landmark visit to Syria maintaining a strong position on the Kurdish-led group in his meeting with de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa of HTS. 'It has turned the region into a cauldron of terror with PKK members and far-left groups who have come from Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Europe,' Fidan said in a news conference after the meeting. 'The international community is turning a blind eye to this lawlessness because of the wardenship it provides' (against the Islamic State). With the ongoing fighting, SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi has expressed concern about a strong Islamic State resurgence due to the power vacuum in Syria and the ongoing fighting, which has left the Kurdish-led group unable to carry out its attacks and raids on the extremist group’s scattered sleeper cells. Tens of thousands of children, family members, and supporters of Islamic State terrorists are still held in large detention centers in northeastern Syria, in areas under SDF control. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skvak8urjl	2024-12-24T08:28:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/Byeid9BDEJx/Byeid9BDEJx_0_306_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

It doesn't feel like Christmas in Syria as tree in town square se...	Thousands of Syrian Christians protest the burning of a Christmas tree by jihadist rebels in a Christian-majority town; The incident raises fears about minority rights under Ahmad al-Sharaa's leadership, as HTS tries to present a moderate image to the international community In Syria, thousands of Christians took to the streets on Tuesday to protest the burning of a Christmas tree in a predominantly Christian town in the center of the country. The incident, reportedly carried out by foreign jihadist rebels, has intensified fears among Christians and other minorities about the new leadership under the jihadist rebel group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Despite their attempts to project a moderate image and promises to safeguard all minorities, the attack has raised serious concerns about what the future holds under their rule. The attack, which enraged Syria's Christian minority—already significantly reduced during the country’s brutal civil war – took place in the town of al-Suqaylabiyah in Hama province, where the majority of residents are Christians. Video footage of the incident shows masked gunmen pouring flammable liquid on a large Christmas tree in the town square before setting it ablaze. The culprits’ identities remain unclear. However, the new HTS-led government, under the leadership of Ahmad al-Sharaa, rushed to condemn the act, claiming it was carried out by non-Syrian fighters. Many foreign jihadists, who view their involvement in the Syrian conflict as fulfilling a religious duty, have joined the ranks of rebel groups, including HTS. Reports from Sky News Arabia suggested that the attackers were Chechens, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights identified them as Uzbeks affiliated with the jihadist group Ansar al-Tawhid. According to the Observatory, the armed men threatened locals with their weapons, preventing them from approaching the tree. However, firefighters managed to extinguish the flames after the attackers fled. Some reports indicate the suspects were later arrested. The Observatory, which operates from London and is aligned with rebel groups, issued a statement accusing such incidents of undermining national stability and efforts toward peaceful coexistence among Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious communities. Protests erupted immediately after the incident. In a viral video, a Muslim cleric representing HTS addressed local residents, claiming that the attackers 'are not Syrians' and vowing they would face punishment. He promised the Christmas tree would be rebuilt and relit the following morning. However, these assurances have done little to calm Syria’s Christian community. Protests continued on Tuesday across several locations, including the capital Damascus, where demonstrators marched with large wooden crosses and waved the Free Syria flag, which the rebels adopted as their symbol after toppling Assad’s regime. 'Let us sacrifice our souls for the cross!' chanted protesters in Damascus’s Bab Touma neighborhood. 'We demand rights for Christians!' One protester, identified as George, told AFP: 'If we cannot live with our Christian faith in our own country as we’ve always done, then we no longer belong here.' He added that despite repeated promises to protect minorities, Christians continue to face 'a great deal of injustice,' disguised as 'isolated incidents.' This incident comes at a particularly sensitive time for the new rebel government led by al-Sharaa, who has been working to present a more moderate image to the world. His goal is to have the severe sanctions imposed during Assad’s rule lifted. Al-Sharaa, who once had ties to al-Qaida, has spent years insisting that he has cut all connections to the organization and has moderated his views. His supporters point to the reported protection of Christians under HTS rule in Idlib province in recent years as evidence of his shift in leadership style. Idlib, the group’s stronghold, was the launching point for last month’s surprise offensive that quickly led to the collapse of the old regime. While al-Sharaa’s promises have been met with skepticism in the West, they have also sparked some cautious optimism that Syria could be on a new path – perhaps even toward a democratic future. Although the U.S. and its allies have yet to remove HTS from their list of terrorist organizations, diplomatic relations with al-Sharaa’s government have been renewed. Notably, the U.S. also withdrew the $10 million bounty it once offered for al-Sharaa’s capture a decade ago. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As part of his efforts to create a stable new regime and prevent further internal clashes among rebel factions, al-Sharaa has pledged to disband all armed factions and merge them under the Ministry of Defense. On Tuesday, the new government announced that al-Sharaa and faction leaders had reached an agreement to implement this plan. Photos from the meeting show al-Sharaa alongside faction leaders, including Marhaf Abu Qasra, who previously served as the head of HTS’s military wing and was recently appointed as the head of the Ministry of Defense. In practice, this consolidation means that al-Sharaa and his allies will retain military power in the so-called 'new Syria.' While his government pushes for international recognition, incidents like the burning of the Christmas tree threaten to undermine his attempts to rebuild trust and stability in a deeply fractured nation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hysfa4ub1l	2024-12-24T06:19:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/HyVXTM7dS1g/HyVXTM7dS1g_0_335_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Saudi executions rose sharply in 2024	Saudi Arabia executed 330 people this year, the highest number in decades, despite de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman's 2022 assertion that the death penalty had been eliminated except for murder cases under his vision for a new open kingdom. The latest execution toll, compiled from execution announcements by human rights NGO Reprieve and verified by Reuters, is a big jump from the 172 total for last year and 196 for 2022. Reprieve said it was the highest ever recorded. Saudi Arabia denies accusations of human rights abuses and says its actions are aimed at protecting national security. More than 150 people were executed for non-lethal crimes this year, according to the tally, which rights groups say is contrary to international law. Those executions were mainly related to alleged drug smuggling amid a flood of amphetamine-like captagon from Syria under ousted President Bashar Assad. They also included people charged with non-lethal terrorism, a charge rights groups say is often used against those who have participated in anti-government protests. The total includes more than 100 foreign nationals from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdgfhdr1l	2024-12-24T05:48:01-08:00	
Iran lifts ban on WhatsApp and Google Play, state media says	Iranian authorities have lifted a ban on Meta's instant messaging platform WhatsApp and Google Play as a first step to scale back internet restrictions, Iranian state media reported on Tuesday. The Islamic Republic has some of the strictest controls on Internet access in the world, but its blocks on U.S.-based social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are routinely bypassed by tech-savvy Iranians using virtual private networks. 'A positive majority vote has been reached to lift limitations on access to some popular foreign platforms such as WhatsApp and Google Play', Iran's official IRNA news agency said on Tuesday, referring to a meeting on the matter headed by President Masoud Pezeshkian. 'Today the first step in removing internet limitations... has been taken,' IRNA cited Iran's Minister of Information and Communications Technology Sattar Hashemi as saying. Social media platforms were widely used in anti-government protests in Iran. In September the United States called on Big Tech to help evade online censorship in countries that heavily sensor the internet, including Iran.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byzpdrusjx	2024-12-24T05:45:04-08:00	
Katz: 'Those who sponsor Houthi terror will pay the full price'	Defense Minister Israel Katz visited on Tuesday the Arrow missile defense battery responsible for intercepting a missile launched from Yemen overnight. Katz reiterated Israel’s commitment to countering Houthi aggression, saying, 'We will not tolerate continued missile fire on Israel by the Houthis.' Katz drew parallels to past operations targeting high-profile adversaries, saying, 'As we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will deal with Houthi leaders in Sanaa and throughout Yemen.' He vowed to dismantle both Houthi leadership and their infrastructure, declaring, 'We will act to eliminate the threat and neutralize any danger to Israel to achieve our objectives.

Nasrallah's funeral and pager operation report: Hezbollah recalib...	Iran-backed terror group admits to suffering 'major blow' by Israel and says will continue looking into pager explosion operation and construct a mausoleum for Nasrallah A month into the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, the Shiite terrorist organization is recalibrating its course and preparing for what’s next amid the heavy blows it sustained during the war. Among other matters, the terror group is deliberating where to bury its former leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was eliminated in September. Senior Hezbollah officials who spoke with the London-based Arab outlet Asharq Al-Awsat outlined the organization's current priorities: holding a comprehensive assessment of the fighting with Israel, continuing investigations into the explosions of pagers and walkie-talkie devices that harmed thousands of its operatives and arranging funerals for Nasrallah and his cousin and apparent successor, Hashem Safieddine who was also eliminated shortly after. According to the sources, Hezbollah is now focused on 'internal reorganization' and rebuilding its political and organizational structure after losing dozens of prominent military, political and administrative figures during the war. The officials noted that Hezbollah will carry out a thorough evaluation of the 'previous political phase' to identify its mistakes in light of the geopolitical changes that took place in the Middle East over the past year. They acknowledged that the terror organization 'suffered a major blow' following its support for Gaza, culminating in the deaths of Nasrallah, Safieddine and top military commanders. They also stressed that the investigation into the pager explosions will continue 'until the truth is revealed.' Discussions about Nasrallah's burial site have recently gained momentum. According to the officials, Hezbollah owns a plot of land along the old road leading to Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport, which it plans to convert into a memorial and burial site of its former secretary-general. Earlier this month, the Lebanese newspaper Ad-Diyar reported that the exact location of the burial site remains undecided, as Hezbollah intends to construct a mausoleum for Nasrallah and Safieddine, similar to the one it built for former Hezbollah leader Abbas al-Musawi. The report mentioned three potential locations for the mausoleum — two in Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahieh) and one along the old airport road. 'The site will be chosen based on available space and its capacity to accommodate visitors,' the report said. Sources who spoke with Asharq Al-Awsat also addressed the cease-fire with Israel, saying that 'throughout the cease-fire period, Hezbollah has acted with restraint and hasn’t allowed Israel to provoke it into renewing the war.' 'The organization is leaving charge to Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati and the army leadership to handle Israeli violations through the body overseeing the cease-fire,' they added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regarding the Syrian front and the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, Hezbollah sources claimed that the organization maintains a military and security presence along the hills of northern and eastern Beqaa. The move was made to counter potential infiltration by groups affiliated with the Islamic State (ISIS) into these areas and from there into Shiite towns. 'Hezbollah's presence in these areas continues, despite receiving assurances that ISIS-affiliated groups won’t enter the Shiite towns,' they said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1purmdh1l	2024-12-24T03:43:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/06/HkzHdEad11kg/HkzHdEad11kg_0_168_2200_1238_0_small.jpg

Satellite images reveal IDF corridor in northern Gaza: 'Half of J...	Experts say tactic mirrors Netzarim Corridor but targets densely populated urban areas; one-third of buildings razed, one-eighth of pre-war population remains Fresh satellite imagery shows Israel carried out mass demolition and erected military fortifications in residential areas of northern Gaza, The Washington Post reported on Monday. The operations, which began October 5 in Jabaliya, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, have displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, with Israel stating the campaign will continue 'as long as necessary.' According to the UN, over 100,000 Palestinians have fled the area in the past 11 weeks, leaving fewer than 50,000 residents—one-eighth of the pre-war population. Humanitarian groups reported severe restrictions on aid reaching the region. Satellite images show entire neighborhoods razed, new roads constructed and extensive military fortifications established. Almost half of Jabaliya’s refugee camp has been destroyed or cleared, with a military corridor now connecting western and eastern roads, creating a pathway from the sea to the Israeli border. Experts likened the new corridor to the Netzarim Corridor, which once split Gaza into two. However, they noted that unlike the primarily agricultural areas of the Netzarim Corridor, these operations are in densely populated urban zones, describing it as 'the demolition of Palestinian cities.' The IDF has reportedly built elevated defense platforms for nearly 150 military vehicles around Jabaliya by late October, with additional fortifications and roads appearing in satellite images through mid-December. Palestinian residents and UN satellite data show over 5,000 buildings in Jabaliya, 3,600 in Beit Lahia and 2,000 in Beit Hanoun have been razed since the war began. Despite Israeli warnings delivered via leaflets, phone calls and drones urging civilians to evacuate, residents said, 'There is no refuge from Israeli strikes.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Human rights groups have criticized the mass evacuations, saying IDF actions align with strategies outlined in the controversial 'Generals' Plan,' which proposed designating northern Gaza a closed military zone, forcing mass evacuations and besieging the area until terrorists surrendered or were killed. Israel has denied allegations of forced displacement. Defense Minister Israel Katz and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer wrote to the Biden administration, saying, 'Israel does not have a policy of forcibly evacuating civilians from Gaza, including the north.' The Post highlighted statements from former defense minister Moshe Ya’alon accusing the IDF of 'ethnic cleansing' and 'war crimes.' Palestinian accounts detailed relentless attacks on civilian neighborhoods, mass separations during evacuations and alleged abuse of those trying to flee. A U.S. State Department spokesperson told reporters last week that they had 'not seen' evidence of forced evacuations in Gaza, adding that such actions would constitute a 'red line' for the U.S. government. Satellite imagery also revealed significant changes to Gaza’s geography, with IDF fortifications mirroring tactics used in past buffer zones, such as the Netzarim Corridor and Philadelphi Corridor. The military corridor now divides northern Gaza, enabling what one expert described as 'more systematic clearing operations' while imposing de facto borders restricting movement to the south. Satellite images show increasing destruction in Beit Lahia between November 15 and December 15. With the war ongoing, negotiations over cease-fires and hostage exchanges remain contentious. Hamas has demanded that families be allowed to return to northern Gaza as part of any truce, a key sticking point in talks with Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvyr7objl	2024-12-24T03:28:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/HyhK0CPrkg/HyhK0CPrkg_0_36_1920_1081_0_small.jpg
Arab League members urge political transition and stability in po...	Arab nations urge stability in Syria, backing a political process while avoiding foreign interference; concerns grow over armed factions and leadership uncertainties amid calls for unity and peace Official Arab responses were cautious after the Syrian opposition factions, headed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Muhammed al-Golani, announced the formula of 'following up on developments in the situation in Damascus and emphasizing standing with the Syrians' choices.' Prevalent in Arab responses were demands, including the start of an integrated political process and warnings against sliding into chaos. According to experts for The Media Line, ambiguity and uncertainty about the future surround the current Syrian scene. Therefore, the Arab position will not be directed toward anyone specific, and most of it will develop and evolve with time, awaiting more clarity of vision. The experts also indicate that there are two possible paths for any Arab scenario. The first is supporting institutions and accepting the leaders of the current transitional path, and the second is restoring the Arab presence in Syria while acknowledging the current reality and following up on its developments. This means not leaving political decisions to any non-Arab intervention and freezing decisions regarding Syria’s seat in the Arab League until a new authority arrives or until the current leaders are accepted. Regarding al-Sharaa’s background, he previously joined al-Qaeda in Iraq shortly before the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and fought for three years in the Iraqi insurgency. After being captured by U.S. forces, he was imprisoned from 2006 to 2011. His release coincided with the Syrian revolution, and he founded Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, in 2012 with al-Qaeda’s support to participate in the Syrian civil war against Bashar Assad’s government. As the emir of Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Sharaa built a stronghold in the northwestern Idlib province and opposed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s attempts to merge Nusra into the Islamic State. This disagreement led to open conflict between Nusra and ISIS. The U.S. State Department designated al-Sharaa a 'global terrorist' in May 2013 and four years later announced a $10 million reward for information leading to his capture. He announced in an audio recording on September 28, 2014, that he would 'fight the United States and its allies and urged his fighters not to accept Western assistance in their fight against ISIS.' However, in February 2021, he backed down from threatening the U.S., saying that 'Hayat Tahrir al-Sham does not pose any threat to the United States, and the U.S. administration must remove it from its list of terrorist organizations.' Since his split from al-Qaeda, al-Sharaa also severed ties with Jabhat al-Nusra, merging it with other organizations to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in 2017. He then began collecting taxes and providing public services in the Syrian province of Idlib, which he controlled. The King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, who also chairs the current session of the Arab League, was the first to send a letter to al-Sharaa, in which he praised 'the cooperation of the Presidency of the Syrian Political Affairs Department with the Arab ambassadors residing in Damascus.' King Hamad also stressed in his letter published by the official Bahrain News Agency, 'the importance of preserving the sovereignty, stability, safety, and unity of the Syrian Republic, and achieving the aspirations of the Syrian people, and the readiness of the Kingdom of Bahrain to continue consultation and coordination with the Syrian Republic, and to support regional and international organizations to achieve what is in the best interests of the Syrian people.' The Saudi Foreign Ministry published a statement calling on the international community to stand by Syria 'without interfering in its internal affairs, and to join efforts to preserve the unity of Syria and the cohesion of its people in a way that protects it from sliding into chaos and division.' Meanwhile, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry confirmed in an official statement 'its support for the Syrian state and people and its support for Syria’s sovereignty.' It also called for 'the start of a comprehensive and integrated political process that establishes a new phase of consensus and internal peace.' Qatar’s Foreign Ministry stressed in a statement 'the need to preserve national institutions and the unity of the state in a way that prevents it from slipping into chaos, and its firm stand by the Syrian people and their choices.' Jordanian King Abdullah II confirmed in a Royal Court statement that his country 'stands by the Syrian brothers and respects their will and choices.' Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi stressed via a post on X that his country 'will provide all possible support to the brotherly Syrian people in their efforts to rebuild their homeland and institutions. It will support any political process launched by the Syrian people to preserve their rights.' He also stressed 'the need to protect Syria from slipping into chaos.' The pro-Assad Iraqi government confirmed in a statement by its spokesman, Bassem Al-Awadi, that it 'is continuing international contacts with brotherly and friendly countries, in order to push efforts toward stability, and preserve security, public order, lives and property for the brotherly Syrian people.' He also stressed 'the importance of not interfering in Syria's internal affairs, or supporting one party for the benefit of another,' affirming that 'intervention will only push the situation in Syria toward more conflict and division, and the first to be harmed will be the Syrian people.' From recent public events, it seems that Syria’s al-Sharaa will not be able to distance himself from those around him who are accused of terrorism. An Egyptian citizen named Mahmoud Fathy, who was convicted of terrorist crimes, including killing the Egyptian Attorney General Hisham Barakat in a bombing on June 29, 2015, has appeared next to al-Sharaa in several recent photos. Fathy is wanted by Egyptian authorities, who consider him an active terrorist according to official statements, and he has had several death sentences issued against him. Regarding the two options for support that Arab countries foresee for Syria, Egyptian political analyst Dr. Amr Shabaky told The Media Line: 'The first is to support institutions and the transitional and peaceful path of power, and the second is to restore Arab presence and not leave it to any non-Arab interventions, including recognition of the reality and dealing with its developments in a way that preserves the stability and safety of Syria and the security of the region.' Shabaky added: 'Current indicators indicate that there is an acknowledgment of the Syrians' options regardless of fears of armed factions, which will be dealt with based on practices, and that the most important thing now is to support Syrian institutions to avoid repeating the experience of Iraq and Libya.' Saudi political journalist Khaled Al-Awadi told The Media Line that 'the Arab position will remain reserved, but it will not allow any foreign intervention, especially since previous experiences were bad in Libya, Yemen, Iraq, and even Syria.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Al-Awadi, 'The Arabs will deal according to what these armed factions deal with, and there are questions that cannot be answered at present, related to the strength of the terrorist organization of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the extent to which these armed factions in Hayat Tahrir al-Sham accept other factions such as the SDF and others.' He argued that no one wants Syria to slide into a civil war again. 'This option is frightening for all Arabs, as the Arab countries fear this.' Jaber Hamoud, a Kuwaiti journalist, told The Media Line: 'I expect the Arab position toward Ahmad al-Sharaa to change now in Syria because of the Arabs’ desire for stability in Syria, especially after years of Bashar Assad’s rule.' Continued Hamoud: 'Bashar al-Assad was a criminal, and he did not have a good policy with the Gulf states or all the Arab states, so his fall will not represent anything important. The most important thing is that the future in Syria will be better than its predecessor.' Hamoud doesn’t expect violent conflicts inside Syria, 'as the Sunnis constitute about 90% of the population, and the Alawites hate Bashar Assad, and everyone is tired of the war that lasted 13 years and wants peace.' According to Jordanian journalist Mohammad Al-Jousi, the Arab countries have been and continue to stand by the Syrian people since 2011 and after the beginning of the Syrian refugee crisis in many Arab countries. 'After the fall of the Syrian regime, the Arab countries are now concerned with the return of security and stability to Syria, and that events be contained quickly by holding transitional presidential elections, for a period filled with hope for stability,' he told The Media Line. Al-Jousi continued: 'With the stabilization of the situation, attention will turn to the return of refugees and the reconstruction of Syria, as the greatest burden will be on the neighboring countries that hosted the refugees, which requires them to play a role in facilitating their return.' 'The Arab role will focus on unifying the Syrian opposition and presenting a roadmap for a political solution, as any internal division may open the way for foreign powers to enhance their influence,' he added. Mohammed Al-Rawi, an Iraqi political analyst, told The Media Line: 'Currently, we see it as natural for Arab countries to freeze Syria’s seat in the Arab League and for the seat to remain vacant until a president is officially elected for Syria, which could last a whole year.' According to Al-Rawi, Al-Sharaa will be eliminated soon, and a new face will appear on the scene, and the Arabs will deal with him. However, if Al-Sharaa is killed, 'there will be major clashes between the armed factions, each of which will accuse the other of being behind his assassination,' he cautioned. Meanwhile, for the Gulf states, Saudi political analyst Jassim Al-Saeedi told The Media Line that 'the most important thing is that the government is not affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and that those accused of terrorism are not in power in Syria.' He continued: 'If there are actually civil elections, a political vision, and a new constitution elected by the Syrian people, all Arab states, including the Gulf states, will stand by Syria. In any other case, there will be no support.'

I will rebuild this country for her if need be': Going back to K...	A father revisits his family’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri with his 5-year-old daughter, who hid in a closet as terrorists roamed their house on October 7; 'We brought her back for the first time in over a year so she could see Be’eri still stands,' father says Omri Shefroni, who lost four family members in the Kibbutz Be’eri massacre on October 7, spent 12 harrowing hours locked in a safe room with his family as Hamas terrorists roamed their living room. On Sunday morning, in an emotional interview with Ynet, he shared that, for the first time since that traumatic day, he took his five-year-old daughter, Arbel, back to his parents’ house in the kibbutz—and to the closet where she had hidden. 'We feared this moment for a long time, but we realized it was essential to help her process the experience. It was an emotional and difficult visit,' he said. 'She doesn’t remember much,' Shefroni explained, 'but she does remember being in the closet. That’s where we hid her and her two cousins as we waited for rescue, knowing it wouldn’t come quickly, with the terrorists just outside the safe room door. They even shot at the door, and two bullets penetrated it.' Despite the terror surrounding them, he added, 'She felt safe there, as far as we can understand. The anxiety, fear and helplessness we felt are impossible to put into words—there’s nothing rational about that situation.' Shefroni explained that the decision to revisit the house came after extensive consultations with Arbel’s therapist and psychologists. 'Part of the process,' he said, 'is ensuring her emotions and memories surface in a positive and constructive way, rather than haunting her mind and soul, while also ensuring she doesn’t suppress them. That was the intention. Arbel doesn’t remember much, but there are details etched in her memory that are slowly emerging.' Shefroni also addressed recent reports about progress in negotiations for a hostage release deal, which is expected to unfold in stages. 'There are still hostages from Be’eri in Gaza. I deeply hope the deal everyone is discussing will come to fruition and include all of them.' He added, 'There’s an ongoing effort to make people forget that we were left completely alone during the attack, abandoned, with no one truly taking responsibility for what happened—except for some incredible civilians, who stepped up on October 7, and they continue to bear that responsibility even now.' Shefroni spoke about his work with the 'Kumu' movement, which he co-founded alongside Yonatan Shamriz and other partners. 'We’re working to create a new reality here, one that reflects the strength of our people and the citizens of this country, showing that real change is possible,' he said. Yonatan’s brother, Alon Shamriz, was kidnapped on October 7 and tragically killed by the IDF in Shijaiyah alongside Yotam Chaim and Samer Talalka. When asked about Defense Minister Israel Katz's deadline for IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi to complete investigations into the massacre by next month, Shefroni responded, 'The defense minister is right. I personally fought to ensure these investigations would take place, but he’s ignoring the other side of the equation—political leadership holds significant and equal responsibility alongside the military. 'The IDF failed completely that day, and any Knesset member or minister who says so is correct. But they cannot absolve themselves of responsibility either. What we’re seeing is a total failure of leadership, and it’s been ongoing for over a year. Yes, we unequivocally expect a state commission of inquiry. That is the only way to truly examine these events.' A lifelong resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, now living in Givat Haviva in the Menashe Regional Council, Shefroni shared his longing to return. 'I visited on that Shabbat. My entire family lived there. Since then, I’ve felt a strong pull to go back. I hope we’ll make it happen, but I can’t promise. Arbel and her brother Maayan have lives and friends elsewhere, and these decisions are not simple. But I want to return, and Be’eri will undoubtedly recover. It will happen—though only after the hostages from Be’eri and the others are brought back. Without them, neither the kibbutz, the state, nor anything else here can truly heal.' Blast from the past Shefroni wrote on social media about his first visit with Arbel to the house where they had hidden during the massacre. 'She was four years and one month old when we hid her in the closet to protect her from the terrorists who were roaming our living room. Luckily, they didn’t try to open the door, though two bullets pierced through it like a hot knife through butter. If they had, we wouldn’t be here today.' Reflecting on the experience, he said, 'The moments of terror and helplessness are deeply burned into my soul, resurfacing every time I look at my children and realize that I’m the only one who can protect them—and that I won’t always be able to.' Shefroni also described the horrifying scenes during their evacuation from Be’eri at first light on October 8. 'As we drove along Route 232—the ‘Road of Blood’—we passed dozens of burned vehicles and bodies scattered around them. Someone had hung signs reading, ‘The Road of Abandonment 7/10.’ Elsewhere, someone had gone out of their way to stop at each sign and erase the words. Maybe they thought erasing them would make us forget, but we won’t. The abandonment cannot be erased.' He added, 'In the safe room where we hid, across from the closet where we concealed the children, my father hung three photos: Dror, who was five and a half when my older brother, Sagi, fled a burning house with her and hid her outside from the terrorists behind laundry baskets; my younger brother Ron being evacuated from the safe room with his partner and their eight-month-old son, Hillel, escorted by soldiers; and one of Arbel and me in the armored vehicle early Sunday morning, freezing because the soldiers had turned the air conditioning to full blast. She remembers we rode in an ‘ice bus.’' Hope for the future Shefroni concluded, 'We brought her back to Be’eri for the first time in over a year so she could see Be’eri still stands. That her grandfather’s house has been repaired and still exists. That there is no longer war or terrorists there. Be’eri stands, and it will continue to stand and rebuild. Its resilient people are rebuilding it and will keep doing so, but they will never forget. They are still waiting for their friends, the hostages, to return.'

Palestinian Authority bans Al Jazeera in West Bank over terror cr...	Palestinian movement says decision comes following Qatari outlet's slanted coverage of clashes between its security forces and terrorists in Jenin The Fatah movement on Monday issued a ban on Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera and prohibited its entry into the West Bank, citing the channel's coverage of the Palestinian Authority's operations in the Jenin refugee camp as incitement against Palestinian security forces. The forces are leading an operation targeting armed terrorists affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The channel, which has become a mouthpiece for the Hamas terrorist organization, systematically portrays the Palestinian Authority negatively and incites against the security forces' activities in a manner that endangers their lives. Al Jazeera personnel were barred from covering the funeral of an officer killed in the Jenin refugee camp on Tuesday. 'To all Al Jazeera employees working in Palestinian territories, we hope you reflect on your actions and resign from this biased channel that has destroyed and continues to destroy the Arab world,' Fatah wrote to the channel's staff. 'Al Jazeera floods the media with lies, especially in Palestine, siding with a group of hostile mercenaries in the Jenin camp and trying to present them as heroes resisting the occupation,' it added.

Former Hamas hostage Hanna Katzir dies at 77	Hamas captivity survivor and longtime caregiver at Nir Oz dies a year after her release in a hostage deal; her husband was murdered in the October 7 attack, and her son was killed in captivity; 'Her heart couldn’t bear the suffering,' says daughter Kibbutz Nir Oz announced Tuesday morning the passing of Hanna Katzir, 77, a member of the kibbutz who was freed from Hamas captivity last year in the first phase of a hostage exchange deal. Katzir is the first released hostage to have passed away. 'It is with deep sorrow that we announce the passing of Hanna Katzir, a beloved member of Kibbutz Nir Oz,' the kibbutz said in a statement. 'After months of struggle and a complicated medical condition following her release, she has left us.' Katzir had been hospitalized in critical condition shortly after her release, with her health deteriorating in December. Katzir will be laid to rest Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. at the kibbutz cemetery. Carmit Palti-Katzir, Hanna’s daughter, described her as 'a loving, devoted wife and mother who was full of love.' She added, 'Her heart could not bear the terrible suffering since October 7.' Speaking of the hostages still in captivity, Palti-Katzir called for urgent action. 'Every day in captivity endangers the lives of our loved ones. A comprehensive agreement to bring back our 100 brothers and sisters must be reached immediately.' Katzir was abducted from her home in Nir Oz on October 7 during the Hamas-led assault. Her husband, Rami Katzir, 79, was murdered by the attackers. Hanna later learned that her son, Elad, 47, had also been taken hostage. In April, the IDF confirmed that Elad had been killed in captivity, and his body was recovered from Khan Yunis. Hanna Katzir was the mother of three children and grandmother to six. Known for her dedication, she had cared for children in the kibbutz for many years. 'When she returned home after being freed, the first thing she asked was, ‘Where is Dad?’' her daughter recalled. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1zteyobjg	2024-12-23T22:40:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/SkQhDcXzp/SkQhDcXzp_0_97_976_550_0_small.jpg

23 UN food aid trucks looted in southern Gaza	The UN’s World Food Program (WFP) reported that 23 of 66 trucks carrying food and humanitarian aid to southern Gaza were looted. UN Deputy Spokesperson Stéphane Tremblay said Monday that the convoy, organized by the WFP, departed from the Kerem Shalom crossing on Sunday via the Philadelphi Corridor. While some trucks reached the organization’s warehouse safely, others were delayed, and news of the convoy spread, leading to the looting.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjchgj00rjx	2024-12-23T22:19:20-08:00	
A Sunni Christmas? Syria's Christians uneasy about Islamists unde...	Ahmad al-Sharaa’s leadership promises unity and respect for Christians, but fears persist over minority treatment and emigration; Lebanon’s economic crisis dims celebrations, with southern villages lacking power as residents rebuild from devastation Christmas has arrived, and Christians in Syria, Lebanon and neighboring Arab countries are preparing for the holiday amid a backdrop of recent upheavals in the region. In Syria, Christmas trees have been lit in the streets, including in the capital Damascus. However, for many Christians, the holiday spirit is tempered by mixed feelings—joy on one hand and uncertainty about the new regime on the other. Although the lives of Christians in Syria have remained relatively stable since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, there is growing apprehension about what the future might hold under the rule of religiously motivated armed factions. While the new Syrian government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has pledged to dismantle these groups, it also portrays itself as a unifying force, aiming to represent all religions and communities in Syrian society. The festive atmosphere across Damascus and other parts of Syria is tinged with fundamental questions about the future of Christians in the reshaped Syrian state. In interviews with Arab media, Syrian Christians have expressed both hope and concern. 'Right now, we are preparing for Christmas and hoping the rebel operations administration will assist us. Syria belongs to everyone, open to all religions,' said one Christian resident. Another added, 'We have lived together—Muslims and Christians—all our lives, loving one another and celebrating holidays together.' Apprehension aside, some see the illuminated Christmas trees lining the streets as a positive sign of better days ahead. Speaking to the Saudi news network Al Arabiya, Mohammad Sabra, a negotiator for the Syrian opposition during the Geneva peace talks, noted that while some fear the new regime will adopt a religious tone, it was Assad's regime that actively sowed division among Syrians. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted that when armed factions first took control of various areas in Syria, they distributed bread and gifts to children in Christian neighborhoods, assuring residents they had nothing to fear. However, in Homs, some claimed militants attempted to close alcohol shops and remove crosses from Christian-owned vehicles. These incidents, though troubling, appeared to be isolated and counter to the official policies of Syria's new leadership. 'Rebels are asking Christians to continue practicing their religious traditions and fully celebrate Christmas,' said a resident named Ammar Fahouri in an interview. 'We are still afraid of the uncertain future and haven’t yet reached a stage of full confidence, but their words, actions and respect for everyone help ease some of the fear.' Meanwhile, a businessman from Aleppo expressed skepticism: 'We are still in the stage of promises. Is this propaganda to build trust abroad, only to change later, or is it genuine? Time will tell.' Jiris Jabra, a Christian resident of Tartus, said he felt relieved by Assad's departure: 'We are optimistic because those who overthrew the regime are taking steps to ensure safety and security.' The report also noted that many Christians fled their homes as rebels advanced but returned within days to protect their properties. 'In 30–40 years, there will be no Christians in Syria' The article pointed out that during decades of Assad family rule, Christians and Muslims coexisted with minimal friction. However, the civil war tested Christian communities severely. As the conflict took on sectarian dimensions, many Christians sided with the regime or refrained from opposing it openly. Church leaders, in particular, had longstanding ties to the regime and its intelligence services. Although there is no precise count of the Christian population in Syria, estimates from international charities and local communities peg the number between 200,000 and 600,000—no more than 1.5% of the population. Before the war, Christians made up about 10% of Syria’s population, but the significant exodus of refugees drastically reduced their numbers. The treatment of minorities is now a critical test for Syria’s opposition forces, particularly for al-Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham organization, which has, in recent years, emphasized its break from its jihadist origins. The Wall Street Journal further reported that many young Christians are emigrating from Syria. A young Christian travel agency owner from Aleppo told the paper that, despite his optimism for Syria’s future, he is still contemplating emigration, believing the region will remain mired in conflict. 'In 30–40 years, there will be no Christians in Syria because everyone will have left,' he said. 'Those who cannot leave will either be old or dead.' The report warned that this ongoing emigration could threaten the historical presence of Christians in Syria. Marguerite Kalenderian, an Armenian Christian who previously lived in northwest Syria but emigrated to Dubai in 2021, expressed concern about the new leadership. 'They were part of ISIS and Al Qaeda—how can I trust someone who was a terrorist just two days ago?' she asked, reflecting fears about possible restrictions on freedoms, including forcing women to cover their hair. In southern Lebanon, Christmas trees remain unlit due to lack of electricity Lebanon is also celebrating Christmas, though the festivities are shadowed by economic hardship and the aftermath of the war. The country, already in the grips of a severe financial crisis, has seen its situation further worsen. This holiday season, Lebanon is relying heavily on tourism to generate much-needed revenue. Social media videos show glimpses of the holiday spirit in Beirut, despite the challenges. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Lebanese army has leveraged the holiday season by hosting a booth at a Christmas exhibition in the Forum De Beyrouth event complex in the capital. Facing numerous challenges and tasked with additional missions following the cease-fire with Israel, the army is now actively recruiting soldiers and raising funds. At the event, the army displayed a sign listing 'volunteer terms for the army,' which has also circulated on social media in recent weeks to attract new recruits. In southern Lebanon, however, holiday atmosphere is far more subdued. In ravaged border villages and areas still experiencing military activity, Christmas celebrations are muted. The Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar shared a video showing a resident of the Christian village Dardara, near Tyre, placing a Christmas tree atop the ruins of the local church, which was damaged in airstrikes. Hezbollah had reportedly used sites, including religious institutions, for hiding, storing ammunition and launching attacks on Israeli territory. According to the report, the Christmas tree in the village remained unlit because electricity had not yet been restored, and most residents had yet to return. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkquchvb1g	2024-12-23T22:12:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/SJ11c6a38ryx/SJ11c6a38ryx_0_436_1079_608_0_small.jpg

Terror meets the army': West Bank terror sees downtrend amid IDF...	Military data from 2024 shows number of West Bank terror attacks lowered significantly year-on-year amid increased military operations and lessons learned from October 7 A significant decline in West Bank terror incidents was seen throughout 2024 as seen by recent military data. According to security officials, 'only' 254 terror attacks took place compared to 847 in 2023 and 342 in 2022. The data also showed other violent incidents including hurling rocks and incidents also reduced with 1,188 incidents in 2024 compared to 3,256 in 2023 and 3,779 in 2022. However, the number of Israeli casualties, including civilians and IDF soldiers, remained relatively stable over the past three years. Some 497 Palestinians were killed in clashes with the IDF in 2024, compared to 504 in 2023 and 155 in 2022. Security officials claimed 97% of those killed were terrorists. Some 2,350 Hamas operatives have been arrested by the IDF Central Command since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023. Jewish nationalist crime incidents also decreased, with 663 recorded in 2024 compared to 1,045 in 2023 and 947 in 2022. Whether this reflects a drop in activity or enforcement is unclear. IDF Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth coined the term 'terror meets the army – civilians live routine,' guiding the IDF's strategy to push terror threats away from communities and roads. The IDF identified high-risk areas in the region and implemented engineering measures to distance Palestinian villages and potential terrorists from Israeli locations. The army also established positions deep in Palestinian territory and restricted its divisions operating in the area, reducing civilian friction. After lessons learned from October 7, Jewish settlements were provided with weapons to ensure readiness in extreme scenarios until the military arrives. The West Bank barrier has also been bolstered, with significant sections rebuilt and new technologies are being implemented to aid forces. The nature of terror in the West Bank has evolved over recent years. In 2015, a wave of 'lone wolf' attacks —unaffiliated individuals committing stabbings — proved hard to preempt and often inspired copycat attacks. While this phenomenon persists to a lesser degree, local terror cells directed by Hamas and other terror organizations have resurged, leading to a rise in suicide attacks, especially via car bombings. In the past three years, a new threat has emerged: armed groups hidden in refugee camps. These groups, especially in the northern West Bank, operate like small terror organizations with hierarchical structures. Backed by substantial funding, they’ve set up command centers, hideouts and infrastructure. Terror camps are equipped with surveillance cameras and explosive traps, with terrorists often engaging the IDF in firefights. This model was inspired by the Lion's Den terror group in Nablus, which was dismantled by Israeli forces in 2022, though its successors remain active. While these 'camp brigades' lack unified coordination, Hamas and Iran fund and attempt to influence them. Armed parades in refugee camps, often just minutes from central Israel, present another challenge. These events are typically surrounded by civilians, making immediate responses complex. However, security forces identify and target the terrorists after the fact. Jordan’s eastern border with Israel poses its own difficulties. Despite the peace agreement with the country, Iran and Hamas frequently attempt to smuggle advanced weapons through the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: This is often done by smugglers tossing weapons over the fence, later retrieved by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs. To counter this, the IDF has established a new division along the border, implemented new technological measures and enhanced cooperation with Jordanian forces. The Palestinian Authority's (PA) security forces have been conducting operations against armed terrorists in Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps for nearly two weeks. Progress has been relatively positive, though it's too early to determine its outcome. The PA aims to demonstrate governance and order, hoping the operation will bolster its case for taking control of Gaza after the war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1kms0vryx	2024-12-23T22:00:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/20/HkNC5vukp/HkNC5vukp_0_11_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Sadly, the IDF continues to treat families of the lookout soldiers in a disgraceful manner.' Adv. Bar-Tal explained that after IDF announced it would share the recordings, it delivered only partial documentation from Friday, October 6, until around 6:30 p.m., alongside a few seconds from 4:47 a.m. on Saturday, October 7. 'All other recordings, including those from Friday night into Saturday and the morning of the attack, were not provided to families,' he said. 'To clarify, the Supreme Court petition will still proceed. The IDF’s conduct, along with these partial recordings, will not lead to withdrawal of the petition.' Yigal, father of lookout soldier Hadar Cohen, who was killed at the outpost, shared his frustration with Ynet: 'We received recordings from the morning of October 6 until that evening, and that’s it. Hadar was on duty from 8 p.m. until midnight,' he said, explaining that her voice was absent from the recordings entirely. 'This is very disappointing,' Yigal said. 'We waited so long for this and feel extremely let down. We didn’t hear Hadar at all in the recordings—they end before her shift even began. We were waiting to hear her voice, but they didn’t tell us what we would hear, and now we know she isn’t included.' 'It’s incredibly strange, an unbearable heartbreak—it feels unreal,' he added, describing his emotions. 'It’s inconceivable that, right before such an attack, no trace of their communication remains. We feel like things are being hidden from us.'

The Houthis cannot be deterred': The militia that defies the US ...	Yemeni rebels threaten Israel and global stability, paralyzing Red Sea trade despite US-led strikes; senior US officials express 'shock' over their advanced weapons, raising fears of increased Iranian support; Trump’s return may signal tougher US stance In one of the most dangerous incidents for U.S. forces in the Middle East since the onset of the war in Gaza, a U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jet was accidentally shot down over the Red Sea by an American warship over the weekend. The incident coincided with U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi positions in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Both pilots safely ejected and were rescued, while the Houthi rebels quickly claimed responsibility for the downing. However, the Pentagon has not clarified whether the friendly fire was directly linked to the ongoing combat against the Iranian-backed group. The episode underscores the broader challenge posed by Iranian proxies, not only to Israel but also to the United States and the international community. Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Houthis have launched what they describe as a campaign of 'support for Gaza.' This campaign has included barrages of missiles and swarms of drones targeting Israel—some of which caused casualties—and strikes on civilian vessels in the Red Sea, effectively crippling one of the world’s critical trade routes. One civilian ship was even seized. The Houthi attacks place the Biden administration in a difficult position, as they coincide with U.S. efforts to mediate an end to Yemen’s civil war and the Saudi-Houthi conflict. That war, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians in Saudi airstrikes, failed to defeat the Iranian-aligned militia. President Joe Biden removed the Houthis from the U.S. list of terrorist organizations upon entering office, and a UN-brokered cease-fire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia was reached in 2022. Over the past year, the U.S. has avoided direct, large-scale attacks on Houthi targets, seeking to preserve diplomatic efforts and prevent broader escalation in the region. Still, Washington formed an international coalition to conduct limited strikes aimed at deterring Houthi activity in the Red Sea. Israel, meanwhile, has expressed frustration over what it perceives as insufficient U.S. actions against the militia. Israel largely refrained from responding to Houthi attacks for months but launched its first strike in July, followed by additional attacks in September and last week. These strikes targeted strategic sites such as energy facilities and ports. Yet the Houthis vowed to continue their missile and drone campaigns. Earlier Monday, the IDF intercepted a drone launched from Yemen—following two failed interceptions of ballistic missiles last week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Israelis to 'remain patient and steadfast' and hinted at a coordinated international effort against the Houthis, possibly involving expanded U.S. operations. 'We will act with strength, determination and ingenuity,' Netanyahu said Monday. 'Even if it takes time, the result will be the same as with other terrorist arms.' He promised that Israel’s recent strike in Yemen 'will not be the last.' As tensions remain high, the possibility of intensified U.S. and allied action could grow, particularly with President-elect Donald Trump set to re-enter the White House next month. However, the U.S.-led coalition’s ability to deter the Houthis has come into question as they had shown resilience against years of relentless Saudi airstrikes, often disregarding the severe suffering of Yemeni civilians. Two-thirds of Yemen’s population lives under Houthi control. A report Monday in The Wall Street Journal highlighted growing concerns in Washington and among international allies over the Houthis’ acquisition of advanced missile and drone technologies from Iran. Western sources have also alleged Russian involvement, pointing to intelligence about Western ships in the Red Sea supplying the Houthis. According to a U.S. defense official cited in the report, the coalition has destroyed 450 Houthi-launched drones. Despite these efforts, the Houthis' technological capabilities continue to pose significant challenges, exemplified by last week’s failure of Israel’s missile defense systems to intercept two ballistic missiles. One struck a school in Ramat Efal, while the other hit a playground in Tel Aviv. As noted by Ynet military analyst Rob Ben-Yishai, experts who spoke to The Journal believe that the Houthis on Saturday fired a derivative of an Iranian-made ballistic missile with a maneuverable re-entry vehicle, designed to evade defense systems. 'The scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,' a United Nations report said in November. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: William LaPlante, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, warned last month that the Houthis 'are getting scary' and that he was 'just shocked' at technologies they now have access to. The rapid evolution of the Houthis’ capabilities has alarmed analysts. 'In 2004, they were a besieged group hiding in the mountains,' said Mohammed Albasha, a U.S.-based Middle East security analyst for Basha Report. 'Now, they’re chasing U.S. carriers with drones and missiles and striking 2,000 kilometers away in central Israel.' This transformation, analysts say, could intensify if Iran increases its support for the Houthis as it faces setbacks in Lebanon and Syria. Even if the U.S. escalates its operations, experts question whether the Houthis can be deterred. Osamah Al Rawhani, a director for the Yemen-based Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, an independent think tank, told The Wall Street Journal: 'The Houthis don’t care what they lose as Yemenis. They want to win as a militia and take on global powers.' Dr. Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), echoed the sentiment. The Houthis 'don’t have a lot to lose' and 'They cannot be deterred.' Trump has not yet outlined specific plans to address the Houthi threat. However, during his election campaign, Trump subtly criticized the Biden administration’s military actions in the region, writing in August in a post on X that ' Bombs are dropping all over the place' in the Middle East. Given his hardline stance on Iran, analysts anticipate a tougher U.S. policy on the Houthis under his leadership. Mike Waltz, Trump’s incoming national security advisor, signaled this shift during a podcast interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, promising to re-designate the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). 'They remain an outstanding issue,' Waltz said. 'I guarantee what you’re going to see very soon is a redesignation of them for what they are — a terrorist organization.' President Biden removed the Houthis from the FTO list shortly after taking office, citing humanitarian concerns and the need to facilitate aid deliveries to Yemen’s civilians amid a dire humanitarian crisis. The FTO designation, first implemented by Trump in the waning days of his first term, carried severe sanctions, including penalties for any entities providing material support to the group. In January 2023, following renewed Houthi attacks, Biden placed them on the less severe Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) list, which imposes sanctions but lacks the sweeping restrictions of FTO classification. Critics have argued that the SDGT label does not do enough to curb the group’s aggression. Ben-Yishai predicted that Trump would lift the operational constraints Biden placed on U.S. forces in Yemen, potentially paving the way for a coordinated U.S.-Israel campaign to neutralize the Houthi threat. Such a strategy could involve targeting the Houthis’ leadership and degrading their ballistic missiles, drones, launch systems and production facilities—actions that Ben-Yishai said would mirror successful Israeli operations against Hezbollah’s strategic assets in Lebanon and the Assad regime’s capabilities in Syria. Israel would likely require significant cooperation from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region with aircraft carriers, missile destroyers and other assets. The geographic distance and intelligence challenges make unilateral Israeli action improbable. Ben-Yishai argued that a coordinated effort could prevent the Houthis from further destabilizing global order and the economy. He noted that while the Houthis are undeterred by strikes on their state infrastructure, leadership decapitation and precision attacks on their military capabilities could shift the balance. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk8oo7wb1e	2024-12-23T11:00:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/HkkC11PNryg/HkkC11PNryg_0_223_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Echoes of rebellion: Exiled activists see hope for change in Iran...	Two years after the start of the Women, Life, Freedom protests, Iranians abroad highlight the regime’s growing instability and find parallels in regional shifts, including Syria’s recent political developments Over the past two years, Iran has witnessed an unrelenting crackdown on its citizens, triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini at the hands of the morality police. The Women, Life, Freedom movement that followed Amini’s death became both a symbol of nationwide resistance and the catalyst for a devastating response from the regime. According to data provided by the Iran Human Rights organization, at least 166 people were executed in Iranian prisons in November 2024 alone, the highest monthly execution rate since 2007. That number includes four women, 12 Afghan nationals, one Jewish person, and a man with intellectual disabilities. Since the start of 2024, more than 850 people have been executed in Iran, surpassing the 2023 numbers. More women have been executed in Iran so far in 2024 than in any year in the past decade. Iran Human Rights founder Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam told The Media Line that Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah played a role in the increasing rate of Iranian executions. 'Since tensions in the region increased, especially after the killing of Nasrallah, we’ve seen a dramatic rise in executions,' he said. 'The regime executed 310 people in two months. Those executed came mostly from marginalized segments of the society and were deprived of fair trial rights.' Only 4% of November’s executions were officially reported by the regime. 'The reports that come out from the Iranian authorities’ side only show a very small part of what is happening,' Amiry-Moghaddam explained. 'For instance, official Iranian media announce between 10% and 20% of all executions. Without our numbers, the execution trends wouldn’t even be visible internationally.' As it stands, the international community is aware of the executions going on in Iran. 'The problem is the willingness to act,' Amiry-Moghaddam said. 'Human rights don’t have a high priority in international politics.' He pointed to indifference regarding state-sanctioned oppression of women as another example of international unconcern for human rights abuses. 'There is no justification for this,' he said. 'The Women, Life, Freedom movement is not just about Iran, it is going against gender apartheid, which has not been recognized internationally as a crime yet.' In September 2023, the Iranian parliament passed a stricter law requiring women to cover their hair and punishing businesses that serve women with uncovered hair. The regime paused the implementation of the law one week ago, in a move analysts say was meant to prevent widespread protests. 'Pragmatically, the regime sees that the backlash of enforcing the law now would be much higher than in 2022, especially since they’ve lost confidence after recent failures and defeats across the region,' Amiry-Moghaddam said. 'Its proxies have suffered major defeats, and the Islamic Republic is weaker than ever. People are aware of it.' Amiry-Moghaddam and his family left Iran in the 1980s. He was just 11 years old when the family fled, first to Pakistan and then to Norway. His parents thought they would be able to return in a few years once things improved, but that hasn’t happened yet. His concern for his countrymen led him to establish Iran Human Rights in 2005 to raise awareness of the regime’s brutality. 'It is very risky work. People inside Iran can be arrested for cooperating with us,' he said. 'They may be accused of espionage, which could result in severe punishment, even death. For this reason, we use secure platforms and anonymous networks to communicate, ensuring that information cannot be traced back to us or our sources.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Being in regular contact with people on the ground sometimes leads him to forget he’s not in Iran, Amiry-Moghaddam. 'Hopefully, even we from the diaspora will be able to go back to our country soon after the regime’s fall, and rebuild everything from scratch,' he said. 'In the meantime, we help from here.' Jeyran and Babak Moghadam are two Iranians who paid the price for trying to protest the regime from within the country. Originally from Tehran, Jeyran had spent years studying in Spain when she was offered a position as Spanish professor at Tehran University in 2014. 'I got into the university system by pretending to align with the regime, but once inside, I worked to help students challenge their oppression. I gave them texts in Spanish regarding the importance of human rights and the fight against dictatorships. Teaching became my way to inspire the younger generation,' she told The Media Line. She even organized illegal gatherings with her students to find ways to fight the regime. One student in her lecture turned out to be a spy, and Jeyran was brought in for questioning by the regime and tortured. 'During interrogations, they threatened me and insulted me for hours,' she said. 'The last time, they locked me in a cell and crushed my hand inside a door. I suffered not only physical but also mental pain. My hand still hurts every time it rains or gets cold. This was my souvenir from the regime.' Her husband, Babak, a pediatrician, also went against the regime on multiple occasions. He organized demonstrations with other doctors and treated injured protesters in their home. 'The regime discovered this, and he was taken many times in for questioning, until one day when he disappeared completely, and I didn’t know what happened to him,' Jeyran said. 'After a week, he came home, and by his face, I could tell he was beaten harshly. He was dumped in the desert, barefoot, and he was forced to walk home. Yet he continued his activism.' Jeyran was offered a teaching position in Germany through a program aimed at hiring professors whose lives are in danger. She left Iran on August 8, 2023, and hasn’t returned since. 'Two years have passed. I believe freedom is near, even though the road ahead will be tough. I hope the people of Iran may kick out the regime, as Syrians recently did.' 'I had to decide immediately, pack my life in weeks, and leave everything behind,' she said. 'My life was at stake in Iran, and I needed to take this opportunity and bring my husband with me.' Babak was set to be arrested again before their flight, and the regime tried to prevent him from leaving the country. Protests broke out at the airport, and he and Jeyran were able to safely board the plane. 'It was a miracle he escaped, but the regime promised that once he sets foot in Iran, he will be arrested for sure,' Jeyran said. The couple have been living in Germany for more than a year now, but both still have family members in Iran. 'My husband received threatening calls while he was staying here and our family members as well,' Jeyran said. 'Despite that, we and our families are all willing to face the consequences to advocate for what is right.' Jeyran entered Germany legally, but her Iranian passport has now expired, and she is unable to request a new one from the regime. 'I am effectively stateless, unable to leave or travel,' she said. In addition, Babak is burdened with the bureaucratic headache of life as a refugee, despite both him and Jeyran having stable jobs. Despite the challenges of life in exile, Jeyran has hope for a better future. 'I gave the regime four to five years when Mahsa Amini’s murder ignited the protests,' Jeyran said. 'Two years have passed. I believe freedom is near, even though the road ahead will be tough. I hope the people of Iran may kick out the regime, as Syrians recently did.'

Images of alleged RPG use by Palestinian security forces in Jenin...	Palestinian Authority denies footage originated in Jenin, claiming such weapons weren't used in their operations; Israeli security reviews suggest otherwise, indicating images likely from Jenin and show weapons seized, not deployed, by PA forces Footage circulating on social media on Monday purportedly shows members of Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces wielding RPG launchers in the Jenin refugee camp as part of an ongoing crackdown on local terror groups. While the PA denied the images were from Jenin, a review by the Israeli security establishment concluded otherwise, indicating that the launchers are likely linked to weapons seized during the PA’s internal campaign rather than arms actively used by the forces. Israeli defense officials are investigating the rare images, which appear to depict a PA special forces operative holding an RPG launcher. Preliminary assessments suggest the weapon has low operational capability and was not used during recent clashes in Jenin. The presence of such weaponry, unprecedented in the West Bank, is considered significant, as similar arms have been smuggled by Iran through the porous border with Jordan. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: PA security forces typically operate with AK-47 rifles, a limited number of machine guns and sniper rifles. Requests to Israel for additional arms have been denied in the past year, despite recommendations from Israeli Central Command to bolster PA forces. Israeli officials speculate the RPG launcher may eventually be handed over to the IDF. A senior PA official denied the authenticity of the images, alleging they were part of an incitement campaign by rivals such as Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad to fuel public opposition to the PA. 'These photos were not taken in Jenin, and PA forces have not used RPGs in the operation,' the official told Ynet. The controversy prompted statements from Israeli regional leaders. Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council, urged immediate military action, saying, 'I demand that the defense minister and prime minister immediately launch a ground operation in Jenin, similar to what was carried out in Gaza and the north, to prevent a repeat of the October 7 scenes in Judea and Samaria and central Israel. 'It is no coincidence that Jenin has become the capital of terror. If the terrorists feel confident enough to brandish RPGs and heavy weapons, it means they are testing us. We must respond with an iron fist to stop this threat to Samaria—and from Samaria to the cities of central Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1nf9zprjx	2024-12-23T08:28:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/rkmwNgPSJl/rkmwNgPSJl_0_578_828_467_0_small.jpg

Two women rebuild community after surviving October 7 kibbutz mas...	After surviving the Be’eri massacre, Adi Weiss and Bar Karbona turned tragedy into action, spearheading efforts to rebuild their community in a new temporary home; their project provides a haven for healing, as they focus on restoring Be’eri and securing the hostages' return Adi Weiss and Bar Karbona are not just two professional, talented women—they are also mothers and survivors of the massacre at Kibbutz Be’eri. Their story, which began in tragedy, has evolved into an inspiring journey of recovery and rebuilding—in every sense of the word. On the morning of October 7, during Simchat Torah and the kibbutz’s communal celebration, Adi, 39, and Bar, 34, woke up to a barrage of rockets and sirens. 'We realized something very unusual was happening,' recalls Bar, who took shelter in the safe room with her partner, Tom, and their infant son, Albi, who had not yet turned one. At the same time, Adi also took refuge in her safe room with her three children, while her partner, Yuval, rushed out to fight the terrorists as part of the Kibbutz's auxiliary squad. For hours, both women were trapped in their safe rooms without food, water, or electricity, while Hamas terrorists tried to break down their doors. Nearby homes burned, and the sounds of automatic gunfire, explosions, and shouting in Arabic surrounded them. By the end of that horrific day, they were rescued but had suffered devastating losses: Bar’s mother-in-law, Galit Karbona, and Adi’s father-in-law and brother-in-law, Mati and Amir Weiss, were brutally murdered. 'When I realized they had been killed,' Adi recounts, 'I tried not to let the kids sense it. I played a game with them called ‘Kva Kva De La Huma’ and told them that Grandpa and Grandma’s batteries had run out.' That night, as the two women fled and walked through the ruins of the kibbutz, they already understood: 'We realized we had nowhere to go back to.' Along with the remaining kibbutz members who had not been murdered or kidnapped, they were evacuated to the Dead Sea. 'Within a week, it became clear to us that we had no home and that we needed to find a temporary place to live for ourselves and our community,' says Adi. 'We didn’t yet know who had been kidnapped or killed, and neither of us had even buried our loved ones, but we understood we had to act,' Bar adds. Bar, an architect by trade, and Adi, a project manager in the planning field, had not been friends and barely knew each other. At the hotel, they connected in what they describe as a 'shared destiny,' joining forces for one mission: finding a new home for their community. Today, after successfully completing the project (led by Yasky Architects) and seeing the residents move into their new homes, they share their story and that of their new living space. 'We didn’t really know each other before,' says Bar, 'but it was through the planning process that we connected. I felt obligated to the kibbutz and my community, based on all the knowledge I had gained.' Adi adds, 'It gave both of us a reason to get up in the morning and cope. It became our psychological therapy. We connected from the very first moment, spending 18 hours a day together.' The two explain: 'We used every connection we had and called every relevant person: the Southern District Planner, the head of the Planning Administration, representatives from the Israel Land Authority, and officials from the Ministry of Construction and Housing. We called everyone and said, ‘You must help us find a place to live.’' After initiating rounds of meetings with various officials, they discovered that Kibbutz Hatzerim, near Be’er Sheva, had already begun work on a new neighborhood. Adi recalls, 'From that moment, without planning or intending to, we found ourselves immersed in the project of our lives. All the experience we had gained and the connections we had made led us to this point—to plan our ‘temporary kibbutz’ in Hatzerim and to begin the restoration of our beloved and beautiful Be’eri, which had been completely destroyed.' Beyond their lobbying efforts, the two actively dove into the project’s plans and began influencing the neighborhood’s design to meet the needs of Be’eri’s residents. They transformed their hotel room at the Dead Sea into an office, opened their laptops, spread out maps of the area, and threw themselves into the task of a lifetime. 'We worked on improving the homes, the living conditions, and the neighborhood, maximizing public buildings and quality of life,' they explain. 'We kept the community updated on the project’s progress and visited the site regularly to ensure everything was moving according to plan. There were many delays in the project, and we had to repeatedly go back to the members and explain why they occurred.' Adi and Bar insisted on the construction of a dental clinic, like the one that had existed in their kibbutz, where five people were murdered. The original clinic is slated for demolition soon. They also influenced the size of the homes, their interior design, outdoor spaces, additional lawns, and even planned a communal garden. 'We wanted to feel as at home as possible,' Adi explains, 'and to have a place for gatherings, events, or even just to have coffee together.' Bar adds, 'We managed to create a sense of home here. After a year in a hotel, we were waiting for this moment. This is what we were looking for. It’s not Be’eri, true, but it’s the space we envisioned to help us move forward from an emotional standpoint.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Given their professional experience, the two knew that such processes don’t happen overnight. From the planning stage to occupancy, there are many obstacles to traverse. 'These are processes that typically take years,' Bar explains, 'sometimes even a decade. Here, everything had to happen as quickly as possible. Every day of delay was another day in a hotel.' For them, this is not just another project—it is, quite literally, the 'project of their lives.' It includes 287 homes in five different sizes, six kindergartens, four educational institutions, a dining hall, offices, a medical clinic, a dental clinic, a clothing warehouse, a local shop, a playground, and a community garden. The two understood that this wasn’t just planning for strangers but for their own friends and community. 'That was the most complex part—our deep personal involvement.' Adi shares, 'Slowly but surely, a neighborhood started to take shape, and suddenly, our kids were riding bikes on the sidewalks again, and families were having picnics on the grass.

Stickers across NYC promise free gifts, QR codes redirect to anti...	Campaign spearheaded by BDS activists accuses Israel of war crimes; QR codes on stickers direct users to videos featuring graphic images of injured children in Gaza alongside calls for boycott Fake stickers promoting QR codes promising 'free gifts' have been appearing on the windows of restaurants and stores across New York City. These stickers, emblazoned with enticing offers like free McDonald’s burgers or Starbucks coffee, have instead been redirecting unsuspecting users to graphic videos and incendiary messages targeting Israel. The campaign, spearheaded by activists within the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, accuses Israel of war crimes and encourages boycotts against companies perceived as supportive of the Jewish state. The stickers, which have been sighted on storefronts of major chains such as McDonald’s, Starbucks and Zara in Manhattan, lure passersby with QR codes that claim to unlock exclusive deals. Upon scanning, users are exposed to distressing images of injured Palestinian children accompanied by calls for action against Israel, including demands for boycotts and allegations of complicity in human rights violations. One sticker placed on the window of a McDonald’s in Midtown falsely advertised free food but instead led to a digital flyer accusing the fast-food giant of 'McGenocide' for its alleged provision of meals to the Israel Defense Forces. Similar stickers at Starbucks locations falsely promised free beverages, redirecting users to anti-Israel propaganda videos. The campaign appears to be orchestrated by NJ PalAction, an activist group that has claimed responsibility for placing these stickers on storefronts in 68 locations across Manhattan. 'Curious customers who scan the codes are confronted with horrific images from Gaza where Israel continues to murder, maim, starve and displace Palestinians for over 430 days. They are reminded that these brands are complicit and have no place on this year’s holiday shopping list,' the organization stated on social media. 'No celebration until liberation We call for an immediate arms embargo, an end to the siege on Gaza, and an end to 76 years of dispossession, occupation and apartheid in Palestine by Israel and the U.S.,' the statement also said. In addition to disseminating its message, the group has used social media to encourage supporters to create and distribute these deceptive stickers in their own neighborhoods. It offers downloadable PDFs for at-home printing, contingent on proof of a donation to organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) or the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF). Both organizations have faced scrutiny over alleged ties to extremist groups. Local residents have expressed alarm over the accessibility of these materials to children and the graphic nature of the videos linked through the QR codes.

'It’s nothing less than an act of Jew hatred disguised as political activism.' Beyond the moral outrage, there are also legal questions surrounding the campaign. According to Filitti the stickers not only deface private property but also misuse the intellectual property of major corporations. Companies targeted by the campaign, including Starbucks and McDonald’s, have yet to respond publicly. Filitti emphasized the importance of pursuing legal action against the activist. 'These actions constitute vandalism and the deliberate spreading of disinformation. Companies must hold those responsible accountable in court,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjar5jwh1l	2024-12-23T05:54:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/HyLI00xPHye/HyLI00xPHye_0_84_1242_700_0_small.jpg
Desalination plant, café resort: How IDF prepares for extended st...	The IDF has launched a seawater desalination plant in northern Gaza, producing tens of thousands of liters daily for drinking and bathing—the first of its kind in enemy territory; nearby, a retreat center offers soldiers a café, massages, Internet and hotel-style meals, boosting morale during wartime Adjacent to a newly operational seawater desalination plant designed to serve soldiers in Gaza, the IDF has constructed a small beachfront retreat for its troops. This unique respite, situated amid the devastation of enemy territory, offers soldiers a rare break from their grueling missions in the Gaza Strip. The retreat, established 14 months after the tanks and APCs of the Givati and 401st Armored Brigades first breached Gaza's gates on October 27, 2023, is an impressive haven of civilian-style comfort. Set amidst the rubble of the war-torn region, the complex includes artificial turf surrounded by modern, portable buildings. These spaces offer officers and their subordinates a chance to converse in a relaxed, private setting reminiscent of rear-base training facilities in Israel. Within the facility, soldiers have access to mental health support from counselors and remote consultations with physicians via the Tyto device, as well as on-site care from a nurse and a paramedic. The paramedic, Shami—a 64-year-old reservist and medical assistant at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center—explains, 'We have 99% of the medications they might need here. It works well.' Nearby, a physical therapist provides massages for sore backs and legs, while a mobile dental clinic, staffed by a young dentist and assistant, offers essential care. Throughout the retreat, beanbags are scattered for lounging. One soldier relaxes with an iced energy drink, while another enjoys a hot cappuccino paired with meringue cookies. Soldiers can shower and use pristine restroom facilities that feel 'just like home.' In the center of the green lawn, a long table is laden with lavish breakfasts reminiscent of a hotel buffet. For lunch and dinner, a barbecue station operates nonstop, serving more than the standard wings and hotdogs—steaks and other premium cuts are grilled to perfection. The retreat is adorned with the flags of visiting platoons and battalions, alongside a festive inflatable gateway to welcome each arriving unit. There's even a barber room where soldiers line up for haircuts from a reservist barber who left his business in Be’er Sheva to serve his fellow troops. Additional comforts include a coffee bar with a large espresso machine, popcorn and cotton candy stations, and a lounge offering Belgian waffles and fresh pretzels. For spiritual nourishment, soldiers can visit a corner stocked with religious texts, tefillin sets, and prayer shawls, offered in a welcoming, non-coercive manner. Hygiene kits—including deodorants, toothbrushes, toothpaste, underwear, and socks—are distributed, alongside an area to upgrade personal combat gear like kneepads and gloves. The facility’s recreation area is still a work in progress, as evidenced by the PlayStation corner currently hosting only a demo game. Meanwhile, charging stations are scattered throughout to help soldiers recharge their phones and stay connected with loved ones back home. A separate room houses efficient washing machines and dryers, allowing troops to refresh their uniforms. The crashing waves of the nearby beach provide a soothing backdrop, though soldiers are prohibited from accessing the shoreline, separated by barriers of concertina wire. Despite this, the view of the sea and the retreat's tranquil ambiance offer a much-needed escape. 'We’ve learned to cook for ourselves during combat operations, and we receive fresh meals several times a week,' describes Sergeant Yaron Rabinovitch from the Nahal Brigade’s 50th Battalion. Taking a bite of a hamburger wrap, he adds, 'Each platoon gets a day here about every 10 days. It’s rejuvenating. By the end of the third round, we get a short leave back home. This has been a game-changer.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Brigadier General Haim Malachi, the IDF's Chief Logistics Officer, who escorted me to the site in an armored jeep, shared, 'Once a platoon finishes its day of rest here, we clean and reset the facility overnight for the next group, like a production line. This is something we've never done before.' The logistics team takes pride in their efforts. Chief Warrant Officer David Turjeman, head of food services for the Southern Command, enthusiastically showcases the array of premium refreshments stored in the retreat’s refrigerators. 'You know this is Gaza, right? Yet we’ve created a sense of home here, with iced coffee, espresso, protein shakes, toast, shakshuka, fresh fruit, and even ice cream on warmer days.' The retreat also features a cutting-edge desalination plant, capable of producing 60,000 liters of drinking water daily. 'This is unprecedented in a combat zone,' notes Colonel Michael Azulai, the Southern Command’s logistics officer. 'The facility's deployment reflects our readiness for prolonged operations, even if a ceasefire is reached in the context of a hostage exchange.' On the evening of my visit, a platoon from the Nahal 50th Battalion was enjoying a break after intense fighting in Jabalia. For these troops, this is no quick incursion but part of a sustained military presence. Similar refreshment centers have been established elsewhere along Gaza's key corridors, including on the Philadelphi Route, but none match the scope and quality of this new retreat. Second Lieutenant Elishama Shpilman, a tank commander with the 401st Brigade, describes the improved working conditions: 'Instead of dealing with sand and dust in the field, we now repair tracks and replace parts on a clean, level surface. My team’s tank has covered all of Jabalia.' Sergeant Rabinovitch sums up the sentiment: 'We didn’t get a house, but the food is amazing, and the drinks are great. Last week in Jabalia, we learned to grill on our own. Overall, we’re happy.' His friend, Sergeant Daniel Vakrat, nods in agreement: 'We didn’t expect anything like this. It’s an incredible morale booster.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkxlqywh1x	2024-12-23T05:39:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/SkNh3W0HBJl/SkNh3W0HBJl_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

King Charles to deliver Christmas message from former hospital ch...	King Charles will deliver his traditional Christmas Day message from a former hospital chapel, Buckingham Palace said on Monday, in a break from tradition and a nod to the British monarch's ongoing treatment for cancer. In February, the palace revealed the 76-year-old, who became king in 2022, had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer detected in tests after a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate. Last week, a palace source said his treatment was moving in a positive direction and would continue into next year. For his annual pre-recorded Christmas Day broadcast to be aired on Wednesday, Charles has selected the Fitzrovia Chapel, an ornate former church on the site of a former hospital in central London. Last year, Charles delivered his message from Buckingham Palace. The Daily Telegraph, which had earlier learned of the location, reported that Charles himself had chosen the chapel as he faced his own health issues. A source told the paper the monarch wanted his message to feel fresher and more modern.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1m7fyvs1e	2024-12-23T04:45:07-08:00

After losing Syria, Iran is considering turning Beirut into a 'sm...	An anonymous source 'familiar with discussions in Tehran' warns in the London Times that the Islamic Republic is exploring the possibility of smuggling weapons to Hezbollah through the Lebanese capital's airport, a move that could lead to the collapse of the cease-fire Following the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Iran is now considering turning Beirut International Airport into its new smuggling hub and thus supplying weapons to Hezbollah by air, the Times of London reported Monday. According to the newspaper, the report is based on a Middle Eastern source 'familiar with discussions taking place in Tehran.' Iran was for years Syrian dictator Bashar Assad 's main ally, along with Russia, and in exchange for sending weapons and militias to help him suppress the rebels during the civil war Damascus allowed Tehran to operate freely on its territory, both to smuggle weapons to Hezbollah and to directly attack Israel from Syrian territory. Now that Assad's opponents control Damascus, and rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani promises that his country will no longer be a 'threat' to its neighbors and will not allow any non-state entity to possess weapons, Tehran has lost a critical supply route for its Shiite militia in Lebanon. The Times of London notes that flights from Tehran's international airport to Beirut resumed a few days ago, but they no longer pass through Syrian airspace. The source who spoke to the British newspaper said that Western countries 'are concerned that, having lost Damascus as its main transit point in the region for arms smuggling, it will now try to turn Beirut airport into its new logistics center, just as it did in Syria.' The source warned that such a move 'could lead to the next escalation,' and the Times noted that it would be a violation of the cease-fire agreement recently signed between Israel and Hezbollah. The Times notes, however, that a bold step such as transferring weapons to Hezbollah through Beirut airport, an act that would mean taking over Lebanon's largest civilian airport, or alternatively by sea, would involve too great a risk for Hezbollah and Iran in their current situation, after the blows they have suffered not only militarily but also in terms of image and politics. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry stated Monday morning that Tehran supports Syria's sovereignty after the fall of Assad, and emphasized that Iran currently has no direct contact with the country's new rulers. 'Our principled position regarding Syria is clear,' he said, 'and it is the need to preserve its sovereignty and integrity and allow the Syrian people to determine their future without foreign interference.' At the same time, the ministry spokesman emphasized that Syria must not become a 'den of terror.' The Iranian spokesman warned against U.S. intervention in Syria, saying that its intervention in the affairs of other countries has in the past only led to division, terrorism and undermining stability and security Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The Americans' latest statements regarding Syria reveal their intentions to control and interfere in countries. The Syrian people are capable of making decisions for themselves and determining the future of their country and its relations with other countries,' he said. At the same time, the Russian news agency Tass reported Monday morning that an official Russian delegation, led by deputy prime ministers Alexei Overchuk and Vitaly Savelev arrived in Tehran for a visit. According to the report, during the visit they will meet with anian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The delegation's visit comes against the backdrop of intensified military cooperation between the two countries, which is reflected, among other things, in the mass of drones that Tehran has supplied to Moscow for its war in Ukraine, but also the severe strategic blow they suffered with the fall of the Assad regime.

Assad's wife 'did not ask for a divorce', Russia asserts	Turkish media reports that Russia has frozen Assad's assets and restricted his movements, and this led his wife to file an official divorce petition wit the court in a bid to leave for Britain; Kremlin strongly rejects the report: They 'do not correspond to reality' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied on Monday reports that the wife of fugitive Syrian dictator Bashar Assad has filed for divorce and is leaving Russia for London, and that Russian authorities have imposed travel restrictions on him and frozen his assets. At a press conference Monday morning, Peskov said that these reports 'do not correspond to reality.' Russia, was Assad's main ally, and in the middle of the last decade it mobilized to help his regime through a bombing campaign that seemed to have subdued the rebels and secured the dictator's future. When Assad's opponents launched a surprise attack on his forces last month, this time while Russia was mired in the war in Ukraine, Moscow failed to save him again, and at the last minute it evacuated him to its territory through its air force base in western Syria. Russian President Vladimir Putin later granted political asylum to him, his wife Asma, and their three children – sons Hafez, 24, and Karim, 21, and daughter Zain, 22. On Sunday, Turkish media reported that, although the Syrian dictator has been granted asylum in Moscow, he is under close surveillance by the authorities there and is prohibited from leaving the Russian capital or engaging in any political activity. The reports also claimed that Assad's extensive assets have been frozen by the Russian government, a fact that further harms his quality of life and that of his family. Against this backdrop, Turkish media reported, Asma Assad filed a formal request with a Russian court to divorce her husband, leave the country and travel to her homeland, Britain. Asma Assad holds British citizenship, and only moved to Syria in 2000, when she married the dictator, a few months after he came to power. At a press conference Monday morning, the Kremlin spokesman denied all these reports. After the overthrow of Assad's regime earlier this month, foreign media reported that the U.S. State Department estimated that the fortune of the ousted president and his wife was around $2 billion, spread across a variety of bank accounts, shell companies, tax havens and real estate ventures across the globe, so it is likely that they still have access to vast sums of money. In addition, it was reported that Assad's extended family owns at least 20 apartments in Moscow, and that their net worth is close to $40 million. The reports in Turkey raise the question of whether his access to money and assets is now blocked, and where exactly he is staying in the Russian capital. The move to Russia comes at a difficult time for the Assad family, not only because of the humiliating escape from Syria. In May of this year, Asma announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer for a second time, this time leukemia, and that she would be required to isolate herself and absent from events and activities. Her announcement comes almost five years after she announced that she had recovered from breast cancer, a disease that the Arab world followed closely during her illness. Some are now wondering whether Asma Assad will receive her treatments in Russia. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last week, after more than eight days of silence, the ousted dictator Assad made his first official statement about his whereabouts in Russia. A message posted on his office's Telegram channel claimed that he had not fled Syria at all, but had first tried to travel to the Syrian city of Latakia to 'monitor the fighting from there,' and that he had been forced to evacuate to Russia only because there was no way to leave the attacked Russian air base where he was staying, and because an order had come from Moscow to evacuate people from the facility. In a statement he issued, Assad emphasized that he was the man who, from the first day of the Syrian civil war, 'refused to negotiate to save his country for personal gain or to compromise on the future of his people,' and that just as he ' never abandoned the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon and did not betray the allies who stood by me, there is no chance that such a man would abandon his people or betray the army and his country.' In his statement, he claimed that, by supporting his opponents, the world was in effect presenting terrorists as a revolutionary movement that was vying for his favor, and expressed hope 'that Syria would once again be free and independent.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj4mm6lrke	2024-12-23T02:17:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/HyPrSx1141l/HyPrSx1141l_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

Biden commutes sentences of 37 of 40 inmates on federal death row	U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday commuted the sentences for 37 out of 40 federal inmates on death row, converting them to life in prison without parole before he hands over power to President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20. Biden's move will frustrate Trump's plan to resume a rapid pace of executions. Unlike executive orders, clemency decisions cannot be reversed by a president's successor, although the death penalty can be sought more aggressively in future cases. Trump restarted federal executions after a nearly 20-year pause during his first term in office from 2017 to 2021. Biden, who ran for president opposing the death penalty, put federal executions on hold when he took office in January 2021. In recent weeks, he has faced pressure from congressional Democrats, opponents of capital punishment and religious leaders such as Pope Francis to commute federal death sentences before he leaves. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said in a statement. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience ... I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level,' he said. 'In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryhiw68rye	2024-12-23T01:55:15-08:00	
South Korea says sees signs of North Korea preparing more troops,...	South Korea's military said on Monday it has detected signs of North Korea preparing to send more troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Pyongyang has already provided 240mm multiple rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled howitzers to Russia, and was seen preparing to produce more suicide drones to be shipped there after leader Kim Jong Un guided a test last month, according to Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). 'Suicide drones are one of the tasks that Kim Jong Un has focused on,' a JCS official said, adding that the North had expressed its intention to give them to Russia. Such drones have been widely used in the Ukraine war, and Kim ordered a mass production of the aerial weapons and an update of military theory and education, citing intensifying global competition, state media reported. Seoul, Washington and Kyiv have said there are around 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia. The JCS said at least 1,100 of them had been killed or wounded, in line with last week's briefing by South Korea's spy agency which reported some 100 deaths with another 1,000 wounded in the Kursk region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ppe6urke	2024-12-23T01:53:29-08:00	
Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq agree to stop attacking Israel, a se...	Iraq's pro-Iranian militia Al-Nujaba Movement has reached an agreement with the Iraqi prime minister to halt military operations against Israel, according to a report in Lebanon; 'The resistance will stop operations in support of Gaza and will not interfere in political changes in Syria' a senior militia official explained. Iraq's pro-Iranian militia Al-Nujaba Movement has reached an agreement with Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani to cease military operations against Israel, according to a report Monday in the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, affiliated with Hezbollah, citing a senior militia official. 'The resistance will stop military operations against Israel as part of its support for Gaza and will not interfere in political changes in Syria,' the senior official said. This came as part of a dialogue between the two sides, against the backdrop of regional and international demands to disband the militias and hand over their weapons to the state, according to the news report. The same official said that 'the factions have decided not to interfere in Syrian affairs and to monitor the situation from a distance while also awaiting the policy directions of US President-elect Donald Trump, particularly regarding the Middle East and Iran.' He added that Tehran gave them the freedom to decide regarding the Syrian arena. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7, 2023, the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, which are in very close contact with Hezbollah, have attacked Israel and began to accept responsibility for firing into its territory - as they saw themselves as another front in the Iranian axis fighting Israel 'in support of Gaza.' Even after the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect about a month ago, elements of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an organization made up of pro-Iranian militias, announced that they would continue their military activity against Israel and said that they had nothing to do with the cease-fire in Lebanon. 'At the last meeting of the resistance, it was agreed to continue attacks against Israel until it completely stops its attacks on Gaza and stops threatening to attack Iraq,' the sources said. The Islamic Resistance in Iran is a relatively new union operating over the last year, made up of several veteran militias supported by Iran: Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq, Al-Nujaba, Ansar Allah al-Awfiya and Al-Imam Ali. A trickle of drones and missiles from Iraq and Syria has been recorded in the past year, and the organization has been known to publish claims of responsibility for attacks on Israel, whether using missiles or drones, and has sometimes also published videos of the launches. There have been many times that drones fired from Iraq did not reach Israel at all, other times they were intercepted; but when they did hit they caused casualties. In October, Sgt. Daniel Aviv Haim Sofer, 19, and Corporal Tal Dror, 19, were killed in a strike by such a drone. The Iraqi government, for its part, has worked to avoid being drawn into the regional conflict, but has failed to deal with the attacks being carried out from its territory and to rein in the militias. Baghdad even turned to Washington last month, asking the Americans to intervene with Israel to prevent a response to the attacks. 'Washington was aware of the possible consequences of Israeli attacks in Iraq and promised to help,' said an Iraqi Foreign Ministry official. Four militia sources said at the time that the Hezbollah Iraqi and Al-Nujaba Brigades, two organizations within the coalition that are leading the attacks on Israel, warned Prime Minister Al-Sudani not to pressure them to stop their operations, and pledged to continue as long as Israel continues to fight in Gaza and Lebanon. The issue has created divisions among the parties in Iraq’s ruling coalition, which all support the Palestinian struggle and see Israel as an enemy, but disagree about the extent of Iraq’s involvement in the regional conflict. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has not only acted against Israel, the U.S. forces operating in bases in Iraq and Syria are another of its targets. The pro-Iranian militias are interested in removing the United States from Iraq and, in recent months, reports have also been published about progress in talks between the United States and the Iraqi government regarding the date for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country. It is not clear how true the reports are on the subject, or whether they are merely intended to calm the militias, who threaten to escalate their activities against the Americans whenever they see no progress. The organization is attacking the American bases, it claims, also because of the U.S. assistance to Israel in the Iron Swords war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkpqw2lskl	2024-12-23T01:50:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/24/Sk0sMDgRR/Sk0sMDgRR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Huge deal: Israel sells air defense system to Slovakia for 2 bill...	Barak MX Integrated Air Defense System, produced by Israel Aerospace Industries, counters threats from fighter jets, helicopters, drones and missiles; It's the largest deal ever signed between the two countries The Ministry of Defense is selling the BARAK MX Integrated Air Defense System, produced by Israel Aerospace Industries, to Slovakia for over 2 billion NIS (approximately $550 million). This is the largest defense export deal ever between the two countries. The deal, led by the Defense Exports Control Agency at the International Defense Cooperation Directorate of the Ministry of Defense (SIBAT), 'will further strengthen the bond between the two nations and enhance Slovakia's defense capabilities,' the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The BARAK MX system, which will be integrated into Slovakia's defense infrastructure, is an advanced air defense system that is designed to counter current and future aerial threats, including ballistic threats. Its operational success in Israel and around the world underscores its reliability and effectiveness, making it a valuable addition to Slovakia's defense infrastructure, according to the ministry. The system is known for its flexible capability to counter threats from various sources, including fighter jets, helicopters, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles. With three interceptors for operational ranges of 35, 70, and 150 km, each equipped with an active radar seeker, dual-pulse engine, and powerful warhead, the system delivers unparalleled interception performance against a wide range of threats. The deal was led by the head of SIBAT, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Yair Kulas, CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Boaz Levy, and Executive VP of Systems, Missiles, and Space Group at IAI, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Guy Barlev. It was signed on Monday by Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir at the Ministry’s headquarters in Tel Aviv During the current war, Israel has sold weapons to the world worth 13 billion shekels.

Report: Iran is considering air supply routes for its Middle East...	Iran is considering opening air supply routes for weapons for its proxies in the Middle East, the New York Times reported. According to the report, Beirut could become a hub for weapons shipments to terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. This is due to the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, which effectively cut off the land supply route for the Shiite terrorist organization. Direct flights from Tehran to Beirut resumed in recent days, but so far do not pass through Syrian airspace.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk7awjls1g	2024-12-22T23:40:52-08:00	
Shock in New York: Man sets passenger who fell asleep on subway t...	Man caught on video 'calmly' walking toward a woman who was dozing in a subway car and set her on fire; He then sat on a bench across the street and watched the scene; Boys recognized him hours later and the man, identified as an immigrant from Guatemala, was arrested New York City police announced Sunday they have in custody a 'person of interest' in the early morning death of a woman who they believe may have fallen asleep on a stationary subway train before being intentionally lit on fire by a man she didn’t know. Transit police apprehended the suspect, identified as an immigrant from Guatemala who came to the U.S. in 2018, after receiving a report from three high school students who had recognized the man. They had seen images of the suspect taken from surveillance and police body cam video and widely distributed by police. 'New Yorkers came through again,' said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who described the case as 'one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.' Tisch said the suspect and the woman, both of whom have not been identified, were riding a subway train without any interaction between them to the end of the line in Brooklyn at around 7:30 a.m. After the train came to a stop, surveillance video from the subway car showed the man 'calmly' walk up to the victim, who was seated motionless, possibly sleeping, and set her clothing on fire with what appeared to be a lighter. The woman’s clothing then 'became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,' Tisch said. Officers on a routine patrol at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station smelled and saw smoke and discovered the woman on fire, standing in the middle of the subway car. After the fire was extinguished, emergency medical personnel declared the woman dead at the scene. Unbeknownst to the officers, the suspect had remained at the scene and was seated on a bench on the subway platform, just outside the train car, Tisch said. Body cameras worn by the officers caught a 'very clear, detailed look' at the suspect and those images were publicly disseminated. After later receiving a 911 call from the teenagers, other transit officers identified the man on another subway train and radioed ahead to the next station, where more officers kept the train doors closed, searched each car and ultimately apprehended him without incident, said Chief of Transit Joseph Gulotta. The man had a lighter in his pocket when he was taken into custody, Tisch said. Gulotta said the investigation was continuing, including whether the woman was homeless and the background of the suspect. The case marked the second fatality on a New York subway Sunday. At 12:35 a.m., police responded to an emergency call for an assault in progress at the 61st Street-Woodside Station in Queens and found a 37-year-old man with a stab wound to his torso and a 26-year-old man with multiple slashes throughout his body. The older man was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital while the younger man was in stable condition, police said. An investigation was continuing. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul this year has sent New York National Guard members to the city’s subway system to help police conduct random searches of riders’ bags for weapons following a series of high-profile crimes on city trains. Hochul recently deployed additional members to help patrol during the holiday season. About a year ago, Hochul supported funding to install video cameras on every train car in the New York subway system, said Michael Kemper, chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He and other officials on Sunday credited the cameras with helping to track down the suspect so quickly.

President-elect Donald Trump has been promising his voters for years to stop the flow of illegal infiltrators into the country, and during his election campaign he vowed to carry out the 'largest deportation of immigrants in history.' Throughout the campaign, he and his supporters highlighted murders and rapes committed by immigrants, including that of Laken Riley , a 22-year-old student from Georgia who was murdered by a Venezuelan immigrant. The New York City subway system sees about 4 million ridership trips each day, and while crime is relatively rare, horrific murders occur every year. As of November 2024, there have been nine murders on the New York City subway system this year, compared to five during the same period last year. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjfgp9uhkl	2024-12-22T23:38:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/SkWPr5IByg/SkWPr5IByg_51_33_2129_1198_0_small.jpg

IDF prepares to stay on Syrian Mount Hermon for the whole winter	Military constructing bases at two elevations on Syrian soil, incorporating hypothermia treatment rooms and reinforced structures to withstand heavy snow loads; Teams working urgently to complete the bases before the first snowstorm hits The IDF is in the midst of an intricate logistical operation, racing against the clock to establish military outposts at high altitudes on Mount Hermon before the arrival of the season’s first snowstorm, according to a report on Monday. The IDF’s Technological and Logistics Directorate has opened access routes to the Syrian summit, facilitating the transport of tons of construction materials and equipment. According to the plan, the IDF will maintain a military presence on Syrian Mount Hermon – which borders Lebanon – at least until the end of the current winter. Two primary outposts are being constructed on Syrian soil. The first, located at an elevation of 2,400 meters (7,874 feet), will feature specially reinforced modular buildings designed to house troops even under snow accumulations of up to six meters (nearly 20 feet). At 2,800 meters (9,186 feet), near the peak of Syrian Mount Hermon, another base is being prepared. This new site will serve as a hub for IDF forces and is modeled after a Syrian military outpost abandoned by Assad regime troops approximately two weeks ago. IDF logistics teams are renovating the compound, cleaning, painting, repairing infrastructure and equipping it with essential facilities, including communications systems, living quarters, food storage containers and a massive water tank capable of holding 20,000 liters. To combat freezing conditions, specialized de-icing systems are being installed to ensure military equipment and tools remain operational in subzero temperatures. The IDF also plans to deploy a newly acquired snow-melting machine, a technique inspired by foreign armies operating in similar extreme conditions. The goal is to sustain both operational and logistical functionality in temperatures as low as -10°C (14°F), even under a potential prolonged supply cutoff due to severe weather. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: To meet these demands, the IDF’s Logistics Brigade has dispatched teams from its Southern and Central commands to Syrian Mount Hermon. Working around the clock, including night shifts, the teams are reinforcing critical structures to withstand the heavy weight of snow accumulation. Additionally, the IDF is equipping the outposts with hypothermia treatment rooms to provide swift and effective care to soldiers without requiring evacuation. Kitchens, gas cylinders for on-site cooking, and an ample stockpile of dry, frozen and canned food are being prepared to ensure readiness for any prolonged isolation scenario. A broader winter preparedness initiative is already underway for troops in the Golan Heights, recently captured by the IDF. Thousands of specialized cold-weather items, including ski masks, snow boots, three sets of thermal uniforms, insulated overalls and tactical gloves, are being distributed to soldiers. For accommodations, the IDF has opted to station troops in fortified outposts, supplementing them with portable living containers equipped with heating and generators to ensure comfort in harsh conditions. As the operation unfolds, the IDF remains focused on completing these critical preparations before the region’s weather deteriorates further, safeguarding both the operational effectiveness and welfare of its soldiers in this strategic, high-altitude terrain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjryhyubyx	2024-12-22T22:33:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/yk14196271/yk14196271_0_84_946_532_0_small.jpg

Mossad agents reveal details of exploding pager operation against...	Now they'll have to guess what the next step is'; Two recently retired Mossad agents gave a behind-the-scenes look at the operation that sent thousands of Hezbollah operatives tot he hospital in an interview on the US investigative news magazine '60 Minutes'; 'We created a pretend world' Two recently retired senior Israeli intelligence agents shared new details about a deadly clandestine operation years in the making that targeted Hezbollah terrorist operatives in Lebanon and Syria using exploding pagers and walkie talkies. The former Mossad agents appeared overnight between Sunday and Monday on the CBS investigative news magazine '60 Minutes' to provide behind-the-scenes information about Operation Pager, that ended three months ago by causing injuries to thousands of Hezbollah operatives. Journalist Lesley Stahl held one of the alleged pagers prepared by the Mossad during the interview. The agents, who according to the network were among those who led the operation, spoke to her masked, their voices distorted, and described how they carried out the operation that began a decade ago - first by selling thousands of walkie-talkies to the organization and then pagers, all of which were planted with explosives. The Mossad began the operation based on walkie-talkies, with the idea that Hezbollah operatives would carry them in their vests - close to their chest and heart. One of the agents, using the pseudonym 'Michael,' said that Hezbollah had purchased 16,000 devices manufactured by the Mossad 'at a good price.' 'We created a pretend world,' said the officer. 'We are a global production company. We write the screenplay, we're the directors, we're the producers, we're the main actors, and the world is our stage. He noted that the price 'couldn't be too low or they'd be suspicious.' The Mossad also had to conceal its involvement in the sale and ensure that the radios could not be linked to Israel, so shell companies were set up to infiltrate the supply chain. As the use of these types of radios became less common, the agents said, the operation to distribute another, more advanced device began. The intelligence organization discovered that Hezbollah was buying pagers from a Taiwanese company called Gold Apollo, which was unaware of the explosives being inserted into the devices. The second agent, who went by the pseudonym 'Gabriel,' told of the day he presented the pager to Mossad head Dedi Barnea - one that had been enlarged to accommodate explosives. 'He was furious, he was telling us, 'There is no chance that anyone will buy such a big device. It's not comfortable in their pocket. It's heavy,'' he said. Barnea sent 'Gabriel' to redesign it, but eventually the second agent convinced the Mossad head that it would work and the device would be purchased as is. The Mossad hired the marketing manager of Gold Apollo to offer Hezbollah an upgrade to the existing devices. 'When they are buying from us, they have zero clue that they are buying from the Mossad. We make like 'Truman Show,' everything is controlled by us behind the scene. In their experience, everything is normal. Everything was 100% kosher including businessman, marketing, engineers, showroom, everything,' according to Gabriel. By September 2024, Hezbollah had already purchased about 5,000 pagers. 'We have an incredible array of possibilities of creating foreign companies that have no way being traced back to Israel. Shell companies over shell companies to affect the supply chain to our favor,' said agent Michael. The devices were advertised as high-end products, with upgrades, new features, and water resistance. For marketing purposes, fake YouTube advertisements were created, showing the device in a glass of water, covered in soil, and they were touted as having a very long battery life. 'It become the best product in the beeper area in the world,' said Gabriel. Stahl asked if they had been approached by other customers, not just from Hezbollah. Gabriel said that the shell company received several requests from potential customers. 'Obviously we didn't send to anyone. We just quote them with expensive price,' he said. The Mossad conducted experiments on dummies wearing padded gloves, in order to plan the amount of explosives that would only harm the person carrying the pager and not those around them, according to Gabriel, who emphasized that the plan was meant to harm only Hezbollah members and not anyone near them. The devices had no intelligence capabilities and could not be used for surveillance, only as small bombs. This is a very stupid device by nature. This is the reason they're using it. There's almost no way how to tap it. It's only receiving messages and-- several grams of explosive,' Gabriel explained. The agents said the Mossad looked at several options for the pager’s ringtones. They wanted to find a sound that would compel the owner of the device to take it out of his pocket. The intelligence agency also looked at how long it took a person to answer a pager, finding it to be an average of seven seconds. The person who gave the order to carry out the operation on September 17 was the head of the Mossad, Barnea, after learning that Hezbollah might be suspicious of the devices. In total, the explosion of the pagers and radios killed about 30 people, including two children, and injured about 3,000. Two days after the pager attack, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed on September 27, gave a speech that 60 minutes described as 'subdued,' in contrast to his other speeches. 'If you look at his eyes, he was defeated. He already lose the war. And his soldier look at him during that speech. And they saw a broken leader. And this was the tipping point of the war,' agent Gabriel said. The retired Mossad agent also said that some of the people who were close to Nasrallah in the bunker were carrying the beepers on the day of the attack. According to him, 'With his in own eyes, he saw them collapsing.' The interviewer asked in response: 'How do you know?' Gabriel replied: 'It's a strong rumor.' The agents were asked if the Mossad plan had achieved its goal. 'The aim, it wasn't killing Hezbollah terrorists,' Gabriel explains. 'If he just dead, so he's dead. But if he's wounded, you have to take him to the hospital, take care of him. You need to invest money and efforts. And those people without hands and eyes are living proof, walking in Lebanon, of 'don't mess with us.' They are walking proof of our superiority all around the Middle East.' The day after the pagers exploded, people were afraid to turn on the air conditioners in Lebanon because they were afraid that they would explode. So there was-- there is real fear,' agent Michael noted. We want them to feel vulnerable, which they are. We can't use the pagers again because we already did that. We've already moved on to the next thing. And they'll have to keep on trying to guess what the next thing is.' 'Michael' said that, following the operation, 'the wind was taken out of Hezbollah's fight,' and expressed hope that the situation in Lebanon will influence Hamas and the release of the hostages in Gaza. 'They're looking at their sides and they're seeing no one next to them. They are completely isolated now.'

In the program's promo, it was noted that it was one of the 'largest operations in contemporary history,' in which 'an intelligence organization achieves the feat of an entire army.' The pager operation was launched on September 17, amid fears that it would soon be discovered. On the first day of the operation, the pagers of Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon and Syria exploded - and the next day, on September 18, their walkie-talkies also exploded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwwt00isyg	2024-12-22T22:00:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/HkSJFnWH1g/HkSJFnWH1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

What about Syria? The hypocrisy behind the world’s selective outr...	Comment: If you remained silent on Assad’s torture you are hypocritical and racist Following the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, new evidence of his crimes against humanity is coming to light—evidence that should prompt anyone with a moral conscience to ask: Why didn’t we do more? While the international media, human rights groups, and the UN focused their criticism on Israel during the Gaza war, the atrocities committed by Assad were largely ignored. It seems the absence of Jewish involvement meant there was little coverage: 'No Jews, no news.' The Scale of Devastation Since the Syrian Civil War began in 2011, more than 6 million Syrians have been displaced, and over 580,000 have been killed. Among the victims were 4,000 Palestinians from the Yarmouk refugee camp, which Assad attacked, displacing 100,000 more. Where were the emergency UN sessions on the plight of these Palestinians? Where were the campus protests, 24/7 media coverage, or marches against this mass slaughter of Arabs? Chemical Weapons and Torture Assad’s regime violated international law by repeatedly using chemical weapons such as mustard gas, chlorine gas, and sarin gas against civilians. The regime also operated over 100 detention centers, holding hundreds of thousands of prisoners in inhumane conditions. In Sednaya Prison, known as the 'slaughterhouse,' detainees endured mass executions, electrocution, whipping, rape, mutilation, and sleep deprivation. Women who were raped were forced to give birth and raise their children in prison cells—children who had never seen sunlight until a few weeks ago. Today, countless Syrians remain missing, and mass graves, including graves holding over 100,000 victims, are still being discovered. The UN’s Response The UN has long been aware of these crimes. Despite evidence of chemical weapons use and other atrocities, in 2022, the UN Human Rights Council praised Assad’s human rights record. Between 2015 and 2022, the UN General Assembly passed 125 resolutions condemning Israel, compared to just nine against Syria. Incredibly, days before Assad’s fall, the UN demanded that Israel return the Golan Heights to his regime. All the while, Assad’s government held a position within the UN responsible for upholding human rights. Silence from Human Rights Groups and Media Early in the civil war, organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International addressed the situation in Syria. However, they have since shifted focus, channeling significant resources into campaigns labeling Israel an apartheid state or accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Amnesty International even invented a new definition of genocide solely to smear Israel. The media’s performance has been no better. Assad’s crimes received relatively little coverage compared to the intense scrutiny placed on Israel during the Gaza war, even as thousands of Arabs languished in Assad’s prisons. The Hypocrisy of Selective Outrage While the UN and media consistently scrutinize Israel, Assad was allowed to commit atrocities without accountability. If you remained silent on Assad’s torture and slaughter of Arabs throughout his rule but express outrage over Israel’s legal actions in Gaza, conducted in accordance with international law, then your stance is not pro-Palestinian or anti-war—it is simply hypocritical and racist.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy11ugw8byg	2024-12-22T19:17:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/BJsW11cMNyg/BJsW11cMNyg_0_194_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Guatemalan authorities raid Lev Tahor Cult, rescue 160 children f...	There is suspicion of possible crimes of human trafficking and other offences,' according to the regional prosecutor Guatemalan authorities raided the Lev Tahor community over the weekend, rescuing 160 children and teens following allegations of rape, human trafficking, forced marriage, and other forms of abuse. Lev Tahor, known as an extremist Jewish cult, was founded in 1988 in Israel and settled in Guatemala between 2014 and 2017. The operation was supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which had been assisting Guatemalan authorities in their investigation since the escape of four minors in November. 'There is suspicion of possible crimes of human trafficking and other offences, specifically in the form of forced pregnancy, abuse against minors, and rape,' said regional prosecutor Dimas Jimenez. 'It is suspected that these crimes were committed by a member of the community called Lev Tahor against minors belonging to that community.' Authorities also reported finding suspected remains of a child on the premises during the raid. In addition to the children, 40 women were rescued. The operation involved dozens of police officers and social workers. Lev Tahor has a long history of legal trouble. In 2021, two cult leaders were convicted in New York for kidnapping and child sexual exploitation. In 2022, the cult’s leader was arrested in Mexico, and children were rescued from the group’s compound. This latest intervention highlights ongoing international efforts to dismantle Lev Tahor’s network and protect vulnerable individuals from exploitation.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syv5evib1g	2024-12-22T19:04:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/rJsVWw8SJx/rJsVWw8SJx_1_60_801_451_0_small.jpg
People in the media often message me saying, 'That was amazing—I...	Australian journalist Erin Molan has emerged as a powerful voice for Israel; speaking to Ynetnews, she shares about the impact of the October 7 Hamas attack on her life and the challenges of countering distorted media narratives; 'They're scared that they might get threats—I'm much more worried about a world that allows terrorism to flourish' Amid rising anti-Israel sentiment in the global media, one voice has stood out: Erin Molan, a former Australian sports journalist turned advocate for truth and justice. Molan, who is visiting Israel for the first time, has emerged as a staunch defender of the country, challenging global narratives with clarity and conviction, often at great personal cost. Molan, best known in Australia as the first woman to host the Footy Show and a prominent figure in sports media, had little prior connection to Israel or its politics. 'I had to ask someone what the kippah was called just two months ago,' she admitted in an interview with Ynetnews. 'I have no association or affiliation, I have no bias, I have no agenda, I'm not Jewish, I'm not from Israel. Anything that you could possibly think of to come at me with won't work. I am an Australian who's never been here before. Now I have a lot of Jewish friends, but before October 7, I had one school mom friend, and I really didn't know anyone else in the Jewish community that well. What I do is speak the truth, and I stand up for what is right. It blows my mind that the rest of the world doesn't see it as clearly as I do, and it scares me as well.' Her advocacy began after the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel which left over 1,200 people and saw 251 people taken hostage, sparking the ongoing war against the terrorist group in the Gaza Strip. The horrors of that day resonated deeply with Molan, who saw parallels with her late father, Major General Jim Molan, a highly respected Australian military leader and former senator who passed away months before the Hamas onslaught. She describes waking up in the middle of that fateful night with her young daughter beside her, the horrifying news of the Hamas attacks in Israel compelled her to do something she hadn’t done since losing her father earlier that year—she reached for the phone to call him. 'I don't really believe in spirituality or signs or anything like that, but Dad was this incredible ally of Israel,' Molan shared. 'He came to Israel many times, and after my editorials started going viral, my mom sent me this screenshot. Dad had come to Israel in 2014 to investigate the war [Operation Protective Edge] and the headline of his investigation with a bunch of foreign retired generals was 'They put us to shame in how they conduct warfare.' As one of Australia’s most experienced military leaders, having commanded forces in Iraq and East Timor, his unwavering moral compass left an indelible mark on his daughter. 'Even when he was fighting ISIS or al-Qaeda, we would say to him as kids, 'Why do you have to follow the rules when they don't?' and Dad would say, 'if we don't follow the rules and stand up for what we believe in, what's the point? What are we fighting for? We're fighting to protect what we believe in, and if we stoop to their level, if we do what they do, if we throw away what matters to us, then there's no point. We might as well not even fight to save anything because we don't have anything.'' With her father’s principles in mind, Molan examined the events of October 7 and Israel’s response, leaving no doubt in her mind. 'There are enough experts in the world who also have no agenda who say that when it comes to minimizing civilian casualties, Israel does it almost better than anyone else in the world,' she said. 'I feel so sorry for a country that has had some of the most appalling things in the world done to it. The depravity, the evil, the horror of it, and I look at a reaction of a world that should be saying, 'What can we do to help you?' Instead, the world went, 'How can we make this your fault? How can we condemn you?' And that's crazy,' Molan said. Molan’s clear-eyed assessment and her willingness to speak out set her apart from other journalists in Australia and globally, but she also revealed a sobering reality about her industry. 'I know for a fact that a lot of people in the media will send me messages who are on different networks and who host different shows and say, 'That was amazing what you said, I wish I could do that too.' I think a lot of people are scared about the reaction,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'They're scared that they might get threats as well, they're scared that they might lose contracts or lose jobs, they're worried about polarizing themselves. I'm much more worried about a world that allows terrorism to flourish than I am about anything personal. You can have everything in the world, but if terrorism is allowed to continue at the trajectory it's going with the support of seemingly the masses in the world, particularly young people, we are completely screwed. Nothing else matters.' After her first editorial condemning the October 7 Hamas attacks, Molan said she was unprepared for the wave of backlash that followed. Molan had previously faced threats during her career as a sports broadcaster, but the response to her pro-Israel stance was on 'another level.' 'I was the first woman to host football and sport, so you can imagine some of the awful things that I would get online—people threatened to rape my unborn child, to kill me—utterly ridiculous,' she shares. 'I could never have imagined it would be so bad that I would need a police escort to go to work. I needed to give my six-year-old daughter to her father for a period of time because there were so many random but really specific death threats. There were ones about my daughter's preschool, there were ones about 'I know you go to this area, I know you live here.' I went to the police and these weren't considered to just be idiots in their mom's basements sending messages. There were pretty serious players in this space.' Family and friends suggested she avoid the topic altogether for her own safety, but Molan stood firm. 'That's not me. I'm not capable of that. I have this kind of perspective and mentality with anything—pick your hard,' she explained. 'I look at this as choosing the hard of speaking out now with the chance that it might make a difference, it might help in some tiny way to shift the narrative, which in turn will help canvas support, which in turn will help heap pressure on Hamas, which in turn will help free the hostages, end the threat, etc. or I can be silent now, and my hard will be 5-10 years down the track when terrorism, the claws of it, which we've already seen, have come to my country, have come to Europe, have come. It's not an Israeli problem. It's a problem of Australia and Europe and the U.S. and all the democratic world. It's a problem for Islamic countries, it's a problem for everyone. Everyone in the world is impacted negatively by this, and right now we can say, 'Oh, it's far away.' It's not. It's already here.' When asked about the recent surge in antisemitic incidents in Australia, including the arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue and other instances of vandalism, Molan didn’t mince words. 'It's crazy. It's very simple to explain in my opinion,' she said. 'You're always going to have people who have bad intentions. But when I look at the response of the Australian government, buying into such falsehoods and perpetuating them—they're committing genocide or Netanyahu's a war criminal— what it says to every person in Australia is that they must be evil.' Molan expressed deep disappointment in the Australian government’s response to the Middle East crisis, describing it as 'utterly disgraceful.' 'There have been moments of real national shame that I have felt us turning our back on an ally, on a country that has been incredible to us for many, many years, and it really shames me,' she said. However, she believes the gap between the Australian public and its politicians is significant. 'I genuinely believe the vast majority of Australians stand with Israel and stand against terror. The issue is that we have a very loud vocal minority, like anywhere else in the world. If we are silent, the people who are rational, who understand the conflict, who understand the difference between good and evil, then we allow way too much space for them to take up. One should not be swayed by the pro-Palestinian riots and protests. The silent majority knows the truth,' she explains. 'I used to cover car racing, and I would do an eight- or ten-hour car race and all I would put in my one-minute news package at night would be the crashes because that's the big spectacle, that's the best thing to watch, not reality. Fifty cars did not crash, including the car that won, but I'll show you those because I want you watching because it's advertising, you've got to generate engagement. I look at that with the antisemitism in Australia as well, it gets headlines. Yes, it's been horrific in so many ways, but it does not by any stretch of the imagination represent the vast majority of people in my country.' Like many modern conflicts, the war in Gaza is being fought not only on the battlefield but also in the court of global public opinion—a front where Israel has struggled, facing widespread protests, international condemnations and even arms embargoes. When asked what Israel could do differently to address global perceptions, Molan responded with a mix of frustration and clarity. 'I look at what you went through on October 7,' she says, 'for a country to have to think, 'We need a PR strategy for this.' is absolutely batshit crazy. You suffered the worst loss of life since the Holocaust. It wasn't just killing people; it was evil, malicious torture. It was children watching their parents die and then burned alive. I can't comprehend the level of depravity that I witnessed in those videos and at those sites, and the world wants you to figure out a plan to come out looking like the good people? 'The vast majority see this for what it is, but when you've got algorithms, social media, when you've got very rich, influential countries that wish you harm, who support terrorism, putting millions and billions of dollars into this space, the issue is not your lack of good PR. You as a country and a people don't need PR. You were massacred by evil terrorists. You need the evil players to stop being able to do what they do, which is attempt to mindwash the masses.' Molan also shared a poignant moment from her advocacy journey. 'A regular bloke, and he's Australian, he's not Jewish, wrote to me, 'My morals haven't changed and my values haven't changed, but after watching your clips, the side that I now know they align with has.' How powerful is that? It's just a shift where people go, 'I care about kids in Gaza.' The way to save them is to stop the terrorists, not condemning Israel or flying the flags of Hamas in the streets or at your university, or at our Christmas celebration. The way to save the kids that we all apparently care about is to eradicate the terrorists who are killing them.' Molan argues that the coverage of the war in Gaza in Australian media often misses the mark, leaving critical truths overshadowed by misleading narratives that many Australians, occupied by their everyday lives, lack the time or resources to dig deeper into. 'I was in the car the other day driving and the start of the ABC bulletin was something to the effect of, 'We are on day 400 and something of Israel's illegal invasion of Gaza,'' she said. 'It wasn't an illegal invasion. The terrorists came in and murdered over 1,000 people and stole people, 100 of whom are still there. Israel's trying to get its people back and trying to stop the terrorists from doing the same thing over and over and over. But if you're just listening to that, and you're not as engaged, then that's your narrative. 'People quote the death toll as though it is fact rather than saying these are Hamas numbers. What they should say is 'we're not saying they're not right, but they're not renowned for being particularly accurate people.' I watch news shows that spout as fact things that are not true. I feel like the mainstream media has gone absolutely crazy. Molan has faced speculation about whether her outspoken support for Israel played a role in her dismissal from Sky News Australia earlier this month. However, she says making that link 'wouldn’t make sense' given other staunch pro-Israeli voices on the network. Although the experience was initially 'gut-wrenching,' Molan is looking ahead and exploring new platforms and opportunities. 'I feel this incredible sense of gratitude, hope and excitement. I feel like this is a blessing in disguise. I'm so excited about what's to come,' she concludes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjclegusye	2024-12-22T15:01:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/SJCgHQIHkl/SJCgHQIHkl_0_40_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israel tells Syria it won't accept Jihadist presence in southern ...	Message sent to de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa stresses Israel intends to maintain its security and will consider leaving buffer zone should stable government be established Jerusalem issued a message to Syria’s de factor leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani) saying any attempt by jihadists to move to the country’s south won’t be tolerated. The message further clarified that if a responsible governmental authority forms in Syria, Israel might consider transferring control of the buffer zone to it. Until then, Israel will continue to ensure its own security. This comes a week after al-Sharaa said he had no intention of clashing with Israel. A few days later, al-Sharaa said that Syria would adhere to the disengagement agreement signed in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. He called on the international community to ensure that Israel remains committed to the agreement as well. Meanwhile, Jerusalem added in its message to Syria's new leadership that the Israeli military's presence in the buffer zone is motivated by defense and security concerns, particularly in preparation for potential incidents like those of October 7, 2023, originating from Syria. 'We won’t allow that to happen,' officials in Jerusalem stressed. During a recent Security Cabinet meeting held at the IDF Northern Command, participants discussed the situation in Syria and Lebanon, delving into security briefings they received. Israel understands that the rebels are trying to present a specific image to the Western world, but Jerusalem remains vigilant regarding developments in Syria. The deterioration of security on the Syrian side since the fall of Assad's regime prompted Israeli forces to advance into the buffer zone between the two countries to neutralize threats. According to Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen network, Israeli forces have established seven permanent positions along the buffer zone in rural areas of Damascus, Daraa and Quneitra. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The report noted that two of these positions, located in the Mount Hermon area, 'overlook Damascus and its western suburbs.' Syrian channels have regularly reported on the Israeli military's advances toward Syrian villages, interactions with the local population and operations at various sites near the border in recent weeks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjza311irje	2024-12-22T13:40:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/SJ119dg8H1l/SJ119dg8H1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Iranian discontent brews amid crippling power shortage	Analysis: Iran's devastating economic situation threatens to push frustrated population further amid losses to Hezbollah and fall of Assad regime Iran is facing significant distress these days. Hezbollah’s beating from Israel, the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House next month are increasing the pressure on Theran’s leadership. If that weren't enough, domestic developments — particularly the economic situation — are exacerbating internal unrest, which could spark popular uprisings at any moment. The country is struggling with a power shortage and cannot meet demand amid the harsh winter sweeping Iran. President Masoud Pezeshkian's remarks have only fueled public anger and underscored the Iranian leadership's detachment from the everyday lives of ordinary citizens. Earlier this month, the president suggested Iranians 'dress warmly' at home, as he does, instead of trying to use heating. Just days ago, he urged citizens to lower their heating by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6°F) to reduce electricity consumption. The backlash on social media has been severe and critical. The worsening electricity crisis has led authorities to take several measures, including closing schools, government offices and shopping centers, as well as turning off streetlights on highways and in urban areas. Iran’s electricity sector relies primarily (85%) on natural gas, but decreased production has forced authorities to increasingly use diesel-powered stations — a pollutant that raises urban air pollution to dangerous levels. Iranian officials blame international sanctions on the gas and oil sector for the crisis, but others argue that mismanagement and the Ayatollah regime's skewed priorities have brought Iran’s electricity industry to the brink of collapse. Misguided priorities The regime’s distorted priorities tie closely to the Assad regime’s collapse and the severe blow to the Shiite axis Iran has cultivated in the region over recent years. Despite sanctions against it, Iran has managed to generate annual revenues of $35–45 billion from its oil and gas sector in recent years. Instead of using these revenues to improve infrastructure, including in the energy sector, the Ayatollah regime has diverted billions of dollars to failing projects such as bolstering Assad's rule and into Hezbollah. These investments have gone to waste and the Iranian public is starting to ask questions. At a press briefing held this week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei was asked about the 'lost funds' Iran invested in Syria, estimated at approximately $50 billion. Beyond military aid, Iran has provided Syria with oil and established industrial projects, such as a car assembly plant, under strategic cooperation agreements with Assad's regime. Baghaei claimed that the reported investment figure was 'exaggerated,' yet he declined to specify the actual value of resources Iran funneled to Syria over the past 13 years to keep Assad in power. As Iran's internal struggles worsen, the issue of investing in the Shiite axis will continue to surface in public discourse. Economic turmoil Geopolitical developments have also led to an unprecedented plunge in the Iranian currency’s value. This week, the black-market exchange rate for the U.S. dollar reached approximately 780,000 Iranian rials. For comparison, the exchange rate stood at roughly 703,000 rials on the day Trump was re-elected. The Iranian rial’s rapid depreciation stems from public fear of what’s to come, prompting many to place their trust in the U.S. dollar. Another contributing factor to the rial’s drop was a change in the Central Bank of Iran’s exchange rate policy, allocating dollars to traders based on the free-market rate instead of a fixed rate. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Nonetheless, the central bank injected $200 million into the market this week, slightly lowering the rate to 766,000 rials. It’s difficult to predict Iran’s next steps given the growing internal crisis. The Iranian leadership is split between the 'moderate' camp, represented by Pezeshkian who advocates for a new nuclear agreement with the West to ease sanctions and improve the economy and the ultra-conservative faction close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, which believes now is the right time to accelerate uranium enrichment on the path to developing a nuclear bomb. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1xjmw8h1l	2024-12-22T12:44:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/ByltYpPWH1x/ByltYpPWH1x_419_1_2176_1224_0_small.jpg

Go for the head': Mossad chief urges strike on Iran over Yemen a...	David Barnea recommends at high-level discussions targeting Iran in response to missile and drone launches of Yemeni militia; Netanyahu vows decisive action against Houthis Mossad Director David Barnea has recommended targeting Iran rather than the Houthis in response to recent missile attacks on Israel, arguing that Israel should 'go for the head, Iran,' officials familiar with recent high-level discussions told Ynet on Sunday. A report in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat cited Israeli security sources who believe the Houthis operate with relative independence but receive significant Iranian support, including funding, equipment, expertise and missile guidance. Recent investigations revealed that missiles launched by the Houthis toward Israel featured advanced technologies, such as extended fuel capacities, allowing them to hover over targets longer and complicating interception. Israel's Arrow missile defense system reportedly struggled to counter these missiles effectively. Israeli political sources also disclosed ongoing efforts to convince the U.S. to launch a dual military operation targeting both Houthi forces in Yemen and Iran. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday decisive action against Houthi missile attacks on Israel. Speaking after a meeting of the Security Cabinet in the IDF Northern Command, Netanyahu linked the Houthis to Iran’s 'Axis of Evil' and emphasized international cooperation against their actions. 'As we have acted decisively against other terror arms of Iran’s Axis of Evil, we will act against the Houthis,' Netanyahu said. 'In this case, we are not acting alone. The U.S. and other nations see the Houthis as a threat not only to international shipping but to the global order.' He assured Israelis that, despite potential delays, the results would mirror Israel’s successes against other terror groups. 'I ask citizens to remain patient and steadfast, as you have so far,' he added. 'Follow Home Front Command guidelines closely. You do that, and we will take care of everything else.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ahead of the Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu and ministers reviewed a display of weapons seized by Israeli forces in southern Lebanese villages during ground operations. The briefing, led by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Northern Command head Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, highlighted the discovery of Hezbollah weapons and ammunition stored in private homes. Netanyahu also visited a mock tunnel designed to replicate command centers found during operations in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the U.S. military confirmed that an F/A-18 fighter jet was damaged by 'friendly fire' during an operation against Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday. The two pilots were rescued, with one sustaining minor injuries. The Houthis claimed responsibility for downing the aircraft, saying their forces repelled the attack on their positions in Sanaa. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree asserted that their forces had also targeted the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier and its associated destroyers using eight cruise missiles and 17 drones during simultaneous operations. Saree claimed the attack forced the carrier group to retreat and vowed continued action as long as the Gaza war persists. Overnight Saturday, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen struck Tel Aviv after evading Israeli interception attempts, directly wounding 16 people and injuring 21 others as they sought shelter. The IDF confirmed an investigation into the failure of the missile defense systems and said that lessons learned are already being implemented to improve both interception capabilities and early warning systems. 'The air defense array is not airtight,' the IDF said. 'We urge the public to continue following Home Front Command directives to ensure safety.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byne3j8byl	2024-12-22T11:02:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/20/ryuFJNzoC/ryuFJNzoC_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg
Pope says Israel 'machine-gunning children' in Gaza	Pontiff continues to condemn Israel's actions against Hamas, equating them to war crimes; Foreign Ministry rebukes claims Pope Francis continued to escalate his criticism of Israel, accusing it of 'machine-gunning of children' and carrying out the 'bombing of schools and hospitals' in Gaza during his weekly mass on Sunday. The pontiff's remarks came just a day after he condemned Israel following an airstrike in Gaza that killed seven children from one family. 'Yesterday, children were bombed. This is cruelty. This is not war. I wanted to say this because it touches the heart,' he told members of the Holy See's government. Israeli officials have accused Pope Francis of causing 'significant damage' to Israel’s standing in the Christian world and alleged a double standard in the Vatican's approach to the country. In a pointed statement, the Foreign Ministry responded to his comments, saying, 'Cruelty is terrorists hiding behind children while trying to murder Israeli children. Cruelty is holding 100 hostages for 442 days, including babies and children, and abusing them. 'Unfortunately, the pope chose to ignore all of this, as well as the fact that Israel's actions targeted terrorists using children as human shields. His remarks are particularly disappointing as they are disconnected from the true and factual context of Israel’s fight against jihadist terrorism—a multi-front war that was forced upon it starting on October 7.' Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli sharply criticized those comments in an unusual open letter published by Italian newspaper Il Foglio on Friday. Chikli said the pope's remarks amounted to a 'trivialization' of the term genocide. 'As a nation that lost six million of its people in the Holocaust, we have a unique sensitivity to the misuse of the term 'genocide' — a misuse that brings us closer to Holocaust denial,' he wrote. The Vatican has intensified its criticism of Israel in recent months, abandoning even a pretense of balance — signaling a concerning policy shift by the pope. His recent stance stands in contrast to the Holy See's modern tradition of neutrality. Recently, he published a book suggesting an examination of whether the situation in Gaza 'meets the technical definition of genocide,' an accusation Israel vehemently denies. At the end of September, the pope also criticized Israel's 'immoral use of force' in Gaza and Lebanon. The Vatican has recognized the State of Palestine and maintained diplomatic relations with it since 2013 while supporting a two-state solution. Henrique Zimmermann, an Israeli journalist reporting for international media and a close associate of the pope, has met him seven times in the past three months. 'I spoke to him about it and told him why I believe he's making a big mistake by saying what's happening in Gaza is genocide. He told me I was right,' Zimmermann said. 'He said he never accused Israel of genocide. He said he was asked whether he thought it was genocide and he replied that experts should determine that — not him.' Regarding the pope's participation in the event featuring Jesus in a cradle with a keffiyeh, Zimmermann explained, 'The installation was created by the Bethlehem community and I don't think the pope even noticed the keffiyeh.' 'There was a justified outcry in the Jewish world after the event, including from his close friends. Rabbis from Argentina, who've been his friends for 30 years, pointed out, 'You know better than anyone that Jesus is Jewish, not Palestinian.' So the pope ordered the keffiyeh removed,' he added. Zimmermann further said that the pope faces intense pressure from various factions within the Church who sympathize with Palestinians in Gaza. 'He receives a lot of criticism from the Arab world for being pro-Israel and for having many Jewish friends,' Zimmermann said. 'He's been in contact with the church in Gaza since October 7, which houses 610 Christians. They update him on what's happening and often poison his views.' 'Every time we meet, I see all kinds of materials sent to him in Spanish by official Palestinian entities and Palestinian embassies in South America about 'the generals' plan,' what Israel is doing and the harm to children and women. There's nothing representing the Israeli side,' he said. 'The new ambassador has much goodwill but has just arrived and met with the pope only once or twice. The pope also has friends in communities near the Gaza border and he consistently mentioned the issue of returning the hostages in various speeches for months. He was also involved in behind-the-scenes efforts to secure the hostages' release, including with U.S. President Joe Biden.' 'We cannot afford to oppose the most influential person on Earth' Zimmermann stressed that Israel cannot afford to confront someone who leads 2.4 billion people worldwide and whose every word is quoted. 'His influence exceeds that of the U.S. president. We cannot afford to oppose the most influential person on Earth,' he said. 'He defines antisemitism as a sin. He says it's permissible to criticize a government but unacceptable to question Israel's right to exist. That's antisemitism in his view.

Taliban purge academics, reshape Afghan education with ‘extremist...	The Taliban appear to be engaging in a systematic approach to seek ideological revenge and promote the 'Talibanization' of universities in Afghanistan, purging opposition, eroding academic freedom and forcing a brain drain After completely eradicating women from the education system, the Afghan Taliban have now turned their focus to silencing male professors who challenge their ideological and ethnic agenda. Reports reveal that the Taliban have overhauled university curricula and forcibly removed dissenting academics. Deans who have challenged the imposed rules and expressed their disagreement with strict ideologies have been subjected to dismissal, intimidation and exile. Sources also suggest professors who oppose the Taliban's changes or fail to comply are being systematically labeled as ideological opponents. In a stark display of their repression, 12 professors from Sayed Jamaluddin Afghani University in Kunar province were dismissed, accused of being 'Salafists.' These individuals have been punished for advocating academic freedom and resisting the constraints imposed upon them. Sources confirmed to The Media Line that among the dismissed professors were eight from the Faculty of Sharia, two from the Faculty of Agriculture and two from the Faculty of Education. Growing concerns have been raised regarding the Taliban’s escalating revenge-seeking actions and ideological clashes against university professors and their curricula, as the group actively pursues a systematic approach to seek ideological revenge and promote the 'Talibanization' of universities in Afghanistan. The academic institutions, which were once safe spaces for independent thinking and intellectual development, are now being restructured to conform to the rigid beliefs of the Taliban. The Taliban appear to be planning an even larger purge to eliminate opposition and suppress any remaining voices of dissent, further eroding academic freedom in the country. By undermining academic institutions, the Taliban have dismantled the foundations of critical thinking and intellectual diversity, leaving Afghanistan’s education system increasingly isolated, regressive and dominated by a single narrative. In the past, the Taliban fired professors who went abroad, including about 50 professors in Balkh province, 300 in Herat and dozens in other provinces. Moreover, professors who had won scholarships to study abroad were substituted by Taliban-linked figures. Many terrified educators and students look to exit the country, which has resulted in a continued drainage of the intellectual capital out of Afghanistan. Abdul Majid, a senior professor at the Faculty of Sharia at Sayed Jamaluddin Afghani University and one of the Salafi academics forced to resign, has since fled Afghanistan. Now seeking refuge with his family, Majid expressed deep concern over the Taliban’s tightening grip on the education sector. Speaking to The Media Line, he warned: 'The outlook and prospect for Afghanistan's educational system are bleak and threatening. The hopes and motivations among students and professors are shrinking very fast, with many planning to leave the country.' Majid highlighted that 'many academics and students view the Taliban's approach to universities and academic institutions as an act of 'educational demolition,' transforming once-thriving centers of learning into mere madrassas (seminaries) aimed solely at propagating their ideology.' Majid referred to the Taliban's endless ideological confrontations and unprofessional behavior toward academics, saying, 'They change curricula, engage in ideological confrontations and give priority to clerics over qualified educators. These practices, besides the lack of legal structure and clerical dominance, have driven many professors to leave universities.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ali Maisam Nazary, head of foreign relations for the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, told The Media Line: 'To advance their extremist agenda, the Taliban are systematically eliminating experienced academics from Afghanistan's educational institutions, replacing them with individuals lacking the necessary academic qualifications to indoctrinate the nation's youth.' 'The consequences of this policy are far-reaching. By promoting a curriculum designed to indoctrinate rather than educate, the Taliban is creating a new generation of youth who are more susceptible to extremist ideologies,' he added. Nazary emphasized that 'the youth, melded in this distorted educational system, could be easily lured by other terrorist groups to perpetuate the cycle of violence and radicalization around the globe.' Commenting on the PhD professors and intellectual students who have been leaving the country, Nazary said, 'This brain drain takes away Afghanistan's finest brains—skilled and most educated—thereby causing innovation, research and other key sectors like education, health and technology to be put behind.' 'Without them,' he continued, 'the country faces stagnation and a growing gap in international competitiveness, which will bequeath its next generation with less room for growth and self-sustainability.' Kamal Alam, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and an expert on Afghanistan, told The Media Line, 'Anyone who has observed and warned against the notion of a ‘reformed Taliban’ will find their current actions unsurprising.' Alam noted that the 'Taliban remain a regressive, puritanical regime with limited education and a narrow interpretation of Islam.' He emphasized that there is little evidence to suggest the Taliban can contribute positively to education, women’s rights or even the broader rights of men. Alam further pointed out their inability to engage constructively with fellow Muslim counterparts on genuine Islamic principles at the international level, highlighting the group’s limitations. 'No progress or enlightenment can be expected from the Taliban’s oppressive methods, whether in academia, governance or their connections with terrorist organizations,' he concluded. Qudrat Ullah Qudrat, a Paris-based Afghan student, told The Media Line, 'The Taliban in Afghanistan have been strategically and methodically working to shape the minds of the younger generation by imposing their beliefs and values through the education system.' Qudrat underlined that 'this systematic takeover involves various actions, including infiltrating schools and universities, appointing sympathetic individuals to key educational positions, rewriting curricula to align with their extremist views and silencing dissenting voices or alternative perspectives.' 'This strategy perpetuates a cycle of violence and extremism, severely undermining Afghanistan’s prospects for peace and stability,' he added. He confirmed that the Taliban have dismissed deans and other educators who disagree with their views, replacing them with loyalists, which has forced many talented academics to flee the country, 'weakening Afghanistan’s future.' Additionally, Qudrat highlighted 'the Taliban’s deliberate targeting of specific religious groups, noting that such actions will further divide the country and exacerbate existing social conflicts, leaving Afghanistan more fractured and vulnerable.' Qudrat also referenced and rephrased a recent statement by Neda Mohammad Nadeem, the acting head of the Taliban’s Ministry of Higher Education, who implied that the academic qualifications of 'Taliban fighters' should be determined by the number of mine-laying operations they have conducted. Meanwhile, Dr. Khairullah Zadran, a senior official at the Afghan Ministry of Education, told The Media Line 'that reports on targeting professors belonging to particular groups are baseless.' He explained that 'the curriculum is being revised to align with Islamic Sharia and maintained that Islam is not against modern education' and asserted that 'every employee is free to resign for any reason, as no law prohibits it.' According to Zadran, 'Previous governments had given women too much freedom in education.' This, he said, resulted in 'social and immoral problems.' In response, Zadran said that the Taliban is working on a plan to bring back senior professors who left the country during earlier periods of instability. By barring girls from secondary schools and universities, the Taliban are denying millions of young women the chance to learn and, in effect, denying the country their contributions to social, economic and cultural development. In a further effort to erase women from both education and active participation in society, Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada issued a decree this month banning women from attending medical and paramedical professional institutions. The decision closes one of the last remaining pathways for women to access higher education in Afghanistan. It comes after the closure of universities to women in December 2022, which had already forced many into medical facilities as a last resort.

Palestinian officer killed in Jenin as West Bank crackdown on Ira...	On day 17 of PA’s operation in Jenin, officer Sahr Arhil killed by terrorist gunfire; PA vows to expand crackdown across West Bank, targeting groups tied to 'the long arm of Iran and Hamas,' calling fight defense of national interests On the 17th day of the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) Operation Protect the Homeland in Jenin, tensions escalated as PA security forces clashed with fighters from the Jenin Brigade, a group linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) attempting to assert control over the refugee camp. The violence turned deadly Sunday when Sahr Arhil, a member of the Presidential Guard from Tulkarem, was killed by terrorist gunfire. Two other security officers were wounded, one severely. PA security forces spokesperson Anwar Rajab condemned the attack, calling it a 'heinous crime' that would only strengthen efforts to pursue 'outlaws.' He described the operation as part of a broader Palestinian security and political vision to protect national interests and urged residents to support efforts to combat groups he labeled as 'lacking national culture.' The PA has signaled plans to expand the operation beyond Jenin to other West Bank areas. A senior PA official described the campaign as a fight against the 'long arm of Iran, Hamas and PIJ,' accusing them of destabilizing the region. 'We won’t allow foreign agendas to control our people,' the official said. 'We’ve seen the consequences of Hamas rule in Gaza—we won’t let them destroy the West Bank.' A rare report by two Washington Post correspondents highlighted the unusual confrontation between the PA security forces and Jenin Brigade gunmen. The newspaper noted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to the PA resuming governance in Gaza, but cited a former Egyptian official claiming Israel had agreed to a temporary PA role managing the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The authority launched Operation Protect the Homeland this month to retake control of Jenin camp by targeting 'outlaws' and those 'spreading chaos and anarchy and harming civil peace,' Rajab told The Post. 'All these actions and policies undermine the work of the PA, and these groups give Israel an excuse to implement its plans in the West Bank.' According to Rajab, the operation’s 'achievements' have included arresting more than two dozen wanted persons, wounding others, dismantling dozens of explosives and 'advancing on important axes' into the refugee camp. Security forces have killed three people: a fighter, a 19-year-old passerby on a motorcycle and a 14-year-old boy. Both sides appear to be showing relative restraint. 'We don’t want to see a single drop of blood being shed,' Sabri Saidam, a member of Fatah’s central committee, told The Post. 'What we would like to achieve is a state of calm, to sit down with different factions and agree on the way forward.' A Palestinian official close to PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private discussions, said that the Palestinian leader has decided that the PA 'will impose its authority and there is no turning back.' But two weeks into the crackdown, militants still roam freely in the Jenin camp. Gunfire rings out day and night. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has suspended schools. Businesses are shut. In the Damaj and Hawashin neighborhoods, heavily damaged in an Israeli raid in September, some families have been without electricity and water for days. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2xuthsjg	2024-12-22T08:47:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/BJWM4aTNJx/BJWM4aTNJx_0_227_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

On Independence Day 1974, a Super Frelon helicopter crashed in flames on Mount Hermon during a rescue mission, killing all six crew members; fifty years later, its front rotor was recovered following Israel's capture of the Syrian Hermon Fifty years after one of Israel’s deadliest aviation accidents, soldiers from the elite Shaldag Unit recovered over the weekend the front rotor of a Super Frelon helicopter that crashed on Syria’s Mount Hermon during the 1974 Independence Day war. The rotor was transferred to Israel for further examination, providing closure for a tragedy that claimed six lives. The crash occurred on the evening of April 24, 1974, less than two weeks after the 'Machanayim Disaster,' when two Yasur helicopters collided, killing eight soldiers and crew. During the Independence Day mission, a Super Frelon helicopter from the 114th Squadron was dispatched to evacuate casualties from a paratrooper brigade stationed at an outpost near the Syrian Hermon.

Netanyahu vows decisive action against Houthi threats	PM highlights US-led international cooperation against Iranian-backed rebels, assures Israelis results would mirror Israel’s successes against other terror groups; 'Follow Home Front Command guidelines closely, and we will take care of everything else' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday vowed decisive action against Houthi missile attacks on Israel. Speaking after a meeting of the Security Cabinet in the IDF Northern Command, Netanyahu linked the Houthis to Iran’s 'Axis of Evil' and emphasized international cooperation against their actions. 'As we have acted decisively against other terror arms of Iran’s Axis of Evil, we will act against the Houthis,' Netanyahu said. 'In this case, we are not acting alone. The U.S. and other nations see the Houthis as a threat not only to international shipping but to the global order.' He assured Israelis that, despite potential delays, the results would mirror Israel’s successes against other terror groups. 'I ask citizens to remain patient and steadfast, as you have so far,' he added. 'Follow Home Front Command guidelines closely. You do that, and we will take care of everything else.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ahead of the Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu and ministers reviewed a display of weapons seized by Israeli forces in southern Lebanese villages during ground operations.

Engineering teams are working across more than 40 towns and surrounding areas to remove military debris and ensure safety for returning residents. 'This is part of broader efforts to create the conditions for residents to return to their homes safely,' the IDF said. 'Teams are clearing communities of military equipment, cleaning debris and removing unexploded munitions with support from local authorities.' Lt. Col. Shlomi Katzin of the 769th Brigade emphasized the cooperation between the military, emergency services and local governments. 'Our mission is to restore security, tranquility and the beauty of the north that we all know and cherish,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1kdyths1x	2024-12-22T07:46:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/ryOvwUbHJx/ryOvwUbHJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
California license plate sparks outrage for appearing to mock Oct...	California DMV apologizes and revokes license plate reading 'LOLOCT7' after being interpreted as mocking October 7 Hamas attack victims; Filipino-American owner’s family claims 'Lolo' means 'grandfather' in Tagalog The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) apologized this week for issuing a personalized license plate that some interpreted as mocking victims of the October 7 Hamas attack. The DMV revoked the plate, citing its policy against hateful messages, despite the vehicle owner’s claim that the controversy stemmed from a misunderstanding. The plate, which read 'LOLOCT7,' gained attention after the advocacy group StopAntisemitism shared a photo of a Tesla Cybertruck with the plate at a Culver City intersection near Los Angeles. Critics argued the combination of characters could be read as celebrating the attack, with 'LOL' (laugh out loud) and 'OCT7' referencing the date of the Hamas assault. StopAntisemitism called on the DMV to cancel the plate, accusing it of 'celebrating the October 7th terrorist attack' and calling it a 'vile mockery.' The DMV responded by issuing a formal apology and announcing the plate’s revocation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We sincerely apologize that these personalized plates were not properly rejected during the review process,' the DMV said in a statement. 'The use of hateful language violates is not only a clear violation of our policies but also a violation of our core values to proudly serve the public and ensure safe and welcoming roadways.' However, the vehicle owner’s son, a Filipino-American who requested anonymity, said the plate’s meaning had been misunderstood. He explained that 'LOLO' means 'grandfather' in Tagalog, the national language of the Philippines, while 'CT' refers to the Cybertruck model, and the number 7 represents the owner’s seven grandchildren. He added that this explanation had been provided to the DMV before the plate’s approval. 'We have great empathy for anyone who has experienced any hatred,' the son told ABC7. 'And we would really appreciate, in turn, for anyone that's seeing this or hearing this to have any empathy toward our family because we had no ill intent for anything.' California allows drivers to request personalized license plates combining letters and numbers with symbolic meaning. However, like most U.S. states, it imposes restrictions on messages deemed racist, political, religious or vulgar. The incident highlights broader debates over personalized license plates. In Maine, a decade-old law barring state officials from rejecting offensive plates was repealed after plates with vulgar terms such as profanity and explicit sexual references became common. The state has since reinstated restrictions to curb the trend. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydtp3rbkg	2024-12-22T07:24:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/SyG6t9BHkl/SyG6t9BHkl_88_68_247_139_0_small.jpg

Iran's Khamenei asserts 'Zionists haven’t won' in Syria	Iranian supreme leader dismisses claims Hamas and Hezbollah are proxies, saying they act on faith, warns post-Assad Syria’s youth may rise up against its leaders Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday tried to downplay the impact of the Assad regime’s recent overthrow in Syria, alongside heavy losses suffered by Hezbollah and Hamas. He dismissed claims that these groups operate as Iranian proxies but rather act on their own beliefs, not at Tehran’s direction. 'The Islamic Republic doesn’t have proxy forces. Yemen fights due to their faith. Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad fight because their beliefs compel them to do so,' Khamenei said in a speech also attended by Muhammad Mahdi Nasrallah, the son of slain Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. He insisted Iran does not rely on such groups, adding, 'If one day we plan to take action, we do not need proxy forces.' Khamenei accused the U.S. and Israel of orchestrating the Syrian conflict to gain control of its resources. 'Now they feel victory, the Americans, the Zionist regime and those who accompanied them,' he said, adding, 'The Iranian people will trample anyone who accepts the role of a mercenary of America.' Iran was the Assad regime's main ally alongside Russia, and for years helped it suppress regime opponents with the help of pro-Iranian militias, partly in exchange for allowing it to flow weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon through Syria and allowing Tehran's militias to operate from its territory against Israel. The collapse of Assad's regime earlier this month, which came after Hezbollah suffered a severe blow at the hands of Israel, was seen as a fatal blow to the Shiite 'Axis of Resistance' that Iran had built in the region. After the toppling of Assad, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, declared that the new Syria would not present a threat to any country in its vicinity and would no longer be subject to Iran's whims. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Iranian officials have emphasized that communication channels have been established with Syria’s new leadership under al-Sharaa, though the details of these ties remain unclear. Tehran faces a challenging relationship with the new government, after years of backing Bashar Assad in a brutal crackdown on opposition forces. In his speech Sunday, Khamenei appeared confrontational toward al-Sharaa’s administration, suggesting young Syrians, facing insecurity after Assad’s fall, could rise against the new leadership. 'What can he do? He should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity,' Khamenei said. 'God willing, he will overcome them.' Khamenei also accused Israel and the United States of fomenting chaos in Syria. 'You Zionists haven’t won; you’ve been defeated. Yes, you were able to advance a few kilometers in Syria where there wasn’t even one soldier with a gun to stop you. That’s not victory,' he said, predicting Syrian resistance to foreign influence. 'The courageous, devout, young people of Syria will definitely expel you from there,' he added. Khamenei ridiculed Israel’s claims of victory in its war with Hamas, accusing the country of failing to achieve its goals despite extensive casualties. 'The Zionists try to show they’re the victors. You wretched people! Where have you won? Have you won in Gaza? Have you destroyed Hamas? Have you freed your own prisoners? Is this victory to kill over 40,000 people without being able to achieve even one of your goals?' Khamenei said. Meanwhile, diplomatic outreach to Syria’s new leadership continues to grow. Al-Sharaa met Sunday with prominent Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt in Damascus. Al-Sharaa criticized the Assad regime’s history of interference in Lebanon, often through Hezbollah, and pledged to chart a different course. 'Syria will no longer be a case of negative interference in Lebanon,' he said, emphasizing respect for Lebanese sovereignty and a desire for stronger bilateral ties. 'We hope to have strategic relations with Lebanon and to start a new history with it,' al-Sharaa added. 'Lebanon needs a strong economy and political stability, and Syria will support it.' Turkey, a key player in Assad’s overthrow, is also strengthening ties with Syria’s new government. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met with al-Sharaa on Sunday, marking the highest-level contact between Turkey and the new Syrian leadership. Turkey, seen as the driving force behind the opposition’s surprise offensive that toppled Assad, is poised to leverage its influence over al-Sharaa’s administration, particularly against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. This influence could also be directed toward advancing Turkey’s regional interests, including its stance against Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjnki5bsyg	2024-12-22T06:46:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/HkCcadHBkx/HkCcadHBkx_0_143_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Jerusalem residents charged with spying for Hezbollah	Abed Al-Salam and Taar Asili indicted for contact with foreign agent and sharing intelligence with Hezbollah operative during war; prosecutors seek their detention until trial The State Prosecutor’s Office filed an indictment Sunday against two Jerusalem residents, Abed Al-Salam, 33, and Taar Asili, 35, alleging they collaborated with a Hezbollah operative and provided sensitive information to the terrorist organization during the war. One of the defendants also faces charges of attempting to carry a weapon without a permit. The indictment claims the two men made contact with a woman identified as Dania through a WhatsApp group. Despite learning she was a Hezbollah operative, they continued sharing information with her. Al-Salam allegedly sent her photographs of the Caesarea area at her request, while Asili provided news articles about Israel and its security situation. The indictment further details that the men were instructed to establish contact with a senior Hezbollah intelligence figure known as 'Al-Hajj.' Asili reportedly purchased a new SIM card for this purpose but refused a request to take photographs near the northern town of Metula which lies on the Lebanese border. Additionally, Al-Salam is accused of being photographed holding a weapon during a visit to Jenin in the West Bank, with the weapon belonging to a local individual identified as 'Abu Kharb.' Both men are charged with contact with a foreign agent and providing information to the enemy. Al-Salam faces an additional charge for attempting to carry a weapon without a permit.

Earlier this month, Artyom Zolotarev, 33, of Nof HaGalil, was arrested on suspicion of working for Iranian intelligence. His alleged tasks included arson and spraying graffiti, and his arrest came during a joint operation by Shin Bet and police. In October, seven Israelis of Azerbaijani descent were accused of maintaining contact with Iranian operatives over two years.

Zelensky says Ukraine's membership of NATO is 'achievable'	Ukraine's membership of NATO is 'achievable,' but Kyiv will have to fight to persuade allies to make it happen, President Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainian diplomats in a speech on Sunday. Ukraine has repeatedly urged NATO to invite Kyiv to become a member. The Western military alliance has said Ukraine will join its ranks one day but has not set a date or issued an invitation. Moscow has cited the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO as one of the principal justifications for its 2022 invasion. Kyiv says membership in the Western alliance's mutual defense pact, or an equivalent form of security guarantee, would be crucial to any peace plan to ensure that Russia does not attack again. 'We all understand that Ukraine's invitation to NATO and membership in the alliance can only be a political decision,' Zelensky told diplomats at a gathering in Kyiv. 'Alliance for Ukraine is achievable, but it is achievable only if we fight for this decision at all the necessary levels.' Zelensky said allies needed to know what Ukraine can bring to NATO and how its membership in the alliance would stabilize global relations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjime9sryl	2024-12-22T04:31:33-08:00	
Estimated damage from Houthi missile that hit central Israel scho...	Missile caused heavy damage to the elementary school near Tel Aviv, despite being 'partially intercepted' Once again, there has been huge damage from rockets falling on Gush Dan in central Israel. The damage from the missile fired from Yemen at an elementary school in Ramat Efal neighborhood of Ramat Gan amounts to approximately 40 million shekels, according to estimates by the Tax Authority. The heavy damage was caused mainly to the school and also to nearby buildings and apartments, Ynet has learned. In comparison, a missile from Iran that hit the prestigious C&S residential complex in northern Tel Aviv on October 1, right before Rosh Hashanah, caused enormous damage to the apartments and restaurants there, which, as reported by Ynet, amounted to approximately 50 million shekels. Only a few weeks ago, repairs were completed at the site and the restaurants, including the famous Turquoise, reopened to diners. Compared to the heavy damage caused in Ramat Efal over the weekend from the missile that the IDF determined was 'partially intercepted,' the damage from the missile that was not intercepted at all and hit a public park in Jaffa on Friday night likely will amount to 'only' a few million shekels, with most of the damage caused to the park itself, as well as broken windows and damage to furniture in hundreds of apartments and businesses in the area. The Tax Authority told Ynet that the current estimate is that about 350-400 claims will be filed by residents in the area.

Ynet recently reported that the direct damage in the northern Lebanese border towns and the Golan Heights is estimated at about 2 billion shekels, and the indirect damage to businesses is estimated at another 3 billion shekels. The direct damage from missile strikes in the Gaza Strip is estimated at about 1.5 billion shekels, and in recent weeks reconstruction of the buildings that were completely damaged in the kibbutzim on the border with Gaza has already begun. The direct damage from the strike last month in Ramat Gan was estimated at 100 million shekels, while the indirect damage following the shutdown of economic activity on the main commercial street is estimated to be about 250 million shekels. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1imqybske	2024-12-22T04:18:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/BJBPir11B1e/BJBPir11B1e_0_187_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Gunmen in the streets, snipers on the rooftops, shooting all the ...	Rare clash between Palestinian Authority security forces and the armed Jenin Brigades in the West Bank city as observed by the Washington Post; The PA hints at a similar model in Gaza Jenin Brigades fighters race through alleys flooded with sewage to evade the gunfire that echoes all around. 'Quickly,' one of the fighters urges his comrades as they pass through patrols and barricades of the Palestinian Authority security forces. 'Watch out,' another cautions at an intersection where an improvised explosive device had been planted. This could have been a response to the IDF raid on the city and the refugee camp in the northern West Bank, but instead it is a report after two Washington Post reporters witnessed up close a rare battle of the Jenin fighters against their internal enemy: the Palestinian Authority . It happened two weeks ago. After many years, Palestinian security forces launched an arrest operation in the crowded refugee camp in an attempt to regain control. The PA, supported by Western countries, is trying to prove that it can manage security in the limited areas it controls in the West Bank, as a reminder to the world that it also seeks to control the Gaza Strip the day after the war ends. The U.S. newspaper reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza as a governing body. However, according to a former senior Egyptian official who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity, Israel has agreed to let the Palestinian Authority manage the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt for a short period. The PA launched 'Operation Protect the Homeland' in November to retake control of Jenin camp by targeting 'outlaws' and those 'spreading chaos and anarchy and harming civil peace,' security forces spokesman Anwar Rajab told The Post. 'All these actions and policies undermine the work of the PA, and these groups give Israel an excuse to implement its plans in the West Bank.' According to Rajab, the 'achievements' of the operation included the arrest of dozens of wanted individuals, the injury of others, the detonation of dozens of explosive devices, and the advancement of important routes into the refugee camp. The security forces killed three people during the operation: a gunman, a 19-year-old young man riding a motorcycle, and a 14-year-old boy. Still, both sides appear to be showing relative restraint, according to the report. 'Don’t want to see a single drop of blood being shed' According to the Ramallah Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between terrorists and civilians, at least 21 people were killed in the long IDF raid on Jenin in September. The IDF said 14 terrorists were killed. The PA also occasionally clashes with armed Palestinians. Since the October 7 massacre, PA security forces have killed 13 Palestinians, including eight in total in Jenin. 'We don't want to see a single drop of blood shed,' Sabri Saidam, an advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a member of his Fatah central committee, told The Washington Post. 'What we would like to achieve is a state of calm, to sit down with different factions and agree on the way forward.' A senior Palestinian source close to the PA chairman said on condition of anonymity that Abbas has decided that the Palestinian Authority will 'impose its authority and there is no turning back.' But two weeks after the PA operation began, gunmen are still roaming freely in the Jenin refugee camp. The sound of gunfire can be heard around the clock. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has closed schools, and businesses are also closed. In some of the neighborhoods, which were badly damaged in the Israeli raid in September, some families were left without electricity and water for days, according to the report. Masked security personnel patrol the government hospital in Jenin. Snipers are stationed on the roof to prevent armed men from trying to hide in its grounds, a hospital source said. The Post's reporters heard gunfire from the roof. The source said several bullets pierced a window in the office, and patients and staff are afraid to come. There is an enormous amount of anger at the security forces in the West Bank. Their men operate in a limited area and, according to agreements with Israel, they are not allowed to deal with violence from settlers and, of course, IDF raids. Many Palestinians see the forces as subcontractors of Israel and a tool of Abbas for corruption and the suppression of internal opposition. '24 hours later there will be someone new in their place' 'The people want ‘law and order’, but apply the law right and people will stand with you,' said Arwad, 35, who spoke on the condition his last name be withheld out of concern for reprisal from Palestinian and Israeli authorities. 'When the Israeli soldiers and jeeps come here, where is the law?' Arwad's brother and father are in Israeli prison. Other relatives of his were killed by IDF fire. Even if the authority arrests wanted terrorists, he said, 'the resistance will continue. Twenty-four hours later there will be someone new in their place.' According to Rajab, the operation in Jenin targeted suspects wanted for criminal offenses, including shooting at hospitals and making explosive devices. He said this escalated when gunmen stole and burned two security force vehicles, and a car bomb exploded near a police station. On the ground, attempts were made to mediate a cease-fire between the gunmen and the security forces but, according to Firas Abu al-Wafa, Fatah's secretary-general in Jenin, the PA refused to compromise. Saidam said talks continue and 'the security apparatus is adamant to impose law and order.' Wafa added that 'If the situation in Jenin stabilizes, then the whole West Bank will be stable.' But if it doesn’t, 'there will not be stability across the West Bank.'

Iran's Supreme Leader on Sunday said that young Syrians will resist the new government emerging after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad as he again accused the United States and Israel of sowing chaos in the country. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address on Sunday that the 'young Syrian has nothing to lose' and suffers from insecurity following Assad's fall. 'What can he do? He should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity,' Khamenei said. 'God willing, he will overcome them.'

Israel's missile defense under scrutiny: Successful Houthi strike...	Two failed interceptions of Houthi missiles launched from Yemen within two days raise concerns about Israel's missile defense; A strike in Jaffa injured 12, while experts highlight technical challenges, delayed alarms and Iran's involvement in arming the Houthis with advanced weaponry; 'Not only do we learn from interceptions, but so does the other side' Over two days, two attempts to intercept Houthi missiles launched from Yemen failed. On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, the IDF claimed to have achieved a partial interception of the missile, though its warhead exploded and struck a school in Ramat Efal, near Tel Aviv. By the night between Friday and Saturday, it was already clear the interception attempt had failed: several interceptors launched at the ballistic missile missed their target, and it hit the center of a public park in Jaffa, injuring a dozen people and causing damage to nearby apartments. 'The fire is scattered; I don’t see an escalation. But it’s evident that even a single missile heading toward central Israel sends many people into shelters,' said Tal Inbar, an expert in aviation, space and missile policy, and a senior research fellow at the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, during an interview with Ynet studio on Sunday morning. 'Every interception is analyzed. The more interceptors are deployed, the better the performance of the systems becomes,' he added. Inbar also referred to the Houthis’ capabilities. 'I don’t know of a reliable source that can specify the number of missiles they possess, but we do know the types of missiles. Ultimately, this is Iranian import, guided deeply by them. Not only do we learn from interceptions, but so does the other side.' Brigadier General (Res.) Ran Kochav, former commander of the Air Defense Array, stated: 'The cases are different, but the proximity is no coincidence. Both are Iranian missiles launched by the Houthis. In the first case in Ramat Efal, despite the partial interception and the approximate hit on the missile, significant parts, including the warhead, fell. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but there was significant damage. On Saturday morning, however, there was a miss – a significant failure without interception. There was a late warning, and the missile hit the ground.' However, Kochav asserted that he does not believe this incident indicates the use of advanced weaponry. 'When there’s an interception success rate of approximately 90%, one out of every 10 launches fails to be intercepted. Over 37,000 rockets and missiles have been launched toward Israel from Yemen, Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. Sometimes it’s a technical malfunction; other times, operational error.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Kochav addressed the delayed alarms in Jaffa and its surroundings. 'There’s a mutual responsibility between civilians and the Home Front Command, and this time it was a malfunction – perhaps even human error. The warning time provided was shorter than required, and it’s very possible that this needs to be extended or corrected. Generally, there’s always a dilemma about when and how to activate the warning,' he said. 'I trust my colleagues in the Air Force to improve. I don’t believe the guidelines for civilians need to change, but this issue should be addressed within the military, within the Home Front Command,' he concluded, adding: 'This pattern of the Houthis firing at us every day or two must stop. I’m not sure the answer lies in tit-for-tat responses.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1mzaprbyl	2024-12-22T02:24:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/rkmraUNB1g/rkmraUNB1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Turkey believes Syria's new rulers, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) armed group which Ankara backs, will drive Kurdish YPG fighters from all territory they occupy in northeastern Syria, Defense Minister Yasar Guler said on Sunday. Turkey regards the Syrian YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for 40 years and are deemed terrorists by Ankara, Washington, and the European Union. 'We believe that the new leadership in Syria and the Syrian National Army, which is an important part of its army, along with the Syrian people, will free all territories occupied by terrorist organizations,' Guler said during a visit to Turkish troops on the Syrian border with military commanders. Ankara has demanded the Syrian Kurdish fighters disband, and has called on Washington to withdraw its support. The U.S. military acknowledged last week it has 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria, twice as many as it had said previously.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qptvbbjx	2024-12-22T01:46:52-08:00

Trump appoints 'The Apprentice' producer as special envoy to UK	President-elect has appointed Mark Burnett as his special envoy to the UK; The producer is also behind the shows 'Survivor' and 'Shark Tank,' and also served as chairman of the MGM television company; Trump: 'Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role' President Donald Trump is in the midst of selecting a cabinet for his return to the White House on January 20, and the process is looking more like a reality TV show than good governance. After announcing the nomination of Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary and the appointment of another Fox News host, Dr. Mehmet Oz, as the head of the U.S. Health Insurance Administration, Trump announced the appointment of 'The Apprentice' producer Mark Burnett as his special envoy to the United Kingdom. In doing so, the president-elect is closing the circle with the man who brought him back into the spotlight 20 years ago as a television personality and saved him from financial collapse as a businessman. 'With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday. Burnett is part of the production team of successful reality shows such as 'Survivor' and 'The Voice,' but is particularly recognized as the one who executed the production of 'The Apprentice' and led it to tremendous prosperity on the NBC network from its rise in 2004 until its decline after 15 seasons in 2017. He was responsible for casting Trump, then a well-known businessman and a fading New York real estate mogul. Two decades later, the president-elect expressed his appreciation for this success. 'Mark was known as the creator and producer of some of the greatest television shows ever, most notably 'The Apprentice,' and it's worth mentioning that he won 13 Emmy Awards.' Over the years, Trump has praised Burnett for his contributions to his career in the entertainment industry and, according to one of the producers of 'The Apprentice,' Bill Pruitt, the Trump's public image was shaped by the show. 'We created a myth,' he said in an interview this year.

This is in contrast to the expected appointment of banker Warren Stevens, one of Trump's major donors, who was selected to serve as the United States ambassador to London. Why is a special envoy from the president needed in the United Kingdom, with which the United Kingdom has had normal relations for years?

US fighter jet shot down over Red Sea in apparent friendly fire i...	F/A-18 shot down during US attack against the Houthis; 2 US pilots rescued alive; This is the most serious incident to endanger American soldiers in more than a year of operations against the Houthis in Yemen; Overnight, U.S. warplanes targeted Houthi military sites Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent 'friendly fire' incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become over the ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn’t specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement. From the military’s description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the 'Red Rippers' of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn’t immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman’s arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen that the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a 'missile storage facility' and a 'command-and-control facility,' without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. The Houthis later acknowledged the aircraft being shot down in the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. The US attacks came less than a day after a Houthi missile evaded Israeli defenses and landed in Tel Aviv. Overnight between Saturday and Sunday, Israeli fighter jets were recorded flying at low altitude in the Gush Dan area to patrol against Houthi drones following the increasing number of launches by the Houthis in recent days. On Saturday, half a day after the launch of the missile that caused extensive damage in Jaffa and injured 16 people, a combat helicopter intercepted a drone, likely launched from Yemen. On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, at the same time as a Houthi missile hit a school in in the Ramat Gan neighborhood of Ramat Afal, Israel attacked for the third time since the start of the war in Yemen - and for the first time in the capital Sanaa. Dozens of fighter jets and other aircraft flew some 2,000 kilometers in that attack. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1lt47bh1g	2024-12-21T20:50:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/05/20/9255056/9255056_55_0_1191_670_0_small.jpg

Turkey will do 'whatever it takes' to ensure its security if the new Syrian administration cannot address Ankara's concerns about U.S.-allied Kurdish groups it views as terrorist groups, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Saturday. Turkey regards the YPG, the militant group spearheading the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for 40 years and are deemed terrorists by Ankara, Washington, and the European Union. Hostilities have escalated since the toppling of Bashar al-Assad. In an interview with France 24, Fidan said Ankara's preferred option was for the new administration in Damascus to address the problem in line with Syria's territorial unity, sovereignty and integrity, adding that the YPG should be disbanded immediately. He also said Turkey was not in favor of any foreign bases, including Russian ones, remaining in Syria, but that the choice was up to the Syrian people.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1poaghhyx	2024-12-21T20:10:13-08:00

Israel-Hamas cease-fire talks 90% complete, report says	Negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages are 90% complete, but critical issues remain unresolved, a senior Palestinian official involved in the discussions told the BBC Saturday night. Among the sticking points being debated in Doha are the presence of Israeli forces along the Philadelphi Corridor and a proposed buffer zone spanning several kilometers along the Gaza-Israel border. 'Once these issues are resolved, a three-phase cease-fire agreement could be reached within days,' the official said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkh892ehkl	2024-12-21T13:01:15-08:00	
US says struck Houthi missile storage facility in Yemen	The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) announced Saturday night it struck a Houthi missile storage facility in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, along with command and control centers in the area. In a statement posted on X, CENTCOM said the strikes aimed to 'disrupt and degrade Houthi operations, such as attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the Southern Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and Gulf of Aden.' The operation also saw the downing of multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rknok3eske	2024-12-21T12:59:18-08:00	
Second Arrow needed': IDF reviews strategy amid Houthi escalatio...	After 2 failed Houthi missile interceptions, senior official urges policy shift: 'Misses can happen, but the solution is launching an additional interceptor'; officials say no advancements in Houthi capabilities detected, but Yemeni rebels 'centers of gravity' remain elusive 'The moment the first missile missed, a second one should have been launched,' a senior IDF official said Saturday evening following the investigation into the failed interception of a missile fired from Yemen, which struck Tel Aviv, causing extensive damage. The official added that the same approach should have been applied in Thursday's attack, when a Houthi missile caused significant damage to a school in Ramat Efal. Ynet has learned that in the past, the Arrow air defense system has fired a second missile against ballistic missiles like those fired by the Houthis toward Israel. The Israeli air defense array’s recent hiccups necessitate a reassessment of interception policies. According to sources familiar with the issue, the last two incidents did not involve an upgrade in Houthi capabilities or weaponry. However, the Yemeni terror group is believed to be learning and improving, which demands a similar response from the IDF. Until now, defense officials have been cautious about launching a second interceptor due to practical concerns: each Arrow missile costs millions of dollars, alongside other operational considerations that remain classified. Still, no such policy is set in stone. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We should have acted differently, and we will adopt a broader interception policy,' a senior defense official said. 'We've made progress in threat analysis. Misses can happen, but the solution is launching an additional interceptor. Both today and Thursday, it’s likely that a second missile would have hit the target.' Military Intelligence had assessed that the Houthis would escalate their attacks on Israel following the Israeli Air Force’s strikes in Yemen, a prediction that has already materialized. The IDF now expects the pace of missile and drone launches to increase further. On Saturday afternoon, another drone, likely launched from Yemen, was intercepted after entering southern Israel near the Gaza border. A dramatic video captured an attack helicopter firing on the drone, which exploded mid-air. Earlier in the week, another Houthi drone was intercepted off the coast of Tel Aviv on Thursday, while both a missile and a drone were shot down on Monday. According to the IDF, the Houthis have fired over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel since the war began, most of which were intercepted or failed to reach Israeli territory. Learning from past attempts, the Houthis have altered their drone routes. Whereas they previously approached central Israel via the sea, drones are now entering through the Sinai Peninsula into Gaza and then targeting southern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel is seeking a more effective response, focusing on identifying so-called 'centers of gravity' to neutralize. However, no definitive targets have been identified yet. Attention is now shifting to January 20, when Donald Trump is set to assume office, raising hopes that his administration might increase pressure on the Houthis. While the United States, alongside Britain, launched airstrikes in Yemen this week, the Houthis appear undeterred. The concept of 'deterrence' holds little weight in the Houthi playbook. The IDF itself cannot yet engage in full-scale combat against the Houthis, making international coalition-building essential. Such a coalition would address a threat that impacts global shipping lanes and the world economy. It is unlikely that a challenge with global ramifications can be resolved by debating whether Israel launches one or two Arrow missiles. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbz434hkg	2024-12-21T12:53:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/ryxmS14B1g/ryxmS14B1g_1_32_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israeli military operation in Syria ‘wise and correct,’ Druze lea...	‘Proud Israeli’ Majdal Shams Mayor Dolan Abu Saleh: 'I love to be part of society in the State of Israel… we want this feeling to be mutual and not one-sided' Israelis across the country were shocked last week by news of the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime and of the Israeli military occupation of certain areas of Syria. This development reverberated strongly in Majdal Shams, a Druze town on the Golan Heights that has been under Israeli control since 1967. The Media Line sat down with Majdal Shams Mayor Dolan Abu Saleh for an exclusive interview about how Israel’s Druze population is reacting to these events. Majdal Shams is considered the unofficial Druze capital of the Golan Heights and is home to nearly 12,000 residents, all of whom are Druze. Druze people make up the majority of the 24,000 Arabs living throughout the Golan. An additional 100,000 or so Israeli Druze live outside of the Golan in northern Israel and around Haifa. The town’s ties to Syria run deep. For many families, there are relatives on the other side of the border, creating a complex set of loyalties and concerns. Abu Saleh, now in his fourth term as mayor, spoke at length about the dramatic changes in Syria and their impact on the Druze community. 'For every family here, there’s family on the other side,' he said, stressing the deeply personal nature of these political shifts. He described the fall of Assad as a transformative event, noting, 'The people here are very, very happy that the dictator, the murderer of the people, is no longer in power. They hope there will be a new Syria of peace, humanity and human rights.' Concerns heightened in Majdal Shams after the terrorist atrocities of October 7, 2023. 'Until October 7, the civil war in Syria did not pose a significant threat to residents of the Golan,' Abu Saleh said. After that date, people worried about possible infiltration from Syria. 'Hezbollah operated freely in Syria under Assad,' he noted, explaining why residents feared that violence could spill over the border. 'All this time, we saw cooperation between Hezbollah and Assad,' he said. The fall of Assad also brought the Druze community’s historical questions of loyalty and identity into sharper focus. When Israel occupied the Golan Heights in 1967 and annexed the territory in 1981, it offered Druze residents Israeli citizenship, but many continued to identify as Syrian. Today, Druze in the Golan remains eligible for Israeli citizenship, and the number of applicants has grown in recent years. Data from 2022 show that around 20% of Majdal Shams residents hold Israeli citizenship, while the rest have permanent residency without citizenship. Abu Saleh described himself as 'a proud Israeli citizen,' explaining that Israel provides security and a high standard of human rights. 'I love this place very much. I love to be part of society in the State of Israel,' he added. 'Both personally and as a community, we want to feel an indivisible part of the State of Israel, not only in name, but also through receiving budgets and sharing resources from the state, and that this feeling will be mutual and not one-sided.' Before discussing the broader historical context, Abu Saleh outlined his personal and political journey. He has served two terms as an appointed council head before being elected in Majdal Shams’ first and subsequent elections, now totaling four terms in office. He explained that the local council is administered under the Interior Ministry and that the town receives funding from Israeli government offices, just like any other local authority in Israel. Majdal Shams drew wider attention in July 2024, when a Hezbollah rocket attack killed 12 children in the town. Abu Saleh called it 'a great human tragedy,' adding that some of those wounded remained hospitalized for months. The community received substantial philanthropic support from Israeli organizations and from the Jewish community abroad. 'Many philanthropic actors came and embraced the families,' he said. This sympathy and support contributed to the sense that the Druze of Majdal Shams are integral to Israel’s fabric, not simply because of geography, but because of shared values and security concerns. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regarding current security measures, Abu Saleh said the town works closely with local Israeli military divisions and the military’s Home Front Command, sometimes going beyond the official guidelines. Only about 60% of homes in Majdal Shams have bomb shelters, and the municipality is aware that more must be done to protect residents. He praised Israel’s decision to enter Syria to create a buffer zone, calling it 'a wise and correct step' to protect Israeli citizens before threats cross into the country. Israel’s actions in Syria have drawn criticism from countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, but Abu Saleh defended the move. 'The State of Israel needs to create a barrier that will protect its residents and citizens,' he said. 'If the State of Israel is threatened in the future, it can manage the war outside its borders. That means that before its residents and citizens are harmed, it will be there to protect them.' Before the outbreak of Syria’s civil war, Druze students from the Golan often attended Damascus University. Abu Saleh acknowledged that it was a positive experience for many at the time, but today, he favors Israeli academia. He believes that Golan Druze who complete their studies in Israel, have an easier time joining the Israeli labor market. Residents of Majdal Shams now work in fields such as medicine, engineering, construction, high-tech and civil service, and most families also engage in agriculture. He emphasized that women in Majdal Shams play an active role, holding many central positions in local government and making up at least half of those working in professional fields. Abu Saleh’s eldest daughter is preparing for an academic career, and his wife runs the family business. He called for more factories and high-tech firms to set up locally, creating opportunities for women who prefer to work close to home. Regarding Syria’s future under the de facto leadership of Abu Mohammed al-Golani, some Druze are worried, but Abu Saleh sees reasons for optimism. He noted that new authorities released prisoners and preserved government institutions, which may indicate a focus on human well-being. Still, he stressed the importance of ensuring that minority groups, like the Kurds, are not harmed and called for international dialogue with Turkey’s president to address concerns over Kurdish safety. Reflecting on his responsibilities as mayor during these tumultuous times, Abu Saleh acknowledged that the job is a great challenge. 'The whole world looks at how a leader acts in such a situation,' he said. 'We will continue to protect our residents and the State of Israel, which protects us, and work toward a future where everyone can thrive.' To mark the fall of the Assad regime, some residents of Majdal Shams raised the flag of the Syrian opposition last week. 'Seeing the Syrian flag fly in Majdal Shams instead of the flag of the Syrian regime is very different and very significant,' Abu Saleh said. 'But we, as a local authority that is under Israeli sovereignty, want to see here in the State of Israel the flag of the State of Israel, because the State of Israel is the one that gives us security.' 'I think that we all hope for a situation in which Syria will receive the flag of Israel in Damascus. Until then, we will think about cooperating in raising the flags in a friendly manner.'

Not Israel this time: Airstrikes rock Yemen’s capital Sanaa	Day after Houthi missile strike on Tel Aviv, international coalition bombs Houthi strongholds, with reports of explosions and fighter jets over Sanaa; strikes, targeting military sites, follow Israel’s third Yemen operation since war began Less than 24 hours after a Houthi ballistic missile struck Tel Aviv, Yemen's Houthi-affiliated Al-Masirah channel reported airstrikes in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, Saturday night. Hezbollah-linked Al Mayadeen reported a powerful explosion and sightings of fighter jets over the city. While some outlets, including Iraq’s pro-Iran Sabereen News, claimed the strikes were carried out by Israel, reports from Al Hadath and other sources indicated that an international coalition conducted the airstrikes targeting Houthi military positions. According to Al Hadath, the strikes hit three key locations in Sanaa, including fuel depots, power plants and other military targets. This followed Israel's own strike on Yemen earlier in the week, marking the third such operation since the October 7 war began and the first to hit the Houthi stronghold of Sanaa. In a statement, the IDF detailed that over 60 bombs were dropped during a mission involving dozens of aircraft covering nearly 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles). The IDF shared video footage of precision strikes on eight tugboats in Houthi-controlled ports, with audio of pilots confirming successful hits: 'Alpha, beautiful hit,' one pilot was heard saying. The operation, named 'White City,' aimed to cripple Houthi port operations, with strikes on Rass Isa, Hodeidah and Al-Salif. The IDF claimed a severe economic impact on the Houthis, though Reuters reported conflicting accounts, with sources in Hodeidah claiming port activity remains partially operational. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The strikes began at 3:15 a.m. with a first wave targeting coastal areas and a second wave at 4:30 a.m. on sites in Sanaa, involving 14 fighter jets. Power outages and significant damage were reported, with at least nine fatalities, according to local sources. The strike came just hours after a Houthi missile hit a school in Ramat Efal, collapsing the building. The missile was partially intercepted by the Arrow system, but its warhead exploded on impact. Since October 7, the Houthis have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones toward Israel, most of which have been intercepted or failed to reach Israeli territory. While the IDF emphasized the strikes were planned weeks in advance and unrelated to the missile launch, they mark a clear escalation in efforts to dismantle Houthi military capabilities. The Houthis continue to claim they are undeterred, framing their actions as a campaign in support of Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1qp8inskl	2024-12-21T11:57:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/SJ00zroNr1g/SJ00zroNr1g_0_346_958_540_0_small.jpg

The first phase of an agreement between Israel and Hamas will include the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners, Egypt’s Al-Rad channel reported Saturday night, citing sources familiar with the negotiations. According to the report, negotiations are advancing on issues such as the Rafah crossing, Israel's withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor and the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza. The sources said that Israel submitted a list of 34 hostages it seeks to prioritize for release in the first phase of the deal, including 11 individuals who do not meet the agreed-upon criteria. Hamas has reportedly agreed to Israel's request, conditional on receiving special compensation for those individuals.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1kfgiehke	2024-12-21T11:17:37-08:00

Pope calls Gaza airstrikes 'cruelty' after Israeli minister's cri...	Pontiff condemns Israeli actions in Gaza after Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli accused him of trivializing genocide for suggesting offensive bears genocidal traits Pope Francis on Saturday again condemned Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, a day after an Israeli government minister publicly denounced the pontiff for suggesting the global community should study whether the military offensive there constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people. Francis opened his annual Christmas address to the Catholic cardinals who lead the Vatican's various departments with what appeared to be a reference to Israeli airstrikes on Friday that killed at least 25 Palestinians in Gaza. 'Yesterday, children were bombed,' said the pope. 'This is cruelty. This is not war. I wanted to say this because it touches the heart.' The pope, as leader of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church, is usually careful about taking sides in conflicts, but he has recently been more outspoken about Israel's military campaign against Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In book excerpts published last month, the pontiff said some international experts said that 'what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide.' Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli sharply criticized those comments in an unusual open letter published by Italian newspaper Il Foglio on Friday. Chikli said the pope's remarks amounted to a 'trivialization' of the term genocide. Francis also said on Saturday that the Catholic bishop of Jerusalem, known as a patriarch, had tried to enter the Gaza Strip on Friday to visit Catholics there, but was denied entry. The patriarch's office told Reuters it was not able to comment on the pope's remarks about the patriarch being denied entry. The IDF said on Saturday the patriarch's entry had been approved and he would enter Gaza on Sunday, barring any major security issues. Aid from the patriarch's office entered last week, the military said. Israel allows clerics to enter Gaza and 'works in cooperation with the Christian community to make it easier for the Christian population that remains in the Gaza Strip — including coordinating its removal from the Gaza Strip to a third country,' a statement from the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk3plc4hje	2024-12-21T10:36:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/ByQFsuVryx/ByQFsuVryx_0_0_1365_769_0_small.jpg

‘The murderers aren’t scary at all, they’re as much victims as th...	At Neve Tirtza, Israel’s only women’s prison, a 17-year-old inmate shares a cell with an 80-year-old and a toddler who has spent his entire life behind bars; 'When women enter prison, their entire world falls apart,' says the commander, 'we provide tools to help them reintegrate into society' Neve Tirza, Israel’s only women’s prison, presents a complex reality of pain and rehabilitation. The facility houses a wide range of inmates, from mothers convicted of murdering their children to a young woman raising her baby within the prison walls. Recently, the institution made headlines for its crumbling infrastructure and outdated physical conditions. Now, we choose to focus on the human stories unfolding behind its peeling walls and rusted bars. A child who thinks prison is home The prison’s Savyon Wing, ironically named after the groundsel flower symbolizing bloom and growth, is one of the most somber areas in Israel’s corrections system. Here, women once known as 'mothers' are serving sentences for the unthinkable crime of murdering their children. Among them are Karina Bril, convicted of killing her two children in Jerusalem; Marie Pizem, sentenced for the murder of her daughter Rose, whose body was found in a suitcase in Tel Aviv’s Yarkon River; and Sigal Itskovich, accused of murdering her son in their Herzliya home. A short walk from the wing, at the end of a corridor, is a very different story. In a modest room with bunk beds and a crib, a young mother is trying to create a semblance of normalcy for her toddler during her relatively short prison term. The cracked gray walls are adorned with colorful childlike drawings—a small effort to brighten the bleak environment. Here, amid confinement, she struggles to maintain her role as a mother in a place where freedom has been taken from her. 'I’m serving 18 months and hope to be released early. It’s hard raising a child here, but I chose not to give up on being with him,' she explains. 'He was just 40 days old when he came to prison with me. The hardest part is that there are no other children here, and he doesn’t have experiences like other kids. But the most important thing is that he’s with me. My sentence is under two years, and the court approved this arrangement. Other mothers aren’t given this option.' 'All the inmates treat him like ‘the wing’s child.’ They play with him and are kind to him. I take him to routine checkups at the well-baby clinic with a prison escort. He watches TV, and the guards take him to the yard to play. He thinks this is his home,' she says. When asked about her fears of returning to prison in the future, she firmly responds: 'I will never come back here. When he’s 18, I’ll tell him about this time. He might ask about his childhood, and I’ll have to explain that he spent his first year behind bars.' Between violence and trauma Neve Tirtza’s wings are divided into specialized sections, each tailored to the diverse needs of its inmates and detainees. The Savyon Wing houses women without a history of drug use or those who have completed long-term rehabilitation. It primarily accommodates detainees serving lengthy terms and is known for its population of inmates with no disciplinary infractions. Other wings cater to various stages of detention and rehabilitation. Wing 1, referred to as the 'Advanced Wing,' is designated for inmates and detainees in the later stages of rehabilitation. In contrast, Wing 2 serves as an entry-level wing for newly detained women, including short-term detainees. This wing is deliberately devoid of televisions to prevent any risk of disrupting legal proceedings. The Therapeutic Wing (Wing 3) includes two specialized departments, each with 16 beds: the 'Circles' department focuses on addressing violence, while the 'Alma' department specializes in trauma treatment. Adjacent to this is Wing 4, a smaller ward serving as an intermediate step in the rehabilitation process. Wing 6, or the Rehabilitation Wing, is intended for inmates in the advanced stages of their sentences. Four women in this wing even participate in community work programs. The facility also includes Wing 8, a section for minors that allows for integration with adult inmates under court approval. A distinctive feature of Neve Tirtza is the integration of convicted inmates and detainees across all wings. This approach enables women, even before their trials conclude, to engage in educational and occupational activities, benefiting from therapeutic resources available within the prison from the early stages of detention. 'Inmates who had killed their own children help care for the baby' Y., a former inmate, shares her experience in prison: 'It wasn’t easy. I went through dozens of arrests, but this was unlike anything else. It was extraordinarily challenging. The physical conditions were harsh, especially the overcrowding. I was in a small, 10-square-meter room with four other women, and at times even five. For half the day, we were crammed in there together. 'I was placed with women who had committed minor offenses, but that didn’t make them easier to share a room with. There were thieves and con artists; our relationships were fine, but far from perfect. Honestly? The murderers weren’t scary at all. As women, we understand what might drive someone to commit such an act. They’re as much victims as they are criminals. 'One well-known inmate who killed her son, for example, went through a significant process. I spent many hours with her. She’s eager to tell her story, but getting approval for that is a massive challenge. If someone manages it, they’ll find a fascinating tale. She’s quiet and unassuming, not at all like the image of her as the ‘queen of the prison.’ Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'On my first day there, I was thrown into a completely different world from my normal life, and what I encountered shook me. The other inmates actually treated me with great respect. I thought they’d dismiss me as some snob who was there for a few weeks, but it was the opposite. They welcomed me warmly and made me a sort of ‘queen of the cell.’ They wouldn’t even let me wash the dishes or clean the floors.' 'Inmates who had killed their own children help care for the baby in the wing; his mother doesn’t fear letting them hold him. But even here, there are fears—not of the women themselves but of being transferred to lower-status wings where the conditions are unbearable' The day in prison starts early, at 5:30 a.m., with a headcount of the inmates. 'After that, we go back to sleep because there’s nothing else to do,' Y. says. At 6:30 a.m., breakfast is served – a cup of milk and cottage cheese. At 7:00 a.m., the cells are opened, and the women get ready and head off to their assigned tasks. 'At 10:30, we’re locked back in the cells until 12:30, and then we’re let out for lunch.' 'After lunch, there are ‘free hours,’ when we’re allowed into a small 14.5-meter yard surrounded by barbed wire fences. I tried going there a few times, but it was even more depressing than staying in the wing itself. I saw a mother showing her child birds through the fences – it was heartbreaking.' 'Mothers in the wing support each other, even when it comes to caring for the children. Inmates who had killed their own children help care for the baby in the wing; his mother doesn’t fear letting them hold him. But even here, there are fears—not of the women themselves but of being transferred to lower-status wings where the conditions are unbearable.' 'On my release day, I left quietly without telling anyone. We went to the bakery across from the prison, had a cappuccino, and then headed home. Life seemingly went back to normal, but it leaves a mark. For example, when I entered a mall and saw security guards, I instinctively raised my hands for a search. The experience leaves scars and thoughts that linger. I still worry about the women I left behind and feel like I’m living half here and half there. Sitting in the yard, surrounded by barbed wire, with other offenders was something I’ll never forget. Playing truth or dare between those fences and hearing stories that brought everything back up—it’s an experience that stays with you,' Y. recounts. 'The first time I saw children playing—I just cried' Vered Refaeli began her career as a prison guard at Neve Tirtza and came full circle when she was appointed its commander a year and a half ago. In a farewell interview, she highlighted the unique challenges of running Israel’s only women’s prison as opposed to other detention facilities. 'Unlike other facilities where cells are designated for detainees only, here we house both detainees and sentenced inmates. A prisoner remains here from the moment of arrest until release, which creates unique management challenges,' Refaeli explained. Refaeli joined the Israel Prison Service after a close friend shared her positive experience. 'From the moment I started, I knew this was my path. I aspired to return here as a commander. It’s a demanding 24/7 role, but I love what I do. I have support from home and manage to balance work and family,' she said. 'We are an executive authority, and I do everything I can to ensure that the inmates leave better prepared to rejoin society. The female inmate population here differs significantly from male prisoners,' she said. 'Men often belong to gangs or organized crime, while women tend to commit crimes due to emotional or situational distress. When they enter prison, their entire world falls apart. About 60% of the women here come from a background of prostitution, so this facility has a strong rehabilitative purpose. 'On the one hand, there’s discipline and clear rules, but on the other, we provide tools to help them reintegrate into society. There are success stories, but unfortunately, there are failures too. Some inmates are released only to return quickly to the cycle of prostitution and the streets, while others seize the opportunity with both hands.' Discussing the success of rehabilitation programs at the prison, Refaeli said, 'We are seeing more and more successes. The facts speak for themselves—recidivism rates among women are significantly lower than among men. This is particularly striking when you look at the big picture: out of 22,000 inmates in the Israel Prison Service, only 188 are women.' The challenges, however, remain complex and varied. 'Every inmate who arrives with media attention poses a unique challenge for integration into the prison wings,' she explained. 'But we are committed to treating everyone the same, regardless of the headlines their cases may have generated. I’ve seen high-profile inmates seamlessly integrate into wing duties and become just like everyone else.' For Refaeli, the most emotional moments come during family visits. 'Once a month, as part of a special program, children come to visit their mothers in prison. The first time I saw these visits—the laughter and the children playing—I just cried. As a mother, it really hit me,' she shared. These experiences, she admitted, have had a personal impact. 'I find myself asking more questions about everything, especially when it comes to children. My kids know about my work—they’ve even visited here. But yes, it’s something that leaves a mark. It messes you up a little inside.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjzo7k4rye	2024-12-21T10:09:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/Sysir00wNyg/Sysir00wNyg_0_91_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Slovenian broadcaster calls for Israel to be barred from Eurovisi...	The Slovenian public broadcaster formally urged the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) on Saturday to disqualify Israel from participating in Eurovision 2025, set to be held in Basel, Switzerland. In a letter to the EBU, the broadcaster cited ongoing political concerns as the basis for its appeal, becoming the first European nation to call for Israel's exclusion from the contest. Two additional proposals were reportedly raised in Slovenia: withdrawing from the competition if Israel participates or blacking out the screen during Israel's performance. However, these more drastic measures were shelved for now. The call follows a tense atmosphere surrounding Israel’s participation in Eurovision 2024, where several countries had pushed for Israel’s removal amid political tensions.

‘There’s no such thing as 100% protection, solution lies in offen...	For the second time this week, a missile from Yemen evaded interception; the IDF says lessons are being implemented, while experts stress it’s too early to draw conclusions; 'Results align with statistical expectations; it’s a journey and there's no end in sight yet' On Thursday, the IDF said that it scored a 'partial interception' after the warhead of a Houthi ballistic missile from Yemen exploded at a school in Ramat Efal, causing the building to collapse. However, in the latest missile launch early Saturday, it was clear the interception attempt had failed. Multiple interceptors fired at the missile missed their target, including the Arrow system. The missile struck a public park in Tel Aviv, narrowly avoiding a major disaster. Twelve people were lightly injured, and nearby apartments sustained heavy damage. The recent Houthi attacks serve as a stark reminder that the war is far from over and highlight the challenges Israel has faced in intercepting thousands of projectiles launched since the October 7 Hamas massacre. These include ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones launched from Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and Yemen. While Iran has shown restraint in the wake of severe setbacks and concerns over Donald Trump’s return to the White House, fighting with Hezbollah has ceased under a truce, and Hamas’ military capabilities have been decimated. The Houthis, however, persist in what they call a 'campaign of support' for Gaza. Even recent Israeli airstrikes in Yemen have not deterred further missile launches. Brig. Gen. (res.) Zvika Haimovich, a former commander of the Israeli Air Force's Air Defense Array, confirmed that unlike the incident in Ramat Efal, this time the interception attempt unequivocally failed. 'In this case, the clichés proved true—there’s no such thing as 100% protection or a foolproof guarantee,' Haimovich told Ynet. 'No matter how many weapons systems are involved—Arrow, David’s Sling or Iron Dome—success isn’t certain. You use every available tool for the specific threat, but you cannot ensure an interception in every scenario.' Despite the two interception failures, Haimovich emphasizes that the overall interception rate remains high and cautions against drawing premature conclusions. 'Two separate incidents happened close together in terms of time and the threat from Yemen. I wouldn’t link them or jump to far-reaching conclusions. We’re talking about dozens, even hundreds of launches—and over a broader time frame, the results align with statistical expectations,' he said. According to the IDF, the Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones toward Israel since the war began on October 7 last year. Most were intercepted or failed to reach Israeli territory. Saturday afternoon, another drone that entered the Gaza periphery—likely launched from Yemen—was intercepted. A dramatic video showed an attack helicopter engaging the drone, which exploded mid-air. Earlier this week, a Houthi drone was intercepted off Tel Aviv’s coast, and both a missile and a drone from Yemen were shot down on Monday. 'We’ve been at war for 15 months, and it’s not going to end tonight,' Haimovich added. 'The systems have performed excellently so far and will continue to do so. This is a competition, a process of mutual learning between us and our adversaries—Iran, the Houthis and various militias. Each side is trying to stay one step ahead of the other. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'While the threat has evolved, so have our capabilities. Since the beginning of the war, our Iron Dome, Arrow and David’s Sling systems have shown significant improvement, thanks to this ongoing learning process. It’s a journey with a beginning, a middle and no end in sight yet.' The IDF said that the failed interception overnight is still under investigation, with some lessons already implemented in interception and alert systems. 'No further details regarding aerial defense activities and the alert system can be given due to information security considerations,' the military said in a statement. 'We emphasize that aerial defense is not hermetic and the public must follow the Home Front Command instructions.' Brig. Gen. (res.) Doron Gavish, also a former Air Defense Array commander, explained the process behind the system's operations: 'The air defense array functions in stages. First, the target is detected. Then, its type is identified, followed by the interception process. The initial stages worked as intended, which is why an alert was issued. However, the interception phase failed, likely due to a technical malfunction that caused the miss.' Gavish dismissed the possibility that a new type of missile had been used in the attack. 'What we encountered is the same missile from the same family that has been launched at Israel previously,' he said. 'Hundreds of missiles have been fired at Israel, and in the overwhelming majority of cases, the systems’ performance—especially the Arrow system—has been effective.' He emphasized that the incident underscores repeated warnings from the IDF that the public must adhere to Home Front Command instructions, as air defense systems are not foolproof. 'This is not a new threat,' he noted. Gavish argued that the solution lies not just in defense but also in offense: 'Defense is meant to mitigate the threat and save lives, but to truly address the enemy, offensive action is also necessary. We’ve seen the Air Force operating there, and in my view, if the Houthis continue launching missiles, this will not be the last strike.' Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai highlighted the difficulty of obtaining high-quality intelligence on the Houthis, given their distance from Israel. He stressed the urgency of quickly gathering intelligence to strike missile production and launch sites, noting that the Iran-backed Houthis have only a limited number of such facilities. On Israel’s interception challenges, Ben-Yishai pointed to the future deployment of the Iron Beam laser defense system, which will enhance the country’s air defense capabilities. Ben-Yishai outlined two potential reasons for the failed interception overnight. The first is that the missile was launched on a 'flattened' ballistic trajectory or from an unexpected direction, meaning Israel’s or U.S. warning systems in Saudi Arabia failed to detect it in time, leaving interceptors unable to maneuver effectively. The second, and more likely scenario, according to him, is that Iran has developed a maneuverable warhead. Such a warhead separates from the missile during the final third of its trajectory and maneuvers mid-flight—executing pre-programmed course changes—to hit its designated target. The warhead of any ballistic missile is hypersonic. Once it re-enters the atmosphere, it uses small rocket engines or fins for navigation during its maneuvering phase. This maneuvering, conducted at speeds of Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound), poses a significant challenge for air defense systems. Ben-Yishai noted that this could explain why the warhead of Thursday morning’s missile struck a building in Ramat Efal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjj1pv4ske	2024-12-21T08:09:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/rkmraUNB1g/rkmraUNB1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How Iran recruits minors in Europe for attacks on Israeli targets...	Bloomberg reveals growing concern in Europe, especially Scandinavia, over Iranian operatives recruiting teens via social media to target Israeli sites; officials hope Iran’s setbacks may shift its focus to rebuilding internally instead of spreading terror In a series of unsettling incidents across Europe, young criminals, some as young as 13, are being recruited by Iranian-linked operatives to target Israeli and Jewish interests, according to a Bloomberg report. The report lists several disturbing incidents of teenagers and adolescents directed by their handlers to carry out such attacks. In Sweden, a 15-year-old boy attempted to locate the Israeli embassy with a loaded gun in a taxi, while in Gothenburg, a 13-year-old fired shots at an Israeli defense firm. In another case, a 16-year-old planted explosives outside the same facility. Authorities attribute these actions to Iran-affiliated actors exploiting local criminal networks to further Tehran’s agenda in Europe. The attacks, as reported by Bloomberg, underscore how Iran’s covert operations against Israel are extending beyond the Middle East, raising concerns among European governments about social tensions tied to immigration. Both Sweden and Norway have issued warnings about Iranian-backed operations, with Norway temporarily raising its terror alert in October and deploying armed police to its borders. The report notes that Iranian operatives are using social media platforms like Telegram, TikTok and WhatsApp to recruit minors and young adults, often from immigrant communities. Payments for these illicit activities range from €120 for a petrol bomb attack to €1,500 for an assassination. While some recruits are motivated by ideological frustrations over Israel’s actions in Gaza, others are drawn by financial incentives and, in some cases, are unaware they are acting on behalf of a foreign power. The Swedish Security Service confirmed instances of recruits being oblivious to their Iranian connections. 'There are cases where the proxies aren’t aware or don’t realize that they are acting on behalf of a foreign power,' the agency said in a statement earlier this year. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For example, a 15-year-old suspect targeting the Israeli embassy in Stockholm in May was intercepted by police before reaching his destination. The suspect had to call for directions to the embassy, highlighting the amateur nature of some of these plots. The incidents detailed in the report are part of a broader Iranian effort to destabilize Europe while maintaining its regional influence amid setbacks in its proxy network. The October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel prompted a severe Israeli response, weakening Iran’s regional allies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. Despite these losses, experts warn that Iranian-linked operations in Europe remain a significant threat. Peter Nesser, a terrorism researcher at Norway’s defense research institute, explained to Bloomberg that Iranian actors 'reach out to potential mercenaries on platforms like Telegram, TikTok or WhatsApp.' These platforms are also used to 'direct and advise recruits during their illegal operations.' One high-profile attack involved a 16-year-old in Sweden using homemade explosives against Israeli defense company Elbit Systems. The report notes that while investigations were unable to trace the financiers, prosecutors believe the attackers were acting under Iranian direction. Sweden’s immigrant communities, struggling with integration and economic disparity, have become fertile ground for recruitment. Around 20% of Sweden's population is foreign-born, with 40% of migrants reporting a lack of integration. Organized crime gangs, already entrenched in these communities, are being exploited by hostile state actors like Iran. Neighboring Norway has begun observing similar patterns, with warnings of 'Swedish conditions' becoming a regular feature in political debates. Norwegian authorities are increasingly concerned about the spread of youth-driven violence and gang recruitment. The report highlights how the rise in youth-driven violence has fueled support for far-right parties in Sweden and Norway. In Sweden, the far-right Sweden Democrats have influenced policies, including the introduction of youth prisons for offenders under 15. Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store has also pledged tougher measures on youth crime, while the opposition Progress Party is advocating stricter policies ahead of next year’s elections. As European governments navigate these challenges, warn that Iran might intensify its covert operations in Europe. Nesser told the publication that Tehran could either retreat to rebuild domestically or escalate attacks to project power abroad. 'They might also try to create more havoc,' Nesser said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyp9b8er1l	2024-12-21T05:53:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/30/B1h4FGINA/B1h4FGINA_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israel bolsters air defenses after Houthi missile hits Tel Aviv, ...	IDF helicopter intercepts suspected Houthi-launched drone over southern Israel, hours after ballistic missile struck following failed interception attempts; military says lessons from incident being implemented but declines to provide details Less than 12 hours after a ballistic missile from Yemen caused significant damage in Tel Aviv, alarms sounded again in southern Israel on Saturday, signaling another suspected attack from Yemen. The IDF confirmed that a drone penetrated Israeli airspace near the Gaza periphery communities of Talmei Eliyahu, Ein HaBesor and Gevulot. An IDF combat helicopter intercepted the drone, believed to have been launched from Yemen, with dramatic footage of the interception shared by officials. Meanwhile, the IDF provided preliminary findings from its investigation into the earlier missile strike on Tel Aviv's Jaffa quarter, which struck a residential area shortly after air raid sirens were activated. This marks the second Houthi missile to hit central Israel in three days, following a strike near Ramat Efal. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF acknowledged failed interception attempts and a short response window between the alarm and the missile’s impact. 'The incident is still being thoroughly examined,' the military said, adding that some lessons learned from the event are already being implemented to improve interception capabilities and warning systems, though it did not disclose further details due to 'information security considerations.' Officials emphasized that while efforts to enhance air defense are ongoing, the system cannot guarantee full protection. '[T]he public must follow the Home Front Command instructions,' the IDF statement concluded. The missile strike on Jaffa caused extensive damage to buildings in the area, and six people were injured by shattered glass, requiring hospitalization. Fire and Rescue Services reported that the missile exploded in a courtyard surrounded by residential buildings, amplifying the damage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj3z3b4hkl	2024-12-21T05:23:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/SkdqydeNBJl/SkdqydeNBJl_0_140_1600_901_0_small.jpg

The children’s voice: The 9-year-old leading Israeli advocacy	Ben Carasso, a fourth-grade student, proves that there is no minimum age required for supporting Israel on the international stage While many adults struggle with the challenges of Israeli advocacy, unexpectedly a nine-year-old boy from Tel Aviv manages to deliver the message in the most authentic manner possible. Ben Carasso, a third generation to Holocaust survivors, has decided to take a mission upon himself: to be the voice of Israeli children during the war. 'I may be nine years old, however, I carry a hundred years of family history on my shoulders. Ever since my great-grandfather made aliya', Ben says with a mature smile. 'I am familiar with my family’s past, which is inseparable from Israel’s and the Jewish people’s history'. Despite the national task, he has taken upon himself, Ben makes sure to emphasize being a child, like all children: 'I go to school, train in floor and apparatus gymnastics, meet with friends and go to the Scouts'. How do you combine childhood routine with a national mission? 'This is what intrigues children around the world', he explains. 'I am a child, just like them, but the war changes my whole routine. In my videos, I share the reality –from friendship with a child who was evacuated from Kiryat Shemona to the pain I feel about my friend’s father who was kidnapped and murdered in Gaza'. What would you like to be when you grow up? Perhaps an ambassador? 'There are many possibilities, but I will certainly continue to do everything for the benefit of Israeli public diplomacy'. How do you find the current Israeli public diplomacy status? 'It’s not simple. I see how our enemies attack us, even myself, through comments to the videos. There is a significant lack of knowledge and ignorance about us in the world. We have a lot of work ahead in spreading the truth, and the children’s voice must be heard'. Boundless advocacy Through English-language advocacy videos, Ben reaches audiences in many countries - from Canada to Australia to Brazil to Iran. One of his videos even reached half a million views, an impressive achievement that led to collaborations with senior Israeli advocacy leaders. This week, Ben will go aboard on an advocacy trip to London, where he will talk to schoolchildren and students about life in Israel and give them tools to deal with antisemitism.

Eylon Levy, who was the 'National Public Speaker' during the war, adds: 'Ben is an ideal example of the civic outreach project.

Loud explosion and shattered windows: Central Israel residents re...	Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis continue to threaten Israel after failed interception leads to ballistic missile landing near Jaffa playground and injuring 16; 'The sirens started but we didn't make it to shelter' For the ninth time this month, Yemen’s Houthis launched a missile or drone toward Israel, causing significant damage. Forty-nine hours after a ballistic missile hit Ramat Ef’al after being partially intercepted, attempts to intercept another ground-to-ground missile fired from Yemen failed Saturday overnight, resulting in a hit near a playground in Jaffa. Sixteen people received minor injuries, 21 were hurt on their way to shelters or suffered anxiety and the damage to nearby buildings was extensive. This took place despite the third Israeli Air Force strike in Yemen since the war began — and the first in the Houthis’ stronghold of Sanaa. Footage showed severe damage to apartments in nearby buildings, with debris scattered in a child’s bedroom and on a child’s bed. 'The siren started, but we didn’t make it to the shelter. There was a very loud explosion, all the windows shattered, the blinds broke and the bed was covered in glass. Everything’s ruined, everything’s broken,' said Dolly Tamar Eliyahu and Ben Nof, residents of one of the damaged buildings. Ezra Bador, another resident of the building, said: 'Just as I was heading to the shelter, there was a serious explosion resulting in broken blinds and windows. It’s terrifying. My balcony and bedroom sustained heavy damage. One of the windows completely fell out.' Karin Goldschmidt and Eden Tsesleski, who live in a neighboring building, recounted, 'We ran to the staircase on the third floor but didn’t make it to the shelter. It felt like the explosion was right above us — the whole building shook. 'After the explosion, we moved on to the shelter, waited for about 15 minutes, then came out to see the damage. The apartment was hit; all the glass is shattered.' Hadra Abu-Hatzeira, who lives near the impact site, said, 'The explosion happened before the siren sounded, so I didn’t make it to the shelter. The house shook and the windows shattered. It was frightening and shocking. 'My kids wanted to take me somewhere else but I refused — I’m staying here. My medication’s at home, I’m ill, and I won’t leave. The siren nearly made me faint; I have epilepsy. I’m terrified, but for now, I’m staying in the neighborhood.' Meir Ohana, a resident of a nearby building, recounted, 'I woke up to check on my cat and just then, there was a serious explosion. If I hadn’t gotten up, the glass would’ve shattered over my bed. We didn’t hear the siren — it was very faint.' He added that all residents of the building were evacuated following the strike. A paramedic from Magen David Adom’s (MDA) motorcycle unit, Yosef Kurdi, recounted: 'I was at home when I heard a loud explosion. I immediately went to the scene and saw extensive blast damage to the nearby buildings. Large MDA teams arrived quickly and we began scanning the buildings as the injured started coming out of their homes.' MDA paramedic Noam Weisbuch and senior paramedic Noa Shimoni added, 'The scene was complex because the blast damage affected apartments in the surrounding buildings. Initially, we treated several people with minor injuries from shattered glass and anxiety.' 'We searched the apartments, treated and evacuated 16 people who sustained minor injuries, including a 3-year-old girl and provided care to those suffering from anxiety,' they added.

US drops $10 million bounty on new Syrian ruler	US delegation meets Ahmad al-Sharaa in Damascus, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara Leaf calls him 'pragmatic' and voices hope for Syrian-led future; announcement follows US strike killing Islamic State leader in Syria Abu Yusif The United States announced Friday the removal of a $10 million bounty on Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Syria’s jihadist movement. The decision came after Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf met al-Sharaa in Damascus, following his emergence as Syria’s de facto leader after President Bashar Assad’s ousting. 'We discussed the critical need to ensure terrorist groups cannot pose a threat inside Syria or externally, including to the U.S. and our partners in the region,' Leaf said. 'Based on our discussion, I told him that we would not be pursuing the Rewards for Justice reward offered.' Leaf emphasized the importance of unity and sovereignty, saying, 'We fully support a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that results in an inclusive and representative government which respects the rights of all Syrians, including women, and Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious communities.' She added that U.S. policy seeks to stabilize Syria economically and politically, free from Iranian and Russian interference. In a significant move, three senior U.S. diplomats, including Leaf, Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens and newly appointed Syria Special Advisor Daniel Rubinstein, visited Damascus for the first time in 12 years. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Their mission focused on engaging directly with Syrian civil society and new leadership as the country transitions post-Assad. The visit does not signal an immediate reopening of the U.S. Embassy, officials clarified, saying that recognition will depend on concrete actions by Syria's new leaders. Leaf described al-Sharaa as 'pragmatic' and said Iran would have no role in Syria’s future. 'Iran’s destructive influence has no place here, but Turkey will have a role due to its security interests as a neighboring country,' she added. The Biden administration had previously grappled with how to engage with Syria’s new leadership, given the designation of leading rebel groups as terrorist organizations. Leaf highlighted that the U.S. calls for an inclusive political process respecting human rights and minorities, noting internal pressure on Syria’s interim leadership to meet these demands in exchange for lifting sanctions. The U.S. State Department reiterated its commitment to supporting Syrians’ vision for their future and announced plans to engage directly with Syrian activists, civil society leaders and diverse communities to guide U.S. policy. Meanwhile, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) announced on Friday the elimination of Islamic State leader Abu Yusif in an airstrike in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor province. The strike, which also killed another Islamic State operative, was part of CENTCOM’s mission to disrupt terror networks. 'We will aggressively target these leaders and operatives, including those trying to conduct operations external to Syria,' CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla said, citing concerns over ISIS's intent to free more than 8,000 detained terrorists in Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hynxwh7hje	2024-12-20T10:51:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/S17LLJB7Ekl/S17LLJB7Ekl_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Impossible without Shin Bet': IDF struggles to finalize probe in...	Senior IDF officers review only intelligence portion of October 7 probe, with issues like Air Force and Southern Command's roles pending; General Staff officials insist Shin Bet, responsible for monitoring Hamas SIM cards, must be included The IDF General Staff convened Friday to review the most sensitive investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 Hamas attacks, focusing on the night leading into the assault. However, the presentation was only partially completed, addressing intelligence shortcomings but leaving operational issues—such as the actions of the Operations Directorate, Southern Command and the Air Force—unresolved. Tensions surfaced during the session, with senior officers criticizing the exclusion of the Shin Bet security agency from the process. 'It’s impossible to investigate the events of October 7 without Shin Bet,' a senior IDF official told Ynet. Shin Bet is primarily responsible for intelligence in Gaza, including the Hamas SIM card monitoring project—a key warning system that failed to signal the impending assault. 'We will not finalize this investigation without Shin Bet’s input,' the official added. Key figures scrutinized include IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Operations Directorate Head Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk, Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and then-Military Intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, who resigned over the failures. According to the IDF, responsibility for assessing the events fell largely to the Southern Command’s intelligence officer, who underestimated the attack as a localized raid rather than a full-scale war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Discussions also highlighted that Southern Command chief Finkelman arrived at the command center only an hour after the attack began at 6:30 a.m., following an intelligence assessment that did not warrant heightened alert levels. Chief of Staff Halevi convened a situation assessment at 8 a.m., further delaying the involvement of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-defense minister Yoav Gallant until the attack was well underway. The Shin Bet has yet to present its findings, despite holding critical intelligence on Hamas’ shift to emergency protocols, as revealed through SIM card activity. This omission led to inadequate preparedness across IDF units, including Gaza Division forces. Concerns over revealing intelligence sources reportedly constrained Shin Bet’s warnings. Adding to the challenges, the IDF faces mounting pressure to conclude its broader investigations, including assessments of Southern Command, Gaza Division and specific border communities. Defense Minister Israel Katz had set a January deadline for completing the probes, but military officials now acknowledge they are unlikely to meet it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkc064xs1x	2024-12-20T10:04:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/20/rJBk114mByl/rJBk114mByl_0_8_853_481_0_small.jpg

The IDF addressed on Friday Syrian reports claiming that Israeli troops shot a protester during a demonstration near the village of Ma’araba in southwest Syria, saying that soldiers called on protesters to retreat from the area during the demonstration, which opposed Israeli military activity in the region. 'The force identified a threat that required action to neutralize and operated according to rules of engagement, resulting in a leg injury to one protester,' the IDF said in a statement. The military emphasized that it does not interfere in events occurring in Syria and reiterated its commitment to protecting Israel and its citizens.

In first in-person contact, US officials meet Syria's HTS in Dama...	U.S. diplomats visiting Damascus held Washington's first in-person official meetings with Syria's new de facto rulers led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on Friday and discussed with the former al Qaeda affiliate the future of Syria's political transition. The United States, other Western powers and many Syrians were glad to see militias led by HTS topple President Bashar Assad, but it is not clear whether the group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move toward democracy. Western governments are gradually opening channels to HTS and its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former commander of an al Qaeda franchise in Syria, and starting to debate whether to remove the group's terrorist designation. The U.S. delegation's trip follows contacts with France and Britain in recent days. The State Department's top Middle East diplomat Barbara Leaf, Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens and Senior Advisor Daniel Rubinstein, who now is tasked with leading the Department's Syria engagement, are the first U.S. diplomats to travel to Damascus since Assad's rule collapsed. 'They met with representatives of HTS to discuss transition principles endorsed by the United States,' a State Department spokesperson said. 'They also discussed regional events and the imperative of the fight against ISIS,' the spokesperson added. The delegation engaged with civil society groups and members of different communities in Syria 'about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,' the spokesperson said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhgr7qbje	2024-12-20T08:11:46-08:00	
Germany denies citizenship to Syrian migrant over refusal to ackn...	Palestinian who lived in Syria until 2016 denied German citizenship after saying in interview, 'Israel is not a state'; court upholds decision, citing requirement to recognize Israel’s right to exist for citizenship approval A German court has ruled against granting citizenship to a Syrian migrant who refused to recognize Israel's right to exist, according to court records made public this week. The man, a Palestinian born and raised in Syria who moved to Germany in 2016, applied for citizenship in August 2022 in Regensburg, Bavaria. Despite passing the citizenship test in November 2022, German intelligence flagged the applicant for frequenting a Salafist mosque, displaying aggressive behavior in discussions with authorities and expressing extreme views toward Israel. In a follow-up interview in August 2023, the applicant said, 'There is no Israel. There are Jewish people, but Israel is not a state.' When pressed, he reiterated his stance, adding, 'I don’t want to talk about Israel anymore,' and hinted at his opinion that Jews should 'vacate the area for Arabs.' Despite multiple opportunities to revise his statements, he did not retract them. After his application was denied, the man claimed he recognized Israel as defined by the Oslo Accords but criticized Israel's policies in the so-called 'occupied territories.' His lawyer argued that the questions posed were 'leading and complex,' asserting his client was a 'tolerant and cosmopolitan individual' whose limited German language skills hampered his ability to address Israel's complicated history. The lawyer also maintained that anti-Zionism should not be equated with antisemitism. Regensburg authorities countered, saying the applicant showed 'no fundamental understanding of democracy,' and his refusal to recognize Israel’s existence reflected 'deep-seated anti-Zionist antisemitism.' The administrative court upheld the city’s decision in October, emphasizing that German citizenship requires alignment with the country's core values, including recognition of Israel’s right to exist under international law. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In his ruling, the judge noted, 'To obtain a German passport, individuals must accept Germany's moral obligations, including the recognition of Israel's existence.' This case precedes a new law enacted in June by Germany’s outgoing government, which mandates that citizenship tests include questions on Jewish life in Germany and Israel’s right to exist to safeguard Jewish security. The Regensburg decision aligns with the principles of the law, reinforcing its aims even before its implementation. Antisemitic symbols at the Christmas market An evangelical church in Darmstadt, Germany, has suspended Pastor Manfred Werner after antisemitic and anti-Israel items were displayed for sale at a 'Christmas Market for Peace and Anti-Colonialism.' Part of the market's proceeds were intended to support aid for Palestinians. The event, held last weekend and co-organized by the local evangelical community and the group Darmstadt for Palestine, featured items including maps of 'Palestine' that excluded Israel, symbols of Hamas—an organization banned in Germany—and stickers with slogans such as 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' Another item displayed the phrase 'Never Again for Everyone,' drawing a parallel between the Holocaust and the situation in Gaza. The market also showcased red inverted triangle symbols associated with Hamas, which denies Israel's right to exist. Pastor Werner, who will miss Christmas services due to the suspension, reported receiving death threats following the incident. He apologized to his congregation and the local Jewish community, saying, 'Certain groups exploited our hospitality and naivety, pushing us into a position I have avoided my entire life.' The church has filed a police complaint, asserting that while it supports humanitarian aid for those in Gaza, it categorically rejects language delegitimizing Israel or supporting Hamas. However, church leaders faced criticism for not addressing the event's title, which labeled Israel as a colonialist force. Critics argued the incident could have been avoided if church organizers had reviewed the Instagram content of Darmstadt for Palestine beforehand. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycxqfqhjl	2024-12-20T07:05:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/06/17/10040891/10040891_0_57_1300_732_0_small.jpg

'We will remain here until an arrangement is reached that guarantees Israel’s security,' Netanyahu said. 'This place’s importance to our security has only increased, especially in light of the dramatic events unfolding below us in Syria.' Defense Minister Israel Katz, who accompanied Netanyahu, reinforced the need for the IDF’s continued presence. 'Based on my directives, the IDF must quickly complete fortifications, deploy defensive measures and ensure proper conditions for the troops to prepare for an extended stay,' Katz said. Katz highlighted the Hermon’s strategic value for Israel’s defense. 'Our presence at the Hermon’s peak strengthens security and adds a layer of observation and deterrence against Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, as well as extremist rebel factions near Damascus,' he said. Katz also noted that despite advancements in long-range weaponry, 'elevation and control of key observation points remain vital. We will not allow a return to the threats seen on October 7 along Israel’s borders.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyou1gmb1l	2024-12-20T06:49:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/20/rJ4VYg7r1x/rJ4VYg7r1x_2_102_719_405_0_small.jpg
Erdogan urges West, US to halt Israeli invasion of Syria	Speaking at Cairo summit of eight Muslim-majority nations in coalition's first meeting since fall of Assad, Turkish president declares Turkey has no intention of withdrawing from Syria Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that the U.S. and the West must prevent Israel from invading Syria. Erdogan was in Cairo for a summit of eight Muslim-majority countries, in their first sit-down since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad. He said Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan would soon be visiting Syria to work on the 'new structure' to be established in the country. 'If Syria establishes a truly stable structure with this new formation, it will, in my view, hold a very strong position in the Islamic world,' he said adding the Turkey will not leave Syria. In an interview with the BBC on Thursday, Syria's rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said his country was exhausted by war and posed no threats to the West or any of its neighbors. He claimed Israel should not be concerned over pro-Iran or Hezbollah militias on its borders. 'those threats are a thing of the past,' he said. Meanwhile, two journalists working for Kurdish media outlets in Turkey were killed in northern Syria on Thursday after their vehicle was allegedly targeted by a Turkish drone, Turkish media and a pro-Kurdish party said.

In a speech in the Turkish parliament on Friday, Gulistan Kilic Kocyigit, co-chair of the DEM Party, condemned the killing of the journalists. 'This attack is a crime against humanity,' she said.

Air Force pilot on Yemen strike: 'After we release the munitions,...	Major D., 26, pilot describes Yemen strike as his longest mission, requiring problem-solving mid-flight, peak focus for a precise attack on Houthi targets and a safe return home after the high-stakes operation Major D. touched down at the Ramon Air Base at 5:30 a.m. Thursday, just as the sun rose, completing the longest flight of his career. The 26-year-old F-16 pilot had spent six hours in the narrow cockpit, flying 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) to Yemen for a precision strike while a ballistic missile headed in the opposite direction toward Israel. His jet was one of 14 aircraft participating in the operation targeting Houthi sites in Yemen. For the first time, strikes hit the capital Sanaa, alongside other coastal port cities. The mission involved five targets with dozens of components, obliterated by 80 heavy bombs. D. and his squadron prepared meticulously for the operation over two weeks. To endure the grueling hours in the air, D. prioritized rest, including a nap the afternoon before the flight, ensuring he was physically ready for one of the most perilous missions of his career. 'The main difficulty is performing at the critical moment during such a long mission, requiring me to stay sharp and alert at all times,' D. told Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth. 'The flight there was easier because there was plenty to do—inspecting weapon systems, navigating crowded skies and mid-flight refueling, which is always more challenging in the dark. Approaching within 10 meters of a refueling plane at night is no easy task,' he explained. During the mission, D. and his navigator faced a tense moment when a fuel tank malfunction indicator lit up. Far from Israeli territory, they had to resolve the issue mid-air to avoid delaying the operation. 'We practice many scenarios in advance because technical or operational issues often arise on such long flights,' he said, emphasizing the pilots' preparation for such contingencies. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The critical moment, the 'money time,' is when we release the munitions. There is no take two. Watching the bomb drop and strike the Houthi tugboats was a powerful experience,' he recounted. 'When I saw the bright light of impact, I knew I hit the target. After that, some of the tension eased, and during the return flight, we could chat about personal matters—both with each other and with the other pilots.' D. said he and the others did encounter anti-aircraft fire, despite Iran supplying the rebels with ground-to-air missile systems. 'An officer in the Air Force war room synchronized all elements of the operation, from intelligence to communications, armaments and aerial command,' he explained. 'This kind of mission demands precise coordination of dozens of factors, all condensed into a few tense hours.' Another challenge was avoiding contact with civilian aircraft. 'We didn’t know a missile had been launched at Israel at the same time we were heading to Yemen,' D. said, underscoring the complexities of operating in international airspace. Assessing the strike’s impact on oil and energy facilities posed additional hurdles. 'It’s harder to evaluate results when the targets are so far away, unlike in Lebanon or Gaza,' D. noted. 'In this case, we carried out the strike in a unique way and used open-source intelligence the next morning to confirm the results through reports and footage from Yemen.' D. remains resolute about future missions. 'If they want a war of attrition, they’ll get one. At least we hit our targets—and we have more in the bank.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rywiacgs1x	2024-12-20T04:02:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/S1mKSWfB1g/S1mKSWfB1g_0_66_1280_721_0_small.jpg
D. sat for six hours in his F-16 cockpit to hit targets in Yemen	26-year-old pilot says the strike on Houthis was the longest mission in his career that involved solving problems mid-fight and maintaining full alert to carry out a successful attack and fly safely home Major D. landed back in Tel Aviv at 5.30 AM on Thursday in his F-16 fighter jet, just as the sun was coming up over the Ramon airbase. The 26-year-old pilot had just completed the longest flight in his career thus far, sitting for 6-hours in a narrow cockpit and flying 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) from Israel, to attack in Yemen, while a ballistic missile was heading the other way, toward Israel. His jet, was one of 14 planes involved in the strike on Houthi targets in Yemen including for the first time, in the capital Sanaa located in the center of the country. There were five targets, with dozens of components, that were hit by 80 heavy bombs in the capital and in the port cities along the coast. D. and his mates prepared for the mission for two weeks. D. tried to get a good night's sleep before the strike including a nap in the afternoon ahead of the flight, to prepare his body for hours in the air and one of the more dangerous missions he had been assigned. 'The main difficulty is performing at the critical time in such an long mission, requiring me to be sharp and alert at all times,' he tells Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth. 'The way there was easier because there was quite a bit to do - inspection of the weapons systems, navigation in a crowded sky and refueling mid-flight which is always harder in the dark. Its no easy task to approach 10 meters at night in such a big plane,' he says. D. and his navigator had a tense moment when a light indicating a malfunction in the fuel tank was turned on. They had to fix the problem in the air, far from Israel, so as not to delay the mission. 'We practice many scenarios and reactions in advance because there are always technical or operational problems on such long fights.' He says the pilots are prepared for them. 'The money-time is when we drop the munitions. There is no take two. To see the bomb fall, and hit the Houthi tug-boats was a powerful moment,' he says. 'When I saw the bright light, I understood I hit the mark. Then some of the tension was released and on the flight back, we could talk about personal stuff, between ourselves and with the other pilots.' D. and the others did not encounter anti-aircraft fire although Iran supplied the Houthi rebels with ground-to-air missile systems. An officer in the Air Force war room prepared the pilots and synchronized the air control units and the aerial command plane that was on the mission. 'This kind of operation demands a precise connection of dozens of factors, intelligence, communications, computers, armaments, planning, information security – that are all concentrated into a few tense hours.' D. said another challenge was to avoid contact with civilian aircraft. 'We did not know about the missile that was launched at Israel at the same time as our planes were on their way to Yemen,' he said.

Israel’s regional war is over'	Chuck Freilich: 'We won this war, and it's a major success' Israel's regional war has come to an end, according to Chuck Freilich, senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) and former Deputy National Security Advisor. 'The war ended a long time ago—at least with Hamas and Gaza,' Freilich told ILTV News. 'I would say the war ended in Gaza in January, and since then, what we have had are a few limited operations.' Freilich noted that the conflict with Hezbollah concluded about a month ago, while Iran is currently weakened, and Syria's Assad regime has collapsed. 'We won this war, and it's a major success, especially if you consider the horrific way in which it began,' he said. 'Israel has done a great deal to ensure its security, I would say, for the medium to long term. And it's a huge achievement. We should start changing the discourse on these matters.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syrgfkqbyx	2024-12-20T03:56:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/10/H1zOo4So6/H1zOo4So6_0_162_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Should Israel maintain a civilian presence in Gaza for security?	Ariel Kahana: 'Once civilians live there, you gain support internally and, at times, even externally' If Israel wants to ensure the safety of its citizens in the south, it must maintain a civilian and security presence in Gaza, according to Israel Hayom diplomatic commentator Ariel Kahana. Speaking earlier this week to ILTV, as Israel nears a potential ceasefire-for-hostage deal with Hamas, Kahana emphasized that a presence in Gaza, similar to Israel's approach in Judea and Samaria, is crucial for national security. 'If you don’t have a civilian presence, at some point the international community pushes you out, or you want to avoid more casualties in Israel,' Kahana explained. 'Once civilians live there, you gain support internally and, at times, even externally.' Kahana expressed confidence that the hostage deal would move forward, with broad support from the Israeli Knesset. However, he cautioned that releasing hundreds of terrorists poses significant risks, as past experiences have shown. He pointed to October 7, orchestrated by terrorists released in 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit deal, as a stark reminder of these dangers. Shalit, an Israeli soldier, was captured by Hamas in June 2006 and held until October 2011. 'There is no doubt whatsoever that terrorists released from Israeli jails often return to terror, rebuild Hamas, or plan new attacks,' Kahana said. 'It’s a clear and undeniable risk.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjmrhrghkg	2024-12-20T03:03:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/29/r1vxmyrYR/r1vxmyrYR_0_77_736_415_0_small.jpg
World's oldest complete Ten Commandments tablet sold for over $5 ...	The buyer, who chose to remain anonymous, plans to donate the artifact to an unnamed Israeli institution The world's oldest complete Ten Commandments tablet has been sold at auction for over $5 million. The buyer, who chose to remain anonymous, plans to donate the artifact to an unnamed Israeli institution, according to Sotheby’s auction house in New York. The 155-pound marble slab, inscribed with the commandments in Paleo-Hebrew script, dates back to 300-800 A.D. It is the only complete example of its kind from antiquity. The final gavel fell after more than 10 minutes of intense international bidding, fetching a price far beyond expectations. The tablet was unearthed in 1913 during railroad excavations along Israel’s southern coast but was initially overlooked as historically significant. It served as a paving stone in a local home until 1943, when it was purchased by a scholar who recognized its importance. While the inscription closely follows the Biblical commandments familiar to both Jewish and Christian traditions, it omits the third commandment against taking the name of the Lord in vain. Instead, it includes a directive to worship on Mount Gerizim, a holy site for the Samaritan community. The donation to an Israeli museum will ensure this extraordinary artifact is preserved and accessible for future generations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkmencmbyl	2024-12-20T02:27:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/13/HJ00Z8DFEJe/HJ00Z8DFEJe_0_14_632_356_0_small.jpg
Is now the time to stop Iran's nuclear program?	Cliff May: ' think there’s a possibility for something to happen in a new Trump administration' Now is the moment for the Western world to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, says Cliff May of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. In an interview with ILTV News, May explained that with Hamas weakened and seeking a ceasefire, Hezbollah contained, and the Assad regime in Syria collapsing, this is the ideal time for Israel or the United States to 'totally destroy the Islamic Republic of Iran’s ability to make and deliver nuclear weapons.' However, May expressed doubt that the U.S. would take action under President Joe Biden’s leadership. Instead, he stated, 'I think there’s a possibility for something to happen in a new Trump administration.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1atxagh1e	2024-12-20T02:15:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/rkOQDXlBJx/rkOQDXlBJx_0_54_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Proposed law seeks to block Palestinian statehood	While many Israelis and Knesset members oppose the creation of a Palestinian state, it’s unclear if incoming U.S. President Donald Trump shares this stance The Knesset's Land of Israel Caucus is set to push the 'Israel Security Law,' which would require at least 80 MKs to approve any agreement involving territorial concessions, including those in Judea and Samaria. This law aims to block the creation of a Palestinian state in future agreements. At the initiative of the Land of Israel Caucus, the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee, led by MK Simcha Rothman—who also co-chairs the Caucus—will soon hold hearings on a proposed bill to expand Israel's Referendum Law. The amendment would apply to all of Judea and Samaria, as well as to Israel's territorial waters. The bill, backed by 23 MKs from factions like Likud, Religious Zionism, Otzma Yehudit, Shas, and others, calls for Rothman to convene a special hearing to amend Israel’s Basic Law: Referendum. The amendment would require a referendum or a special majority of 80 MKs to approve any deal involving territorial transfers or the establishment of a Palestinian state. Notably, this law would close the loophole that allowed former Prime Minister Yair Lapid to transfer territorial waters to Lebanon in a previous agreement. While many Israelis and Knesset members oppose the creation of a Palestinian state, it’s unclear if incoming U.S. President Donald Trump shares this stance. Moreover, Saudi Arabia has made the establishment of a Palestinian state a condition for peace with Israel. If this bill progresses, international reactions, even from allies, will be worth watching.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy11ptamh1l	2024-12-20T02:03:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/22/HkWctMAGJg/HkWctMAGJg_0_139_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu to skip 80th anniversary of Auschwitz liberation fearin...	Polish deputy foreign minister tells daily newspaper his country is obliged to respect the rulings of the ICC which issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his then defense minister for alleged war crimes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend the ceremony marking 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz in Poland, out of concern he may be arrested after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes committed during the ongoing Gaza war, the Polish Rzeczpospolita daily newspaper reported on Friday. The paper quoted deputy Polish foreign minister Władysław Bartoszewski, responsible for coordination of the ceremony scheduled to take place on January 27 with the participation of dozens of world leaders who said, 'We are obliged to respect the decisions of the ICC.' Jews were the vast majority of victims in the largest of the Nazi death camps but despite that, the leader of the Jewish state will be absent from the ceremony, while dozens of other world leaders are expected to attend. The paper said Foreign Minister Gideon Saar would likely represent Israel on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, although some officials said Israel would be represented by Education Minister Yoav Kisch. According to the Polish newspaper's report, Israeli authorities did not even request the prime minister's attendance in the ceremony. They knew what the response from Warsaw would be. President Issac Herzog is also expected to be absent, unlike the ceremony a decade ago that marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz camp, when then president Reuven Rivlin was in attendance.

Syrian shake-up stokes Israeli concerns over Jordanian border	Israel-Jordan relations face strain amid Gaza war and regional instability; concerns over Syria’s turmoil, border security and tensions over Jerusalem’s holy site challenge the fragile peace between the neighbors Thirty years into the fragile peace between Israel and Jordan, scenes of instability in Syria have raised concerns within the government and defense echelon that a similar scenario in the Hashemite Kingdom would spill over into Israel. Peace between the two neighbors has almost always been characterized by tension and a tricky balance between political interests and conflicting loyalties. Israel’s engagement in a lengthy regional war, which began over a year ago when the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist group stunned Israel in a massive attack, has further challenged the relationship. Throughout the war, there have been demonstrations in front of Israel’s embassy in the Jordanian capital of Amman. Jordan sent humanitarian aid to Gaza during this period on several occasions, another sign of the constant efforts to maneuver between a highly pro-Palestinian public sentiment and its pro-Western alliance with both Israel and the United States. 'Jordan was always considered the weakest and most unstable actor in the region, and yet the most stable at the same time,' Cl. Res. Ron Schatzberg, the Economic Cooperation Foundation co-director and an expert on Israel-Jordan relations, said. 'Its strength lies in its weakness, and its government shows a certain openness to extremist elements in order to allow them to vent while applying substantial covert intelligence efforts to contain them.' The ripple effects of the fall of the Bashar Assad regime at the hands of the extreme Islamist movements in Syria could potentially reach Jordan. This event would have a dramatic impact on Israel. Jordan’s strategic position in the region has everyone eyeing it. Earlier this week, Israeli media reported that the heads of the Secret Service and the military intelligence unit visited Jordan to discuss the latest regional developments and their implications. The two countries share a 480-kilometer-long border, which is Israel’s longest. It is estimated that around half of Jordan’s population is of Palestinian descent, making relations with Israel a contentious issue in the Hashemite Kingdom. Throughout the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Jordan has tried to position itself as the guardian of the Palestinian cause. There have been numerous attempts throughout the war to smuggle weapons into Israel, mostly from Syria, through the border aimed at reaching Palestinians in the West Bank in order to carry out attacks in Israel. In recent months, there have been several attacks along the border, including the murder of three Israeli border crossing employees shot dead by a Jordanian terrorist. According to data from the Israeli Population and Immigration Authority, there has been an increase in the number of illegal infiltrations through the border with Jordan in recent years. The fence along the lengthy border is incomplete, and the topography, sometimes mountainous but filled with tangled flora, makes surveillance challenging. 'There have been numerous attempts throughout the war to smuggle weapons into Israel, mostly from Syria, through the border aimed at reaching Palestinians in the West Bank in order to carry out attacks in Israel,' Dr. Ofir Winter, Senior Researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University, said. 'Iran has been trying to undermine the Jordanian regime in order to make Jordan another arena in its ‘axis of resistance’ against Israel.' Israeli media has reported that the army is acting in order to upgrade its presence along the porous border, including improving the barrier there and establishing a new brigade solely dedicated to the area. Jordan also has borders with Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, each hostile to Israel in varying degrees. Amer Sabaileh, a political analyst from Jordan, noted that while 'we cannot deny' that these incidents have occurred, 'to take these steps just from the Israeli side... It means that they are applying unilateral positions to the Jordanian government.' 'It's obvious that Israelis today are thinking just individually, let's say, about their security and about the need to see this moment of what's going on in the Middle East, or in the front, where the people can go in, that they need to secure and fall under the fear of having another presence at the table,' Sabaileh continued. It means, unfortunately, that what they might be doing does not show that this comes to the country with whom they share a peace treaty. 'It means, unfortunately, that what they might be doing does not show that this comes to the country with whom they share a peace treaty. It's something that they do just for themselves, securing themselves without caring too much about who is attempting the other side.' Adding to the complexities of the relationship, Jordan has custodianship over a holy site in Jerusalem, under contested Israeli sovereignty, highlighting the importance of the relationship and its delicacy. Called the Temple Mount by Jews and the Noble Sanctuary by Muslims, it is a hot spot holy to both Jews and Muslims and is at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There are limits to Jewish visitation near the compound, including a prohibition against Jewish prayer. These limits have been tested repeatedly by Jewish nationalists in recent years and in the past two years, especially since the swearing-in of Israel’s most far-right government to govern. As ultra-nationalist elements are a cornerstone of the current coalition led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, relations between Amman and Jerusalem have become increasingly strained. Relations between Netanyahu and Jordanian King Abdullah II were tumultuous even before the current government came to power. Over the years, there have been reports of the Jordanian king refusing to take calls from the Israeli premier. Despite the tensions often accompanying poor relations, diplomatic and security ties have continued throughout the years. 'The personal tension between the two leaders rose during the war because of the increasing difficulty Jordan had maneuvering between its strategic need to maintain the peace agreement with Israel and the public demand to annul it,' said Winter. Sabaileh said that he believes 'peace on the Jordanian and different sides is peace by obligation.' When comparing the Kingdom to other countries in the region, he stated, 'The Emirates model is a different model and different concept because they don't share borders.' 'They don't have heritage that's complex. It's just they decide the peace, so it's much easier.' Winter noted that 'Jordan is especially sensitive to any development in the Palestinian arena due to its demographic make-up and the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Kingdom.' According to Winter, there are several reasons for the increased friction between the two. First, there is concern that the war in Gaza will spill over into the territories under Palestinian control in the West Bank. Extreme ultra-nationalist voices in the Netanyahu government have called for the establishment of a Palestinian state in Jordan. This move would allow them to expel West Bank Palestinians. 'The greatest fear of the Hashemite Kingdom is the people in Israel who believe Jordan should be a Palestinian state,' said Schatzberg. 'In the eyes of the Jordanian regime, the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank would guarantee the survival of the Jordanian kingdom.' According to Schatzberg, instability in the Palestinian West Bank, which borders Jordan, is perceived as a far greater threat to its stability than scenarios similar to what was witnessed in neighboring Syria earlier this month. 'There isn’t a lot of appetite for such an overthrow in Jordan, which saw how often in the Arab Spring governments were replaced by even more oppressive governments,' he said. 'However, there is always fear that there will be extremist elements who will take advantage of a population in a dire financial situation. Netanyahu and his coalition partners rule out the establishment of a Palestinian state, a position that many Israelis have increasingly adopted in the wake of Hamas’ attack on Israel last year. In addition, Jordan is concerned by the erosion of the status quo in the Jerusalem holy site. But also, it has a difference of opinion with Israel regarding the fate of Gaza at the end of the war. While Israel refuses to accept the return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which currently controls the West Bank, to Gaza, Jordan views the PA as the leading candidate to rule the territory. 'There is no immediate threat to Jordan’s stability,' Winter explained. 'But any instability could pose a direct threat to Israel’s national security. Jordan and Israel have close security cooperation, and Jordan serves as a buffer between Israel and potential threats from Iran, its proxies and Islamist, pro-Palestinian elements. Any destabilization along the border will require Israel to deploy more forces in order to protect the border, which will be a significant burden, both in terms of its defense and financially.' Definitely, problems can arise. We have a difficult economic situation. We have desperation as well. But I don’t think that the same elements that make Syria collapse quickly are there in Jordan. Sabaileh agreed with the sentiment. 'Definitely, problems can arise. We have a difficult economic situation. We have desperation as well. But I don't think that the same elements that make Syria collapse quickly are there in Jordan.' In May and September of this year, when Iran attacked Israel directly with a barrage of missiles and drones, Jordan played an instrumental role in thwarting the attack. Criticized by pro-Palestinians and Arab states opposed to Israel, it was a position Jordan adopted without giving it much publicity, as it has done regarding much of its cooperation with Israel. 'The whole relationship is kept under the radar by the Jordanians,' said Schatzberg. 'The more the relations with Israel are in the headlines, it creates unrest amongst the public. The Palestinians in Jordan are always suspicious of the regime, its degree of cooperation with Israel and to what extent it actually looks out for Palestinian interests.'

Any destabilization along the border will require Israel to deploy more forces in order to protect the border, which will be a significant burden, both in terms of its defense and financially.' Definitely, problems can arise. We have a difficult economic situation. We have desperation as well. But I don’t think that the same elements that make Syria collapse quickly are there in Jordan. Sabaileh agreed with the sentiment. 'Definitely, problems can arise. We have a difficult economic situation. We have desperation as well. But I don't think that the same elements that make Syria collapse quickly are there in Jordan.' In May and September of this year, when Iran attacked Israel directly with a barrage of missiles and drones, Jordan played an instrumental role in thwarting the attack. Criticized by pro-Palestinians and Arab states opposed to Israel, it was a position Jordan adopted without giving it much publicity, as it has done regarding much of its cooperation with Israel. 'The whole relationship is kept under the radar by the Jordanians,' said Schatzberg. 'The more the relations with Israel are in the headlines, it creates unrest amongst the public. The Palestinians in Jordan are always suspicious of the regime, its degree of cooperation with Israel, and to what extent it actually looks out for Palestinian interests.'

Sweden will no longer fund UNRWA aid agency, minister says	Swedish Aid Minister, Benjamin Dousa says his country plans to increase its overall humanitarian assistance to Gaza next year via alternative agencies such as the World Food Program Sweden will no longer fund the U.N. refugee agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) but instead provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza via other channels, the Nordic country's aid minister, Benjamin Dousa, told Swedish broadcaster TV4 on Friday. Israel, which will ban UNRWA's operations in the country from late January, has repeatedly accused the agency of being involved in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel that triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. Sweden's decision to end funding for UNRWA was in response to the Israeli ban, as it will make channeling aid to the Palestinians via the agency more difficult, Dousa said. Sweden plans to increase its overall humanitarian assistance to Gaza next year, he added. 'There are several other organizations in Gaza, I have just been there and met several of them,' the minister said, naming the U.N. World Food Program as one potential recipient.

The Iranian arm Israel is finding hard to cut off	Israeli strikes in the Yemeni capital mark the end of restraint against the Iran-backed Houthis that remain one of Tehran's final operating proxies; Power cuts make Yemeni citizens fear serious war against Israel When Israeli Air Force fighter jets were already in the air last night to strike 2,000 km (1243 miles) from Israel and end weeks of restraint in response to repeated Houthi attacks, it was another reminder that the war in this country has not disappeared. Meanwhile, millions of residents in central Israel were awakened in the middle of the night by sirens following the launch of a missile from Yemen. The interception failed, and its warhead exploded on a school in the Ramat Ef’al neighborhood of Ramat Gan. An hour later, the Israeli Air Force bombed a series of strategic Houthi targets, including their stronghold in Sana’a for the first time. However, an indication of the difficulty in inflicting significant damage from such a great distance came later that afternoon, when a drone launched from Yemen was intercepted off the coast of Tel Aviv. In recent weeks, since the cease-fire with Hezbollah, which was battered in Lebanon and the subsequent collapse of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, the Houthis have essentially become one of Iran's last remaining operational proxies. In fact, they’ve even intensified their attacks against Israel. Wednesday’s operation marked the third IDF strike against the Houthis, two and a half months after the previous one. As before, Israel claimed significant strategic damage was inflicted, but the Houthi attacks persist. The IDF said that the new strikes aimed to disable Houthi-controlled ports, targeting eight tugboats. However, sources at the central port in Hodeidah countered that they still have additional vessels capable of towing ships. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi vowed in a televised speech on Thursday that the group's actions would continue as part of what it calls the 'Gaza support campaign.' 'They keep escalating, and we don't care about their aggression,' said al-Houthi, who leads a terrorist organization seemingly indifferent to the suffering of his people. His terror group, which withstood years of Saudi bombings that resulted in mass civilian casualties, remains defiant. Al-Houthi declared that the strikes wouldn't affect the 'escalation under phase five of support for Gaza.' Al-Houthi also claimed that his group launched 1,147 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles or drones, many of which targeted commercial ships, significantly disrupting a crucial trade route for the global economy in the Red Sea throughout the war. Attacks on ships have also effectively shuttered Eilat's port, with a dramatic reduction in the number of vessels arriving and some workers being furloughed. According to the IDF, the Houthis have fired over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel since October 7, 2023, most of which were intercepted or failed to penetrate Israeli territory. Ynet's security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai assessed that the operation is unlikely to deter the Houthis or impair their ability and intent to continue launching missiles and UAVs at Israel. Worse, he noted, they’ll continue targeting global commercial and military shipping in the Red Sea, causing significant economic disruption to energy transport – a campaign they've been waging for over a year. His prediction was reinforced Thursday afternoon when the IDF announced it had intercepted a drone off the coast of Tel Aviv without triggering alarms, in accordance with policy. It’s believed the UAV was launched from Yemen. Ben-Yishai explained that the Houthis, a Shiite jihadist-ethnic group, are determined to demonstrate that, unlike Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranians, they remain steadfast, fighting to support Gaza, which they perceive as under attack by Israel. Alongside Shiite militias in Iraq, the Houthis likely anticipate that a cease-fire in Gaza is imminent as part of an emerging hostage deal. He added that the difficulty in targeting them also stems from a lack of intelligence capabilities, with Israel having limited resources to allocate for intelligence gathering at Yemen's distance. The U.S. over the past also hoped year to deter the Houthis due to the severe disruptions in the Red Sea trade route. Still, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has avoided targeting their strategic assets as Israel has, which has previously frustrated Jerusalem. While the Americans and British conducted numerous strikes, these were relatively limited and aimed at intercepting missiles and drones about to be launched. Washington remains concerned about significant escalation that could ignite a regional war. Even the U.S. strike in Sana’a on Monday was effectively aimed at empty Houthi headquarters. Will the Yemeni people turn on the terror group? Still, the Israeli Air Force’s strikes were extensive in scope despite the significant challenges with a source in Sana’a reporting that they caused panic in the city. For the first time, power plants in the Yemeni capital were hit and thousands of families were reportedly left without electricity. 'People woke up in shock. The capital of Yemen woke up in shock. I went to my neighbors, whose buildings depend on government electricity and they had no power,' the source said. He noted that while more expensive private generators were more commonly used in the past, access to government-supplied electricity had recently expanded, with about 50% of residents relying on it. 'We're afraid of what’s to come because it’s the first time power stations have been targeted,' the source added. 'We’ve gotten used to the fact that hills and military sites are always attacked, whether empty or containing soldiers and equipment but this time it was directed at civilian-essential facilities.' 'This could turn the public against the Sana’a regime, which has plunged the people into chaos and war with Israel. Many fear a repeat of the scenarios in Syria and Lebanon,' he continued, referencing the fall of Assad's regime and the fighting against Hezbollah. 'However,' the source stressed, 'some people don't care about the incidents – they say this is an ideological and religious war with Israel and that it’s an honor.' Many Houthi supporters in the capital gather every Friday for massive rallies as part of their 'Gaza support campaign.' In an interview with Reuters, a resident and Houthi supporter said he wasn’t afraid. 'We've been fighting their tails for more than 10 years,' he said, referring to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 'So now, when we're fighting face-to-face with the Zionists and Americans? We're not scared at all. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Threats against Houthi leaders Over 60 bombs were used in the operation according to the military, hitting 'Houthi military targets along the western coastline and deep within Yemen.' The first wave of strikes began along Yemen's coastline at 3:15 a.m., followed by a second volley at 4:30 a.m. near Sana’a. The operation involved 14 fighter jets targeting ports at Ras Issa, Hodeidah and Salif, as well as fuel and oil tanks and a power station in Sana’a. Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened to target Houthi leaders themselves, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu adding: 'This morning, the Air Force attacked strategic targets of the Houthis in the port of Hodeidah and deep into Yemen. We did this in response to repeated Houthi attacks against civilian targets in Israel. Last night they attacked a school in Ramat Gan.' 'After Hamas, Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last arm of Iran's axis of evil. They are finding out, and will find out, the hard way that whoever harms Israel – will pay a very heavy price,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syqn1fgryg	2024-12-19T14:02:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/SJ4SqlfrJg/SJ4SqlfrJg_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

Indictment details how Mohammed Saadi delivered information to Hezbollah and its affiliates asking to join them in their cause and fight for them Israel's Northern District Prosecutor's Office filed an indictment on Thursday against Mohammed Saadi, 19, from Nazareth, for providing information to Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah during the war. The charges accuse Saadi of contact with a foreign agent. The investigation revealed that Saadi, who was arrested by the Shin Bet and the police last month, had approached the terrorist organization several times in recent years and even asked to join its ranks in the fighting. Saadi also contacted the Lebanese Hezbollah-affiliated channel Al-Manar during the war, offering to send the station photos and videos. The investigation also found that Saadi provided these organizations with information regarding rocket impact sites, aircraft movements and the locations of IDF forces. 'The investigation of this case once again highlights the fact that elements of the Shiite axis, led by Iran, actively promote terrorism in Israel, including through recruiting Israeli residents to serve their espionage needs,' the Israel Police and Shin Bet said in a joint statement. 'The Shin Bet and police view any connection with terrorist organizations with great severity and warn the public of the potential for such ties to escalate into espionage operations that endanger Israel's security,' the two groups said in a statement. 'Security agencies will continue to operate within the scope of their legal authority, taking all necessary measures to thwart such threats and ensure severe consequences for all involved.'

Wrath of Allah': US indicts man who planned attack on Israeli Co...	FBI agent says he had conversations with Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan from Virginia on social media and the Islamic State supporter shared his plan to join terror organization and carry out targeted attacks against Jews The FBI arrested Virginia resident Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan on suspicion of planning an attack against the Israeli Consulate General in New York. According to the charges listed in the indictment, Hassan was exposed after providing a covert agent with detailed instructions on building and planting a bomb. The 14-page indictment which has been under seal outlines a network of well-planned actions, including detailed instructions for constructing explosive devices, purchasing weapons and tips for fleeing the U.S. after the attack. The investigation began in May when Fairfax County Police in Virginia received an anonymous tip about an X account promoting terrorism and supporting the Islamic State terror group (ISIS). The account, managed by Hassan, included posts praising terrorists and advocating violence against Jews and Americans. One post described Osama bin Laden as an 'idol,' declaring that 'the struggle against Islam's enemies will continue forever.' The FBI recruited an undercover informant who approached Hassan via X. Posing as someone sharing his extremist beliefs, the informant engaged Hassan in months of conversations during which Hassan revealed his intentions and actions. In November, Hassan sent the informant the address of the Israeli Consulate General in New York, suggesting it as a target for an attack, calling it a 'symbol of world Jewry.' Hassan also provided a text for a 'martyrdom video' he planned to record before the attack, which included threats to Western countries and a declaration of the 'Wrath of Allah.' He instructed the informant to say: 'Your governments have been complicit in and utterly responsible for the deaths of millions of men, women and children across al-Sham, Iraq and our beloved Al Quds. Now the time has come for revenge.' Court documents revealed that Hassan instructed the informant on how to build a Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) explosive device, one of the most potent and commonly used by terrorist organizations. He also shared links for purchasing assault rifles and ammunition, recommending a Zastava rifle. During their exchanges, Hassan proposed various scenarios for the attack on the consulate and other locations, such as a mass shooting or detonating an explosive in a crowded area. He stressed the importance of live-streaming the event on social media as part of a 'global terror campaign.' Hassan also planned for the aftermath, advising the informant on how to escape the U.S. post-attack. He suggested fleeing to ISIS-controlled areas in Africa or other regions without extradition agreements with the U.S., stating: 'If you plan it right, you can evade authorities and find safe refuge.' The indictment against Hassan also included a history of social media posts praising al-Qaida leaders like bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri and celebrating attacks on Jewish targets worldwide. Hassan reportedly used multiple accounts to evade platform moderation. The U.S. Department of Justice announced that Hassan will face charges including disseminating information on constructing explosives, aiding terrorism and planning an attack against foreign diplomats. The district attorney's office handling the case said in a statement: 'This is one of the most severe cases of attempted attacks on a Jewish target on U.S. soil.' If convicted on all counts, Hassan faces a minimum of several decades in federal prison, with the possibility of life imprisonment without parole or even the death penalty, depending on the severity of the charges and the case’s terrorist context.

Investigative program '60 Minutes' set to release special episode including exclusive interview on pager operation attributed to Israel American outlet CBS announced on Thursday that a special episode of the investigative program '60 Minutes' will air in the United States on Sunday, revealing behind-the-scenes secrets of the pager operation that launched Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon. While Israel has yet to officially claim responsibility for the operation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to it in the past. According to the network, recently retired Mossad agents were interviewed for the program, speaking under condition of anonymity about how the covert operation was carried out and the decade-long preparations leading up to it. Instagram posts showed the agents and interviewer Lesley Stahl, who was reportedly holding one of the beepers allegedly prepared by Mossad. The investigation is scheduled to air Sunday at 7:30 p.m. local time (2:30 a.m. Israel time, early Monday morning). Axios quoted one agent as saying they tested the devices 'multiple times in order to make sure there is minimum damage. If we push the button the only one that will get injured is the terrorist himself. Even if his wife or his daughter will be just next to him, he's the only one that going to be harmed.' The pager operation was launched on September 17, following concerns that its execution was at risk of being uncovered. On the first day, Hezbollah operatives' pagers exploded in Lebanon and Syria.

Biden expected to visit Pope Francis in final international trip ...	The White House is expected to announce soon that President Joe Biden will visit the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis next month for what would likely be the final international trip of his presidency, according to three people familiar with the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House deliberations. Asked about the potential Vatican visit, White House officials declined to comment. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni also declined to confirm or deny any visit, noting that Vatican policy is only to announce papal audiences with visiting heads of state a few days before they occur. Biden, a practicing Roman Catholic, last met privately with Pope Francis earlier this year while in Italy for the Group of Seven leaders meeting. He also met with Pope Francisat the Vatican in 2021, when they had a wide-ranging conversation about climate change, poverty and the coronavirus pandemic. Their warm conversation also touched on the loss of the president's adult son Beau, who died of cancer in 2015, and included jokes about aging well. Biden's support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage has put him at odds with many U.S. bishops, some of whom have suggested he should be denied Communion. But following the Vatican meeting in 2021, Biden said Francis called him a 'good Catholic' who should keep receiving Communion.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1yqjwfb1g	2024-12-19T11:18:21-08:00

UN votes to seek World Court opinion on Israeli law banning UNRWA...	Norway-led resolution seeks International Court of Justice's opinion on Israeli legislation against the Palestinian aid agency and seeks to cement Israel's legal binding as a member state; Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon condemns move The UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a resolution against Israel initiated by Norway in support of UNRWA, with 137 countries voting in favor and 12 against. The assembly approved the motion requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding Israeli legislation affecting UNRWA. The move came in response to Israel's decision to ban the operation of the UN Palestinian refugee agency in the country from late January and obstacles faced by other UN agencies in their aid work in Gaza over the past year. The ICJ, known as the World Court, is the United Nations' highest court and its advisory opinions carry legal and political weight although they are not binding. The Hague-based court has no enforcement powers if its opinions are ignored. The resolution adopted on Thursday also expressed 'grave concern about the dire humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory' and 'calls upon Israel to uphold and comply with its obligations not to impede the Palestinian people from exercising its right to self-determination.' The new Israeli law does not directly ban UNRWA's operations in the West Bank and Gaza. However, it will severely impact UNRWA's ability to work. Top UN officials and the Security Council describe UNRWA as the backbone of Gaza's aid response. In a letter to the 15-member Security Council on Wednesday, Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said that 'replacing UNRWA with relief schemes that will adequately provide essential assistance to Palestinian civilians is not at all impossible.' 'Israel is willing and ready to work with international partners (and already does work tirelessly) so as to allow and facilitate the continued passage of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, and to ensure the unhindered provision of these necessary basic services, in a way that does not undermine Israel's security,' Danon wrote. The UN has long complained of aid obstacles in Gaza since the war between Palestinian terror group Hamas and Israel began on October 7, 2023. Danon spoke before the vote, saying: 'We’re repeating the same scenario where the priority is to attack Israel and undermine its right to defend its citizens. This time, the Palestinians are deploying a new tool in their diplomatic circus – the International Court of Justice.' 'While they exploit your indifference and the court’s submission to their terror-supporting agendas, 100 innocent civilians are still held hostage in Gaza by Hamas and the Iranian regime is racing toward nuclear weapons,' he added. 'While you dwell on the past, Israel is focused on the future – one not dominated by the forces of Iranian evil,' Danon said.

Syrian city Hama celebrates liberation after decades of fear	After 61 years under Baath Party rule –54 of them under the Assad family – the people of Hama rejoice in newfound freedom while honoring lives lost to oppression Since her childhood, Hala, 57, dreamed of the day the Syrian regime would fall so she could dance in Assi Square, in the heart of her hometown, Hama, in central Syria. That dream has finally become a reality, though Hala now lives as a refugee in Germany. She recounted the moment she heard that the oppressive regime had been overthrown. 'It was historic when Syrian state TV announced the regime’s fall and Bashar Assad’s escape. I wished I could have been in Hama, where Assad’s father killed my father and brother in 1981, and from where Assad the son displaced us in 2012,' she said. Hama, a city with a long history of resistance, first rose against Hafez Assad’s rule in 1980. The retaliation was swift and brutal. Assad dispatched military forces, led by his brother Rifaat Assad, to crush the uprising. The result was catastrophic: widespread destruction, mass killings, mass arrests and the forced displacement of thousands of residents. Hala vividly recalled the horrors of the massacre. She shared how men over the age of 12 were rounded up and executed. Her grandmother’s quick thinking saved her younger brother, hiding him in her arms beneath her mourning clothes. After Assad’s fall was announced, Hala joined her children in the streets of Berlin, waving the Syrian revolutionary flag she had long hoped would replace the regime’s symbols of tyranny. Hama’s long struggle Since the 1982 massacre, Hama endured systemic oppression, limited access to basic services and discriminatory policies, much like Idlib to the north. The city’s population suffered under collective punishment, with families of dissidents denied government jobs, access to health care, and even basic food subsidies. Residents lived in fear of arbitrary arrests, often disappearing into Assad regime prisons notorious for torture. When the Syrian revolution erupted in 2011, nearly one million Hama residents staged massive protests. Then-U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford even visited the city to demonstrate solidarity with the protesters. The move angered Damascus, with the Assad regime accusing foreign powers of inciting rebellion. Ford’s visit, however, was seen as a significant moral boost to protestors, who took great risks in continuing their demonstrations. The regime responded with a heavy hand, enforcing strict security measures and cracking down violently on dissent. This repression continued until the city’s liberation earlier this month. As the war progressed, Hama remained under tight regime control, with military checkpoints dotting every major road and curfews imposed to suppress dissent. Activists described the city as a 'prison under open skies.' Celebrations in Hama following the regime’s collapse were marked by a mix of joy and sorrow. Local residents described the liberation as bittersweet, honoring the memory of countless lives lost during the decades of struggle. The 1982 Hama Massacre, a dark chapter in Syria's history The February 1982 Hama massacre, lasting 27 days, stands as one of the darkest chapters in Syria’s history, Amnesty International noted in a recent report. Rights groups estimate that over 40,000 civilians were killed during the assault. Widespread atrocities, including rape, theft and destruction, were documented. Airstrikes on the city center were followed by indiscriminate violence on the ground, with military forces given unchecked powers. The massacre was part of a larger campaign by Hafez Assad to crush dissent from the Muslim Brotherhood, which had gained significant support in Hama. Entire neighborhoods were leveled, with artillery and tanks used against civilian areas. Survivors recount the eerie silence that followed the bombardments, with bodies left to decompose in the streets. The regime’s grip on Hama tightened in the massacre’s aftermath. Survivors were forced to remain silent, their collective trauma passed down to younger generations. Activists describe how the 1982 massacre became a symbol of the regime’s willingness to use extreme violence to maintain power. Now, a new era With the collapse of Assad’s regime, Hama residents joined massive nationwide protests, raising revolutionary flags and chanting slogans for a better future. 'People here feared the regime more than others due to past traumas, but today, the kingdom of fear has collapsed forever.' said Sawsan, a young protester in Hama. Her optimism was shared by many. Residents celebrated the end of 54 years of fear under the Assad family and 61 years since the Baath Party came to power through a military coup known as the March 8 Revolution, marking the start of one-party rule. They look forward to building a new Syria founded on justice, equality, and opportunity. > After an 11-day battle, opposition forces declared victory, forcing Bashar Assad to seek asylum in Moscow. Protests across Syria called for Assad to face justice for war crimes, with demands for trials in Syria or international courts. International observers have pointed out that the road ahead remains fraught with challenges. Decades of war have devastated Syria’s infrastructure, leaving cities like Hama without functioning hospitals, schools or sanitation systems. Moreover, divisions among opposition factions could hinder efforts to rebuild a unified state. Still, many see Hama’s liberation as a critical milestone in Syria’s long journey toward freedom and accountability. Hama’s liberation stands as a turning point in Syria’s modern history, offering a symbol of resilience and hope for the future.

Very good, everything exploded': Watch footage of fighter jets s...	Videos released by the IDF show fighter pilots carrying out precise strikes on military targets in Yemen using more than 60 bombs; Houthis deny claims port operations crippled The IDF released on Thursday footage of Israeli Air Force fighter jets attacks against strategic Houthi targets in Yemen. Dozens of aircraft flew approximately 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) overnight, striking the capital of Sana’a for the first time. Over 60 bombs were used in the operation according to the military, hitting 'Houthi military targets along the western coastline and deep within Yemen.' The targets included fuel and oil tanks, two power stations and eight tugboats, whose incapacitation, according to the statement, 'severely impacts Houthi military operations.' The IDF released footage of the attack featuring the communications of fighter pilots. In one exchange, a pilot is heard saying, 'That was a good hit. Alpha, very good.' Later, another pilot reports, 'Alpha, second bomb. Everything there exploded.' The strike in Yemen took place an hour after a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens across central Israel and overnight was partially intercepted by the Arrow air defense system. The warhead, however, was not intercepted and exploded on a school in the Ramat Ef’al neighborhood of Ramat Gan, causing extensive damage. The operation had been planned by the Air Force for several weeks, independent of Wednesday’s missile launch. Unlike the two previous strikes in Yemen – the last of which occurred more than two and a half months ago – targets in Sana’a, a Houthi stronghold, were also targeted. Power outages were reported in some areas with at least nine people killed according to some reports. The strike’s main goal was to disable the Houthis' port operations – numbering three in total. The military said this represented 'a severe economic blow.' Estimates now say all operations at Houthi-controlled ports have been paralyzed. The Houthis, however, dispute this. According to Reuters, sources at Hodeidah port reported that, while one tugboat was destroyed, other vessels at the port still allow for the movement of larger ships. The first wave of strikes began along Yemen's coastline at 3:15 a.m., followed by a second volley at 4:30 a.m. near Sana’a. The operation involved 14 fighter jets targeting ports at Ras Issa, Hodeidah and Salif, as well as fuel and oil tanks and a power station in Sana’a. Ynet security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai assessed that the operation is unlikely to deter the Houthis or impair their ability and intent to continue launching missiles and UAVs at Israel. Worse, he noted, they’ll continue targeting global commercial and military shipping in the Red Sea, causing significant economic disruption to energy transport – a campaign they've been waging for over a year. His prediction was reinforced Thursday afternoon when the IDF announced it had intercepted a drone off the coast of Tel Aviv without triggering alarms, in accordance with policy. It’s believed the UAV was launched from Yemen. The Houthis have vowed to continue attacking Israel as part of what they call their campaign in support of Gaza following the strike. The terror group’s spokesperson Yahya Saree said their attacks will persist 'unless the aggression against Gaza stops and the siege is lifted.' 'Israeli aggression will not deter Yemen or Yemenis from fulfilling their religious and moral duty to respond to the massacres in Gaza,' He added.

Suspected terror attack in Jerusalem: Elderly woman stabbed in he...	The 74-year-old woman called her daughter, and was taken to Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, where she is reported to be in stable condition; Shin Bet is involved in the investigation, and suspicion has grown that this was a nationalist attack A 74-year-old woman was stabbed Thursday morning in her home in Jerusalem by a suspect who apparently broke in. She was evacuated from the scene in moderate to serious condition. Hours later, Ynet learned that the General Security Service has been involved in investigating the case, and by evening suspicions grew that it was a nationalist attack. The police said the stabbing took place on a street in the city center. 'Police forces, including the Jerusalem District Criminal Investigation Unit, closed off the scene and began collecting evidence,' the statement said. 'The woman was evacuated by medical personnel, in serious condition as they described it, for further medical treatment. At this stage, the circumstances of the incident are unknown, and the police investigation is ongoing.' The police later issued a gag order on the investigation, stating that 'all avenues are being explored in order to reach the truth.' Forensic science lab personnel arrived at the apartment and began collecting evidence. The report of the woman's stabbing was received by the emergency 101 hotline in the Jerusalem area at 11:47 a.m., after the victim called her daughter and told her what had happened.

Putin says Israel main winner in Syria, denies loss in country	Russian president denies claims his intervention in Syria since 2015 has been in vain and says he's concerned about new Israeli position in area; Says will meet with Assad in the future Russian President Vladimir Putin denied on Thursday that Russia's nine-year intervention in Syria had been a failure, but expressed concern about Israel's military operations there since the toppling of his ally Bashar Assad. Putin, addressing multiple questions on Syria at a marathon annual news conference, said Moscow had made proposals to the new rulers in Damascus to maintain Russia's air and naval bases in the country. In his first public comments on the subject, he said he had not yet met Assad since the former president fled to Moscow earlier this month, but that he planned to do so. Putin played down the damage to Moscow from the fall of Assad, saying its military intervention in Syria since 2015 had helped prevent the country from becoming a 'terrorist enclave.' He said Israel was the 'main beneficiary' of the current situation. Soon after Assad's fall, Israel moved troops into the buffer zone on the Syrian side of the dividing line with the Golan Heights and conducted hundreds of air strikes to destroy Syrian army weapons and equipment. 'Russia condemns the seizure of any Syrian territories. This is obvious,' Putin said, saying Israel had penetrated to a depth of 25 km (16 miles) and got as far as fortifications that were built for Syria by the former Soviet Union. Putin said Russia hoped that Israel would at some point leave Syrian territory, but 'I have the impression that not only are they not going to leave, but they are going to reinforce there.' He said Turkey was also intervening in pursuit of its own security interests with regard to Kurdish fighters in Syria whom Ankara regards as terrorists. 'We all understand this. There will be many problems. But we are on the side of international law and for the sovereignty of all countries, while respecting their territorial integrity, meaning Syria,' Putin said. He said most people in Syria with whom Russia had been in contact about the future of its two main military bases in Syria were supportive of them staying, but that talks were ongoing. Russia had proposed using its Hmeimim air base to deliver humanitarian aid, and had also evacuated 4,000 Iranian fighters from Syria via that route, he said. In response to a question on the subject from a U.S. journalist, Putin said he would ask Assad about the fate of U.S. reporter Austin Tice, who is missing in Syria, and was ready to ask Syria's new rulers about Tice's whereabouts too. Russia's future with Trump Putin added that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on ending the war and had no conditions for starting talks with the Ukrainian authorities. Trump, a self-styled master of brokering agreements and author of the 1987 book 'Trump: The Art of the Deal,' has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, but has not yet given any details on how he might achieve that. Putin, fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with the Russian people, told a reporter for a U.S. news channel that he was ready to meet Trump, whom he said he had not spoken to for years. Asked what he might be able to offer Trump, Putin dismissed an assertion that Russia was in a weak position, saying that Russia had gotten much stronger since he ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022. 'We have always said that we are ready for negotiations and compromises,' Putin said, after also saying that Russian forces, advancing across the entire front, were moving toward achieving their primary goals in Ukraine. 'Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out, in my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.' It was reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine cease-fire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO. Putin said on Thursday that Russia had no conditions to start talks with Ukraine and was ready to negotiate with anyone, including President Volodymyr Zelensky. But he said any deal could only be signed with Ukraine's legitimate authorities, which for now the Kremlin considered to be only the Ukrainian parliament. Zelensky, whose term has technically expired but who has delayed an election because of the war, would need to be re-elected for Moscow to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, said Putin. Putin dismissed the idea of agreeing a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Any talks should take as their starting point a preliminary agreement reached between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the early weeks of the war at talks in Istanbul, which was never implemented, he added.

UN chief says Israeli air strikes in Syria must stop	Israeli airstrikes on Syria are violations of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity and 'must stop,' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday. Since Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted earlier this month, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes aimed at destroying strategic weapons and military infrastructure. 'Syria's sovereignty, territorial unity, and integrity must be fully restored, and all acts of aggression must come to an immediate end,' Guterres told reporters. Israeli troops also moved into a demilitari\ed zone between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights - created after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war - that is patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers. Israeli officials have described the move as a limited and temporary measure to ensure the security of Israel's borders but have given no indication of when the troops might be withdrawn. 'Let me be clear: There should be no military forces in the area of separation other than U.N. peacekeepers â€' period. Israel and Syria must uphold the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, which remains fully in force,' Guterres said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqidnzbkx	2024-12-19T06:11:48-08:00

The Houthis 'will learn the hard way', Netanyahu warns	Prime minister refers to Israeli attack on Houthi targets deep inside Yemen overnight in a Hebrew video statement; 'When Israel takes action against the Houthis, it is acting on behalf of the entire international community'; Following statement, Israeli Air Force intercepts drone from Yemen off coast of Tel Aviv Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made his first public statement on Thursday afternoon about Israel's overnight airstrikes on Houthi targets deep inside Yemen, in an operation dubbed Operation White City. The Houthis 'are finding out, and will find out, the hard way that whoever harms Israel will pay a very heavy price,' he said in a Hebrew-language video statement. 'This morning, the Air Force attacked strategic targets of the Houthis in the port of Hodeidah and deep into Yemen. We did this in response to repeated Houthi attacks against civilian targets in Israel. Last night they attacked a school in Ramat Gan,' Netanyahu said in the statement. 'They are not attacking just us – they are attacking the entire world. They are attacking the international shipping and commercial lanes. Thus, when Israel takes action against the Houthis, it is acting on behalf of the entire international community. The Americans understand this very well, as do many others,' he continued. 'After Hamas, Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last arm of Iran's axis of evil. They are finding out, and will find out, the hard way that whoever harms Israel – will pay a very heavy price,' he concluded. Air raid sirens jolted central Israel overnight, stretching from the Shfela region to the Sharon area, as the Arrow missile defense system intercepted a ballistic missile launched from Yemen. Following the interception of the Houthi missile, Israeli fighter jets targeted military sites belonging to Yemen’s Houthi forces along the western coast and inland regions of Yemen, the IDF announced early Thursday, marking its first operation in Yemen since September. On Thursday afternoon, the IDF intercepted an unmanned drone off the coast of Tel Aviv over the Mediterranean Sea. No alerts were activated before its interception. The IDF determined that the drone had been launched from Yemen. It is the ninth missile or drone attack by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels against Israel this month, including the overnight attack and two on Monday. The IDF said the overnight strikes on Yemen aimed to degrade Houthi military capabilities and prevent the use of targeted facilities for military operations, including the smuggling of Iranian weapons. The Houthis, aligned with Iran, have repeatedly launched UAVs and surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, most of which were successfully intercepted, according to the military. Yemeni media reported that two major power stations near the capital of Sanaa, Haziz to the south and Dhahban to the north, were struck, leaving much of the surrounding area without electricity. In addition, the Houthi-affiliated Al-Masirah channel reported strikes on oil facilities in Ras Issa and the port of Hodeidah, where multiple locations were targeted.

Drone threat from Gaza neutralized by Israeli Air Force near bord...	Two drones launched from Gaza breached Israeli airspace, triggering sirens in the Gaza border region; One drone was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force, while the other crashed near Kibbutz Urim; Incident underscores ongoing tensions along Gaza border The Israeli Air Force intercepted an unmanned aerial vehicle launched from the Gaza Strip over the border region in Israel on Thursday. This marks more than 14 months since the war began. No fatalities or injuries have been reported. At 11:45 a.m., alarms were triggered in Kibbutz Magen and Moshav Ein HaBesor, located within the Eshkol Regional Council in the Gaza border region. Shortly after, the IDF announced it was investigating the incident, and footage of the event began circulating. Incident resolved, residents informed Approximately 40 minutes after the alarms sounded, the Home Front Command issued a statement declaring 'the incident has ended.' Similarly, the Eshkol Regional Council informed residents they could safely exit their protected areas. 'The drone has left the Gaza border region, and the threat has been neutralized,' the council reassured residents. However, it later emerged that the situation was more complex than initially reported. The drone identified in the Gaza border region had seemingly 'disappeared,' leaving the military uncertain about its location, intended target or entry point. Further updates from the Eshkol Regional Council later revealed that two UAVs had infiltrated the area, prompting the alarms.

Katz gives IDF deadline for Oct. 7 probe	Defense minister instructs military chief to hand over all finding of inquiries already completed; in statement defense minister says they must be made public while government and coalition refuse national commission of inquiry Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi on Thursday to complete the military's investigation into the failings of the Oct. 7 massacre by the end of January and to deliver to him all those investigations that were already done and completed, so that they would be made public. 'It is the duty of the IDF to complete its investigation quickly and present the findings to the Israeli families and the public at large, so that lessons could be learned, and determinations made,' Katz said in a statement. The defense minister also said that no new appointments to top command positions must be made until the investigation results have been delivered to him. 'The defense minister must study the findings and understand their repercussions on possible candidates for promotion,' his office said. The deadline imposed by Katz comes as the government refuses to establish a national commission of inquiry into its failings and the failings of the security services ahead of the Hamas massacre and as members of the coalition have been outspoken about their refusal to allow such a commissioned to be paneled. Halevi criticized Katz after he learned from media reports that two of his appointments for generals have been suspended. 'The appointments of officers is not a privilege,' Halevi said. It is a necessity and a duty,' he wrote in a letter to the senior IDF command. The chief of staff was the first to assume responsibility for the IDF's failures and implied he would leave his position when the investigations into the massacre are completed. Members of the coalition have insisted on laying blame for the events leading to the massacre on the IDF and Shin Bet and have claimed that a national commission of inquiry, assembled by a Supreme Court Justice, would be bias against the government and therefore untrustworthy. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the decision by Katz to impose a deadline on the military chief was a 'positive and refreshing change,' compared to his predecessor's position.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syqmm5wbjg	2024-12-19T03:43:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/11/HkWgEeTyGJx/HkWgEeTyGJx_181_95_1100_619_0_small.jpg

French man gets 20 year sentence for enlisting men to rape wife	All 51 defendants guilty on Thursday in a drugging-and-rape case that horrified the world and transformed the victim who says she hopes the enormous interest in her case will help other women who have suffered sexual abuse A French court found all 51 defendants guilty on Thursday in a drugging-and-rape case that horrified the world and transformed the victim, Gisele Pelicot, into a stirring symbol of courage and resilience. Pelicot's ex-husband of 50 years, Dominique Pelicot, had pleaded guilty to drugging her repeatedly for almost a decade to rape her and to offer up her unconscious body for sex to dozens of strangers he had met online, while videoing the abuse. A panel of five judges sentenced him to the maximum 20 years in jail, as requested by prosecutors. The court imposed generally shorter terms than the four-to-18 years demanded by the prosecution for the other defendants, almost all of whom were accused of raping the comatose Gisele Pelicot. In all, the court found 47 of the defendants guilty of rape, two guilty of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault. A cheer went up outside the court in the southern French city of Avignon among the victim's supporters when news of the first guilty verdicts filtered out. Many of the accused had denied the charges, saying they thought it was a consensual sex game orchestrated by the couple and arguing that it was not rape if the husband approved. Dominique Pelicot, 72, denied misleading the men, saying they knew exactly what they were doing. 'I am a rapist like the others in this room,' he said during testimony. Gisele, who is also 72, waived her right to anonymity during the trial and demanded that horrifying videos of the serial abuse, which were recorded by her former husband, should be seen in court, saying she hoped this would help other women speak up. The trial has triggered protest rallies around France in support of Gisele, and spurred soul searching, including a debate on whether to update France's rape law, which at present makes no mention that sex should involve consent. Gisele stared down her abusers with steely determination in the packed courtroom day after day, scoffing at any claim that she might have been a willing participant. 'I've decided not to be ashamed, I've done nothing wrong,' she testified in October. 'They are the ones who must be ashamed,' she said. Horrifying Secrets The Pelicots' children, David, Caroline and Florian, arrived in court to hear the verdict alongside their mother. The siblings have spoken out forcibly against their father, rejecting his pleas for forgiveness. The defendants come from all walks of life - lorry drivers, soldiers, firefighters, security guards, farm workers, a supermarket worker, a journalist and the unemployed. The youngest suspect was just 22 when he entered Pelicot's bedroom, while the oldest was in his early 70s. Many had children and were in relationships. Most lived within a 50-km (31-mile) radius of the Pelicots' picturesque village of Mazan, which nestles in vineyards below Mont Ventoux. The case only came to light in 2020, when Dominique was caught trying to take photographs up the skirts of women in a supermarket. Police then discovered more than 20,000 photos and videos on his computer drives revealing the horrifying secrets that he had hidden from his now ex-wife for a decade. Police believe 72 men had gone to the house to rape and abuse Gisele, but they were not able to identify them all.

Gisele said she was worried she was developing Alzheimer's or had a brain tumour because of the memory gaps. She says she hopes the enormous interest in her case will help other women who have suffered sexual abuse, and brushes off praise for her own bravery in letting the world see her pain. 'It's not courage. It's determination to change things,' she told the court in October. 'This is not just my battle, but that of all rape victims.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjezuk11r1x	2024-12-19T03:02:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/B1Xb0DbH1e/B1Xb0DbH1e_0_68_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
The rise of the 'woke right:' A new threat to Israel and the West...	Epoch Times Associate Producer Karys Rhea explores the growing influence of the 'woke right' What happens when a rising conservative faction challenges 'America First'? In the latest episode of the ILTV News Podcast, Epoch Times Associate Producer Karys Rhea explores the growing influence of the 'woke right.' This controversial movement, characterized by anti-Zionist rhetoric and a fixation on revisionist history, is shaking the foundations of conservative values, Rhea said. With figures like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens at the forefront, the ideological battle raises critical questions: Is Israel’s role in American politics at risk? And can Donald Trump’s movement withstand this internal divide? 'These people say they are part of the America First movement. They’re very clear that they consider themselves patriots,' Rhea explained. 'These are people who are usually proud Christians, people who are anti-censorship, pro-faith, pro-family, anti-globalism, anti-Marxism, and anti-elitism. But people have observed that it seems like both their beliefs and their actions say otherwise.' Rhea highlighted, for example, that much like the woke left—which sees racism where it isn’t and ignores it where it is—the woke right does the same when it comes to Christian persecution. She said they overlook the routine slaughter of Christians occurring in Africa and the Middle East, where churches are being defaced and desecrated. 'They focus on who they think are the ultimate oppressors of Christians: Jews, right?' Additionally, Rhea referenced an analogy from author Bari Weiss: the woke left knocks down statues of America’s sacred history, while the woke right destroys their legacies. 'There is nothing wrong with talking about Martin Luther King or Winston Churchill and maybe discussing some of their flaws,' Rhea said. 'But that is not what these people are doing. They are coming with a wrecking ball, and they are trying to turn upside down the entire notion of history that we have to paint it as something different. 'And that is why I say fundamentally that these people hate America, and they hate the West, because they are trying to destroy it in order to create this new America that they want to see,' she said. Will this have an impact on the Trump administration, which Israel expects to be one of the most pro-Israel governments in a potential second term? So far, Trump has not appointed anyone who shares the woke right’s point of view, Rhea said. However, she added that she knows from insiders 'there is intense pressure on him to do so.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkgnfyzbye	2024-12-19T02:58:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/01/H1aGXdfZye/H1aGXdfZye_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Shrapnel from missile intercept near Knesset, school hit in balli...	IDF probes incidents; says school likely hit from part of the Houthi missile when it is intercepted; Knesset guards on Thursday found shrapnel from the intercept of a Houthi ballistic missile fired overnight. No sirens were activated in Jerusalem and the Knesset said no damage was caused by the shrapnel that was removed by police sappers. The IDF was investigating the incident. A school in Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv's neighbor to the east, suffered major damage and would be torn down. 'We heard the explosion at night, I’m in shock,' said Nir, whose children attend the school. 'This is the school I attended; my kids study here, and now they’ll need to move to a different school,' he said. The school’s main building collapsed, causing damage to nearby cars and homes. Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama announced that first- to fourth-grade students will study at a nearby school, while fifth- to eighth-grade students will switch to online learning. 'Destruction is extensive, and IDF is still investigating, but engineers have determined the school must be demolished. There’s a silver lining—the students will get a new school. Houthis can fire missiles, but we will remain resilient and united. Ramat Gan has robust protective measures, and we deeply appreciate the air defense system, but there’s no such thing as 100% safety,' said the mayor. Education Minister Yoav Kisch visited the school and stated, 'The impact was caused by the warhead after it was likely intercepted. I’m glad the Air Force struck the Houthis hard yesterday. The message that Israel’s strong arm will reach all fronts working against us must resonate across the Middle East. 'In terms of handling the incident, the children are already at an alternative school for the day. No one was hurt, and I estimate routine will return in two weeks. A new building is ready for occupancy, and we’ll move the children there. Psychological support and assistance are being provided, even though, thank God, none of the staff or children were harmed. Israel is strong, and we’ll overcome any challenge, and our enemies will feel the full force of our response.' 'This appears to be a missile strike. We are in the final stages of investigation, but the inquiry is not yet complete,' Col. Yehonatan Raz, a commander in Home Front Command told Ynet. 'We also inspected other buildings in the neighborhood to ensure there were no injuries or damage. We are still at war. In recent weeks, the volume of fire has decreased significantly, but we remain prepared to respond. All educational facilities in Ramat Gan have access to shelters or reinforced safe rooms. Even during the day, it’s likely this would have been a survivable event due to adherence to Home Front Command guidelines. The shelter at the school remained intact and undamaged.'

Hamas wants 7-day truce before hostage release; Israel demands so...	Sources tell Lebanon outlet that the terror group cannot compile a comprehensive list of living hostages without at least a week-without fighting; but expressed optimism, stating, 'An agreement could be reached very soon' Hamas officials told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar newspaper in Lebanon that negotiations in Doha are progressing well, with most issues resolved. However, two critical sticking points remain, according to the report published Thursday. The first dispute involves Israel’s demand for a comprehensive list of all hostages—both alive and deceased—held by Hamas and other Palestinian factions. Hamas officials reportedly insist that verifying such a list is impossible without at least a week-long ceasefire. Despite the impasse, sources suggest an agreement may be within reach 'very soon.' The second disagreement centers on Israel’s insistence that soldiers, including those injured, be prioritized in the initial phase of the humanitarian release deal. Hamas has reportedly rejected this, claiming it contradicts prior understandings of the release framework for Israeli hostages. Ofir Angrest, whose brother, IDF soldier Matan Angrest, is among those held captive in Gaza, said that 'toppling Hamas is not an option. We demand that soldiers be included in the deal.' Despite these differences, Palestinian factions reportedly believe that Israel’s seriousness in pursuing an agreement could resolve the remaining issues. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Sky News Arabia quoted a member of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s team as saying there has been 'additional progress in recent days' toward a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas reportedly informed mediators that it cannot provide an exact number of hostages it holds, which has delayed the release of further details. The deal is expected to proceed in stages. The U.S. official noted that both Israel and Hamas appear more determined than ever to end the war. Israeli officials are awaiting a formal list of living hostages from Hamas, emphasizing that their top priority is maximizing the number of living captives returned. Hamas has offered to include the bodies of deceased hostages to address any shortfall in living captives released during the first phase. For now, the negotiations continue, with both sides under pressure to strike a deal amid ongoing international mediation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjvrauwhjx	2024-12-19T00:39:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/SkfKvzyr1x/SkfKvzyr1x_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Syria tired of war, poses no threat, rebel leader says	Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Al-Golani says sanctions imposed on Syria under deposed leader Bashar Assad should be lifted and that his HTS group was a victim of the regime; assures West he does not seek to turn Syria into Afghanistan Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Al-Golani said Syria is exhausted by war and the rebels pose no threat to the West or any of Syria's neighbors. Al-Sharaa, who led the rebel force that took down the regime of Bashar Assad in a lightning offensive earlier this month said in an interview to the BBC that sanctions against Syria should be lifted. 'Now, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime. The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,' he said. He also said that his group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) should be taken of the list of terror organizations claiming it did not target civilians or civilian areas and were themselves the victims of Assad's cruelty. The HTS was known as and arm of the Islamist al Qaida terror group in Syria. After announcing it was breaking with the group, al-Sharaa attempted to convince Syrians and the world that he has turned away from the Jihadist ways of al Qaida, ISIS and the Taliban, and was seeking a moderate regime that would respect all minorities in the areas under its control. The new Syrian leader denied that he would turn Syria into a version of Afghanistan although he did concede that he was seeking a Muslim religious rule. 'We've had universities in Idlib for more than eight years,' Sharaa said, referring to Syria's north-western province that has been held by rebels since 2011.'I think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%,' he said refuting concerns that he would keep education from girls.

And any ruler or president will have to follow the law'. Since toppling Assad Western leaders said they were encouraged by al-Sharaa's public statements but that he would be judged by hid deeds. Thus far, the U.S. and Britain did not change their classification of HTS as a terror organization and a bounty of 10 million dollars, announced by the U.S., remains on the leader's head. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hka6g811hyg	2024-12-18T23:04:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/BJJ38yFmJg/BJJ38yFmJg_0_0_1024_576_0_small.jpg

IDF veteran, service dog expelled from bus, arrested and humiliat...	Kobi Levi recognized with PTSD prevented from boarding with his dog; after driver humiliates him and calls police, officers arrest the veteran and continue the humiliation; Police issues apology and suspends arresting officers An IDF veteran suffering from PTSD was prevented from using a public bus with his service dog and arrested by the police. 'It was a humiliating and terrible experience,' said 36-year-old Kobi Levi, after the traumatic event. The bus driver refused to allow him to board the bus with his service dog, despite Levi presenting the required certification. The confrontation with the driver culminated in Levi’s arrest, involving the use of force, threats with a taser, and being held in a detention cell for five hours—during which his dog was denied water. 'They tried to take my dog to a kennel in Tel Aviv and laughed at me,' Levi recounted. The bus driver confronted him in front of all the passengers, declaring that he would not continue driving until Levi got off the bus. When he refused to comply, the driver called the police. The officers also disregarded the certification Levi presented. Instead of instructing the driver to allow the service dog on board, they handcuffed Levi using force and took him to the police station. 'I was returning from a visit to a bereaved family. On the way back, I waited for the bus with Morpheus, my dog. When the bus arrived, the driver refused to let me board,' Levi told Ynet. 'The driver said he would not allow me on, stopped the bus, and declared he wouldn’t continue driving until I got off. I begged him to look at the certification and told him I was a combat veteran, but he didn’t care. He cursed at me and called the police.' Levi said five officers showed up after the driver alerted the police. 'I told them I was a combat veteran and showed them the certification for my dog, but it didn’t matter,' he said. 'After a few minutes, they told me I was being detained. One officer tried to put handcuffs on me. I told them they couldn’t handcuff me because of my mental health condition. They used force, injured my hands, and took me in a patrol car to the Ramat Gan police station.' At the station, officers threatened to use a taser on Levi and his service dog if he didn’t enter the detention cell. 'They injured my hands. Magen David Adom paramedics were at the station and treated me. After that, the officer in charge told me to go into the cell. I told him they couldn’t do that. He replied, ‘If you don’t go in, I’ll taser you and your dog.’ I went in handcuffed, and a few minutes later, they tried to take Morpheus to a kennel in Tel Aviv. They tried to get him to leave with them, but he wouldn’t go.' Levi claims he sat in the detention cell for five hours, barefoot and handcuffed. 'I sat in the cell for five hours without shoes, and they wouldn’t let me give Morpheus a bowl of water. After five hours, they released me without even conducting an investigation. The officer who arrested me and hit me cursed at the officer who sent me home.' 'Right now, I feel awful,' Levi added tearfully. 'I sat in a detention cell for five hours. They tried to take Morpheus out of the cell, but he wouldn’t leave. They humiliated me. It was a truly degrading experience on the bus in front of everyone. I felt completely broken; it was an awful feeling of humiliation. Five hours in a detention cell—for what? And the fact that this happened the day before the National Day of Recognition for IDF Wounded Veterans makes it even sadder and more shocking.' 'I’m very scared, crying a lot, and my hands hurt terribly,' Levi shared. 'They laughed at me from one of the police cameras, so I could hear it the entire time,' he added painfully. 'I heard one of the officers say four times, ‘I turned him into tahini,’ and it’s humiliating. I can’t calm down at all.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We regret the distress caused and clarify that the conduct of the officers is under investigation, and the necessary lessons will be learned,' the police said in a statement. 'The Tel Aviv District Commander views the incident in Bnei Brak, in which a citizen was arrested on a bus by police officers in a manner that contradicts the values of the Israel Police, with great severity. As a result, he has ordered an immediate inquiry into the event and has suspended the officers involved from operational duties until the investigation is concluded.' The Electra Afikim bus company also issued an apology: 'We deeply apologize to the passenger. The driver has been suspended pending the completion of a full investigation into the incident, and a disciplinary hearing will be held based on the final findings. We are conducting dedicated meetings with all drivers and company employees to reinforce procedures and prevent similar incidents.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said that suspending the officers involved was the right thing to do. 'I will not tolerate any form of violence, especially against combat veterans who have protected Israel with their lives. We will do everything to preserve their dignity.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj57naeb1x	2024-12-18T21:28:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/21/HkpvROMUR/HkpvROMUR_0_186_855_482_0_small.jpg
Separated for decades, Assad’s fall spurs hope for families split...	Sisters try to connect with oldest family daughter married to a Syrian 27 years ago says the collapse of the regime in Damascus makes contact easier The four sisters gathered by the side of the road, craning their necks to peer far beyond the razor wire-reinforced fence snaking across the mountain. One took off her jacket and waved it slowly above her head. In the distance, a tiny white speck waved frantically from the hillside. 'We can see you!' Soha Safadi exclaimed excitedly on her cellphone. She paused briefly to wipe away tears that had begun to flow. 'Can you see us too?' The tiny speck on the hill was Soha’s sister, Sawsan. Separated by war and occupation, they hadn’t seen each other in person for 22 years. The six Safadi sisters belong to the Druze community, one of the Middle East’s most insular religious minorities. Its population is spread across Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau that Israel seized from Syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981. Five of the six Safadi sisters and their parents live in Majdal Shams, a Druze town next to the buffer zone created between the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and Syria. But the sixth, 49-year-old Sawsan, married a man from Jaramana, a town on the outskirts of the Syrian capital, Damascus, 27 years ago and has lived in Syria ever since. They have land in the buffer zone, where they grow olives and apples and also maintain a small house. With very few visits allowed to relatives over the years, a nearby hill was dubbed 'Shouting Hill,' where families would gather on either side of the fence and use loudspeakers to speak to each other. The practice declined as the internet made video calls widely accessible, while the Syrian war that began in 2011 made it difficult for those on the Syrian side to reach the buffer zone. But since the Dec. 8 fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime, families like the Safadis, are starting to revive the practice. They cling to hope, however faint, that regime change will herald a loosening of restrictions between the Israeli-controlled area and Syria that have kept them from their loved ones for so long. 'It was something a bit different. You see her in person. It feels like you could be there in two minutes by car,' Soha Safadi, 51, said Wednesday after seeing the speck that was her sister on the hill. 'This is much better, much better.' Since Assad’s fall, the sisters have been coming to the fence every day to see Sawsan. They make arrangements by phone for a specific time, and then make a video call while also trying to catch a glimpse of each other across the hill. 'She was very tiny, but I could see her,' Soha Safadi said. 'There were a lot of mixed feelings — sadness, joy and hope. And God willing, God willing, soon, soon, we will see her' in person. After Assad fell, the Israeli military pushed through the buffer zone and into Syria proper. It has captured Mount Hermon, Syria’s tallest mountain, known as Jabal al Sheikh in Arabic, on the slopes of which lies Majdal Shams. The buffer zone is now a hive of military and construction activity, and Sawsan can’t come close to the fence. While it is far too early to say whether years of hostile relations between the two countries will improve, the changes in Syria have sparked hope for divided families that maybe, just maybe, they might be able to meet again. 'This thing gave us a hope … that we can see each other. That all the people in the same situation can meet their families,' said another sister, 53-year-old Amira Safadi. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yet seeing Sawsan across the hill, just a short walk away, is also incredibly painful for the sisters.

Israel disabled Houthi ports, goes after rebels economy	Military says strikes on the Iran backed proxy is after weeks of planning and not an immediate response to the overnight ballistic missile fired by the Houthis on Israel The Israeli strike on the Houthi rebels in Yemen early on Thursday, disabled three sea ports, Yemen media affiliated with the rebels said. The purpose of the Israeli attacks was to deal a significant financial blow to the Yemeni rebel forces. The strikes were weeks in the planning and were carried out by dozens of fighter jets who also bombed the tug boats that bring ships into the ports. The military said the timing of the attack on the Houthis was decided according to operational considerations and was not in direct response to the ballistic missile fired at Israel overnight. In the Yemen capital of Sanaa, which came under Israeli attack for the first time, the planes targeted fuel storages and a power station. At least nine people were killed at the Ras Issa oil facility and others were hurt in seven strikes on the ports, local media claimed and according to reports in the Saudi Arabian press, in all, there were 16 strikes in the Israeli attacks that included the port city of Hodeida and the capital Sanaa. A senior official for the Houthis said that the strikes by Israel and the U.S. forces on civilian instillations including power stations and ports, reveal the hypocrisy of the West and said attacks in support of Gaza would continue and escalate in response to the escalations of the Israeli strikes.

IDF confirms strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen	The IDF confirmed Thursday morning that Israeli fighter jets targeted military sites belonging to Yemen’s Houthi forces along the western coast and inland regions. The operation was carried out under the direction of the Intelligence Directorate and Israeli Navy, following Defense Minister Israel Katz’s approval of strike plans. The IDF said the strikes aimed to degrade Houthi military capabilities and prevent the use of targeted facilities for military operations, including the smuggling of Iranian weapons. The Houthis, aligned with Iran, have repeatedly launched UAVs and surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, most of which were successfully intercepted, according to the military. Over the past year, the Houthis have operated under Iranian guidance and financial support, often collaborating with Iraqi militias to attack Israel, disrupt regional stability, and threaten global freedom of navigation, the statement added. 'The IDF is determined to continue operating against all threats posed to the citizens of the State of Israel, wherever necessary,' the military said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjhzezws1l	2024-12-18T18:19:55-08:00

Did Assad trade military secrets with Israel? Turkish claims make...	Hurriyet report, echoed by Daily Mail, claims Syria's ousted leader shared locations of weapons stockpiles and missile launchers with Israel in exchange for guarantees to ensure safety of his escape route Syrian President Bashar Assad, ousted by rebel forces on December 8, reportedly shared classified military information with Israel before fleeing the country, Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Wednesday. The report, later echoed by global outlets including Britain’s Daily Mail, claims Assad handed over documents detailing the locations of weapons stockpiles, missile launchers and military hangars. The Hurriyet report claims that Assad received guarantees from Israel to ensure the safety of his escape route in exchange for the intelligence. 'Judging by the precision of Israel’s strikes on Syrian military assets following Assad’s fall, it seems Israel received highly accurate information,' the report noted. Turkish commentator Abdulkadir Selvi provided additional details, claiming Assad fled Damascus for Moscow on the morning of December 8. Selvi reported that as opposition forces closed in on Damascus on December 7, a summit took place in Doha involving Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Selvi quoted Fidan describing the situation obliquely: 'We met with the Russians and the Iranians in Doha and discussed a few topics. I prefer not to say more.' According to Selvi, Assad’s escape was coordinated from Russia, which arranged his evacuation from the Russian-operated Khmeimim Air Base to Moscow. Selvi also claimed Assad had initially sought refuge in Iran, which refused him, and negotiations with the United Arab Emirates failed, leaving Russia as his only option. Selvi said a trusted source revealed that Assad provided Israel with detailed maps of Syrian military assets to guarantee Israel would not target his escape route. 'Looking at the precision strikes conducted by Israel following Assad’s departure, it bolsters the credibility of this account,' Selvi wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryg00ypxs1g	2024-12-18T12:45:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/11/BkES00b6mp/BkES00b6mp_0_0_1600_1156_0_small.jpg

Russia has relocated advanced air defense systems and additional military equipment from its bases in Syria to Libya, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing U.S. and Libyan officials. The move is seen as an effort by the Kremlin to maintain a military foothold in the Middle East following the collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime. The transferred equipment reportedly includes radars for S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, as well as fighter jets, weapons and military personnel.

As part of hostage deal, Hamas demands release of Israel’s most n...	As hostage negotiations gain momentum, reports suggest terror group will demand exile of convicted mass murderers from Israeli prisons to third countries; here are the high-profile prisoners likely to be on the list As negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a potential hostage-prisoner exchange gain momentum, the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds reported Wednesday that discussions are focusing on which Palestinian prisoners will be released in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza. According to the report, high-profile prisoners serving life sentences may be deported to Turkey or Iran under the terms of the deal. A few months into the war, Hamas made it clear that the next hostage-prisoner exchange deal must include three renowned Palestinian prisoners, only one of whom is affiliated with the terror organization. Hamas’ insistence on adding two prominent non-Hamas figures to the list reflects its strategic thinking about the post-war period and its relations with Fatah and other Palestinian factions. Among the names Hamas is expected to present are prominent figures in Palestinian society who could reshape the Palestinian Authority, foremost being senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti. In a recent West Bank poll, Barghouti was the leading candidate to succeed Mahmoud Abbas as chairman of the Palestinian Authority. Barghouti is serving five consecutive life sentences and an additional 40 years for his involvement in attacks that killed five Israelis and injured many others during the Second Intifada. Formerly the secretary-general of Fatah in the West Bank, he was arrested on April 15, 2002. Like other Palestinians serving long sentences for terror offenses, Barghouti remains highly popular among Palestinians. Unlike most prisoners, however, his status as a political figure makes him even more revered. The second name Hamas insists on including in the deal is Ahmed Saadat, secretary-general of the Marxist-Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the mastermind behind the 2001 assassination of Israeli minister Rehavam 'Gandhi' Ze’evi. Israel refused to release Saadat as part of the 2011 prisoner exchange deal that saw the release of captive IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Like Marwan Barghouti, Saadat is considered a significant and popular figure in Palestinian society. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After Ze’evi’s assassination, Saadat fled to the Muqata’a compound in Ramallah. Then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat refused to hand him over, prompting an Israeli siege on the compound. Following negotiations involving the United States and the United Kingdom, the sides reached the 'Ramallah Agreement,' under which Saadat was imprisoned in Jericho under the supervision of British and American guards. After Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections, Saadat was captured by Israeli forces and sentenced to 30 years in prison in December 2008. The third high-profile prisoner is Abdullah Barghouti, a senior Hamas operative and former commander of the group’s military wing in the West Bank. Barghouti is currently serving an unprecedented 67 life sentences in Israel for his involvement in multiple deadly attacks. Hamas was unable to secure his release in the Shalit deal, but the organization is now adamant that Barghouti must be freed in the next exchange, along with the other two senior prisoners. Throughout the war, additional names have emerged that Hamas is expected to demand in exchange for hostages. Among them is Hassan Salameh, a close associate of the slain Hamas bombmaker Yahya Ayyash and a senior figure in Hamas’ military wing. Salameh has been serving 46 life sentences in Israel since 1997 after being convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed approximately 100 Israelis. He was born and raised in Gaza’s Khan Younis refugee camp, a stronghold of senior Hamas operatives. Another figure on the list is Abbas al-Sayyid, the chief planner of the 2002 Park Hotel bombing in Netanya. He is serving 35 life sentences for his role in the attack, which killed 30 Israeli civilians and injured more than 160 others. Hamas is also expected to push for the release of Ibrahim Hamed, formerly the second-most important figure in the group’s West Bank operations after Saleh al-Arouri, who was assassinated in Lebanon earlier this year. Hamed, a commander of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades during the Second Intifada, was responsible for planning and organizing dozens of attacks against Israelis, including high-profile suicide bombings. He was arrested by Israel in 2006 and is serving multiple life sentences for terrorism and murder. Meanwhile, reports in Egypt indicate 'intense Egyptian-Qatari efforts' to negotiate a cease-fire in Gaza. However, Hamas has yet to give its approval for any deal, and no agreement has been finalized. Despite this, progress has been made, and Israeli officials note a willingness on both sides to move forward. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bykadherkx	2024-12-18T12:23:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/SkXy59gSke/SkXy59gSke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Court presses prosecutors over holes in Netanyahu corruption case	Judges challenge prosecutors to clarify key claims Netanyahu traded regulatory benefits for favorable media coverage; with gaps in evidence regarding Netanyahu's direct involvement, case could be significantly weakened A dramatic turn unfolded Wednesday in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial, as judges challenged prosecutors on key elements of the charges in the 'Bezeq-Walla Affair,' popularly known as Case 4000. The case alleges that Netanyahu, during his time as prime minister, granted regulatory benefits to telecom giant Bezeq in exchange for favorable media coverage on the Walla news site, both owned by businessman Shaul Elovitch. During the hearing, Netanyahu reiterated his claim that he was unaware of any specific requests for media coverage made by his associates. However, the judges pressed prosecutors to clarify allegations of Netanyahu’s involvement or knowledge, with Presiding Judge Rivka Friedman-Feldman questioning inconsistencies in the indictment. Prosecutors argued that Netanyahu was generally aware of a pattern of systematic requests, even if he was not involved in every specific instance, but judges demanded evidence to support this claim. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Judge Oded Shaham, considered more lenient toward the prosecution, expressed concern about the lack of explicit references to Netanyahu's awareness in parts of the indictment. Prosecutor Yehudit Tirosh requested time to review materials and potentially revise their approach. The indictment includes a detailed appendix listing 315 instances of alleged media requests as the basis for the bribery and breach of trust charges. However, if prosecutors fail to establish Netanyahu’s direct knowledge or involvement, as many as 80 to 140 instances could be removed from consideration, potentially undermining up to 50% of the case. Adding complexity, Netanyahu's defense lawyer, Amit Hadad, announced that Sara Netanyahu, the prime minister's wife, would not testify as a defense witness. Her absence could impact both Case 4000 and another case involving allegations of accepting expensive gifts (Case 1000). Sara Netanyahu’s testimony could have bolstered the prosecution’s claims regarding her communications with Elovitch’s associates, but her testimony was also critical for the defense’s argument that gifts received from businessman Arnon Milchan’s wife, Amanda, were part of a reciprocal relationship. Next week, the trial will continue with further discussions on Netanyahu’s alleged awareness of media requests and preparations for defense witnesses. A canceled hearing has been rescheduled in Jerusalem without Netanyahu’s attendance, focusing on procedural issues. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1xp3ogbye	2024-12-18T11:21:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/Sy00ZToEgHJg/Sy00ZToEgHJg_0_22_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Fed lowers rates but sees slower pace of further cuts, firmer inf...	The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday and signaled it will slow the pace at which borrowing costs fall any further, given a relatively stable unemployment rate and little recent improvement in inflation. 'Economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace' with an unemployment rate that 'remains low' and inflation that 'remains somewhat elevated,' the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in its latest policy statement. 'In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range ... the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,' it said in new language that sets up a likely pause to rate cuts beginning at the Jan. 28-29 meeting. U.S. central bankers now project they will make just two quarter-percentage-point rate reductions by the end of 2025. That is half a percentage point less in policy easing next year than officials anticipated as of September, with Fed projections of inflation for the first year of the new Trump administration jumping from 2.1% in their prior projections to 2.5% in the current ones - well above the central bank's 2% target. Slower progress on inflation, which is not seen returning to the 2% target until 2027, translates into a slower pace of rate cuts and a slightly higher ending point of 3.1%, also hit in 2027, versus the prior 'terminal' rate of 2.9% seen as of September. Fed officials also boosted their estimate of the long-run neutral rate of interest to 3%. The reduction in the benchmark policy rate to the 4.25%-4.50% range was opposed by Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, who preferred to leave the policy rate unchanged.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkicdjlh1e	2024-12-18T10:52:34-08:00

Speaking to troops in Rafah, Halevi says military intensifying operations to dismantle Hamas and secure return of remaining 100 hostages, emphasizes need for stronger security frameworks to support displaced residents returning to communities near Gaza IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Wednesday that the military is intensifying operations against Hamas to secure the return of 100 hostages taken during the October 7 attack. Halevi made the remarks during a visit to the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where he conducted a situational assessment alongside senior commanders, including Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces so that there will never be another October 7,' Halevi said. 'We are exerting pressure on Hamas daily, driving it into greater distress, to ensure the return of the 100 hostages—hopefully alive—and for those who are not, to provide them a proper burial in Israel.'

Meanwhile, the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds reported Wednesday that negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, are now in their final stages. According to sources quoted in the newspaper, at this stage, discussions are underway regarding the identity of the Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of the deal. The report claims that 'heavyweight' terrorists serving life sentences will probably be deported to Turkey, and also to Iran—a country whose name has not been mentioned so far as a possible destination for exile. The rest, according to the report, will be released to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk3tsqlske	2024-12-18T10:06:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/Hy2e3FlBJl/Hy2e3FlBJl_0_0_1378_909_0_small.jpg

US Supreme Court to consider TikTok bid to halt ban	The U.S. Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the short-video app by Jan. 19 or face a ban on national security grounds. The justices did not immediately act on an emergency request by TikTok and ByteDance, as well as some of its users who post content on the social media platform, for an injunction to halt the looming ban, opting instead to hear arguments on the matter on Jan. 10. The challengers are appealing a lower court's ruling that upheld the law. TikTok is used by about 170 million Americans. Congress passed the measure in April. The Justice Department had said that as a Chinese company, TikTok poses 'a national-security threat of immense depth and scale' because of its access to vast amounts of data on American users, from locations to private messages, and its ability to secretly manipulate content that Americans view on the app. TikTok has said it poses no imminent threat to U.S. security. TikTok and ByteDance asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 16 to pause the law, which they said violates free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The companies said that being shuttered for even one month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its U.S. users and undermine its ability to attract advertisers and recruit content creators and employee talent.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1iam5xbye	2024-12-18T09:22:53-08:00	
UN to vote on Norwegian proposal targeting Israel over UNRWA ban	Resolution, which could eventually lead to sanctions, expected to pass with automatic majority despite Israeli diplomatic efforts to block it; Israel expected to respond to move The UN General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a Norwegian-backed initiative seeking an International Court of Justice (ICJ) advisory opinion on Israel’s legislation banning the operations of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The law, passed after allegations that some UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7 attacks, has drawn accusations from Norway of violating the UN Charter and international humanitarian law. Additionally, Norway accuses Israel of obstructing the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and preventing other nations from providing assistance in what it describes as 'occupied territories.' If approved, the ICJ will examine Israel’s obligations as an occupying power and UN member, including ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid and respecting the immunity of UN bodies like UNRWA. Oslo’s proposal asserts that Israel has no legal authority to interfere with their operations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Norwegian officials hope the ICC will recommend sanctions against Israel if it continues to obstruct UNRWA and other UN agencies. The measure is likely to pass, given the UN's frequent majority against Israel, though Israeli diplomats are lobbying to minimize support. The vote underscores rising tensions between Israel and Norway, which previously recognized Palestine as a state, prompting Israel to expel Norwegian diplomats handling Palestinian affairs. The move comes as Israel grapples with the fallout from International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryh5xfxbyl	2024-12-18T08:38:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/19/r111f2QPk6/r111f2QPk6_0_121_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Engineering troops from the IDF's 188th Brigade recently uncovered an underground tunnel in southern Lebanon, stretching hundreds of feet and leading to a Hezbollah command post. The site had been used to direct terror activities and rocket launches targeting Israeli communities in the past year. Inside the command post, troops found weapons, surveillance systems and other military equipment. Nearby, several weapons depots were discovered, including one concealed in a mosque, containing hundreds of explosives, rifles, grenades and additional military gear. The IDF destroyed the command post and tunnel and confiscated the equipment.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sypgj00esye	2024-12-18T06:50:06-08:00

Declassified files show when US knew Israel was close to having a...	Newly published documents reveal US officials suspected Israel developed a nuclear reactor during the 1960s, prompting David Ben-Gurion to adamantly fire back against the suspicions Newly revealed classified U.S. documents uncovered when the United States first realized Israel was developing nuclear weapons — and when they assessed Israel was '6-8 weeks' away from completing a nuclear bomb. The documents are published against the backdrop of Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and IAEA Chair Rafael Grossi's recent remarks that the 'nuclear deal with Iran is no longer relevant and that Iran is enriching uranium to a military-grade and is rapidly nearing the position of a nuclear state.' One of the declassified documents is a December 1960 report by the U.S. Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee (JAEIC). According to researcher William Burr and Prof. Avner Cohen, this was the first American report to definitively state that the Dimona reactor would include a plutonium production facility tied to weapon development. Subsequent American reports treated the issue as unresolved until the late 1960s, by which time Israel had reached the brink of military nuclear capability. This culminated in a 'bilateral secret deal between President Richard Nixon and Prime Minister Golda Meir,' whereby Israel would hold 'undeclared nuclear weapons status.' Another declassified intelligence document revealed that, in February 1967, several Israeli sources informed the U.S. Embassy that Israel 'either has or is about to complete ' the Dimona plutonium extraction plant and that 'the Dimona reactor has been operated at full capacity.' The U.S. concluded that Israel was '6-8 weeks' away from a bomb at that time. The document also mentioned, for the first time, the possibility that 'Israel was systematically deceiving the United States about Dimona.' This was later hinted at in an Israeli series on the atom which featured conversations with Benjamin Blumberg, founder of the Lekem intelligence agency and dubbed 'the driving force behind the Dimona reactor,' who died six years ago. In December 1960, the same month the U.S. first assessed that Israel was advancing toward nuclear capability, other documents surfaced about the construction of the Dimona reactor, initially described as located 'in or near Be’er Sheva.' Then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion first addressed the issue in a Knesset speech, saying that Israel built the reactor for 'research for peaceful purposes.' Ben-Gurion was incensed by statements from U.S. officials in the press claiming Israel had not informed Washington about Dimona. He summoned U.S. Ambassador Ogden Reid to his residence in Sde Boker. According to a document detailing that meeting, Ben-Gurion sought to answer the question of whether Israel had any plans to develop nuclear weapons, emphatically saying, 'Absolutely not,' adding that Israel had no such intentions. The document further recounts how Ben-Gurion praised 'the greatness of America,' calling it a 'refuge for tens of millions of people of Europe,' and perhaps 'the most prosperous nation of all.' He added: 'Your people conduct a bitter war to abolish African slavery; that you saved Europe twice from the Germans.' However, Ben-Gurion then launched a pointed critique: 'We are equals of America in terms of moral respect. We didn't deserve it and we will not accept such treatment.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The ambassador noted how Ben-Gurion straightened in his chair and declared: 'We are not a satellite of America... and will never be a satellite.' While 20 documents on Dimona and Israel’s nuclear program have been declassified, many others remain sealed. For example, a 1976 American document concerning Dimona was entirely redacted by the CIA and remains classified nearly 50 years later. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1emiblbyx	2024-12-18T04:55:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/B1uQEberJg/B1uQEberJg_271_321_781_440_0_small.jpg
Return of NASA astronauts from space station further delayed unti...	NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore's return to Earth will be further delayed until at least late March, the agency said, taking what should have been an eight-day stay on the International Space Station to more than nine months. The duo had traveled to the ISS in June for the test mission, but their return was extended by eight months to February, after the Boeing Starliner capsule they arrived on was deemed unfit to return them to Earth. NASA said Williams and Wilmore, along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, would return to Earth after the four-member Crew-10 mission, now expected to take off in late March, reaches the space station. The agency did not specify a date for the return of the astronauts. Hague and Gorbunov boarded the ISS in September, over three months after Williams and Wilmore.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byacxigsjg	2024-12-18T04:54:10-08:00	
Exile of released terrorists is cease-fire demand as deal gets cl...	Hamas may be flexible on release of terrorists, with reports that Tehran is a possible destinations to which they will be exiled; Senior Hamas officials have examined whether Marwan Barghouti will agree to exile to Turkey, and are insisting on guarantees from the mediators that Israel will comply with terms Negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the US, Egypt and Qatar, are now in their final stages, the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds reported Wednesday. According to sources quoted in the newspaper, at this stage a discussion is underway regarding the identity of the Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of the deal. The report claims that the 'heavyweight' terrorists serving life sentences will probably be deported to Turkey, and also to Iran - a country whose name has not been mentioned so far as a possible destination for exile. The rest,according to the report, will be released to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Another report, on the Saudi Al-Hadath channel, claimed that these are 'crucial hours' following a significant breakthrough achieved on some issues, particularly after Hamas gave up its demand for a complete end to the war in the first phase of the cease-fire, and agreed to the deportation of senior prisoners to Turkey or Qatar. Iran was not mentioned in this report. On Tuesday, Ynet reported that Hamas may be flexible on the issue of releasing terrorists with blood on their hands and is considering the possibility of them being exiled to a third country such as Turkey, Qatar or another Muslim country. The terrorists in prison are apparently reluctant to return to the Gaza Strip - since it is a land of ruins, and exile may buy them a new life. Meanwhile, sources close to a senior Hamas official claimed that Marwan Barghouti, who is considered the most senior of the Palestinian prisoners, and Ahmed Saadat - the Secretary-General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who planned the assassination of government minister Rehavam Ze'evi in ​​2001 - would agree to deportation abroad as part of a deal. According to the sources, senior figures in the terrorist organization contacted the wives of Barghouti and Saadat and consulted with them about whether to agree to their deportation to Turkey. The women did not express any objection to this, it was reported, and suggested that the prisoners should also be asked about whether this was acceptable to them. 'We are nearing the end of the talks and reaching an agreement,' according to the sources. Despite the optimism expressed by certain sources, a Hamas source told the Saudi Asharq News that 'Israel has so far refused to agree to the release of senior Palestinian prisoners and leaders. Israel insists on deporting all prisoners with lengthy sentences out of the Palestinian territories.' The source added that Hamas is demanding various guarantees for the deal. 'Israel wants an agreement without a signature, similar to previous wars, and is content with a Qatari and Egyptian declaration. We want a written agreement, and are asking the mediators for guarantees that Israel will be committed to implementing all of its stages,' he said. A report in the Saudi Al-Hadath newspaper also claims that Hamas is demanding 'international guarantees for Israel's commitment to the three stages of the agreement,' and that it also opposes checkpoints for refugees who will return to northern Gaza during the cease-fire. The talks are currently being conducted with great intensity since the collapse of the previous round in August, with several key concessions by Hamas in the background - including the agreement not to bring an end to the war in the first phase, as well as a willingness for an Israeli military presence, albeit a more limited one, on the Philadelphia and Netzarim corridors at the end of this phase. An Israeli negotiating delegation arrived in Qatar on Monday, where a delegation of Hamas members is also located, and CIA chief Bill Burns was also expected to arrive in Doha on Wednesday. On Tuesday night, a senior American official told Ynet that there will be a deal. 'It's just a matter of time,' he claimed. However, an Israeli official estimated that 'things are not yet ripe' and that there are still 'significant gaps.' The outline in question is reportedly based on the same outline that President Joe Biden revealed in May, which includes three stages, and, if implemented in full, should effectively bring about an end to the war. The first phase is set to last six weeks and will reportedly include the partial release of 'humanitarian' hostages such as women, the elderly and the sick - and now also the bodies of dead hostages - in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a partial withdrawal of the IDF and the introduction of greater humanitarian aid into the Strip and perhaps the possibility of refugees returning to northern Gaza. Earlier, Asharq Al-Awsat, a Saudi newspaper published in London, reported that negotiations between Israel and Hamas were now entering a 'crucial phase.' Sources in Cairo told the newspaper of an approach to signing the agreement once the final details, especially those related to the names of the living hostages and Palestinian prisoners, are finalized. According to the report, there is a possibility that the deal will be completed soon. The newspaper repeated the details of the emerging deal that have already been reported: The agreement includes a cease-fire in the first phase, an IDF withdrawal from city centers, while partially remaining in the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors - on the condition that 'women and children' are allowed to return to the northern Gaza Strip. In a later and gradual phase, the report states: 'the return of the men will be carried out according to an agreed mechanism.' In the first phase, which will last between 45 and 60 days, Hamas will release about 30 live and dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, dozens of whom have been sentenced to life imprisonment. The agreement also includes the transfer of the Rafah crossing to the Palestinian Authority, but not immediately and within the framework of arrangements supervised by Egypt. Al-Arabiya quoted sources as saying that Hamas had agreed to release the 'sick, elderly and female soldiers' who are being held captive in the first phase. At the same time, a Hamas source told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the terrorist organization's leadership had held several meetings with Qatari and Turkish officials in recent hours. 'A leading delegation from the movement is scheduled to visit Cairo on Sunday,' he said. 'We prefer not to talk about the details of the proposals on the table.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skc8ysls1x	2024-12-18T04:40:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/BJYydQqXyl/BJYydQqXyl_0_166_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

Italian woman rescued from cave after 3-day ordeal	Emergency services in Italy have rescued a cave explorer after she was injured and trapped underground for more than three days following a fall, bringing relief to Italians who have been following her fate. Ottavia Piana was carried out of the cave on a stretcher just before 3 a.m. on Wednesday and airlifted to a hospital in the northern city of Bergamo following a 75-hour rescue operation. Piana, 32, suffered injuries to her back and ribs and also has suspected fractures to facial bones and a knee after she fell around eight meters in the Abisso Bueno Fonteno cave network on Saturday. Rescuers said she was conscious but tired and clearly in pain when brought up to the surface after being trapped some 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) from the cave entrance. Piana, who is an experienced cave explorer, suffered a similar ordeal in July 2023 when she was trapped in the same cave network for around 40 hours after another accident.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwpjsxbyx	2024-12-18T03:30:38-08:00

Some 10 days ago that the group, advocating the annexation and settlement of southern Lebanon, said they had crossed the border and established an outpost, the Times of Israel first reported. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said they had been promptly removed. 'The preliminary investigation indicates that the civilians indeed crossed the blue line by a few meters, and after being identified by IDF forces, they were removed from the area,' said a statement by the IDF. 'Any attempt to approach or cross the border into Lebanese territory without coordination poses a life-threatening risk and interferes with the IDF's ability to operate in the area and carry out its mission,' the statement said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyom1bxb1x	2024-12-18T03:27:11-08:00

Iran's currency plunges to historic low and Tehran turns off the ...	Since Trump's election victory, the Islamic Republic's currency has lost more than 10% of its value; At the same time, Iran's energy crisis is also worsening, despite its vast oil and gas reserves: the electricity grid is shaky due to sanctions, and now that a cold wave has arrived, there is not enough for everyone The value of the Iranian currency, the rial, fell to its lowest level ever on Wednesday, after losing more than 10% of its value since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election in November. The drop in the currency's value comes at a time when the Islamic Republic is facing major strategic setbacks in the form of the crushing of Hezbollah's power in Lebanon and the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, and at the same time as Trump is making vague statements that he does not rule out an attack on its nuclear facilities. According to reports coming from Tehran, the Iranian currency is trading at 777,000 rials to the dollar today, compared to 703,000 rials to the dollar the day Trump won. For comparison, before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the currency was worth 70 rials to the dollar, and in 2015, the year Iran signed the nuclear deal with the world powers, under which most sanctions were lifted and in exchange for Iran curtailing its nuclear program, the value was 32,000 rials to the dollar. On July 30 the day the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, was sworn in , the rate was 584,000 rials to the dollar. Pezeshkian was elected president partly on the strength of his promise to forge a new nuclear agreement with the powers that would ease sanctions, but in the meantime Iran's status and economy are only deteriorating, without such an agreement being reached, and without it appearing that the parties are getting closer to it. The reports of the further drop in the currency's value come against the backdrop of the regime's announcement that schools, universities and government offices in Tehran and more than half of the country's provinces will remain closed on Wednesday due to the energy crisis it is suffering from, following a devastating combination of an intense cold wave, heavy snow and air pollution. On Wednesday, Tehran's electric company announced that it was forced to turn off the streetlights that normally illuminate the capital's highways at night, due to the strain on the electricity grid. 'This policy will continue until a balance is reached between supply and demand,' said company official Alireza Rezaei. Tehran has been dealing with power outages on its highways for two months, and on Saturday local traffic police warned of the danger of an 'exponential increase in the number of road accidents.' Although Iran has vast gas and oil reserves, years of underinvestment in its infrastructure and international sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear program and its support for terrorist organizations have left its energy sector unprepared for the surge in demand during peak seasons, forcing it to resort to planned power outages and face shortages of ready-to-use gas. It also faced a similar crisis during the heat of the summer. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In recent weeks, the Islamic Republic has already been forced to impose restrictions on the use of electricity due to a shortage of gas and fuel for its power plants, and the cold wave that has hit the country in recent days has only increased demand, especially for gas, and left it in real distress. According to Iranian state television, temperatures in 25 of Iran's 31 provinces dropped below freezing overnight. Because of this, schools and public institutions in Tehran were closed for the fourth consecutive day, as were more than half of the country, in an attempt to save energy. Shopping malls in the capital Tehran were ordered to close their doors two hours earlier than usual to join the energy-saving effort. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syx514es1e	2024-12-18T02:59:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/H1e007Pmeryg/H1e007Pmeryg_0_278_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The head of the U.N. migration agency said she was reassured by commitments she heard from Syria's new caretaker government in meetings in Damascus, as the country seeks to rebuild after more than a half-century of rule under the Assad family. Amy Pope, director-general of the International Organization for Migration, said Wednesday that Syria's new leaders 'recognize the job they have ahead of them is enormous and that they need the support of the international community.' IOM estimates about 100,000 people 'many looking to return to their former homes' have entered Syria from neighboring countries since Dec. 8, the day former President Bashar Assad fled the country as opposition fighters swarmed into the capital. 'There's no question to me that at this moment in time, they are looking for ways to make this work, to be more inclusive, to build partnerships across the international community, to build partnerships with other governments,' Pope said of the caretaker government. 'It's just going to be a question of whether they can deliver.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjtnbmgh1e	2024-12-18T01:19:49-08:00	
People love fake news,' says brother of Israeli spy Eli Cohen	Avraham Cohen, brother of Israeli spy active in Syria before he was caught, slams rumors saying agent's body was recovered from Syria and returned to Israel after security officials deny reports; 'We’ve been given hope' One day after incorrect rumors spread about the recovery of Israeli spy Eli Cohen's remains from Syria, his brother, Avraham Cohen, told Ynet on Wednesday: 'People love fake news. Everyone wants to be famous for knowing something, so they make things up and publish them irresponsibly. I looked into the claims circulating among the public and received confirmation that there’s no truth to them.' Numerous rumors suggested Cohen's remains had been returned from Syria, but security officials clarified the claims were false. Saudi TV network Al-Arabiya reported that the Mossad was allegedly working on locating Cohen’s remains and had connections with some rebel groups. The rumors coincided with a Russian report of an unusual Israeli operation deep in Syria, alleging that an Israeli helicopter landed near a military site in the Damascus area on Monday evening. Avraham shared that the family received inquiries from people asking if his brother's grave had indeed been located. 'People asked on WhatsApp and other platforms if we’d received any updates. It was nonsense. We didn’t hear anything from the Mossad or anyone else. People spread rumors just because they feel like it,' he said. Regarding efforts to locate his brother's grave, Avraham added, 'Hafez Assad once said they built an entire neighborhood over the area where Eli was buried. I don’t believe they’ll demolish the houses and find Eli’s grave.' 'I want to tell the government that if there’s truth to the matter, they should approach us – even if it’s a lie,' he stressed. 'Spreading fake news to the public is irresponsible and hurts the family for no reason. It creates false hope and disappointment and there’s no need for that. We’ve suffered enough and irresponsible individuals shouldn’t spread baseless rumors. Of course, we’d be thrilled if this were true.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Avraham noted that he discussed the matter with his niece Sophie, Eli’s daughter. 'She agrees that unsubstantiated reports shouldn’t be spread. It’s certainly the heartfelt wish of many in Israel for Eli’s remains to be recovered and returned home. I don’t know if an active search is going on but we’ve been given hope. I sincerely hope it’ll come true this time.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jrqmgsyl	2024-12-18T01:10:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/SybiMloEJx/SybiMloEJx_153_23_575_324_0_small.jpg

We'll be the last battalion here': Ynet reporter embeds with IDF...	The IDF Combat Engineering Corps’ 601st Battalion's troops and commanders say they still have work to do in Gaza and will leave only once peace can be fully restored; 'Finding the hostages is our top priority' Fighting in the northern Gaza Strip has renewed since the IDF resumed its operations in the area. Now, the IDF Combat Engineering Corps’ 601st Battalion is acting against underground terror tunnels and working to separate the northern part of the Strip from Gaza City proper to clear out remaining Hamas terrorists in the area. 'We've made significant progress in the two months we've been here,' said Lt. Col. Yisgav Israeli, commander of the 601st Battalion. 'If you walk from here (the starting point of the refugee camp) to the sea, you'll be safe.' 'Our goal is to be the last soldiers in this area. To enter the area for the last time, no matter how long it takes,' he added. 'We’ll be the last battalion here if it were up to us and we’re here to finish the job.' Another commander we met on the ground showed us a drone image of the densely packed Jabaliya refugee camp. He zoomed in on a central building about a kilometer away from us. Near the building, dozens of black dots are seen moving back and forth. 'Look,' he pointed, 'these are terrorists in buildings we still haven't destroyed. At first, our objective was to push forward quickly, but now our focus is advancing to the heart of the camp and addressing the remaining threats. This isn't simple combat. Everything is dense and there are many narrow corridors. We're fully aware of the risks.' The scale of destruction in the Gaza Strip is staggering. We didn’t see a single intact structure from the moment we passed the Zikim checkpoint to about 10 kilometers inside the strip. The Combat Engineering Corps is working without pause. At one point, we met soldiers from the March 2024 draft. Barely 19 years old, they enlisted only eight months ago. Having just graduated high school and completed their training, they're now serving in Gaza and taking part in demolishing buildings. Despite the constant danger, their spirits remain high. When do you expect to leave here? 'I don’t know when we’re leaving,' Lt. Col. Israeli answered. 'We’re not planning on leaving anytime soon. This is our main mission and we’re doing it around the clock. We still have weeks, maybe months, ahead of us.' At the end of our time with him, Lt. Col. Israeli wanted to share a message. He led us to the building he uses as his headquarters. Pulling back the curtain at the entrance, he stepped into a room and sat on the couch. 'I wish things worked like this outside,' he said, with a hint of frustration.

UK's Starmer confirms plan to boost defense spending to 2.5% of G...	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer reiterated on Wednesday his Labor government's plan to increase defense spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), after NATO called on members to boost spending to meet threats from Russia. In an interview with LBC radio, Starmer was asked whether Britain would be willing to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP, but the leader repeated his government's position that it would plot a route to spending 2.5%. 'The commitment we've made is to set out a path to 2.5%,' he said. Starmer has said his government will set out that path next year. Last week, NATO head Mark Rutte warned the U.S.-led alliance that it was not ready for the threats it would face from Russia in the coming years and called for a shift to a wartime mindset, with much higher defense spending beyond the 2% target. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has called on NATO members to boost defense spending to 3% of economic output. The alliance estimates 23 of its 32 members will meet its target of dedicating 2% of GDP to defence this year.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkxrkgebye	2024-12-18T00:04:10-08:00

Shooting in all directions': How Qatar is grabbing a foothold in...	Doha is actively working to secure its place and interests in the region by coordinating with Turkey while masquerading as default mediator; How will this affect Israel? Following the collapse of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria last week, Qatar's foreign ministry issued an official statement, saying that Doha 'is closely monitoring developments in Syria and calls for preserving the nation's institutions and unity.' Numerous discussions have since taken place between Qatari officials and various regional leaders from across the political spectrum. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari, said that the country is closely following regional developments, particularly the war in Gaza and the situations in Syria and Lebanon. 'The Syrian people are facing an opportunity to realize their aspirations and establish a homeland for all. The people's choices must be supported. We call on all parties in Syria to work together to preserve the nation's unity,' he said. He also condemned 'Israeli incursions into the demilitarized zone with Syria and their control over it,' stressing that Qatar's role is defined by Syria and that it maintains contact with all parties involved. On Monday, Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani about enhancing cooperation between their countries across various fields and discussing regional developments. Last week, Qatar's foreign ministry announced that its embassy in Syria would reopen soon, following necessary preparations, and it confirmed on Sunday that embassy operations would resume on Wednesday. Moreover, Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi held talks with Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed Al Thani last Thursday. According to Iranian reports, the discussions focused primarily on the situation in Syria. That same day, a joint Turkish-Qatari delegation, including Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatar's State Security Chief Khalfan Al-Kaabi, visited Damascus. The delegation met with rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani) and Syria's interim prime minister Mohammed al-Bashir. Qatar is already planning its next steps in the region. Following the Assad regime's fall, it immediately sent humanitarian aid to Syria via Turkey. A week ago, Qatar's foreign ministry reported that the emirate had delivered aid intended for Syria to the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Qatar presents itself as a supportive mediator while pursuing other interests behind the scenes 'The Qataris know how to leverage the humanitarian issue as a powerful tool for their interests,' explained Dr. Ariel Admoni, a researcher in Bar-Ilan University's Middle East department specializing in Qatar. 'In this case, they collaborated with the Turks because they want boots on the ground — people who are familiar with the situation firsthand.' According to Admoni, the Qataris are aware of their limitations. 'A contact in the Damascus embassy is nice but Turkey understands the area — whether it's dealing with clashes involving the Kurds or rising forces. Turkey is on Syria's border; it lives as part of its reality and is already poised to intervene in Syria. The Qataris prefer that Turkey's involvement happens in coordination with them.' 'If we think about Qatari behavior from the early days of Syria's civil war, Qatar didn’t solely back Islamists – it also supported the coalition and secular elements,' Admoni added. 'As in many conflicts, Qatar funds various groups to ensure a foothold on the ground. 'The Turks and Qataris already share close military and economic ties dating back to the Arab nations' boycott of Qatar between 2017 and 2021. Qatar’s collaboration with Turkey provides it with proximity to the situation and the ability to monitor developments closely.' Amid the uncertainty surrounding Syria's future, Qatar, experienced in 'ensuring future investments,' is hedging its bets and 'shooting in all directions.' 'They’re ensuring that any actor – whether aligned with Iran or an Islamist – will need Qatar,' Admoni noted. 'At the Doha Forum held about a week ago, Qatar held intensive discussions with UN representatives and American officials, repeatedly raising the Syrian issue. 'This is a calculated attempt to position themselves not only as a representative of Iran but also of the West in the region. Qatar's decision to be among the first to reopen an embassy in Syria is no coincidence — it ensures that no matter the direction the regime takes, its interests, including economic ones, will be safeguarded.' Admoni stressed that Qatar doesn’t want to appear overly opportunistic at this stage but is ensuring all regional actors recognize it as the 'default mediator.' Rebel leader al-Sharaa’s current self-branding conveniently aligns with Qatar's narrative, which promotes the idea that Islam doesn't necessarily equate to terrorism. 'Using media and statements from its prime minister and foreign minister, Qatar champions the notion that they oppose terrorism but argue against rejecting Islam altogether,' Admoni explained. 'If al-Sharaa presents himself this way, Qatar won’t object. They’re fully embracing this narrative.' Regarding Qatar-Iran relations, Admoni said that the weakening of the Shiite-Iranian axis won’t prompt Qatar to abandon its ties. 'Qatar knows better than to dismiss regional actors, even when they’re on the decline. Over the past decade, when Hamas was ostensibly more present in Gaza, Qatar continued — and continues — to engage with the Palestinian Authority,' he said. Admoni believes Qatar will maintain relations with various players, ensuring that Syrians may need them for Iran’s sake — or vice versa — or even for the West. Qatar’s modus operandi is familiar to Israel from its activities in Gaza, which is why it raises concerns. Qatar presents itself as a supportive mediator while pursuing other interests behind the scenes. This strategy has worked in different arenas so far and its recent actions suggest it’s determined to cement its influence in the Syrian arena. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Ultimately, when Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson explained the delegation’s visit to Turkey, he said that its purpose was to coordinate humanitarian aid,' Admoni added. 'But when the delegation includes Qatar’s state security chief, it’s clear you don’t send your intelligence head to coordinate humanitarian aid issues. Qatar has plenty of humanitarian agencies capable of handling such tasks.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybayjlhye	2024-12-17T22:39:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/03/31/9156247/9156247_249_136_849_478_0_small.jpg

Houthis see ‘little to lose’ as missile threat persists and Israe...	Israel intercepted a Houthi missile launched from Yemen toward Tel Aviv, prompting discussions of a military response; Iran-backed group continues attacks amid Israel's multi-front war, posing a growing but manageable threat A ballistic missile launched toward central Israel by the Yemen-based Houthis could lead to an Israeli military response in an effort by the Jewish state to deter further attacks. The attack on Monday was intercepted by the Israeli air defense system, causing no damage or injuries while sending tens of thousands of people to protected areas, but poses a dilemma for Israel on what its options are while facing the threat. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed rebel group that operates in Yemen, joined the war on Israel, which was initiated by the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist organization in October of last year. Since the beginning of the war, the Houthis have fired over a dozen ballistic missiles and a larger number of drones. Israel has largely been successful at thwarting the attacks, except for one civilian death in the past summer from a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv. In July and September, Israel launched widescale attacks against Houthi targets in Yemen, focusing on the Hodeida port, which is considered a lifeline for the terrorist group. The July offensive was the first time Israel directly hit Yemen. The attack achieved temporary quiet, with a lull in attacks from Yemen. However, in the past two months, the Houthis seem to have rekindled their efforts against Israel despite other fronts in the war against Israel becoming less active. 'The Houthis may be making calculations figuring that they can sustain an Israeli retribution once every few months while continuing to attack Israel,' according to Dr. Nachum Shiloh, a research fellow from the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'Unlike Gaza and Lebanon, where the Israeli Air Force can conduct hundreds of sorties a day, this is not the case in Yemen, which is approximately 2,000 kilometers away.' 'In their cost-benefit analysis, they want to implement their anti-Israeli, anti-American ideology while taking into account that Israel’s ability to hit them is limited,' Shiloh said, adding that Yemen’s impoverished population and under-developed economy make for very few valuable military targets to Israel. 'The price currently being exacted by Israel still allows the Houthis to continue attacking,' he explained. 'Our only option is to continue supporting and defending our oppressed brothers in Gaza until the aggression stops and the siege is lifted,' Hezam al-Asad, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, posted on his X social media account on Tuesday. According to Sharona Shir Zablodovsky, an expert on public policy and national security at the Dvorah Forum, the Houthis are banking on their distance from Israel. 'The geographical distance is an advantage because it allows them to be prepared for an attack,' she said. 'But also, with Yemen’s failing economy, the Houthis have little to lose.' Israeli media reported that defense officials have decided to attack Houthi targets again. While the damage from Houthi attacks has not been large-scale, the cost of thwarting ballistic missiles and unarmed vehicles (UAVs) is estimated at millions of dollars per interceptor, something Israel would like to avoid. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, Israeli air defense systems have been challenged by the UAV threat. The small vessels are often successful in evading sophisticated radar systems and have preoccupied state-of-the-art fighter jets engaged in often lengthy aerial pursuits. 'The threat from Yemen is more of a nuisance than a strategic one,' said Shiloh. 'Israel has no problem intercepting the number of missiles currently fired from the Houthi, and while the drones have exposed a weak spot in Israel’s air defense, it is still something that is dealt with.' There is no precise estimate of the number of missiles the Houthis possess. Still, several research institutions and think tanks believe they have a relatively wide array of missiles of varying ranges capable of carrying different types of warheads, including unconventional weapons. The delay in Israel’s response to the Houthi threat is not only rooted in the relatively low price in terms of human life and the disruption to daily life but also in Israel’s entanglement in a multi-front war that has lasted over a year. Currently, Israel is engaged in an active battle in the Gaza Strip against Hamas and maintaining a fragile cease-fire with the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon. There are hopes that a cease-fire with Hamas is imminent, and with a possible Israeli strike against Iran in the works, Israel may have chosen to contain the Houthi attacks until now. Israel is also waiting for US President Donald Trump to enter the White House in a month, something that will most certainly impact its ability to act in the Middle East and also may have motivated it towards containment. 'I am sure the Houthis are not first on Israel’s list of priorities,' said Shiloh. The Houthis have also staged frequent attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden against international vessels, something the US and other Western powers have so far failed to halt. This has caused major disruptions in international trade. On Monday, the US military announced it had conducted an airstrike against a critical Houthi command and control center as part of that effort. 'The Houthi’s ability to harm international trade could lead to action by the US and other actors,' said Zablodovsky. 'This could be beneficial to Israel. Such action, however, could also instigate Iran if its leadership feels like it is losing its grip.' For years, the Houthis have been a menace to the region, attacking targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Throughout the current conflict, the Houthis have said their attacks, both against Israeli and other targets, are an expression of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Such was the Hezbollah’s rationale when it also joined the attack. The Houthis are largely funded and backed by Iran. Hezbollah and Hamas, both Iranian proxies of varying extent, have both been significantly hit by Israel. Israel’s attacks on the Houthis have so far failed to neutralize the threat, leaving the group to pose a nuisance to the Jewish state still. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Neither Iran nor its proxies should be underestimated or eulogized, even though they have been badly hit by Israel,' said Zablodovsky. 'They still have abilities, as the Houthis proved earlier this week, and the Iranian regime will not give up so easily on its agenda.' The Iranian leadership has frequently vowed to seek the destruction of Israel. With Hezbollah and Hamas significantly weakened, the Houthis may see their mission against Israel as an even more pressing one. While Israel reportedly prepares for a significant strike against the Houthis in Yemen, their motivation to continue to target Israel will remain. 'Such extreme ideological groups that define themselves as part of the resistance to Israel do not raise a white flag in surrender,' said Shiloh. -This article is written by Keren Setton and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bky11ijesjl	2024-12-17T21:29:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/14/S1xqfXzcr0/S1xqfXzcr0_0_166_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Concern in the US, Israel over Elon Musk's handling of sensitive ...	Three parallel investigations have been opened in the US regarding the billionaire, and the US Air Force has refused to grant him a high-level security clearance, the New York Times reports; Other countries, including in Europe, have expressed concern Elon Musk and SpaceX face at least three federal reviews over whether they have complied with federal reporting rules aimed at protecting national security, the New York Times reported. Musk, among other things, did not provide details about meetings he held with foreign leaders. Several US allies, including Israel, have also expressed concerns that Musk might share sensitive information with others, according to the report. According to the report, SpaceX employees had become concerned about Musk's ability to handle classified information, including due to posts he made on the X platform covering everything from gaming to diplomatic meetings. These concerns, it was reported, were exacerbated by Musk's very high security clearance at SpaceX, which exposes him to classified information such as advanced U.S. military technologies. Musk, according to the rules, must report information regarding his personal life and his foreign flights, as part of a process known as 'ongoing review.' This allows the administration to assess whether he can continue to be exposed to sensitive information. Musk has met with, among others, the Iranian ambassador to the UN. This is not the first time the security practices of the SpaceX founder have been questioned by the Pentagon. A 2018 incident in which Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla, smoked marijuana on a live Web show with U.S. comedian Joe Rogan also sparked a security clearance review by the Pentagon. Such reviews ordinarily occur once instances of a potential infraction come to light, Pentagon officials have said. The New York Times said the new reviews were initiated by the Air Force, the Defense Department's Inspector General and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. It cited eight people with knowledge of the rocket company and internal documents. 'Elon Musk and his rocket company, SpaceX, have repeatedly failed to comply with federal reporting protocols aimed at protecting state secrets, including by not providing some details of his meetings with foreign leaders,' the newspaper report said. The Air Force and undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security referred queries to the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General. That office, in turn, said that as a matter of policy, it could 'neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing investigation.' It added: 'This is to protect the confidentiality of those involved and to protect the integrity of the investigative process.' SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell declined to comment on the security clearance issues or the probes when asked by a Reuters reporter as she left an event in Washington. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The New York Times said the Air Force recently cited potential security risks in denying high-level security access for Musk, and that allies including Israel have flagged concerns that the billionaire CEO might share sensitive data. Last month, two Democratic U.S. senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Jack Reed, wrote in a letter that reports that Musk has held multiple calls with Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, should be investigated by the Pentagon and law-enforcement agencies on national security grounds. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall responded last week to Shaheen that he shared those concerns but could not comment on the status of a person's security clearance. Musk is the owner of Tesla. After the U.S. presidential election, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would appoint him as the person to lead a process to streamline his future administration and make major cuts to prevent waste of taxpayer money. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkasaayb1l	2024-12-17T20:50:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/24/Sk12p70uR/Sk12p70uR_0_80_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Security Council has issued its first statement on Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's government, calling for a Syrian-led political process leading to elections and urging all nations to respect the country;s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. The council said Syrians should 'peacefully, independently and democratically determine their own futures' based on key principles in a 2015 council resolution that sets out a roadmap to peace calling for a new constitution and U.N.-monitored elections. It said the process should be facilitated by the United Nations and backed efforts being taken by U.N. envoy Geir Pedersen. The Security Council reiterated support for the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNDOF monitoring the Israel-Syria border following the 1973 Mideast war. It stressed the obligation of all parties to the 1974 Disengagement Agreement that established a demilitarized buffer zone between the countries to abide by its terms and reduce tensions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bykgpa1hyl	2024-12-17T20:01:49-08:00	
Hebron: How do 1,100 Jews survive surrounded by 200,000 Arabs?	Yishai Fleisher explains why Hebron is one of the most dangerous cities in Israel The residents of Hebron face a daily battle for their safety and security, according to Yishai Fleisher, director of international affairs for the Jewish community of Hebron. Speaking to ILTV News on Sunday, Fleisher highlighted the challenges of living in the ancient city, home to one of Judaism’s holiest sites: the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs. For centuries, Hebron was largely inaccessible to Jews. It is also the site of the 1929 Hebron massacre, where nearly 70 Jews were killed by local Muslims. In 1967, Israel regained control of Hebron during the Six-Day War. Today, around 1,100 Jews live in the city, surrounded by approximately 200,000 Arabs in an area governed by the Palestinian Authority, many of whom support Hamas, Fleisher said. 'Some people call it even a Hamas city,' he noted. The security concerns extend beyond the residents. Fleisher emphasized that visitors to the holy site also require protection. 'On the one hand, we're a security town. On the other hand, we're a touristic town,' Fleisher said. 'So, in many ways, we mirror what Israel is, which is a country that has a security element but wants to bring in people and connect with a lot of people.' Hebron also faces what Fleisher described as a 'narrative war.' 'We face a lot of besmirchment of the history of the Jewish community of Hebron, an effort to erase our history, an effort to blacken our name,' he said. 'But we fight through that with the amazing message of the history of the Jewish community of Hebron and the connections of the forefathers and mothers and the heritage of the Jewish people in this place.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s18wir1hyx	2024-12-17T20:00:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/22/HkWctMAGJg/HkWctMAGJg_0_139_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Time to strike back at the Houthis?	British military expert Andrew Fox says the time does feel right to start taking 'more assertive' action towards the Houthi Israel and its allies may soon take 'slightly more assertive action toward the Houthis,' according to British military expert Andrew Fox. Earlier this week, the Houthis launched missiles at central Israel, a bold move considering the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which has largely held. Fox explained that for the past 14 months, Israel has been 'reactive' and has lacked 'a particularly clear strategy as to how to find a political or military solution to the problem.' However, he suggested that recent developments—such as attacks on allied ships, direct strikes on Israel, and Iran's weakening position—could make this an opportune moment for action. 'I think a completely independent Israeli strike is extremely unlikely,' Fox said. 'Israel will need American facilitation of things like refueling and recovery of potential downed aircraft, should such an eventuality occur. But I think it's very clear that with the collapse of the remainder of Iran's Shiites crescent proxy strategy, the time does feel right to start taking slightly more assertive action towards the Houthis.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjyjfa1b1e	2024-12-17T19:43:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/15/yk13718211/yk13718211_0_0_658_371_0_small.jpg
Still 'significant' gaps in cease-fire negotiations as CIA chief ...	Senior U.S. official asserts 'there will be a deal'; With Israeli delegation in Doha, Jerusalem keeping a cool head; First phase expected to include 7-week cease-fire while second phase 'won't be easy' As progress appears to be continuing in talks for a cease-fire and hostage deal with Hamas - and in light of Defense Minister Israel Katz's statement that such an agreement is 'closer than ever,' a senior U.S. official told Ynet Tuesday evening that there will be a deal. 'It's just a matter of time,' he claims. However, an Israeli official estimated that 'things are not yet ripe.' This does not mean that a deal will not be implemented, but he noted that 'there are significant gaps.' At the same time, the Reuters news agency reported that CIA Director Bill Burns will arrive in Qatar. An Israeli delegation left for Doha, the capital of Qatar, Monday night, and the source said that 'it is likely that, in order to close a deal, the senior officials will have to come to Cairo, with Hamas representatives in another room. In the meantime, there is a lot of inaccurate information reaching the media.' According to information obtained by Ynet, the first phase of the deal will include a seven-week cease-fire, during which women, children and elderly hostages will be released and negotiations will take place on the second phase - in which all the men, the soldiers, and the bodies of the killed hostages will be returned. In the second phase, it appears, Israel will be forced to release a very large number of terrorists. 'It will not be easy to digest,' they explained in Israel. Degel Hatorah Party chairman Moshe Gafni, a member of Knesset, met Wednesday with families of hostages, amid criticism from some of them about the intention to advance a partial deal first. 'I don't know what I'm doing in this coalition,' he told relatives of the hostages. 'The government is going for a phased deal. I want a comprehensive deal with all the hostages.' A source familiar with the details said that behind the scenes, as Haaretz first reported, talks are underway led by the Americans to bring a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries back to the table. Ron Dermer, the Minister of Strategic Affairs who is close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been working for a long time on a wording that would be acceptable to Saudi Arabia in the context of a vague commitment to a future Palestinian state. Now, Israel understands, this is needed not only for an agreement to normalize relations, but also for Saudi Arabia to agree to finance the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip the day after the war. Bothoutgoing President Joe Biden's people and the staff of President-elect Donald Trump are involved in those negotiations with Saudi Arabia. The one pushing for this is Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is interested in bringing about a hostage deal during Biden's term - which will end in about a month with Trump's inauguration on January 20. 'Talks in Doha are almost at a final stage' Palestinian sources claim that the talks on the hostage deal taking place in Doha have reached an 'advanced, almost final stage,' the Saudi-owned Al-Sharq channel reported. The report also revealed the deal that is apparently in the works. The first phase - humanitarian - will include bringing aid to the Gaza Strip and releasing all civilian Israeli hostages, and female soldiers, whether they are alive or their bodies are being held in Gaza. The first phase will reportedly last at least six weeks, and the Israeli civilian hostages will be released in exchange for the release of hundreds of terrorists from Israeli prisons. The aid to Gaza will come immediately after the start of the cease-fire - and will also be accompanied by an Israeli withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor. The forces will remain on the eastern side of the Rafah crossing - and will partially and gradually withdraw from the Netzarim corridor. The Washington Post reported earlier Tuesday that Hamas insists on the return of the displaced to the north of the Gaza Strip, and the Saudi report also claims that they will be allowed to return to Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip, with an IDF supervision mechanism that will ensure that Hamas terrorists and factions of other terrorist organizations do not take over the area. The Palestinian authorities, the report noted, did not reveal further details regarding that mechanism, and it is still unclear how it will operate. In the second phase of the agreement, the remaining Israeli hostages, including soldiers and officers, also will be released in exchange for the release of terrorists - the number of whom has not yet been finally agreed upon. Among other things, dozens of terrorists who have been sentenced to long prison terms are also expected to be released. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The sources noted that this list does not currently include prisoners considered terror 'leaders', such as Marwan Barghouti. Israel, it is claimed, insists on deporting these terrorists. At this stage, Israel will also complete its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, with forces being allowed to remain in the eastern and northern border areas. After that, the end of the war will be declared and the blockade on the Gaza Strip will be lifted, including the opening of the crossings. And who will manage those crossings? According to the sources, the Palestinian Authority, in coordination with Egypt and the European Union, will be responsible for supervising the Rafah crossing. The crossing will be activated gradually with the entry of aid and the transfer of the wounded and sick from Gaza. There has also been discussion about the 'day after' the war .The identity of the administrator of the Gaza Strip will be agreed upon at the end of the war, according to the report. The one who will decide on this will be a committee with 'independent powers,' which will operate in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority. This, however, requires a presidential decree from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1kq2wyryg	2024-12-17T13:19:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/09/Bke40uLz86/Bke40uLz86_0_194_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
IDF establishes a reserve division for troops aged 38-58 to bolst...	The David Brigades was created to prevent enemy infiltrations like the one on October 7; It consists of five reserve brigades, and is set to strengthen border defenses and respond rapidly to threats, with operational readiness targeted for 2025; 'Struggling to meet recruitment targets' The IDF announced the establishment of five new reserve brigades on Tuesday, known as the 'David Brigades,' to enhance defensive capabilities along Israel’s borders in response to evolving operational needs and lessons learned from the ongoing war and the October 7 terror attack. The brigades – Negev ('Negba'), Shephelah ('Yonatan'), Valleys ('Yizraeli'), Jerusalem ('Ari'), and Galilee-Golan – will be tasked with providing a rapid defensive response to sudden events. Recruitment will be based on soldiers’ residential areas, enabling a more immediate and effective initial response. The units will primarily consist of reserve soldiers aged 38-58, most of whom are volunteers with extensive experience gained during both their military service and civilian lives. IDF Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi emphasized the need to expand the military’s capabilities. 'In this war, we have learned that the IDF needs to be larger and broader to face difficult situations and prolonged wars,' Halevi said. 'Over these months, we are establishing new brigades of reservists comprised mostly of individuals who are already over the exemption age and have shown a willingness, recognizing the urgency of the moment, to step up and say we are returning to serve, returning to the reserves. Although we are not at the official age for reserve duty, we come with the right spirit and an understanding of the necessity.' Halevi highlighted the importance of easing the current strain on Israel’s reserve forces, who have faced an unprecedented operational load. 'When they carry out operational duties, we will be able to alleviate the burden on the reserves, which has been so heavy over the past year and three months. I must salute the reservists who have handled this burden with exceptional quality and great honor,' he added. Maj. Gen. (res.) Moti Baruch, the founder of the new brigades, underscored the need to adapt to the changing security environment. 'We all understand that the security reality has changed, and we must adapt accordingly. These are people who are ready to volunteer and play a central role in strengthening security, and we view this as a significant operational advantage,' Baruch said. The division will include approximately 15,000 infantry reservists, equipped with personal weapons, marksmen, grenade launchers, snipers and drone teams for reconnaissance and attack missions. The units will not operate armored vehicles but are designed for swift, flexible deployments. Over the past nine months since the ambitious plan was launched, the IDF has managed to recruit around 3,000 soldiers, including 100 company commanders out of the 130 required. 'We are struggling to meet recruitment targets,' the IDF admitted. 'We are currently in contact with another 6,000 individuals who are in the process of enlisting, but there is a strong willingness among many people, even those in their 40s and 50s, to serve. Many recruits will be veterans of combat engineering and similar units.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Reservists in the new division will be on high alert and able to mobilize rapidly from their homes during emergencies. As a result, they will keep their personal weapons and uniforms at home, despite the associated risks of theft or safety incidents. The IDF also plans for one of the division’s battalions to be composed of Bedouin soldiers, featuring four combat companies from the Galilee and one company from the Negev. To join the new division, soldiers must complete a thorough bureaucratic process, including providing a clean criminal record, documentation verifying their mental and physical health and other approvals. The initiative reflects the IDF’s shift toward bolstering defense capabilities and readiness amid changing security threats, relying on experienced reservists and volunteers committed to safeguarding the nation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b14ezrkr1l	2024-12-17T12:23:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/S1XPIgJSJl/S1XPIgJSJl_0_20_1600_900_0_small.jpg
Iris president: 'Israel violated sovereignty of 3 countries'	srael Violated the Sovereignty of 3 Countries'; Saar: 'Anti-Semitic Lie Show' Irish President Michael Higgins said Tuesday that calling the Irish antisemites is 'gross slander,' during a ceremony to accept the credentials of the Ambassador of the State of Palestine Jilan Abdaljamid.

Man accused of killing UnitedHealth executive indicted for murder	Luigi Mangione, the man accused of shooting dead UnitedHealth Group executive Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street this month, was indicted for murder on Tuesday, prosecutors said. 'This type of premeditated, targeted gun violence cannot and will not be tolerated,' Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement announcing the indictment. Ivy League-educated Mangione was charged with murder on Dec. 9 for the killing of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel before a company conference, following a five-day manhunt. Mangione suffered from chronic back pain that affected his daily life, according to friends and social media posts, though it is unclear whether his personal health played a role in the shooting. Mangione was charged with murder in the first and second degrees as well as counts related to criminal possession of a weapon, prosecutors said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk4rwdybkx	2024-12-17T11:41:35-08:00

For 1st time since start of war, hostage's family member will bri...	Michael, the brother of hostage Or Levy, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the opening of the Security Council's discussion of the Middle East; Unprecedented invitation came after efforts by Amb. Danny Danon and the United States For the first time since the beginning of the war in Gaza, the family of an Israeli hostage will participate in an official discussion of the United Nations Security Council. Wednesday's meeting, on the subject of the situation in the Middle East, will be attended by Michael Levy, the brother of Or Levy, who was abducted from the Nova music festival during the October 7 massacre. His invitation to the discussion was made possible after many efforts by Israel and UN Ambassador Danny Danon, and thanks to an invitation by the American delegation. Or was kidnapped 438 days ago; on the same day, his wife Einav was murdered, and their son Almog, only 3 years old, is being raised by family members until his father returns. Michael Levy will brief the Security Council at the beginning of the session, which is chaired by the new president of the UN Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. This is an unprecedented event, since families of the hostages as of yet have not been granted permission to speak before the Security Council in an official council debate. 'After a long struggle and thanks to the willingness of the U.S. delegation, we were able for the first time to bring the family of hostage Or Levy to brief the Security Council ambassadors in an official council debate,' Danon said. 'We will continue to fight until all the hostages emerge from the darkness of Hamas' tunnels into the light. We will not wait for a miracle and we will not leave the fate of the hostages in the hands of the UN.' Michael Levy said he was invited to speak because the U.S. currently holds the council's rotating presidency. 'I was contacted by one of the assistants to the U.S. ambassador in New York; She said they had seen my interviews. This is the first time the U.S. has been president of the Security Council since the start of the war, and until now no family member has spoken in this forum. The other countries would not have invited us,' he said.

I'm talking about the personal aspect, not politics. There's an opportunity now to make things happen, and their silence screams. This is their commitment as diplomats and especially as human beings. If they accept this situation, they are saying that some people's lives are more important than others' lives.' 'Tomorrow is my birthday,' he added, 'and this will be the second time I haven't celebrated a birthday. My life has stopped. I will talk about Or, about his son, Almog, and what it is like to be the family of a kidnapped person.' 'I mostly know nothing, and it's terrible. I only know what every citizen knows. Now there is some kind of peak, I assume something is happening, you don't have to be a great genius for that. What, how and who is on the list - that's a good question. Or is a humanitarian case, but I assume he won't be in the first stage. It doesn't sound like Israel insisted enough on this, but I would be very happy to be wrong. I hope we will know in the coming days. I am not in favor of a partial deal, and it has nothing to do with my brother. Even if he is released first, it's time to get everyone out because if they keep waiting - there will be no one to get out,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkuowijryg	2024-12-17T11:32:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/HJPGtmyHyg/HJPGtmyHyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Prime minister visits site taken over by IDF with heads of the defense establishment; 'We are here at a crossroads to decide on Israel's preparedness in this important place' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during his visit to the Syrian side of Mount Hermon on Tuesday that Israel and Israeli troops will remain at the site 'until another arrangement is found that guarantees Israel’s security.' Netanyahu made the statement alongside the heads of the defense establishment. 'The events in Syria are happening at a dizzying pace, and their consequences could determine fates,' he said. Netanyahu held a briefing Tuesday on the site over the Syrian border, together with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Northern Command Commander Gen. Ori Gordin, and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. According to a statement from his office: 'The Prime Minister reviewed the IDF deployment in the area and set guidelines for the future.' 'I am here on the summit of Mt. Hermon with the Defense Minister, the IDF Chief-of-Staff, the Head of Northern Command, the Director of the ISA and senior commanders. We are holding this assessment in order to decide on the deployment of the IDF in this important place until another arrangement is found that ensures Israel's security,' he says. 'This is nostalgic for me; I was here 53 years ago with my soldiers on a Sayeret Matkal patrol,' he says. 'The place hasn’t changed, it’s the same place, but its importance to Israel’s security has only been reinforced in recent years, and especially in recent weeks with the dramatic events taking place here below us in Syria. We will determine the best arrangement that will ensure our security.' Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), addressed Israel for the first time over the weekend and said that Syria will continue to adhere to the disengagement agreement signed in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War. He called on the international community to ensure that Israel remained committed to the agreement. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a conversation he held on Monday with a small group of journalists, al-Sharaa sharply criticized Israel's 'military advances' into Syrian territory beyond the Golan Heights and into the buffer zone declared by the UN under the agreement, which is considered disputed according to international consensus. Israel has described its advances into Syrian territory as defensive measures aimed at preventing armed groups from seizing positions near the border and ensuring the security of communities in the Golan Heights. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhx7hybkx	2024-12-17T10:00:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/HkeWj74kBkg/HkeWj74kBkg_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

Palestinian sources familiar with the negotiations told the Saudi newspaper As-Sharq al-Awsat, that 'talks regarding the cease-fire agreement and prisoner exchange in the Gaza Strip have reached an advanced and almost final stage. According to the sources, the two sides agreed to implement the agreement in three stages, starting with a 'humanitarian' stage that will last six weeks, and include 'the introduction of aid to the Gaza Strip and the release of Israeli hostages, including female soldiers.' In the second stage, they said, all remaining hostages, both living and dead, will be returned. In the third stage, there will be a comprehensive and permanent cease-fire, and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from the Gaza Strip, including from the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors, and other positions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syusmsyhkx	2024-12-17T09:34:18-08:00	
Waiting for loved ones in Syria’s Sednaya Prison: Many missing, m...	Since the fall of the Assad regime, the search for detainees in Syria’s notorious prisons has brought both heartbreak and revelations, as families mourn the missing and uncover brutal executions Following Bashar Assad’s fall from power in Syria, thousands of detained Syrians have been released from prison. Yet tens of thousands of imprisoned individuals are still missing, with many presumed dead. When search operations began in Sednaya military prison, Naima, a mother from Idlib, was hopeful that her son would be found alive there, but by the time the search came to an end, there was no sign of her son, who had been imprisoned for years. Similarly, Mahmoud was unable to locate his father, who was taken to the prisonin 2011. 'Thirteen years of patience and hope to see him again, 13 years imagining the moment of reunion,' he said. 'How did they kill you? The revolution has triumphed, father, but they killed you.' Syrian opposition factions have released around 3,000 former detainees from Sednaya Prison alone over the past week. Social media platforms are flooded with images and videos of released Syrians who were detained in the regime’s prisons for being associated with the Syrian revolution. Rumors quickly spread about large numbers of detainees on their way to freedom, but only a small portion of the anticipated detainees were found. From 2011 until the end of Assad’s rule, Syrian authorities used detention as a tool to suppress and silence opposition. Numerous accusations have surfaced about massacres committed inside Syrian prisons, which were substantiated by a leaked group of photos known as the Caesar Files – tens of thousands of photos taken between 2011 and 2013 showing detainees killed in Syrian prisons. The release of those files, named for the pseudonymous leaker, led the U.S. to pass the bipartisan Caesar Act in December 2019, which imposed sanctions on Assad for his crimes against Syrian civilians. Syrians believe that the deposed regime detained hundreds of thousands of people. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, the Assad regime detained approximately 137,000 individuals since 2011, including more than 96,000 forcibly disappeared people. Naima says that her son disappeared under mysterious circumstances while working in Damascus in 2011. Later, they learned that he had been detained by the Syrian regime. She had hoped to find him after the regime’s fall, but that did not happen. 'It seems he is dead. His son will never see him now, nor will his wife,' she said, pointing to his photograph in obvious pain. 'My son did nothing wrong. His only crime was being from Idlib.' Another man named Ehab was momentarily jubilant upon hearing about the release of his cousin, who had been detained since 2012. His joy turned to despair when it was revealed that the release involved someone else with the same name. When opposition forces entered Sednaya Prison, they discovered bodies of detainees bearing signs of brutal torture. Among them was Mazen al-Hamada, a Syrian activist who was first imprisoned and tortured between 2011 and 2013. After being released and fleeing to Europe, al-Hamada returned to Syria in 2020 and was imprisoned once again. Photos suggest he was tortured to death. Gruesome deaths at Sednaya Prison are nothing new. According to a 2017 Amnesty International report, over 13,000 people were extrajudicially executed at the prison between 2011 and 2015. Dr. Ahmed al-Shaher, a Syrian physician, told The Media Line that the bodies discovered in Sednaya appeared to have died recently, with signs of torture evident. These signs suggest that the regime carried out routine torture and execution campaigns. As the detainee search efforts came to an end, Syrians held mourning ceremonies for their loved ones across the country. The director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights announced that those not found can officially be considered deceased. American citizen Travis Timmerman, who had been detained in a Syrian prison, was discovered by chance in the search efforts. Detainees with Jordanian, Lebanese, Iraqi and Turkish citizenship also were freed. Other than those, no foreign nationals were found. That’s difficult news for the family of Austin Tice, an American journalist who’s been detained in Syria since 2012. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Previous information provided to The Media Line suggests that Tice is still alive, but his whereabouts remain unknown. The Syrian Political Affairs Administration announced last week that search operations were ongoing to determine his location. In addition to these discoveries, new claims have emerged regarding previously hidden mass graves. Mouaz Moustafa, head of the US-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, stated on Monday that a mass grave near Damascus may hold the remains of at least 100,000 people. He described the site in Al Qutayfah, about 25 miles north of the capital, as one of five mass graves he has documented. Although the claim could not be independently verified, Moustafa said victims likely include Syrians as well as American, British, and other foreign nationals, adding further weight to longstanding allegations of extrajudicial killings committed during Assad’s rule. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byrubeksyl	2024-12-17T08:59:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/ryigltBVyl/ryigltBVyl_0_159_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Pope reveals he was target of suicide bomb attempt during 2021 Ir...	Pope Francis says police informed him that at least two known suicide bombers were targeting one of his planned events; 'A woman packed with explosives was heading to Mosul to blow herself up during the papal visit' Pope Francis has revealed he was the target of an attempted suicide bombing during his visit to Iraq three years ago, the first by a Catholic pontiff to the country and probably the riskiest foreign trip of his 11-year papacy. In an excerpt published on Tuesday from a forthcoming autobiography, Francis said he was informed by police after landing in Baghdad in March 2021 that at least two known suicide bombers were targeting one of his planned events. 'A woman packed with explosives, a young kamikaze, was heading to Mosul to blow herself up during the papal visit,' wrote the pontiff, according to an excerpt from the book published in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. 'And a van had also set off at full speed with the same intent.' Francis' visit to Mosul was a key moment during his Iraq trip. Iraq's second-largest city had been under the control of Islamic State from 2014 to 2017. The pope visited the ruins of four destroyed churches there and launched an appeal for peace. During the trip, the Vatican provided few details about the security preparations for the pope. Many of the events during his visit, which took place as the COVID-19 pandemic was first easing, were open only to a limited number of people. Iraq is known to have deployed thousands of additional security personnel to protect Francis. The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for further details about the pope's new comments. Francis' new autobiography, titled 'Hope,' is due to be published on January 14, 2025. The pope also published a memoir in March. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the excerpt published on Tuesday, Francis said the Vatican had been informed about the assassination attempt by British intelligence. The pope said he asked a security official the next day what had happened to the would-be bombers. 'The commander replied laconically: 'They are no more',' wrote Francis. 'The Iraqi police had intercepted them and blown them up.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk57h7jrke	2024-12-17T08:03:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/ByecHz1rkg/ByecHz1rkg_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US targets North Korean money laundering network with sanctions	The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two people and one entity based in the United Arab Emirates, accusing them of being involved in a network that launders millions of dollars generated by IT workers and cybercrimes to support the North Korean government. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that the two people hit with sanctions worked through a UAE-based front company to facilitate money laundering and cryptocurrency conversion services that funneled the illicit proceeds back to Pyongyang. Tuesday's action comes as Washington seeks to cut off funding for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, the Treasury said. Tuesday's move targeted UAE-based Chinese nationals Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian as well as UAE-based Green Alpine Trading LLC. It freezes any of their U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with them also risk being hit with sanctions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxtsqysjl	2024-12-17T07:49:51-08:00

NATO takes over coordination of military aid to Kyiv from U.S., s...	NATO has taken over the coordination of Western military aid to Ukraine from the United States, as planned, a source said on Tuesday, in a move widely seen as aiming to safeguard the support mechanism against NATO sceptic Donald Trump. The step, coming after a delay of several months, gives NATO a more direct role in the war against Russia's invasion while stopping well short of committing its own forces. Diplomats, however, acknowledge that the handover to NATO may have a limited effect given that the U.S. under Trump could still deal a major setback to Ukraine by slashing its support as it is the alliance's dominant power and provides the majority of arms to Kyiv. Trump, who will take office in January, has said wants to end the war in Ukraine swiftly but not how he aims to do so. He has long criticized the scale of U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bygawqysyl	2024-12-17T07:08:24-08:00

Swiss parliament votes to ban Hezbollah	Switzerland's parliament on Tuesday voted to outlaw Hezbollah, in a rare move by the neutral country that has traditionally followed a policy of promoting international dialogue and mediation. Proponents of the ban, which was passed by the lower house after receiving upper house approval last week, said Hezbollah was a threat to international security and that Switzerland needed to prohibit it to take a stand against terrorism. The Swiss government opposed the ban. 'If Switzerland now moves to ban such organizations with special laws, we must ask ourselves where and how the boundaries are drawn,' Justice Minister Beat Jans said during the parliamentary debate. The ban against the Lebanese armed terror group passed the lower house with 126 votes in favor, 20 against and 41 abstentions.

Report: Kidnap deal may be signed in coming days; Prime minister'...	Sources told Reuters that Netanyahu is on his way to Cairo, but his office denies it, says he visited the Syrian border today with the heads of the security establishment; US believes 'getting closer to a Gaza agreement; Hamas: A deal can be reached if Israel stops setting conditions Reuters reported Tuesday afternoon that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose testimony in the corruption trial against him was canceled for the day under 'exceptional circumstances,' is now making his way to Cairo, the capital of Egypt. However, a short time later, the prime minister's spokesman denied the report, saying: 'Contrary to the wave of rumors, Netanyahu is not in Cairo.' He also clarified that 'there is no news regarding the late Eli Cohen,' which stated that the remains of the famous spy for Israel had been located in Syria. In addition an Egyptian official also denied that Netanyahu was in Cairo. The sources who spoke to Reuters earlier claimed that Netanyahu arrived in the Egyptian capital amid the feverish negotiations for a hostage return and cease-fire deal which, they said, could be signed 'in the coming days.' The Government Press Office late Tuesday afternoon released an official statement reporting that Netanyahu held a briefing Tuesday on the Hermon Range on the Syrian border, together with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Northern Command Commander Gen. Ori Gordin, and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. According to the statement: 'The Prime Minister reviewed the IDF deployment in the area and set guidelines for the future.' Following the Reuters report, an official statement also was issued by the terrorist organization Hamas, which stated that the discussions underway regarding a possible deal are 'serious and positive,' under the auspices of mediators Egypt and Qatar. 'A cease-fire agreement can be reached if the occupation (Israel) stops setting new conditions,' the Hamas statement said. At the same time, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in an interview with Fox News that 'we believe - and the Israelis have said this - that we're getting closer, and no doubt about it, we believe that, but we also are cautious in our optimism. He added that: 'We've been in this position before where we weren't able to get it over the finish line.' Kirby did not respond when asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was traveling to Cairo for talks. Israel's ambition is to reach an agreement this month, probably during Hanukkah, with an eye for completing the agreement at least before President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. Behind the scenes, Israel is working to increase the number of hostages to be released in a phased humanitarian release. In the past, the number of kidnapped women, children and adults has been small, and approximately the same, but Israel wants to increase the number to dozens. Negotiations on this are in full swing, and in return the mediators have given Israel lists of prisoners that Hamas is demanding be released. The reports and rumors that led to the denial by Netanyahu's spokesman In recent hours, rumors and reports have been circulating , and only after the report in Reuters, which is considered one of the world's leading and most reliable news agencies, did Netanyahu's spokesman choose to publish a denial that he was in Cairo. The Prime Minister's Office was out of contact for long hours, which contributed to fueling the rumors - which ranged from a secret visit by Netanyahu to Cairo to a Wing of Zion flight to Crete and then to Larnaca, which was actually a 'routine training flight,' but Netanyahu's office chose to officially ignore all of these. In parallel with these numerous reports, and Israel's denial that Netanyahu is in Cairo, there were also reports that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would also arrive in Cairo on Wednesday afternoon to participate in a summit of Arab states. Among other things, according to the office of the PA president, the Egyptians plan to discuss with him the issue of ending the war in Gaza and controlling the Rafah crossing. Hours earlier, Egypt reported that 'there are feverish Egyptian-Qatari attempts' with all sides to reach a cease-fire in Gaza. Talks for a deal have entered their final stages in recent days, and earlier Tuesday a Hamas source also told The Washington Post that the terrorist organization had given up its demand for a complete end to the war and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from the Gaza Strip. However, the source noted that, alongside other key concessions in the negotiations, the organization 'still insists that Palestinians be allowed to return to the northern Gaza Strip.' Either way, Hamas has not yet given a green light to the deal - and it currently has no agreement to reach one. Jerusalem has made it clear that it is not final or closed, but there is progress and Israel sees a desire to move forward. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the Washington Post, while its public statements remain defiant, Hamas has quietly begun to soften its tough demands in negotiations — revealing 'a new willingness to compromise after months of deadlocked talks.' According to the report, on Friday the terror organization gave Israel, through Egyptian mediators, the names of live hostages as a goodwill gesture intended to pave the way for a cease-fire. However, the families of the kidnapped have now received an official notification that 'the reports of receiving lists are incorrect. We recommend that you stay updated on the announcements of the IDF Spokesperson and official sources. If there is information related to your loved one, official sources will work to update you as soon as possible.' The team in Doha - and Katz's statement On Monday Defense Minister Israel Katz said that the deal is 'closer than ever ,' and that the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors - which were previously one of the main obstacles in the negotiations - 'will not be a problem.' According to reports, Israel's main focus in the negotiations now is to try to increase the number of hostages who will be released in the deal, which will not be comprehensive despite the families' protests against a 'partial deal.' An Israeli technical team, consisting of Mossad, Shin Bet and Military Intelligence personnel, has been in Doha since Monday night to prepare the infrastructure so that, if the talks mature into a deal, everything will be ready on the ground, and the time for its implementation will be shortened. On Monday, a senior political source claimed that the main dispute was and remains over the number of hostages to be released and said that as of Monday evening, Hamas is willing to release 'a few hostages' - and Israel is demanding double that. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byg04mjrjl	2024-12-17T06:45:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/BJPNZehlye/BJPNZehlye_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

Security forces arrest Jerusalem man for spying for Iran	Shin Bet and police say they arrested a 23-year-old man who carried out intelligence missions for Iranian operatives and planned to carry out bombing attack Ardler (Israel) Amoyal, a 23-year-old from Jerusalem, was arrested last month on suspicion of collaborating with Iranian intelligence agents and carrying out security-related missions in Israel under their direction in exchange for monetary compensation, security forces reported on Tuesday. An investigation by the Shin Bet and Israel Police revealed that Amoyal had been in contact with Iranian intelligence operatives via social media since October. The investigation found that he initially communicated online with a profile named 'Ariana,' and after an initial acquaintance, was connected to an operative called 'John,' who handled him. The investigation further revealed that despite understanding that 'John' was an Iranian operative early on, Amoyal agreed to carry out intelligence-gathering missions under his guidance. These included photographing locations and spray-painting graffiti. Amoyal took pictures of signs reading 'Making Peace' in various areas of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, spray-painted the name 'Sinwar' in Tel Aviv and photographed streets and houses in Netanya and Jerusalem, sending all this material to his handler. Amoyal also purchased a GoPro camera and memory card to document his missions, created a video of a car being set on fire, searched social media for a handgun, silencer and materials to manufacture an explosive device and watched videos on bomb-making. According to the Shin Bet and police statement, his activities were intended to advance violent operations, including planning an attack in Israel. Amoyal was also instructed to recruit other agents, including individuals with criminal backgrounds. The investigation also revealed that Amoyal proposed to burn a police vehicle and disrupt power to the Jerusalem light rail to his Iranian handler. To this end, he filmed various points near the light rail system, attempting to locate the power supply and sent the footage to his handler. Amoyal received payment for his activities from his Iranian handler via cryptocurrency transactions. He is expected to be indicted at the Jerusalem District Court in the coming days and was remanded to custody until Friday. 'This investigation once again exposes the efforts of Iranian intelligence to recruit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorist activities in Israel, as well as the willingness of some Israeli citizens to carry out these missions under Iranian direction, fully aware of the operatives' identities, all for financial gain,' A Shin Bet official said. 'The Israel Police and the Shin Bet continue to focus their efforts on thwarting any action that could harm the state's security and its citizens,' the Israel Police said in a statement. 'Spying for an enemy state during wartime or otherwise is a serious and dangerous act that constitutes betrayal.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Shin Bet and police reiterated in a joint statement, 'Israel's security agencies, including the Shin Bet and the police, warn Israeli citizens and residents against engaging with foreign operatives or carrying out tasks on their behalf.

The public is urged to report any suspicious contact from unidentified sources, especially those made via social media or job-seeking websites, to the Shin Bet or the Israel Police.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by0068kybkl	2024-12-17T03:57:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/21/rkvv8onTC/rkvv8onTC_0_48_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Two soldiers fall in building collapse near Gaza's Philadelphi Co...	Major (Res.) Maksim Rozenwald, a 35-year-old officer from Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, a decorated IDF commander and family man, brings the war’s toll to 818 fallen soldiers, as military operations intensify in Gaza IDF Major (Res.) Moshiko (Maksim) Rozenwald, a 35-year-old from Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, was killed in Rafah when a building collapsed. Another soldier was also killed in the same incident in the area of the Philadelphi Corridor. IDF said that the family of the other soldier has been notified, but his name has not yet been cleared for publication and will be released later. Major Rozenwald served as a company commander in the 7107th Engineering Battalion, which operates under the Nahal Brigade. He was promoted to the rank of major in April 2023 during a division excellence ceremony held in honor of Israel's 75th Independence Day. He will be laid to rest at 3:30 p.m. in the military section of the Modi'in cemetery. Haim Bibas, the mayor of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, shared his condolences: 'He was a graduate of the city's Ironi Alef high school, a fighter, a commander, and a family man who recently moved with his wife and young son to the city of Yavne. On behalf of myself and the residents of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, I send my heartfelt condolences to the Rozenwald family, to his parents Elizabeth and Aryeh, and to his siblings Alex and Tali, who are residents of the city.' On his Facebook account, Rozenwald frequently shared posts about the war and the hostages. In his last post, on November 12, he shared a screenshot of a conversation with a soldier from his reserve battalion. The soldier wrote: 'I received 1,000 shekels ($280) in cash from a kind citizen at a gas station on Route 6 for the benefit of the company.' Rozenwald wrote about it: 'Today is a battle day—where all the ends will be silent, and only the beautiful people of Israel will remain! Don’t despair—Am Yisrael Chai!' About a year ago, Rozenwald was interviewed by Israel's public broadcaster Kan after returning home for a brief break. He said, among other things: 'It’s a joy to come home, to my wife and my dog. My wife is also pregnant, and first of all, she is the real hero. She coped and gave me the peace of mind to focus and deal with everything we faced. Of course, I missed my parents, my friends, and my siblings.' He added at the time: 'We’ve spent many Shabbats in various locations in the Gaza Strip, but we understand the importance of what we’re doing. Our battalion is fighting in the northern part of the Strip. We go into houses, and it’s simply unbelievable. In every house, there are weapons and explosives—mortar shells next to a baby’s bed or explosives under the bed. There are also unfortunate people in the Strip, I’m certain of that, but ultimately, when it’s everywhere, there’s simply no choice. It’s painful to hear accusations against the fighters.' 'I share the grief of bereaved families and hope that all the hostages will return home as soon as possible, down to the very last one,' he said. 'We’ve been through tough times as a country and as a people, and I think we’ve been forcibly reminded that we have no other homeland. Let’s preserve the unifying discourse.' Maccabi Haifa Football Club paid tribute to the officer: 'Maksim has been a season ticket holder in the northern lower stand since the 2014/15 season. He managed to attend the away game against Maccabi Petah Tikva on November 30, and this year, he became a father to a son named Orel—whom he registered on Maccabi Haifa’s website when he was just three months old. We will attend the funeral, embrace the family, and honor his memory.' 818 fallen soldiers in the war This is the first announcement of the deaths of IDF soldiers in the Gaza Strip battlefield since the report of the deaths of Staff Sergeant Ido Zano, Sergeant Omri Cohen, and Staff Sergeant Barak Daniel Halperin, who were killed in an anti-tank missile attack in Jabaliya in northern Gaza on December 9. The last fatality in Rafah before this incident was Captain Avraham Ben Pinchas, who was killed in an anti-tank attack on December 7. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7 last year, 818 soldiers have been killed, including 386 who have died since the ground maneuver in the Gaza Strip began approximately three weeks later. Additionally, 5,490 soldiers have been injured since the beginning of the war: 801 of them were seriously injured, 1,369 sustained moderate injuries, and 3,320 were lightly injured. Of these, 10 soldiers remain hospitalized in serious condition, 202 in moderate condition, and nine in light condition.

2015 nuclear deal no longer relevant, Iran close to bomb, IAEA ch...	Rafael Grossi tells Italian ANSA news agency that Iran is moving quickly to obtaining a nuclear device, is enriching uranium to near military grade; says a new deal must be reached taking current Iranian reality into consideration International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi said the nuclear deal with Iran was no longer relevant and that Iran was enriching uranium to a military grade and was rapidly nearing the position of a nuclear state. Grossi spoke during a visit to the Italian Foreign Ministry on Monday. 'The philosophy of the original Iran deal can be used as a basis but the deal itself, is no longer needed,' Grossi said in an interview with the ANSA news agency. He said Iran currently has many more capabilities and is enriching Uranium to a level of 60% and to nearly 90%, which is military grade. He said Iran was significantly developing its nuclear capabilities. The new regime under President Masoud Pezeshkian was creating an opportunity for new negotiations but they would have to be on a different basis than the talks that led to the original JCPOA signed in 2015. The IAEA must play a central role he said and there must be serious cooperation between the UN agency and the world powers. > 'We must reexamine the agreement and find a new technical version of political principles. This is a complex process in which European nations, the United States, China and Russia would have to sit down with the IAEA and come up with a system that is more compatible with the new Iranian reality,' Grossi said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry0onyksje	2024-12-17T03:33:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/10/rkE1LDrk1e/rkE1LDrk1e_0_0_1039_630_0_small.jpg

Turkey amasses force on Syrian border for 'immanent' assault on K...	American officials say Ankara is set to launch offensive against US-backed Kurdish territories in country in a bid to shape Syria's future; Trump calls Erdogan a 'smart guy' Senior U.S. officials told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that Turkey and allied militias are amassing forces along the Syrian border, raising concerns that Ankara was planning a large-scale invasion of the country’s Kurdish-held territory backed by the United States. The forces include militias and Turkish commanders in civilian clothing, along with significant artillery units concentrated near Kobani, a key Kurdish city in Syria close to the Turkish border. According to the officials — one of whom noted that an 'immanent' Turkish assault could take place — within hours or days, the troop buildup began after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in early December. The current buildup resembles Turkey's preparations for its 2019 incursion into northeastern Syria. ' We are focused on it and pressing for restraint,' one U.S. official said. In a press conference held on Monday, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump addressed the turmoil in Syria, saying that the rebels who overthrew Assad's regime were 'controlled' by Turkey. Trump, who had previously declared that the U.S. should avoid involvement in Syria, signaled his intent to maintain minimal engagement in the newly established rebel-led country. He also praised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who reportedly supported the rebels’ surprise offensive and is now working to strengthen Turkey’s influence in the new Damascus regime. 'Nobody knows who the other side is, but I do!,' Trump said, likely referring to the widespread uncertainty about the true nature of the jihadist Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham rebels, whose leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), is currently attempting to present a more moderate image to the West.

Israel supporter projected to be next German chancellor	Following the dramatic 'no confidence' vote that left Olaf Scholz battered, Germany to hold snap elections in February; CDU head Friedrich Merz, once ousted from politics by Angela Merkel may well become the new chancellor Years after clashing with Angela Merkel and being politically sidelined by her during her tenure as leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, now 69, is positioning himself for a dramatic political resurgence. As leader of Germany’s center-right party, Merz is poised to lead the CDU back to power, three years after its electoral defeat following Merkel’s retirement. The no-confidence vote on Monday against Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic government, set the stage for snap elections on February 23, with the conservatives under Merz enjoying a commanding lead in the polls. Merz represents a stark departure from Merkel’s leadership style and persona. Unlike Merkel, who hails from East Germany, Merz comes from the western part of the country, where he still resides. He is married to his childhood sweetheart Charlotte, a judge, and is a father of three and a grandfather. A devout Catholic, Merz does not shy away from showcasing his wealth, frequently traveling aboard one of his two private jets—an image in sharp contrast to Merkel’s understated lifestyle. The history between Merkel and Merz is anything but amicable. Once regarded as Merkel’s most formidable political rival within the CDU, Merz was elected to parliament in 1994 and gained prominence as an expert in economics and law. However, Merkel, who reportedly referred to him as an 'enemy,' successfully ousted him from the party leadership in 2002, clearing her own path to becoming chancellor three years later. Marginalized within the party, Merz eventually withdrew from politics in 2009 and built a fortune as an investment banker. His political comeback coincided with Merkel’s retirement in 2021, and he reclaimed the CDU leadership in 2022. Despite his political resurgence, Merz remains a polarizing figure. He has never been a charismatic leader who inspires mass appeal, and he describes himself as 'socially conservative and economically liberal.' His current political momentum owes less to his own abilities and more to widespread dissatisfaction with what many perceive as the Scholz government’s mismanagement. As Merz and his party prepare for the upcoming elections, they will emphasize qualities that resonate with German voters: discipline, precision, hard work, and a sense of purpose. However, his opponents are expected to highlight his controversial outbursts, past remarks about immigrants, and his tax policies—traits and positions that have led some to draw comparisons between Merz and Donald Trump, whose populist style is deeply unpopular in Germany. A member of the CDU’s conservative wing, Merz has previously championed the idea of a 'leading culture,' advocating for Muslim immigrants to adopt German traditions and values. In addition to grappling with Germany’s immigration challenges and an emerging economic crisis—affecting even corporate giants like Volkswagen—Merz will face scrutiny over his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump's election win could force Germany and other European nations to ramp up economic support for NATO. Merz has pledged to increase Germany’s support for Ukraine, but such a commitment would require Germany to borrow funds, forcing him to abandon the CDU’s traditional fiscal conservatism and its focus on reducing budget deficits. Merz is a staunch supporter of the European Union and its collaborative framework. However, to counter the growing appeal of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)—which currently polls at 18%, making it the second-largest party after the CDU’s 32%—Merz has steered the CDU away from Merkel’s 'open-door' refugee policy. In doing so, he has adopted or echoed aspects of the AfD’s platform on immigration, including stricter border controls and more rigorous vetting procedures.

He has drawn a sharp distinction between the two parties, stating, 'The difference between us is the difference between nationalists who love their country and hate everyone else, and patriots who love their country but respect others.' Where does he stand on Israel? Since October 7, Merz, like nearly all CDU members, has expressed unwavering support for Israel and its right to self-defense. He has pledged to take a tougher stance against violent and antisemitic demonstrations in Berlin, promising stricter enforcement and harsher penalties for antisemitic incidents. Marking the one-year anniversary of the October 7 massacre last month, Merz delivered a scathing speech in parliament, criticizing the Scholz government for what he called its hypocrisy. He accused the government of paying lip service to Germany’s solidarity with Israel while failing to supply weapons and spare parts without imposing conditions to ensure they are not used for alleged war crimes. Merz has previously stated that 'Germany’s relationship with Israel is unique—without any ifs or buts.' While he supports a two-state solution, he insists it must be contingent on Palestinian recognition of Israel’s right to exist. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hjz9inr4yg	2024-12-17T01:48:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/rkGuCMRNkx/rkGuCMRNkx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF troops operate in Damascus military site, report	Military chopper reported to land in the Syrian capital on Monday bringing troops who operate in a military facility for 20 minutes before leaving; Israel strikes suburbs of the capital at the same time An Israeli helicopter landed Monday overnight near one of the military sites in the Damascus area, sources told the Russian news agency Sputnik on Tuesday. 'Soldiers entered the site and left after about 20 minutes, heading toward southern Syria,' the report claimed. Reports of Israeli strikes in the Sitt Zaynab area on the outskirts of Damascus arrived shortly after. Hezbollah-affiliated outlet Al-Mayadeen reported on Tuesday on additional IDF advances in the buffer zone area in Syria. According to the report, Israeli forces 'entered the front neighborhoods of the town of Hader.' Israeli officers have already met with local village leaders and elders in the area, following a video showing Druze residents in Hader requesting that Israel annex the area. Tribal sources in Syria told Lebanon's Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar that some view a temporary Israeli presence in Druze villages as a preferable alternative to a takeover by rebel group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham in those areas until minority protection mechanisms in the country are established.

Israel to maintain freedom to operate in Gaza, Katz says	Defense Minister says Israel will not allow Hamas to reorganize and rebuild and to pose a threat to communities; IDF prepares to cut of northern areas and prevent return of displaced civilians Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Monday that Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom to operate in the Strip, after defeating Hamas in the enclave. 'We will not allow any terrorists to organize and attack Israeli communities and citizens from Gaza,' Katz said. 'We will not allow the return to the reality of before the Oct. 7 massacre.' One of the central questions still undetermined for the day after the war remains whether the IDF would allow the tens of thousands of displaced Gazans to return to the area of Jebaliy which has been mostly destroyed in the fighting, or whether they would be prevented from returning, a millions of displaced Gazans who have moved south, have been. The military said that the northern third of the Strip would be cut off and remain mainly unpopulated, according to the decision of the government. Ynet has learned that the IDF's Southern Command intends to leave infrastructure established in recent months, in Gaza that would spread from the border with Israel all the way to the Mediterranean cost. The purpose if to prevent the return of civilians to areas that are close to the Israeli border communities. If that scenario plays out, it would mean that Israel had adopted the so called 'Generals' Plan' calling for the area or northern Gaza to remain unpopulated and under IDF security control to prevent the ability of Hamas to rehabilitate itself as a ruling force. According to the authors of the plan, Hamas can only enforce its rule if it can control the civilian population, primarily by the provision of humanitarian aid. If there is no alternative to Hamas as a governing body, it will once again survive. Israel has thus far refused to allow the Palestinian Authority to take over civilian governance of t he Strip, leaving the IDF military control the only option to ensure security along the border. The military estimates there are still some 100 Hamas terrorists in the Jabaliya and surrounding areas of northern Gaza. Israel also believes there will be a few civilians who will remain there, mostly under the protection of humanitarian zones. 'After we bomb and area, our troops enter to find a building that was unharmed with some 20 women and children inside,' an IDF commander said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvmbaaeyl	2024-12-17T00:41:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/ByHZVy0Qkx/ByHZVy0Qkx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Syrian rebel leader says will uphold 1974 cease-fire agreement wi...	Ahmad al-Sharaa addresses Israel for the 1st time, criticized IDF advance into Syrian territory but says agreement with Israel following the Yom Kippur war to hold Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), addressed Israel for the first time on Saturday and said that Syria will continue to adhere to the disengagement agreement signed in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War. He called on the international community to ensure that Israel remained committed to the agreement. In a conversation he held on Monday with a small group of journalists, al-Sharaa sharply criticized Israel's 'military advances' into Syrian territory beyond the Golan Heights and into the buffer zone declared by the UN under the agreement, which is considered disputed according to international consensus. Israel described its advances into Syrian territory as defensive measures aimed at preventing armed groups from seizing positions near the border and ensuring the security of communities in the Golan Heights. Al-Sharaa, who is seeking to rebrand himself from a terrorist to a political leader, responded to the claim, arguing that Israel no longer needs to maintain these positions as the threat from Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militias has been removed with the fall of Bashar Assad's regime. 'Syria's priority now should be building a state and creating public institutions that serve all Syrians,' he said and declared he would run for president if he gains sufficient support.

The Syrian regime is consolidating control, but Israel must act fast to prevent jihadi groups from acquiring advanced weapons, Kuperwasser said Israel needs to carefully monitor developments in Syria as the new regime consolidates power, according to Brig.-Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser. Speaking to ILTV News, Kuperwasser emphasized the importance of remembering the origins of many Syrian rebel leaders. 'No matter what the rebels and their leaders say now, many were members of ISIS and Al-Qaeda,' he said. He added that foreign forces backing these rebels include the Muslim Brotherhood, primarily through Turkey and Qatar. 'We have little trust in the Muslim Brotherhood,' Kuperwasser explained. 'Not only we, but all the relatively pragmatic and moderate elements in the Arab world have a similar attitude toward the Muslim Brotherhood.' Despite these concerns, Kuperwasser clarified that Israel is not under immediate threat. The Syrian regime is currently focused on consolidating control over the country and stabilizing its fractured government. 'They are not looking for confrontation with Israel at this point,' he said. 'But we know who they are. We know that many of them are jihadi organizations, and we don’t want to see them holding very advanced weaponry that Assad’s army used to have.' Kuperwasser stressed the need for swift action to prevent such groups from gaining access to these weapons. 'We have to take very fast the necessary activities to make sure that they don't have all these weapons in their possession.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r111l6ccn1e	2024-12-16T21:48:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/ryNfYE241g/ryNfYE241g_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Smotrich pushes ahead with plans for West Bank annexation	Far-right minister says is working to disrupt plans by the Palestinian Authority to create continuity of Palestinian population in an area that would cut Gush Etzion off from Jerusalem and bring about a Palestinian State Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was racing ahead with his plans to annex the West Bank and establish new settlements that would ensure a continuation of Jewish controlled territory. The civil administration has doubled its enforcement of violations by Palestinian of building permits, demolishing illegally built structures. According to figures obtained by Ynet, since January 2024, 642 cases of illegal building in Palestinian areas were prosecuted. In some cases, multiple structures were demolished. In 2023, the civil administration enforced 306 cases only. An official said that 1,000 illegally built structure of Palestinians were demolished this year. The accelerated efforts could be in order to create facts on the ground before U.S. president-elect Donald Trump takes office. In November, Smotrich, who also holds a ministerial position in the Defense Ministry, charged with the administration of the West Bank, emphasized the plan to create Jewish settlement continuity connecting Gush Etzion, in the southern part of the West Bank, to Jerusalem. 'Trump's victory also brings with it an important opportunity for the State of Israel. We were a step away from applying sovereignty to the settlements in Judea and Samaria, and now is the time to do it,' he said. > The head of the far-right Religious Zionism Party said his efforts were to prevent plans by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to cut Gush Etzion off from the capital and create a continuity of Palestinian residents.

Christian leader: October 7 war reveals who truly stands with Isr...	Those who love Israel are actually stepping up to the plate and making a difference,' said Steve Wearp, the founder of Blessed Buy Israel The October 7 massacre and subsequent multifront war between Israel and radical Islamist groups have exposed who truly stands with Israel and who does not, according to Christian evangelical leader Steve Wearp, founder of Blessed Buy Israel. 'This war is making people take a stand on one side or the other, and it seems to be very clarifying,' Wearp said. 'What do people really believe? Where is their heart at? 'Those who love Israel are actually stepping up to the plate and making a difference,' he continued. 'Many others are going to the radical left and calling for destruction. I think this is a matter of education and definitely a spiritual issue, where people’s hearts have been turned. They've been lied to and captured by a false philosophy that allows them to support Hamas. 'How can you support Hamas? How can you support what they’ve done? How can you support Hezbollah, or Assad, or the Iranian regime? How can you stand there silently by?' Wearp added that he reassures his Jewish friends: 'You will never, ever, ever be alone again.' Wearp founded Blessed Buy Israel to support life in the Biblical Heartland by selling products handcrafted by residents of Judea and Samaria. The idea for the company emerged in 2015 when the Obama administration supported the European Union’s decision to label Jewish-made products from the area. 'It was an attempt to support BDS,' Wearp recalled. 'My family and I sat down and decided we would not be like our forefathers. We were going to make a difference.' The family’s commitment deepened after the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which declared any Jewish presence in the West Bank illegal under international law. Wearp and his family went to Judea and Samaria, meeting small business owners and families to find ways to get their products to market and counter international pressure. Since then, Wearp says the residents of Judea and Samaria have become some of his closest friends. 'It totally changes your heart and your attitude,' Wearp said. 'These are the people we care the most about. These are the people we walk with continually, on a daily basis.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1yuuq0nyg	2024-12-16T21:20:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/BkzMuc0Eke/BkzMuc0Eke_0_25_199_113_0_small.jpg

Candace Owens named ‘Antisemite of the Year’ for 2024	Owens has claimed that Israel forces Muslims into segregated quarters and insinuated Hollywood is run by sinister Jewish gangs Disgraced conservative commentator Candace Owens has been named the 2024 'Antisemite of the Year,' an ignominious title awarded by StopAntisemitism, a leading non-partisan U.S.-based organization dedicated to combating antisemitism. In its announcement, StopAntisemitism stated: 'From defending Hitler’s actions in Germany and mocking Jewish fears over Kanye West’s antisemitic tweets, to claiming Israel forces Muslims into segregated quarters and insinuating Hollywood is run by sinister Jewish gangs, Owens has been rightfully crowned 2024's Antisemite of the Year.' Owens’ rhetoric escalated further following the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, as she amplified conspiracy theories targeting Jews and the Jewish state. This led to her ousting from The Daily Wire and a suspension from YouTube. Owens’ actions have since been widely condemned, including by evangelical leaders and even her own father-in-law. Joining Owens in the so-called 'Top Three' are environmental activist Greta Thunberg, who has drawn criticism for her pro-Hamas stances, and popular Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, accused of echoing Hamas propaganda.

Ice cold: Winter war preparations underway as IDF deploys in Syri...	IDF gearing up for extreme winter operations in Syria and Lebanon, equipping troops with advanced cold-weather gear, insulated shelters and upgraded logistics; lessons from past campaigns and foreign militaries aim to ensure readiness in harsh enemy terrain IDF is gearing up for Operation General Winter across all operational zones, with a strong emphasis on the challenges posed by snowfall in the northernmost regions—territories where IDF has not operated for 50 years. Drawing lessons from both its historical operations and the expertise of foreign militaries accustomed to winter warfare, IDF is adopting new strategies to sustain operational readiness in extreme conditions. Roughly a week after Israeli forces captured the Syrian Hermon and advanced 6–7.5 miles beyond the Golan Heights border, IDF’s Technology and Logistics Directorate (Atal) launched an urgent and large-scale procurement initiative. This operation provides thousands of specialized winter items and tools, informed by operational practices of European and American militaries experienced in combat in sub-zero environments. Through expedited coordination with the Ministry of Defense Procurement Directorate, Atal has already secured thousands of pairs of Canadian-made military-grade winter boots designed for operational use in snow and sub-zero temperatures. Snow is forecasted in the coming weeks for the Golan Heights, the Syrian end of Mt. Hermon, and multiple locations in southern Lebanon, where Israeli forces remain deployed—particularly along the eastern sector parallel to the Ramim Ridge. In the last few months, IDF has procured over 2,000 mobile living containers, including many specifically for northern deployment. These insulated units will house soldiers stationed beyond the border in both southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan Heights. In southern Lebanon, where forces are expected to remain for at least the next month (coinciding with the end of a 60-day ceasefire stabilization period), Golani infantry troops and reservists have already been equipped with portable structures, insulated shower and restroom units, heating systems, and cooking facilities to ensure access to hot meals. Preparing for the harsh winter in the Syrian Hermon A similar logistical infrastructure is being established in the Syrian Hermon, now held by Israel. Rising to an elevation of 9,186 feet, this mountainous region—covering hundreds of acres—was recently abandoned by Assad regime forces. IDF is now setting up its first operational outposts in the area. Troops stationed there, including paratroopers, commando brigades, and armored units operating on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, are being equipped with specialized gear typically reserved for the Alpine Unit. This includes three sets of thermal uniforms, insulated winter sandals, ski masks for facial protection, thick socks, and insulated overalls for static missions. Heated shelters are also being deployed to treat soldiers suffering from hypothermia quickly and effectively. Additionally, 'anti-freeze' systems are being installed to prevent essential equipment and batteries from freezing in the frigid temperatures. Sustaining operations in extreme conditions To address potential disruptions caused by snowstorms or supply route blockages, IDF is pre-positioning tons of dry and canned food at remote outposts. These stockpiles will sustain troops for over a week without the need for active logistical supply lines. 'We have established protocols for extreme scenarios, which we’ve encountered during past winters at Hermon outposts,' explains an IDF source. 'But this situation is different—this time, we’re operating in enemy territory under the looming threat of a severe winter. We’ve even studied our own history from the early 1970s, when IDF troops were stationed in these areas. The goal is to ensure that soldiers remain comfortable, safe, and supplied with hot food, even in the harshest conditions. We are already delivering cooked meals to the most remote outposts in Syria and Lebanon.' Atal is also exploring innovative solutions proven effective by militaries operating in freezing climates, such as snow-melting devices that convert snow into usable water. 'We’re not investing in expensive equipment for just a few weeks or a month. Every decision is being managed wisely, with long-term planning in mind,' Atal officials explain. 'Some of the procurement has been expedited through rapid tenders and international orders, while other supplies have been drawn from emergency reserves.' Upgraded infrastructure and living conditions In the Syrian Golan Heights, soldiers have already received generators and portable, insulated living quarters that can be dismantled within 24 hours if a withdrawal is ordered. Initially, troops had to operate out of the damp but relatively spacious fortified rooms of the 'Pita' outposts—bunkers left behind by the Syrian army. However, for safety, electrical, and comfort considerations, IDF decided not to use these rooms for prolonged stays. Soldiers found remnants of the Syrian army’s presence in these spaces, including rusted mess tins with rotted food. This approach contrasts with operations in Gaza, where forces often take over residential buildings for extended use during combat, adapting them with additional equipment like air conditioners or heaters. Comprehensive winter preparations across combat zones According to THE IDF, Atal, in coordination with regional commands, has completed extensive winter preparations across all operational zones in recent weeks. More than 1,900 mobile buildings and living containers—equipped with air conditioning, electrical panels, and connections to fixed or portable energy infrastructure—have been deployed. Each housing complex includes showers and heating systems to provide optimal conditions for soldiers. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF Supply Center has also distributed over 885,000 winter items, including custom sleeping bags, insulated overalls, and cold-weather clothing, supplementing the inventory distributed throughout the year.

Israel weighs response to Yemen as escalating Houthi attacks test...	Houthis continue attacks even as other fronts have quieted, warning, 'What’s coming will be worse'; millions of Israelis forced into shelters once again, while officials in Jerusalem vow, 'We will not show restraint' Most threats are intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory, but unusual activity from Yemen has drawn attention. On Monday afternoon, air raid sirens blared across central Israel from the Shfela region to the Sharon area, sending millions of Israelis into shelters after a missile launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted the country. The Iran-backed Houthis continue to issue threats via social media, and Israeli officials warn of a significant response: 'There will be no restraint.' Approximately four hours after the sirens, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, stating they had fired a 'Palestine-2 hypersonic ballistic missile at a military target near Jaffa.' Despite two Israeli strikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, the rebels vowed to continue supporting 'our brothers in Gaza' and even increase their attacks. Following Monday’s missile launch, Hezam al-Asad, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council in Yemen, posted in Hebrew on X (formerly Twitter): ''The Israeli enemy will pay the price for its continued brutal aggression and siege on our people in Gaza, as well as its attacks and invasions in Syria.' He followed up with two additional tweets in Arabic, writing, 'We renew our jihadist stance in support of our people in Gaza, relying on God and confident in our victory. Let the Zionist enemy and its supporters know that what is coming will be worse as long as the attacks and siege on our brothers continue.' As Houthi threats persist, Israel is treading cautiously on whether to act again in Yemen, grappling with a significant dilemma over how to respond. Sources familiar with the situation told Ynet in recent days that 'targeting the Houthis is more challenging,' but added that the rebels' increasingly aggressive actions could prompt a far more substantial Israeli response. The Houthis have continued their attacks on Israel even after the cease-fire in Lebanon came into effect and have escalated their missile launches in the two-and-a-half weeks since. The first post-cease-fire missile launch occurred earlier this month, triggering sirens in the Shfela region. The Houthis claimed responsibility for firing a 'Palestine-2' missile at a 'vital target' near Jaffa, Tel Aviv’s historically Arab quarter. Since the beginning of December, the Houthis have claimed responsibility for several additional operations involving drones targeting Israel. On December 3, they announced involvement in three operations allegedly conducted in coordination with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of pro-Iranian militias active since the war began. According to the Houthis, these operations occurred within 48 hours and included two drone attacks on northern Israel and another on a 'vital target' near Eilat. The Houthis declared all operations 'successful.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On December 8, a ballistic missile launched by the Houthis was intercepted outside Israeli territory. On the same day, the Houthis claimed responsibility for an operation involving drones targeting a 'vital target' in southern Israel, also in coordination with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. That day, the Iraqi militia issued a statement condemning 'Israeli aggression against Syria' and 'the occupation of new villages in Quneitra and Mount Hermon.' Last Thursday, sirens sounded in southern Israel, likely due to drones launched from Yemen. An interceptor was deployed near Eilat, and a chase ensued for a drone suspected of entering the Gaza border region. However, the IDF said it was investigating whether the Gaza-area alerts were triggered by a false identification. Last Monday, a drone from Yemen exploded in a penthouse apartment in Yavne. While no injuries were reported, the blast caused significant damage to the 16th-floor balcony, with parts of the drone scattered near the building. The drone approached from the sea, crossed near Sderot and then turned northward. It was detected near Ashdod, prompting electronic warfare measures. Detection lasted only a few minutes, and although a fighter jet was scrambled, the drone disappeared from radar, preventing interception. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the 'attack on a sensitive target' in Yavne and the next day took credit for 'attacks on military targets' in Jaffa and Ashkelon. In a speech during a weekly pro-Gaza demonstration in Sana’a, Yemen, last Friday, Saree claimed responsibility for additional attacks, highlighting the group's escalating launches at Israel since the start of the month. The Houthis have vowed to continue their strikes 'as long as the siege on Gaza persists,' insisting that attacks on their territory, including international coalition strikes led by the U.S. and UK, will not deter them. While some launches fail to reach Israel, the drone threat remains challenging. The drones often fly low and slowly, making them harder to detect—similar to those used by Hezbollah during months of fighting. Moreover, the lack of Israeli retaliation risks normalizing such attacks. Although Iran’s influence has waned following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria, the Houthis remain operational. Sources told Ynet recently that Israel is considering a significant response against the Houthis. 'There will be no restraint—they will get what they deserve. They will pay a heavy price,' warned the officials. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2z00qrvkx	2024-12-16T13:41:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/14/S1xqfXzcr0/S1xqfXzcr0_0_91_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Syrian U.S.-backed Kurdish Syrian forces (SDF) said U.S-brokered mediation efforts failed to reach a permanent cease-fire with Syria's Turkey-backed rebels in the northern cities of Manbij and Kobani, according to head of the SDF's media center Farhad Shami on Monday. Shami blamed the collapse of the mediation on 'Turkey's approach in dealing with the mediation efforts and its evasion to accept key points.' The Turks are not happy about the cease-fire deal and Turkey prefers to keep maximum pressure on SDF, a Syrian opposition source told Reuters.

Palestinian security forces gain ground in Jenin refugee camp ami...	PA forces, aiming to regain control of terror hotbed after nearly a decade, secure key sites, including Jenin Brigade’s main operations center, with heavy gunfire wounding several terrorists Palestinian security forces intensified operations in the Jenin refugee camp on Monday, seeking to regain control of key areas. According to Palestinian reports, heavy exchanges of gunfire over the past several hours have left seven terrorists injured. Security officials announced the capture of several strategic points within the camp, including the main operations center of the Jenin Brigade and a facility known as the 'Al-Hura Club,' a frequent gathering spot for armed terrorists. 'In the past 24 hours, security forces have arrested 12 terror operatives, neutralized a car bomb and dismantled 12 explosive devices,' the statement said. Officials claim nearly half the camp is now under operational control. Palestinian security forces report significant progress in Operation Homeland Defense, led by the elite Unit 101, aimed at regaining control of the Jenin refugee camp, which in recent years has become a hub for terrorist activity by groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The Palestinian Authority said that its security forces will 'press forward decisively until the operation’s objectives are achieved.' Intelligence Chief Majed Faraj has reportedly been stationed at the Jenin headquarters for the past eight days, closely monitoring developments. Members of the Jenin Brigade, affiliated with PIJ, have been given an ultimatum to surrender their weapons or face arrest and prosecution for weapons trafficking and collaboration with foreign entities like Iran and Hamas. Security forces have already detained several terrorists attempting to flee the camp for other areas. In Tulkarm’s Nur Shams camp, efforts to incite resistance against the security forces failed to gain traction. Akram Rajoub, who served as governor of Jenin until last year, expressed support for the operation. 'This is a group of young men—only God knows who armed them and gave them money. They want to dictate to the security forces how to confront Israel and in what way,' he said. While acknowledging the patriotism of some, he noted, 'Perhaps there are those who didn’t join the chaos created by these outlaws, but this is the reality in the camp right now.' He added that the Fatah movement supports the government’s efforts, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining citizens’ safety and preventing lawlessness from descending into chaos. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Palestinian Interior Minister Ziad Hab al-Reeh and Jenin Governor Kamal Abu al-Rub visited several government and official institutions in Jenin on Monday. The minister emphasized the importance of these institutions in maintaining order and law and instructed them to continue providing services to citizens and adhere to regular working hours, despite the current circumstances. The minister said that, under directives from Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, 'the security apparatus continues to impose order and the rule of law, put an end to security chaos, confront outlaws and restore safety.' He also acknowledged the symbolic and historical role of refugee camps in the Palestinian national struggle, highlighting the government’s prioritization of restoring and rehabilitating Jenin camp. On Monday, Abbas issued a stern warning to those refusing to participate in the effort, threatening 'immediate dismissal.' The ongoing operation in Jenin was launched against a backdrop of escalating tensions between PIJ terrorists and Palestinian security forces. The clashes intensified after terrorists seized two security vehicles and paraded them through the streets of the camp last week. Footage from the operation shows Palestinian security forces armed with sniper rifles, equipped with tactical helmets and driving armored jeeps—all reportedly approved by Israel. The immediate trigger for the crackdown was images of terrorists from Jenin driving in a procession with a stolen security jeep, draped in Hamas and PIJ flags. Since Thursday, Palestinian security forces have reinforced their presence, taking control of hospitals in Jenin and sealing entrances and exits to the refugee camp in preparation for their operation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkkhrma4jl	2024-12-16T13:00:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/ryouLCT4yl/ryouLCT4yl_0_47_1460_822_0_small.jpg
Senior official: Hostage deal possible before Trump takes office	Official says 'Most details agreed upon' but primary dispute 'centers on number of hostages to be released in first stage'; Israeli delegation departs for Qatar to advance talks A senior Israeli official said on Monday negotiations for a hostage deal with Hamas are ongoing, with hopes of reaching an agreement before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president on January 20. 'The goal is to finalize a deal by the end of the month,' the official told Ynet. 'Most details have been agreed upon, but the primary dispute centers on the number of hostages to be released in the first stage.' The official explained that Hamas has proposed releasing a smaller group of hostages, while Israel is pushing for nearly double that number. 'Right now, the focus of negotiations is on the number of hostages and their identities,' the source added. Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation departed for Qatar on Monday evening to advance talks. Meanwhile, Trump said on Monday he had a 'very good talk' with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the war in Gaza and reiterated his threat that 'all hell is going to break out' if Hamas does not release its hostages by Jan. 20, the day Trump takes office. Trump described it as a 'recap call' during a press conference at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. 'As you know, I gave a warning that if these hostages aren't back home by that date, all hell is going to break out,' he said. Hamas-led terrorists killed 1,200 people and abducted more than 250, including Israeli-American dual nationals, during their Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, according to Israeli tallies. More than 100 hostages have been freed through negotiations or Israeli military rescue operations. Of the 100 still held in Gaza, roughly half are believed to be alive. U.S. President Joe Biden recently dispatched more senior aides to the region to try and secure a long-sought cease-fire deal. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and Defense Minister Israel Katz held private meetings with Adam Boehler, Trump's point man on hostage affairs. The meetings were attended by Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for prisoners and missing persons. The American envoy requested complete discretion during the discussions with the ministers. Earlier, Katz said that negotiations for a hostage deal with Hamas were at their peak and described the talks as 'closer than ever' to reaching an agreement. Speaking to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Katz noted that Hamas had shown flexibility on key points, including the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors, which he said would not be obstacles to finalizing the deal. 'In my view, we are closer than ever to securing an additional hostage-release deal,' Katz said. He added that the process would occur in gradual phases and expressed confidence that the agreement would receive Cabinet approval. 'It is best to speak as little as possible about it in public,' Katz cautioned. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem District Court announced Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would not be required to testify in his criminal trial as scheduled on Tuesday. The court provided no public explanation for the decision, stating only, 'After hearing both sides and considering special circumstances, we have decided not to hold a court session tomorrow.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier Monday, a senior Hamas official told Saudi Arabia’s Asharq News that the group believed a deal involving 'the exchange of prisoners and a cease-fire' was within reach, provided Netanyahu did not 'disrupt the agreement.' The official claimed that Hamas and other Palestinian factions had demonstrated significant flexibility, agreeing to a phased end to the fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli forces according to a set timetable. 'The Gaza factions insist on a final end to the war, a full withdrawal of IDF forces from the Strip, the return of displaced Gazans to their homes and a respectful exchange of prisoners,' the official said. He emphasized that international mediators had advised keeping the details of the talks confidential to prevent Netanyahu from using them as a pretext to derail negotiations. A source close to the discussions indicated that both the U.S. administration and President-elect Donald Trump were pressuring for a swift resolution, with hopes of reaching an agreement by the end of the year. 'The factions are ready; the main issue is the Israeli position,' the source said. Mohammad Nazzal, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, confirmed ongoing negotiations but warned it was too early to predict the outcome. He framed Hamas’ efforts as an attempt to overcome obstacles and end the fighting in Gaza. Nazzal mocked President-elect Trump’s reported threats to intensify pressure if hostages were not released by January 20, the day of his inauguration. 'Is there anything worse than the hell Gaza has experienced for over a year?' Nazzal said. He accused Israel of failing to secure significant results in prior hostage rescues, adding, 'They recovered only a few bodies after they killed them.' He insisted that both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration must recognize the demands of the Palestinian people and the 'brave resistance.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkfadxaeke	2024-12-16T10:25:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/Hy11Oh3AOXJg/Hy11Oh3AOXJg_0_182_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Concerns for Jordan’s future: Why it’s not another Syria	Liberal regime with legitimacy, space for opposition, mostly homogeneous society and strong Western ties: Despite concerns for kingdom's future, it’s far more stable than Assad’s Syria; 'It’s hard to act against Jordan,' expert says; here’s why a rebellion is unlikely In recent days, voices expressing concern over Jordan's future have grown louder following the overthrow of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad by rebel forces. One fear is the potential rise of Islamist forces within Jordan, while another relates to Iran’s attempts to establish footholds in the Middle East, particularly after losing Syria. However, in practice, Jordan and Syria differ in many ways, which serve to stabilize the Hashemite Kingdom compared to its northern neighbor. Unlike Syria, Jordan did not witness extraordinary or violent demonstrations during the Arab Spring protests. During those events, only one person was killed in Jordan, in stark contrast to Syria, where Assad and his forces slaughtered approximately half a million people during the civil war that began in 2011. According to Prof. Ronen Yitzhak, head of the Middle Eastern Studies Division at the Western Galilee Academic College, who is also a researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Dayan Center specializing in Jordan, the events that unfolded in Syria are unlikely to occur in its eastern neighbor. Liberal, relatively The Jordanian regime is notably different from the Syrian regime. It is more liberal and enjoys legitimacy within the country. Secret prison cells, like those in Saydnaya Prison near Damascus, where prisoners — men, women and children — are held for years in inhumane conditions, are not a feature of the Hashemite Kingdom. According to Professor Ronen Yitzhak, 'The regime in Jordan is built on an inclusive policy toward the opposition.' He cites the parliamentary elections held in September, in which the Muslim Brotherhood won seats, as evidence of this inclusivity. 'Moreover, Jordan does not execute opposition activists. It is true that Jordan is not a democratic or fully liberal country, but compared to other Arab states, it is much more liberal. It is among the most liberal countries in the Arab world,' Yitzhak explained. One testament to Jordan’s liberalism is that it was the first Arab country to abolish the death penalty. While capital punishment was reinstated in 2014, largely in response to the rise of ISIS, the new law introduced significant restrictions, applying mainly to those convicted of terrorism.

'The opposition operates with greater ease in Jordan,' Yitzhak added. The Palestinians stand with the king While the prevailing assumption is that Jordan, home to an estimated two million Palestinians, is deeply divided, this is not the case. Jordanian society is relatively homogeneous and much stronger compared to Syria’s, which is composed of various ethnic groups and minorities. 'This makes it harder for fringe groups and rebels to operate within Jordan,' said Prof. Yitzhak. Although Islamist groups are active in Jordan, the Palestinian population in the country is largely loyal to the Hashemite monarchy and identifies as Jordanian. Those who participated in pro-Gaza and pro-Hamas demonstrations during the war — which filled the streets of Amman and featured anti-Israel slogans — were not necessarily Palestinians. Many were Jordanians, including members of the Bedouin Al-Huwaitat tribe. 'In previous episodes involving al-Qaeda and ISIS, there was Jordanian recruitment to these terror organizations. That’s not happening now,' Prof. Yitzhak explained. 'Many former members of ISIS and al-Qaeda were Jordanian Salafists, but this time, there’s no such trend. We don’t see Jordanians joining Syrian rebels. Aside from expressions of support — even King Abdullah has done that — there’s nothing unusual. It’s different from previous instances.' The CIA’s closest partner Another key advantage for Jordan is its close ties with the West. The United States views Jordan as a key ally, with President Joe Biden maintaining frequent contact with King Abdullah. 'It's hard to act against Jordan. The country has intelligence, operational, security and strategic connections with Western nations,' explained Prof. Yitzhak. 'Jordan’s intelligence services are considered among the best — if not the best — in the Arab world. Jordanian intelligence is reliable and is the CIA’s most trusted partner.' The Americans not only maintain close relations with Jordan but also have a physical presence on its soil, as does the United Kingdom. Britain, which controlled the territory until granting the Hashemite monarchy independence in 1921, established its ties with the royal family during World War I. These ties culminated in the Hashemite-led revolt against the Ottoman Empire in exchange for the promise of an independent state. The U.S. has unrestricted access to 12 major military bases in Jordan. According to Prof. Yitzhak, 'There is also a German presence in Jordan and even joint command structures that include representatives from various countries.' Despite growing concerns about regional stability, Prof. Yitzhak believes these robust international ties and military partnerships will ensure that the Jordanian regime remains secure. 'Despise Iran more than Israel' Iran has long been trying to infiltrate Jordan and extend its influence. According to past reports, Iranian operatives have smuggled weapons through Jordan into the West Bank. However, Prof. Yitzhak says Iran has struggled to breach Jordan's defenses. 'Iranian propaganda has difficulty reaching the Jordanian public,' Yitzhak explained. 'The Jordanian intelligence services and regime are adept at identifying those involved in such activities and monitoring Shia elements, making it challenging for Iran to operate in the country.' A survey by the Princeton-based Arab Barometer research network revealed that while Jordanian public opinion harbors strong resentment toward Israel, it dislikes Iran even more. 'The Jordanians view Iran as a destabilizing force in the region, one that negatively impacts their own country,' Yitzhak noted. 'The aversion to Iran is even greater because of sectarian factors. Jordanians dislike Shiites and refuse to give them a foothold,' he added. 'Unlike other countries in the region where regimes allow Iran some influence, Jordan does not permit this, making it even harder for Iran to establish operations there.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjftmjceyg	2024-12-16T08:53:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/SJrl5p6Vke/SJrl5p6Vke_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

In first statement after ouster, Bashar Assad says 'not flee'	Ousted Syrian dictator says 'did not abandon Syria' but was forced to evacuate Russian air base in Latakia, where he was monitoring the fighting Syria's ousted president, Bashar Assad, issued his first official statement on Monday since fleeing his country early last week, following the arrival of rebel forces in Damascus and the collapse of his regime. In the statement, Assad insisted he had not fled at all, claiming he traveled to a Russian air base in the coastal province of Latakia to 'monitor the fighting from there.' He said he only left for Russia because the Khmeimim Air Base had come under attack by drones and Moscow ordered an evacuation. Assad’s message, dated December 16, was published in both English and Arabic on his office's official Telegram channel. 'As terrorism spread across Syria and ultimately reached Damascus on the evening of Saturday 7 December 2024, questions arose about the president's fate and whereabouts. This occurred amidst a flood of misinformation and narratives far removed from the truth, aimed at recasting international terrorism as a liberation revolution for Syria,' the statement reads. > 'As terrorist forces infiltrated Damascus, I moved to Latakia in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations,' Assad said. 'Upon arrival at the Khmeimim air base that morning, it became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from all battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen,' the statement continued. 'As the field situation in the area continued to deteriorate, the Russian military base itself came under intensified attack by drone strikes. With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia. This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all state institutions,' Assad said. 'At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party. The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.' He added that he had 'never sought positions for personal gain' and viewed himself as 'a custodian of a national project, supported by the faith of the Syrian people.' Assad also declared: 'Just as I never abandoned the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon and did not betray the allies who stood by me, there is no chance that such a man would abandon his people or betray the army and his country.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skj2vote1x	2024-12-16T06:56:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/r1skJ11mEkg/r1skJ11mEkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Missile from Yemen intercepted over central Israel; 'Houthis will...	Emergency medical service report no injuries or damage; operations at Ben Gurion Airport temporarily halted; senior Israeli official warns of significant retaliatory strike on Houthis Air raid sirens blared across central Israel Monday afternoon, stretching from the Shfela region to the Sharon area, as the Israeli Air Force intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. The alarms were triggered due to concerns over falling interceptor debris. Following the alerts, operations at Ben Gurion Airport were temporarily halted, including all takeoffs and landings. Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency medical service, reported no injuries or damage as of yet. The missile launch coincided with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's testimony at the Tel Aviv District Court, which continued uninterrupted as the courtroom is located in a protected space. Netanyahu's scheduled court appearance on Tuesday has been canceled, citing 'security matters.' This incident marks the latest in a series of escalating threats from Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Israeli officials are reportedly considering a stronger response to the Houthis, who have continued their hostile activities despite a cease-fire agreement in Lebanon with Hezbollah. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The Houthis will pay a heavy price,' a senior Israeli official warned, suggesting the possibility of a more significant retaliatory strike than the last Israeli action against Yemen in September. The official acknowledged the challenges of striking Yemen, citing the logistical and operational complexities involved. In recent weeks, Houthi drones have also targeted southern Israel. Last Thursday, air raid sirens were triggered near Eilat and Ashdod due to suspected drone incursions. An interceptor was launched near Eilat, while in Ashdod, the military pursued what was initially thought to be a drone entering from Gaza’s perimeter. The IDF later said the alarms may have been caused by a false detection. Earlier this month, a drone launched from Yemen caused extensive damage when it exploded on a penthouse balcony in a 16th-floor apartment building in Yavne. The unmanned aerial vehicle approached from the Mediterranean, entered Israeli airspace near Sderot, and traveled northward toward Ashdod. Despite being detected and targeted with electronic warfare measures, the drone evaded interception and ultimately exploded, causing significant property damage but no injuries. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjhcrhtnyx	2024-12-16T05:23:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/SJK0d2pEye/SJK0d2pEye_0_82_640_361_0_small.jpg
More recruits enlisting in combat units, IDF figures show	Military highlights high motivation among recruits, with turnout surpassing projections and reinforcing readiness of various units; IDF emphasizes that this cycle's success enhances its preparedness for upcoming challenges The IDF announced Monday the November-December enlistment figures for combat roles, revealing a recruitment rate that exceeded expectations. According to the IDF, this recruitment cycle included the launch of a new combat engineering battalion, resulting in a 120% increase in overall enlistment compared to the same period in 2023. Notably, there was a 28% rise in the number of women joining combat roles, attributed in part to pilot programs such as a gender-specific unit in field intelligence and a new infantry mobility training track for female combat soldiers. 'This recruitment cycle reflects the growing willingness of young people to step up and play an active, meaningful role in the challenges facing the IDF as combat soldiers in various units,' the IDF Spokesperson's Unit said. 'The high recruitment rates relative to our planning strengthen our units and enhance the IDF’s preparedness for the missions ahead.' As debates over legislation to exempt ultra-Orthodox men from military service loom, the IDF also reported the first round of recruits joining the new Hashmonayim Brigade, part of its framework for ultra-Orthodox enlistees. However, frustration remains over the low turnout, with only 200 ultra-Orthodox men enlisting so far from the thousands who received draft notices. > Recruitment for combat-support roles is still ongoing and will continue in the coming weeks, the IDF added. These roles, critical for operational success, provide essential support to soldiers in the field.

Israel Katz tells Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Philadelphi and Netazarim corridors would not be an obstacle in achieving a deal; Hamas official says Palestinian factions show flexibility in agreeing to gradual end of war and troop withdrawal Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Monday that negotiations for a hostage-release deal are at their peak. Speaking to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Katz said the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors would not be obstacles in order to agree to a deal, and that Hamas has shown flexibility on these matters. 'In my view, we are closer than ever to securing an additional hostage-release deal,' Katz said.

Earlier on Monday a senior member of Hamas told Saudi Arabia's Asharq News that a deal for 'the exchange of prisoners and a cease-fire,' was closer than ever, 'if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not disrupt the agreement.' He said Hamas and the other Palestinian factions showed great flexibility when they agreed to a gradual ending of the war and the withdrawal of IDF troops according to an agreed schedule and called on the U.S. administration to pressure Netanyahu to see the deal through. 'The Gaza factions insist on a final end to the war, a full withdrawal of IDF forces from the strip, the return of displaced Gazans to their homes and a respectful exchange of prisoners,' the Hamas official said adding that international mediators were working toward an agreement but had recommended that its details no be made public at this stage so as 'not to provide Netanyahu with reasons to avoid making the deal.'

After Assad, Syria (again) changes flag, this time it has 3 stars	The new Syria is not only getting used to streets without statues of Hafez Assad and portraits of his son Bashar, but also to the 'flag of independence,' a 96-year-old flag brought back into fashion by the rebels which actually was the first official flag of Syria The flag of the Syrian opposition, which in the days following the fall of Bashar Assad's regime has effectively become the new flag of Syria, is now being flown above a host of institutions in the capital, Damascus, and other cities. It has a long history, dating back at least to 1932, if not before. The new-old Syrian flag, called the 'Independence Flag,' consists of three horizontal stripes in green, white and black, with three red stars embossed on the white stripe. During the rebels' surprise attack and until they took control of Damascus, it was difficult to find a video of the opposition members that did not feature this flag; They made sure to carry it everywhere they went and have their pictures taken with it, a symbol of their victory. Throughout its existence, from the Great Arab Revolt of 1916 through the years of the French Mandate to the civil war that broke out in 2011, the Syrian flag has been replaced many times, and the three-star flag that has now returned to use is deeply rooted in this history. In fact, it was the first official flag of Syria. In the distant past, the official flag of Syria was the flag of the Ottoman Empire, and it remained so until the last Ottoman soldier fled Damascus in 1918. In 1916, during the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, the rebels adopted a flag with three horizontal stripes in black, green and white, from top to bottom, and a red triangle on the left, with its base on the left and its tip pointing to the right. In 1918, after the Ottomans left, the flag was raised in Damascus. In March 1920, the Syrian National Congress declared Syria's independence and crowned Prince Faisal bin Al-Hussein bin Ali as king. A white star was added to the flag in the middle of the red triangle, but this did not last long. The Allies refused to recognize Syria's independence and announced the imposition of a mandate over Syria and Lebanon, with Syria becoming a protectorate under the French Mandate. During the French Mandate, the French changed the Syrian flag twice. Both flags included a small French flag in the upper left. The Syrians have rejected the flags of the French Mandate over the years. In 1925, the 'Great Syrian Revolt' began in Syria and the Syrians sought a flag that would emphasize their sovereignty. The 'Flag of Independence,' the current flag of Syria, first appeared in 1928 in the draft constitution of the First Syrian Republic, when Syria was still under the rule of the Mandate. It was first flown in the city of Aleppo in 1932 and later in Damascus. Each of the colors of the flag had a different meaning at that time: green represented the first caliphate after the death of the Prophet Muhammad; white represented the Umayyad dynasty; and black represented the Abbasid Caliphate. The three stars represented Aleppo, Damascus and Deir ez-Zor, strategic and important cities in Syria. In 1936, after the annexation of Latakia and the Druze Mountains (Jabal al-Druze, in the Sweida region) to Syria, the meaning of the three stars changed. The first star symbolized Aleppo, Damascus and Deir ez-Zor, the second the Druze Mountains, and the third Latakia. After Syria officially declared its independence from the French Mandate in 1946, the Mandate flag was lowered and the flag of the First Syrian Republic, the 'flag of independence,' was officially raised. It remained in force until 1958. From 1958 to 1961, Syria was part of a state united with Egypt called the 'United Arab Republic,' and its flag was replaced with a flag with three stripes - red, white and black from top to bottom - with two green stars on the white stripe, one of which symbolized Syria and the other Egypt. Later, it was the flag of the Baath regime, after several changes. After the collapse of the 'United Arab Republic,' the 'flag of independence' officially returned to Syria, but for only three years, from 1961 to 1963. When the Baath Party came to power in Syria, it re-adopted the flag of the 'United Arab Republic,' and it was its official flag from 1963 to 1972, but with a small addition: When the Baath Party came to power in Iraq, there was an attempt by the Baath governments there and in Syria to unite with Egypt, and a third green star was added to the previous unity flag, so that the three stars represented the three countries. However, the Baath government in Iraq fell, and with it the plans for unification also collapsed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the ensuing years, Syria's flags continued to change. In 1971, during the reign of Hafez Assad, Syria joined the 'Union of Arab Republics' with Egypt and Libya, and a new flag was adopted: The three stars from the last flag were replaced by an image of a hawk with the inscription 'Union of Arab Republics' underneath. The union fell apart, and in 1980, Hafez Assad changed the flag again. He returned the flag that had been used in 1958-1961, during the 'United Arab Republic' of Syria and Egypt, with the original two stars. This flag remained the official flag of Syria until just a week ago. The 'flag of independence' with the three green stars was used again in 2011 when the civil war broke out, and it was the rebels who brought it back into fashion. It became the official opposition flag, and last week it became the new flag of all of Syria. Yesterday, Syrians were already seen flying it on poles in schools and sticking it to planes at the airport. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rki11gfpeke	2024-12-16T03:46:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/SksYZEVE1g/SksYZEVE1g_0_244_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Ireland rejects Israeli claims of bias; Jewish leader: 'dialogue ...	Foreign Minister Micheal Martin says Dublin's decision to join the ICJ case accusing Israel of genocide is motivated by respect for international law; Israeli ambassador says decision to close embassy does not mean diplomatic ties are severed Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said on Monday that Ireland’s intervention at the ICJ and its previous recognition of the 'state of Palestine' is motivated by 'respect for international humanitarian law' and added that supporting the ICJ and the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, should not be viewed as a hostile act. Martin spoke in Brussels a day after Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar announced the closure of the Israeli embassy in Dublin. Sa'ar on Sunday cited Ireland's hostility to Israel as the reason for his decision. 'Ireland’s actions and rhetoric are rooted in delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, accompanied by blatant double standards,' Sa'ar said. 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its treatment of Israel. We will redirect our resources toward strengthening ties with nations that respect Israel.' 'We’ve consistently called for an immediate cease-fire, release of all hostages, and a massive surge of humanitarian aid,' the Irish minister said, adding that there must be 'full accountability for the destruction of much of Gaza by the IDF in the war as well as accountability for Hamas militants who had controlled the Palestinian enclave, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.' Martin also called on Israel to 'open up' Gaza to the international community and the media, so that they could 'bear witness' to what is happening. Chairman of the Irish Jewish Representative Council Maurice Cohen expressed his concern over the deterioration of Israeli-Irish diplomatic relations and said that the closure of the embassy 'has caused distress' for Israelis in Ireland. 'The closure of the embassy represents not only a symbolic blow but also a practical disadvantage,' Cohen said. 'Consular services provided by the embassy are vital for those maintaining connections with family, culture, and heritage in Israel,' he added. He said that losing this resource would leave many feeling unsupported and aggrieved, according to Cohen. 'Closing the embassy risks alienating a significant segment of Irish society and sends a message that dialogue is being replaced by disengagement,' he added Cohen said that Ireland's decision to join the case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, is a overly simplistic interpretation of a complex and tragic dispute 'unfairly isolating Israel, and undermining the integrity of the term 'genocide'.' He said that the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the protection of innocent lives 'on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' while also supporting Israel's right to defend itself from 'terrorism and existential threats.'

Biden ties fall of Assad to US support for Israel	The US administration is using the toppling of the Syrian dictator to defend the Biden White House's Mideast policies, according to a Washington Post analysis Senior officials in the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden claimed that the president's unwavering support for Israel helped weaken Hezbollah and Iran and led to the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. An analysis piece published in the Washington Post on Sunday said the administration was using the collapse of the Syrian regime to defend its Middle East policies, including its support of Israel in the war in Gaza, that was widely criticized. Biden said that Assad's main backers, Iran, Hezbollah and Russia, had been significantly weakened. Without those patrons, the regime in Damascus fell at an unusual speed. 'For the first time ever, neither Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend this abhorrent regime in Syria. And this is a direct result of the blows that Ukraine and Israel have delivered upon their own self-defense, with unflagging support of the United States,' the president said. A senior official in his administration added that, in view of the general picture, it his hard to argue that the American approach was wrong.

Some 3 million Israelis live in poverty, 40% of them children, re...	Latet's annual poverty report paints a grim picture of economic hardship in Israel during the ongoing war, as 678,000 families face significant deprivation, with nearly 50% of children in supported households experiencing declining mental health and educational setbacks; Additionally, more than half of elderly beneficiaries are forced to forgo essential medications and are grappling with heightened loneliness and anxiety Latet, an Israeli nonprofit aid organization, published its annual poverty report on Monday, shedding light on the complex economic reality in Israel during 2024 against the backdrop of ongoing war and conflict. According to the organization's multidimensional poverty index, which defines poverty as significant deprivation in relation to basic living needs and conditions, 678,200 families (22.3%) and 2,756,000 individuals (28.7%) in Israel are living in poverty. This includes 1,240,000 children, accounting for 39.6%. While the poverty rates are similar to last year’s figures, the forecast is alarming. 'The relative stability in poverty rates this year stems partly from government support for evacuees and businesses, activities by civil society and philanthropy, continued national insurance payments, and the gradual nature of descent into poverty,' the report explains. 'This process typically begins with exhausting savings, moves to taking out loans, and only later becomes evident in official poverty statistics. Unfortunately, future projections indicate a worsening situation, particularly in light of the government’s new economic measures.' The rising cost of living The report reveals that in 2024, the minimum monthly cost of living in Israel is 5,355 shekels per person and 13,617 shekels for a household of two adults and two children. These figures represent increases of 6.5% and 6.9% respectively compared to last year. Annually, this amounts to an additional expense of approximately 4,000 shekels per person and 10,500 shekels per household. For middle-class households, normative living costs are estimated at 8,665 shekels per person and 22,181 shekels per household. 'The minimum cost of living, reflecting the basic expenses required for survival, has nearly doubled the growth in the Consumer Price Index, which stands at 3.6%,' Latet notes. Most of the rise is attributed to higher prices for food, housing, utilities, and related costs. As a result, there is a growing population in Israel that, while not classified as poor by the National Insurance Institute, effectively lives in poverty. Households with a per-person income above the national poverty line of 4,105 shekels but below the minimum cost of living of 5,355 shekels are unable to maintain basic living standards and therefore experience varying degrees of deprivation. The report also examines the challenges faced by those supported by Latet. 'The cost of living in Israel, already high before the war, has significantly worsened,' it states. 'The conflict has driven up prices, particularly for food and consumer goods.' The average monthly expenditure for supported households is 10,367 shekels – 1.7 times their average net monthly income of 6,092 shekels. Debt is widespread among these households, with 78.8% reporting outstanding loans compared to 26.9% of the general population. The financial situation of 65% of Latet beneficiaries and 32.1% of the general public has deteriorated over the past year. Among the supported population, 69.5% are unable to repair severe home defects due to financial constraints, 84.8% face energy shortages, and 33.7% endure severe energy insecurity. Alarmingly, the electricity was disconnected for 22.1% in the past year due to nonpayment. Children and the elderly are most affected The report highlights the war's toll on children and teenagers. Academic performance has significantly declined for 44.6% of children in supported households, compared to 14.1% in the general population. Moreover, 46.7% of beneficiaries report severe mental health impacts on their children, three times higher than the general public (14.5%). About 22.8% say at least one child dropped out of school, and 18.9% had to transfer their children to boarding schools due to financial hardship. Additionally, 85.4% had to forgo private tutoring for at least one child. The elderly population also faces unique challenges exacerbated by the conflict. Among Latet’s elderly beneficiaries, 81.7% live in poverty, and 52.6% are classified as living in extreme poverty. Over one-third (34.8%) endure severe food insecurity, and 60.4% have forgone essential medications or medical treatments because they could not afford them. Research conducted for the report underscores the daily struggles of supported families, especially regarding food insecurity. 'Many supported households live in constant fear of running out of food and being unable to buy more or provide balanced meals for their children,' Latet states. About 80% of beneficiaries report instances where food ran out, and they lacked funds to purchase more. Additionally, 62.4% reduced or skipped meals due to financial constraints, compared to 16% in the general population. Among parents, 50.5% had to forgo or reduce recommended infant formula for their babies, compared to 12% of the general population. > Latet's founder and president, Gilles Darmon, and its CEO, Eran Weintraub, express grave concerns about the future. 'The planned economic measures – including raising VAT, increasing social security and health insurance payments, and rising electricity, water and property tax costs – are expected to deepen the hardships faced by vulnerable populations,' they warn. 'The combination of inflation, high interest rates, an anti-social government budget, and the ongoing costs of recovery from the war, will likely push thousands more low-middle-class families into severe deprivation.' They conclude with a call to action. 'In addition to military and security challenges, Israel faces another battle – the fight against poverty. The country stands at a moral crossroads. Solidarity and mutual responsibility will determine whether we emerge from this crisis stronger or weaker. It’s time for the government to take responsibility, act decisively to reduce poverty and inequality, and implement a comprehensive socio-economic policy that addresses the needs of all segments of society.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skalv8tvjl	2024-12-16T01:13:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/06/07/rkvzG6aT83/rkvzG6aT83_0_136_2560_1440_0_small.jpg

Serbia used Israeli firm’s tech to enable spy campaign, Amnesty s...	Report says spyware by Israeli surveillance company Cellebrite DI Ltd was used to unlock phones of activists and journalists during interviews with Serbian police and security authorities; Company says 'violation of our end user license agreement' Serbian officials installed homegrown spyware on the phones of dozens of journalists and activists, Amnesty International said in a report on Monday. The report cites digital forensic evidence and testimony from activists who said they were hacked in recent months. According to the report, software provided by Israeli surveillance company Cellebrite DI Ltd (CLBT.O) was used to unlock phones prior to infection. The Serbian spyware, dubbed 'NoviSpy' by Amnesty, then took covert screenshots of mobile devices, copied contacts, and uploaded them to a government-controlled server, the report said. 'In multiple cases, activists and a journalist reported signs of suspicious activity on their mobile phones directly following interviews with Serbian police and security authorities,' Amnesty said. Serbia’s interior ministry, foreign ministry and intelligence agency BIA did not respond to requests for comment made on Dec. 12. Cellebrite products are widely used by law enforcement, including the FBI, to unlock smartphones and scour them for evidence. Cellebrite Chief Marketing Officer David Gee said it was investigating the Amnesty allegations. 'Should those accusations be accurate, that could potentially be in violation of our end user license agreement,' Gee told Reuters. If that were the case, Gee said, Cellebrite could suspend the use of its technology by Serbian authorities. Putting surveillance software on devices 'is absolutely not what we do,' Gee said. He added that Cellebrite had begun contacting Serbian officials but declined to provide further details. One of the activists featured by Amnesty in the report said they had noticed the contacts on their phone had been exported immediately after a meeting with the BIA. The activist told Reuters they showed their phone to digital forensic experts, who discovered the NoviSpy spyware had exported their contacts and sent private photos from their device to a BIA-controlled server. According to Amnesty, Serbia received phone-cracking devices from Cellebrite as part of a broader package of assistance designed to help Serbia meet the requirements for integration into the European Union. That package, which was funded by the Norwegian government and administered by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), was provided to the Serbian interior ministry from 2017 to 2021 in order to help Serbia fight organized crime, the report said. > The Norwegian government temporarily ceased delivery of Cellebrite devices to Serbia in 2018, Amnesty said. The Norwegian Embassy in Belgrade also raised concerns about the program, the report added, but UNOPS eventually delivered the devices in June 2019. 'The claims made in the report are alarming and, if correct, unacceptable,' Norway's deputy foreign minister, Maria Varteressian, told Reuters. 'We will meet Serbian authorities as well as UNOPS later this month to get further information on the matter.' 'We expect UNOPS to investigate the allegations,' she added. UNOPS said in a statement it welcomed Amnesty's report and said the agency had in the years since 2017 'further enhanced mechanisms to assess and mitigate potential adverse effects.' The agency did not elaborate on those measures. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk0avlpe1l	2024-12-15T23:05:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/r1Gd8IT4yx/r1Gd8IT4yx_0_49_1921_1081_0_small.jpg
The IDF’s groundbreaking Refaim combat unit has its 1st female op...	Major A, the first female Operations Officer in an elite IDF unit, is breaking barriers in the Refaim (Ghost) Unit under the 162nd Division; From Gaza tunnels to cutting-edge combat innovation, her leadership exemplifies dedication, resilience and a commitment to redefining possibilities for female soldiers The IDF’s 162nd Division has been conducting prolonged operations in Jabaliya for over two months, recently expanding into Beit Lahia. Among the ruins of northern Gaza, Major A has emerged as a key figure. Serving as the first female Operations Officer (Katzin Agam) in an elite IDF unit, she is part of the multi-dimensional elite Refaim unit, a groundbreaking combat force. In her previous role, Major A was the deputy commander of a combat platoon in Yahalom (which means Diamond), the elite unit of the Combat Engineering Corps. Reflecting on her decision to continue her military service, she explained: 'I had a dilemma this summer about whether to leave the IDF after completing my time in Yahalom. But with the fighting here ongoing, I couldn’t bring myself to leave Gaza. I felt I had more to give. I applied for the position of Operations Officer in the Refaim unit and was accepted after two crazy years in Yahalom, the second of which was spent in maneuvering operations in Gaza.' A native of a community near Jerusalem and now living in Tel Aviv, Major A is no stranger to breaking barriers. She began her service as a combat soldier and officer in the Gaza Division’s reconnaissance unit, and later, as a commander of an observation company, she worked closely with Colonel Tal Ashur, the former commander of the Southern Brigade, who now leads the Refaim unit. Refaim: Innovation and combat excellence The Refaim unit, established four years ago, serves as the experimental and developmental arm of the IDF’s ground forces. Its mission is to test and implement innovative combat techniques and technologies, which are then shared with other brigades and units. The unit’s soldiers undergo specialized commando training, preparing them for cutting-edge operations. On October 7, the unit’s commander, Colonel Roi Levi, was killed in action while fighting in Kibbutz Re’im. Despite its relatively small size, Refaim has made significant advances over the past year, particularly in the use of drones for detecting and eliminating threats. These advancements, along with classified technologies developed during combat, have placed the unit at the forefront of operational innovation. Major A has played a central role in managing these efforts, coordinating the unit’s operations in areas such as the Nitzarim corridor and now in Jabaliya under the 162nd Division. A career built on breaking barriers Before the war, Major A held a staff position in the IDF’s central Tel Aviv headquarters as the head of the operational section in the Cyber Defense Division. There, she worked on bridging operational combat and the cyber spectrum, a field that continues to evolve both in the Refaim unit and across all branches of Israeli armed forces. 'I never imagined I’d become a deputy battalion commander in Yahalom, let alone lead a combat platoon and enter tunnels in Gaza,' she said. 'I commanded forces tasked with destroying tunnel infrastructure, and my presence as a female officer was unique. I was often the first commanding figure in Yahalom, but the unit commander trusted me and gave me the opportunity to lead soldiers, from northern Gaza to Rafah.' While her time in Yahalom marked the peak of her career, Major A felt compelled to continue. 'Something in my gut told me not to leave. I couldn’t see myself anywhere else with all the experience I had gained. When the door to Refaim opened, I seized it with both hands. In my time here, I’ve been responsible for managing and executing the unit’s operations against Hamas, overseeing battle management, resources, and weaponry for the soldiers. Essentially, I’ve become the commander’s right hand on the battlefield.' Leadership during crisis Major A was at the helm of the unit’s operations center during a tragic incident two weeks ago, when four Refaim soldiers were killed by an explosive device in Jabaliya. 'I quickly mobilized the system to isolate the area, evacuate the casualties, safely integrate reinforcements, and secure the zone,' she recounted. 'It was a deeply painful event, though not the first time I’ve lost close friends in this war. In this incident, Lieutenant Joni, the team commander who had previously been my operations officer, was killed. Before that, two of my close friends, Ariel Ben Moshe and David Shkuri, were also killed in combat. The event two weeks ago hit me hard, but in these situations, you have to stay focused and save the emotions for later. The team here is incredibly strong and continues to excel in exposing and eliminating the enemy.' In her next role, Major A is expected to compete for a position as a battalion commander, which would make her a lieutenant colonel. Despite the progress made, she acknowledges that female combat officers remain a minority in the IDF. While there are female Operations Officers in maneuvering battalions, female battalion commanders who have operated in Gaza, and combat medics in elite units, she believes there is still more work to be done. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I hope one day this won’t even be a topic of discussion, but we’re not there yet,' she said. 'The war has raised awareness about the role of female combat soldiers, and it’s heartwarming to see more women in combat roles, even in Gaza. We’re still a minority among combat officers, though I don’t feel like I’m doing anything extraordinary. The unit here has welcomed me with open arms. There will always be a few people who raise an eyebrow, but I know the burden of proof is on me – not because I’m a woman, but because I’m a soldier. I hope this conversation disappears one day.' Still, Major A advises caution in opening all combat roles to women immediately. 'The military has made significant progress on this issue. There are far more opportunities for female combat soldiers today than when I enlisted 11 years ago,' she said. 'We need to preserve and develop what exists, increasing equality and opportunities without lowering standards or compromising quality. More and more units are opening up to women, and this should be based on the essence of the role, not just the name of the unit.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ryxjktn4jx	2024-12-15T22:50:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/13/yk14150635/yk14150635_0_13_464_262_0_small.jpg

Israeli analyst: Diplomatic ties with Syria unlikely	Jonathan Conricus: Syrian rebels 'are just one notch away from full jihadi extremism in the forms of ISIS and Al Qaeda' An Israeli analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies has expressed skepticism about the likelihood of Israel and the incoming Syrian government establishing normalized ties. Speaking to ILTV News, Jonathan Conricus, a former IDF spokesperson, said the Syrian rebels 'are just one notch away from full jihadi extremism in the forms of ISIS and Al Qaeda,' making warm ties unlikely—at least in the short term. He added, 'Maybe in the future, after one or two elections, when the Syrian people understand that the only thing that can happen with regards to normalization with Israel is prosperity and peace and stability and options for the future for them, for the future of their children.' 'Then, maybe they will see things in a different way and reach out towards Israel,' Conricus continued. 'I think if and when they do, they will find an Israel that is willing, interested, and capable in building those bridges of peace, which are mutually beneficial, and it will promote stability in the region.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj5ybeanjx	2024-12-15T19:50:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/SkqmlETVyg/SkqmlETVyg_0_616_720_406_0_small.jpg
Middle East expert: ‘Any strike on Iran will be blessed’	Dr. Mordechai Kedar: There was never any diplomatic way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon A Middle East expert has stated that if Israel or the United States decides to attack Iran, the move will be 'blessed' because 'it will bring more peace and stability to the world.' Speaking to ILTV News, Dr. Mordechai Kedar said that President-Elect Donald Trump’s suggestion of a preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear sites is likely the only way to prevent the rogue regime from obtaining a nuclear bomb. He emphasized that diplomacy is not—and never was—an option. 'There was never any diplomatic way to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon,' Kedar told ILTV. 'They were marching forward with their nuclear program, in spite of all the negotiations, and, in fact, in spite of all the agreements. And unfortunately, the world, especially the western world, who doesn't understand anything in the Middle East, fell in this pit time and again.'

Israeli anchor praises Erin Molan: 'A role model for journalists ...	Sivan Raviv: 'Your courage and unwavering commitment to presenting the realities of this region are truly inspiring' ILTV News anchor Sivan Raviv has praised former Sky News Australia anchor Erin Molan, who was dismissed from the outlet following widespread criticism of her outspoken support for Israel over the past year and since October 7. 'Erin, your bravery in reporting the truth about Israel has not gone unnoticed,' Raviv said Sunday during the ILTV Daily News report. 'As a fellow anchor and journalist here in Israel, I want to tell you that your courage and unwavering commitment to presenting the realities of this region are truly inspiring in a world where reporting on Israel often invites disproportionate criticism.' She continued, 'You stood tall and spoke with integrity. You are a role model for journalists everywhere who strive to tell the truth, no matter the personal or professional cost. We deeply appreciate your voice and your work, and I wish you nothing but success and strength in the next chapter of your career.' Molan, who is neither Jewish nor Israeli, is known for her bold and unapologetic style as she stood firm in defending Israel's right to self-defense amid the ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. Her coverage highlighted the complex realities of the conflict, including the role of terrorism and its impact on Israeli civilians—topics she argued were often overlooked in international reporting. Despite her efforts to provide a perspective often marginalized in global media, Molan faced significant backlash from some viewers and activists who accused her of bias and insensitivity toward Palestinians. Critics targeted her social media posts and on-air comments, which condemned Hamas while calling for more nuanced reporting on the region. Supporters, however, praised her for speaking the truth and challenging what they saw as double standards in media narratives about Israel. Sky News stated that Molan’s dismissal was a business decision, though many speculate the move was influenced by the controversy surrounding her stance on Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk11so76ekl	2024-12-15T19:27:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/13/SkXmwvFVyl/SkXmwvFVyl_1_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Al Jazeera's 'cameraman' killed? IDF: he was PIJ commander	The Qatari-based network claims Ahmed al-Louh was a member of their news team, but the military says he had been a platoon commander for the Islamic terror faction The Qatari Al Jazeera network said on Sunday that the IDF killed Ahmed al-Louh who worked as a cameraman in Gaza at the Nuseirat refugee camp. 'Al Jazeera Media Network condemns in the strongest terms the killing of its cameraman, Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, by the Israeli occupation forces,' the channel said. 'He was brutally killed in an air strike that targeted a Civil Defense post in the market area of Al-Nuseirat Camp, central Gaza Strip,' it added. The IDF confirmed in a statement that Louh had been killed in a strike on Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the 'Civil Defense' organization in Nuseirat. 'Among the terrorists eliminated in the strike was the Islamic Jihad terrorist Ahmed Bakr al-Louh, who previously served as a Platoon commander in the Islamic Jihad's Central Camps Brigade,' the IDF said in a statement. 'The terrorists used the command and control center to plan and carry out an imminent terror attack against IDF troops.' > The IDF said that steps were taken before the strike to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians, 'including the use of precise munitions, precise aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence. 'The terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip systematically violate international law, exploiting civilian infrastructure and the Gazan population as human shields for terrorist activity. The IDF will continue to operate against terrorist organizations in defense of the citizens of Israel,' the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkrzba341e	2024-12-15T13:20:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/r1fUm0hV1g/r1fUm0hV1g_246_150_706_397_0_small.jpg
Palestinian Authority's elite unit leads Jenin anti-terror operat...	The PA’s 101st Unit is a 2,000 strong forced trained by Americans and Canadians conducting a sweeping crackdown; Abbas assigned the force to assert control amid firefights with terrorists Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Sunday that anyone in his security forces who refuses to take part in the counter-terror operation the PA was conducting in Jenin would be fired. The West Bank city of Jenin has become a nerve center for terrorist activity, where armed groups operate with impunity. But now, the Palestinian Authority’s elite 101st Unit is rewriting the rules of engagement. With its sights set on restoring order and intends to dismantle the terror networks, reclaim refugee camps, and reassert authority. Comprising of 2,000 highly trained troops, the 101st Unit is a force to be reckoned with. Its members—young, academically accomplished, and physically fit—are rigorously trained by American and Canadian specialists. 'This is an elite unit that trains abroad, in various countries,' a senior Palestinian Authority official explained to Ynet. 'It’s a source of Palestinian pride, defined by strength, courage, and respect for the population.' Working in close coordination with Palestinian intelligence services, the unit is tasked with identifying 'lawbreakers,' a term that encompasses everything from drug dealers and arms traffickers to terrorists targeting both Palestinians and Israelis. Jenin’s refugee camp, long seen as a lawless enclave and a hub for terrorist activity, now finds itself in the crosshairs of the Unit’s precision operations. Leadership in the shadows The 101st Unit operates under the command of Major General Nidal Abu Dukhan, a towering figure in Palestinian security circles. Renowned for his academic and military training across multiple countries, Abu Dukhan has earned the respect of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and even served as Yasser Arafat’s bodyguard. His leadership is as strategic as it is symbolic, embodying the authority’s determination to restore order in its restive territories. Despite initial fears of widespread unrest, the Palestinian Authority has reported minimal public resistance to the unit’s activities within the camps. 'We thought the population would protect the lawbreakers among them, but that didn’t happen,' a senior official admitted. 'This shows that the residents are tired of illegal activities and want order to return to the camps.' Symbolizing change Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa recently visited Jenin to commend the ongoing operation. 'The Jenin camp and other camps are symbols of our pride,' he declared. 'This is a commitment from the president and all of us. While these camps are national symbols, residents must be able to live in peace.' He further emphasized, 'We are working to restore security everywhere, which will bring positive outcomes for everyone—security and development for our people as we work toward an independent state.' Last night, the unit maintained control over the camps despite attempts to disrupt its operations in several locations across the West Bank. No significant disturbances were reported, further solidifying the operation's success. The name '101st Unit' carries historical weight. It mirrors the legendary Israeli commando unit founded by Ariel Sharon in 1953, known for its daring reprisal operations against infiltrators from Jordan and Gaza. Among its storied actions were raids on the Al-Bureij refugee camp in Gaza and operations like 'Silk Gloves,' where Meir Har-Zion led ground assaults deep into enemy territory. The symbolic adoption of this name by the Palestinian Authority is both bold and ironic, as it signals a new era of assertiveness. The Assad effect: A war on terrorist strongholds The 101st Unit’s campaign, known as 'Homeland Defense,' has unfolded against a backdrop of shifting regional dynamics. Israeli intelligence has noted a marked increase in Palestinian Authority activity against militant groups in the northern West Bank, particularly in Jenin. The operation, now in its seventh day, includes encircling the Jenin refugee camp and conducting raids in areas like Tulkarm. 'This is equivalent to a major military campaign on our scale—something we haven’t seen in years,' a senior Israeli security source told Ynet. 'The humiliating trigger was the theft of Palestinian Authority vehicles by armed militants.' The operation has deployed snipers, sharpshooters, and armored vehicles, leveraging strong intelligence to guide its actions. Despite early heavy firefights and the use of a car bomb by militants, the unit’s efforts have yet to uncover all hidden explosive devices. After setting up a command center in the Jibrayat neighborhood overlooking the camp, the unit launched its ground assault at 5:00 AM, engaging in intense exchanges of fire. So far, one senior militant commander has been killed, and injuries have been reported on both sides. Significant arrests of wanted men remain elusive, but the operation is expected to continue for several days. A wake-up call from Syria The Palestinian Authority’s determination to act has been fueled, in part, by the collapse of the Syrian regime. 'They saw how a handful of armed groups with pickup trucks, AK-47s, and machine guns quickly and easily seized control of the government,' an Israeli military source observed. 'What’s to stop militant groups from doing the same in Ramallah?' The Israeli defense establishment has urged Palestinian forces to adopt a more proactive approach, following the success of last year’s 'Nablus Model.' There, terrorist groups were suppressed through a combination of Israeli military action and the subsequent reassertion of Palestinian Authority control over the city’s Kasbah and refugee camps. The battle for Jenin highlights the cyclical nature of counterterrorism. 'You kill ten militants in a place like the Jenin refugee camp, and ten new young recruits replace them immediately,' one security source remarked. Members of the 101st Unit have reportedly faced children as young as eight throwing explosives at them during the past week.

But in their campaign to reclaim Jenin and other militant strongholds, they are forging a new narrative—one of resilience, strategy, and the uncompromising pursuit of order in one of the most turbulent regions of the West Bank. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rynmhihvjl	2024-12-15T12:44:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/B1t000NNh4kg/B1t000NNh4kg_122_61_647_364_0_small.jpg

How Israeli Irish relations failed	The decision to close the Israeli embassy in Dublin comes after over a year of policies taken by the Irish government including recognizing a Palestinian State, divesting from Israeli companies and ignoring Hamas crimes The decision of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to close the Israeli embassy in Ireland came after Dublin joined the South African petition against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague accusing Israel of committing genocide. 'The actions and antisemitic rhetoric used by Ireland against Israel are rooted in the delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, along with double standards. Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel,' Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said in the statement. 'The Israeli decision was deeply regrettable,' Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said. 'I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-International law,' Harris said in a post on X. Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said the two countries would maintain diplomatic relations and there were no plans to close Ireland's embassy in Israel. Israel had previously considered the option of closing-down its embassy and said it took the step, in response to the Irish government's extreme anti-Israeli position. Soon after the war in Gaza began, there were voiced in Ireland calling for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador Dana Erlich, who received threat just three weeks after the Hamas massacre. Erlich who was assigned to one of the most hostile European capitals, appeared frequently in the Irish media, criticizing the parliament. That led to personal threats against her and she was slammed on social media with calls to 'kick out the terrorist ambassador,' accompanied by her photos covered in blood. She recently even found herself in confrontation with Irish President Michael Higgins who had accused Israel of violating international law and the Geneva Convention and claimed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had declared his intentions to break international law in advance. Erlich responded by accusing him of misinformation regarding the war. She said the president's comment were inciting. One month later, the former prime minister Leo Varadkar praised the release of then nine-year-old Emily Hand from Hamas captivity after she was abducted during the Oct. 7 massacre but neglected to mention who her abductors were. 'This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family. An innocent child who was lost and has now been found and returned, Varadkar wrote in a post on X. Last May Ireland joined Norway and Spain in recognizing a Palestinian state. Harris then said he expected more countries to follow suit. Even before that decision was made, in April Ireland' Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) announced it was selling its holdings in six Israeli companies because they had activity in the 'occupied Palestinian territories.' The sale of assets totaling some three million euros from major Israeli banks and a supermarket chain was based on a UN data base of companies working in Israeli settlements on the West Bank. At the same time Ireland has had a sharp increase in antisemitic incidents including in the education system. The British Jewish Chronical reported that school books included sentences like 'murderous Jews' and 'Israel is an aggressor' and as a result, Jewish children were traumatized and made to change schools. The Education Ministry in Dublin rejected the criticism and said that Irish children receive fair and balanced educational material from good Irish teachers in a variety of subjects including Judaism and the history of the Jewish people.

The students who fight for Israel on Italian campuses	Andrea Nizoli and Pietro Balzano talk with Ynet about their efforts to cooperate with Israeli universities and hostilities against Jewish and Israeli students by pro-Palestinians on campus As pro-Palestinian protests, violent incidents against Jews and Israelis and antisemitism across the world intensified hate for Israel after October 7, some pro-Israeli actors moved to try and defend the country in the international arena. Now, two Italian students who took a stand for Israel and its public diplomacy on their campus spoke to Ynet about their efforts. Andrea Nizoli and Pietro Balzano, thank you for joining us. Andrea, a university student in international relations and law and the leader of Forza Italia that were the first to demonstrate against pro-Palestinians on campus. As a non-Jewish student, what was the motivation behind your activity? 'Support for the Israeli people and we were also grateful for all the democracy exportation you're doing. We can see the result of your action in Syria now. And, at the start of that period, we started demonstrating for the freedom of Israeli people and also, the freedom to go to university and be free to study.' Did you witness incitement against the Jewish students on your campus this year? 'Yes, for sure. There was a lot of discrimination against Jewish people. And today we have some Jewish people that told us they were not allowed to go to the university, to be free to study without the protestors going against them. There were also Jewish people with us and they joined us after that we publicized our manifest.' Pietro, what made you join the fights against the rising antisemitism on campus and the lies that were spread this year since the beginning of the war? 'We've seen since the beginning of the war, those violent protests that started in our campuses and, not only in Milan, but also, Naples, Rome, Turin and so on because they want to use fear and violence against common students and in particular against students who also come from Israel to our universities and Jewish people in general. 'So I think it's also important to remember that they call themselves a 'Students Intifada.' That's how far they've come. And what we are trying to fight is exactly what we are seeing in those images. They are blocking our universities. They are causing damage to our universities for tens of thousands of euros — in some cases, hundreds of thousands of euros, which, of course, they aren't going to pay and that's what we are fighting against'. Do you have specific examples from your campus? You also participated in a debate relating to the war. 'Yes. I tried to participate in a so-called 'debate', but I instantly acknowledged that debates in our university, especially when Israel is concerned, are no longer possible because there's too much extremism and it's not possible to even talk about the agreements with the Israeli universities right now because they're trying to stop them all and we're also fighting against this.' 'And in this regard, I want to say that I'm extremely happy to announce that we will be coming to Israel because I think it's extremely important to show the truth they forget or try to hide. We have to show the truth and bring it back to Italy, that's extremely important for us.' Andrea, as Pietro has mentioned you're planning to come to Israel in January. What is the purpose of your visit? 'We are going to visit Reichman University to announce our support of the university. After October 7, a lot of universities in Italy, like in Milano and Torino, know a lot of universities around all of Italy from the north to the south and decided to not continue to have a relationship with Israeli universities and this for us is something that is unacceptable. 'This is because as a student we really believe in the international community, especially the one in Israel because you have some knowledge in some subjects that are fundamental nowadays. We're also going to Jerusalem to see the real Israel.' Pietro, you raised funds to finance the visit. What kind of responses do you get from your fellow students on campus? 'The students, are afraid because those students who support Palestine and not only are using violence and fear, and so the students who actually support Israel, and there are a lot, are scared to speak about about it because they're using violence against their own colleagues and I think it's no wonder why Hezbollah officials have described them as actors in which they should invest.

Britain has had 'diplomatic contact' with Syria's HTS group	Britain has had diplomatic contact with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that swept Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power last week, British foreign minister David Lammy said on Sunday. 'HTS remains a proscribed organization, but we can have diplomatic contact and so we do have diplomatic contact as you would expect,' Lammy told broadcasters. 'Using all the channels that we have available, and those are diplomatic and, of course, intelligence-led channels, we seek to deal with HTS where we have to.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s13amin4ke	2024-12-15T09:41:53-08:00	
Between a niqab and a bikini: Riyadh aims to become world's fashi...	Saudi Arabia's relationship with the fashion world is seeing major shifts in the last year, culminating in a glamourous fashion week that draws congratulations but also condemnations In October 2023, right after Paris Fashion Week ended, Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh hosted its first-ever fashion week, organized by the Saudi Fashion Commission. Held at the King Abdullah Financial District, the event showcased 30 local designers and brands. Since then, the event has been held twice a year, drawing prominent figures from the Arab world and local celebrities including Georgina Rodríguez, Cristiano Ronaldo’s partner (Ronaldo plays for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia). Rodriguez attended shows by designers Fatima Alabdulqader and Khawla Alaiban. 'The event highlights our top creative talents and allows our brands to show the world what Saudi fashion has to offer,' Saudi Fashion Commission Director Burak Cakmak said. Riyadh Fashion Week marked a turning point in Saudi Arabia's approach to fashion and its openness to the Western world — a trend that's grown over the past year. In May, for example, Saudi Arabia held its first-ever swimwear fashion show — a bold step for the conservative Muslim nation. Recently, as part of the Riyadh Season festival, Lebanese designer Elie Saab’s fashion show featured singers like Jennifer Lopez and Céline Dion. Simultaneously, the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition launched at Saudi Arabia’s National Museum (closing April 2), showcasing 75 years of Dior’s creations. The exhibits emphasize local influences, such as the Al-Ula region, reflected in designs inspired by desert light and golden sands, blending Western haute couture with local traditions and nature. One of Saudi Arabia's strategies to bolster its fashion industry was establishing the Saudi Fashion Commission in 2020, headed by Burak Cakmak, a former dean of fashion at Parsons School of Design in New York. 'We have been building a fashion industry here in Saudi completely from scratch,' Cakmak explained in a 2023 interview with Forbes. 'The biggest challenge has been obtaining market data information. It’s important that the commission, as well as designers and businesses across the value chain, can make informed data-led decisions,' he said. 'The Saudi fashion scene is truly like no other, you just need to attend a Saudi event such as the Saudi Cup to witness its originality and love of luxury and extravagance, blended with Saudi heritage and the contemporary,' he added. Cakmak is optimistic about the sector’s growth in the Muslim country, envisioning a future that preserves Middle Eastern traditions while developing a new design language. One of his initiatives is the Saudi 100 Brands program, a professional development effort helping emerging fashion talents — 85% of whom are women — reach their potential through specialized courses and brand development support. 'What distinguishes Saudi designers from others is our vision, which is born from our past and our heritage,' said Nour Al Dhahri, a designer from the Saudi 100 Brands program specializing in embroidered evening gowns and a regular at Riyadh Fashion Week. Saudi Arabia's current focus on expanding its presence in fashion, including shows, exhibitions and Western appeal, follows two and a half decades of stability in its luxury market, fueled by its oil wealth. In the early 2000s, luxury brands began entering the Saudi market — a trend that intensified in the 2010s with the expansion of major fashion groups like Chalhoub, representing brands like Fendi, Versace and Tom Ford. This period also saw the launch of fashion magazines targeting the local audience, such as Vogue Arabia and Marie Claire Arabia, based in the UAE. These developments strengthened the local economy. Whereas 70% of Gulf and Saudi customers’ luxury purchases previously occurred abroad in fashion hubs like Milan and Paris, there’s now a growing trend of buying luxury brands in local malls. As of 2023, Saudi Arabia's fashion industry is valued at approximately $30 billion, projected to reach $42 billion by 2028, with a significant 48% growth in retail fashion sales expected by 2025. The industry contributes 2.5% to the country’s GDP and has created 320,000 jobs. Women comprise 52% of the workforce, underscoring Saudi Arabia's emphasis on diversity and gender equality. The market also invests in expanding local brands and designers, such as Hindamme by Mohammed Khoja, which combines Saudi heritage with modern design; haute couture designer Yousef Akbar; and Arwa Al Banawi, known for blending classic and contemporary styles. 'Swimsuit models? This was unheard of in Saudi Arabia' 'This is a revolutionary yet quiet period in Saudi Arabia, driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,' explained Prof. Uzi Rabi, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies. 'The openness in fashion takes the country a step further as it touches on women’s rights. Swimsuit models? This was unheard of in Saudi Arabia.' 'But it’s part of Saudi Vision 2030 that the kingdom aims to promote. In the last five years, we’ve seen women driving alone, holding photo IDs and participating in short film competitions — developments that all point to one message: Saudi Arabia wants the world at its doorstep,' he added. Vision 2030, launched by bin Salman in 2016, is a comprehensive strategic plan to diversify the kingdom’s economy and reduce reliance on oil revenue. The plan includes extensive economic, social and cultural reforms, particularly in tourism. 'Bin Salman questioned what Saudi Arabia would look like in 2030 and began 'Saudizing' the workforce with a focus on women’s empowerment — by Saudi standards,' Rabi noted. 'They’re not discarding the hijab, but they’re advancing things women could only dream of 15–20 years ago. It’s a delicate dance between progress and tradition, all seemingly sanctioned by religious approval. Sometimes, however, that approval comes after the fact.' How does modernization coexist with Islamic sharia law? 'When contemporary Saudi society seeks progress, it consults its past to shape an acceptable future,' Rabi explained. 'This involves adopting new elements that might initially be seen as heretical by radicals but eventually gain religious endorsement. Essentially, they’re bending religious law to facilitate modernization.' Are they subordinating Islamic law to modernization efforts? 'Absolutely,' Rabi said. 'Bin Salman not only uses Islam as a tool for modernization but also leverages it to drive progress. This is part of his controversial persona. Despite his ruthlessness and authoritarian rule, he’s immensely popular among Saudi youth. He’s opening Saudi Arabia to the world, fostering interactions, and gaining recognition. 'This is a sophisticated strategy — not a whim — to make Saudi Arabia more welcoming to tourists and businesspeople. With [Donald] Trump’s election and Jared Kushner’s deep involvement in the Saudi economy, we can expect even bigger developments.' The end of modesty laws is still far off Fashion in Saudi Arabia isn’t just about clothing or women wearing Dolce & Gabbana beneath their black niqabs — it reflects broader social and political shifts. According to Rabi, bin Salman's initiatives aren’t just PR moves aimed at Western liberal audiences; they directly impact citizens’ lives, evident in social media, Saudi theater, freedom of expression, inheritance laws and education reforms — though superficially. By 2034, Saudi Arabia is also set to host the FIFA World Cup, positioning itself as a nation blending innovation with tradition and tourism with business. Modernization’s challenges arise both domestically and internationally. A prime example is the May swimwear show during the Red Sea Fashion Week at the luxury St. Regis Hotel on the Saudi island of Ummahat. Contrary to expectations, models wore one-piece swimsuits and bikinis, marking a historic moment. Fashion designer Yasmina Qanzal, who showcased swimwear at the event, told AFP, 'It's true that this country is very conservative but we tried to show elegant swimsuits which represent the Arab world,' Despite this progress, Saudi women still don’t dress this way, even at the beach. The show sparked a divide: some celebrated it as a recognition of women’s rights and a move toward the kingdom’s aspirations, while others saw it as provocative and offensive to Islamic law, particularly in a devout country that hosts millions of pilgrims annually. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi human rights activist Lina al-Hathloul argued that the May swimwear show was aimed at improving the kingdom’s international image but didn’t necessarily reflect genuine change in civil rights, personal freedoms or attitudes toward women. '3 weeks after Saudi authorities sentenced Manahel to 11 years in prison for her choice of clothing, some of the #WWE’s top female talent were pictured posing in revealing swimsuits on the kingdom’s Red Sea coast.

Troops scanning areas near the Litani and Saluki rivers as implementation of the cease-fire deal progresses at a slow pace; U.S.-led international monitoring commission also begins work although it is still in early stages The Lebanese army began deploying to the south of the country, nearly three weeks after the cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah came into effect. IDF troops were still operating in the areas close to the border and planned to remain there until their scheduled withdrawal four weeks away. The Lebanese military that entered the region and according to the IDF, were launching their own operations to find Hezbollah weapons including rockets and launchers near the Litani and Saluki rivers. The U.S.-led international commission assembled to monitor the situation on the ground has also began its work, but it is in the early stages. 'UNIFIL is also still here and we are exercising our right to attack against any violation of the cease-fire,' the military said. The IDF did not operate in most of Hezbollah's villages in South Lebanon, despite eliminating much of its leadership and destroying more than two-thirds of its fire power and its anti-aircraft systems. Hezbollah's ability to rearm has also been disrupted after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria.

Cabinet convenes to discussions West Bank, hostage deal	Jerusalem is concerned terror activity would spread into Israeli territory following a step up of operations by Palestinian security forces in the West Bank over the past week The Security Cabinet is set to convey on Sunday at the IDF Central Command to discuss the recent surge in terror incidents in the West Bank, and the potential hostage deal to release 100 hostages who have been held in Gaza by Hamas for 436 days. According to reports, the deal is expected to proceed in stages, beginning under the Biden administration and continuing under a potential future Trump administration. The initial phase would be humanitarian, involving the release of hostages in exchange for a seven-week ceasefire. A senior source noted that the talks currently focus on a humanitarian exchange of an unspecified number of hostages, including women, children, and elderly individuals, with both sides reserving the option to resume hostilities afterward. Over the past week, Palestinian security forces have intensified operations against terror groups in refugee camps across the West Bank. On Saturday, exchanges of gunfire erupted in Tulkarm between armed groups and Palestinian forces. Meanwhile, both Tulkarm and Jenin saw protests supporting terror organizations, accompanied by tire burnings and demonstrations against the Palestinian Authority's security actions. Israeli officials fear the growing unrest could destabilize the Palestinian Authority. The security establishment is closely monitoring the impact of these security measures on the ground. However, cabinet member Bezalel Smotrich has taken steps to counter efforts to maintain PA stability. Smotrich has repeatedly imposed sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials, withheld clearance funds, and threatened to cease financial and legal protections for Israeli banks facilitating transactions with Palestinian institutions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although his latest move was blocked under U.S. pressure, Smotrich continues to advance settlement expansion policies. Notably, this month, he enforced building violations in Area B, a first in the Etzion Bloc's designated reserve under the Oslo Accords. Meanwhile, Adam Boehler, a former adviser to then-President Donald Trump on prisoner and hostage issues, is expected to visit Israel this week. While sources described the visit as private, Ynet has learned that Boehler will hold consultations on a potential hostage deal in Gaza. The Defense Ministry has also received a request to coordinate a meeting with him, possibly as early as Monday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyvp4unvkx	2024-12-15T07:48:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/BklASqSqGJe/BklASqSqGJe_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Turkey quick to establish facts on the ground in Syria, offers mi...	Ankara reopens Damascus embassy 15 years after it closed during civil war atrocities; Turkish defense minister says no signs of ISIS resurgence, wants U.S. troops out and their Kurdish coalition partners eliminated Turkish Defense Miniter Yasar Guler said on Sunday that his country stands ready to provide military training to the new Syria security forces, if asked – in what could be considered another sign of Ankara's ambition to become the new Damascus patron, under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkey which borders Syria from the north has for the past 13 years of the Syrian civil war, backed the rebels fighting the Assad regime. But, in the past two years when it appeared that the Syrian leadership had the upper hand in the war, Turkey attempted to improve its relations with Damascus. Last month it seemed Turkey was behind the rebel offensive that ultimately brought the regime down. The possibility that the Jihadists of Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) would now repay the Turkish leader is cause for concern not only to the Kurds in northern Syria, Turkey's long-time enemies, but also Israel - which Erdogan has grown more belligerent toward since the Oct. 7 massacre. Signs that Turkey was quick to establish facts on the ground were apparent last week. On Thursday, The Turkish intelligence chief was the first foreign senior official to visit Damascus since the rebels took control of the country where he met with rebel leaders. On Saturday, Turkey reopened its embassy in Syria, nearly 15 years after it was closed in response to Assad's massacre of his opponents. 'In their first statement, the new administration that toppled Assad announced that it would respect all government institutions, the United Nations and other international organizations,' Guler told reporters in Ankara in comments authorized for publication on Sunday. 'We think that we need to see what the new administration will do and to give them a chance.' ' When asked whether Turkey was considering military cooperation with the new Syrian government, Guler said Ankara already had military cooperation and training agreements with many countries. '(Turkey) is ready to provide the necessary support if the new administration requests it,' he added. Turkey has a few hundred troops in northern Syria and had carried out four military operations there since 2016, against 'threats to Turkish security,' as Guler called it. He said his government may reevaluate Turkish military presence in Syria with the new leadership 'when conditions are ripe.' In his briefing to reporters the defense minister said Turkey's primary goal was and is to abolish the Kurdish YPG, which it claims is part of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization in Turkey and the U.S. YPG is one of the leading forces in the 'Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that now controls some of Syria's biggest oil fields. It is also a senior partner in the U.S. led coalition against ISIS, so its future would be a point of contention between Ankara and Washington. Guler said the PKK and the YPG in Syria would be eliminated, sooner or later and its members whom he claimed came from outside Syria would have to leave and those who are Syrians would be made to lay down their arms. The defense minister also claimed that despite warnings from the U.S., Turkey had not identified any resurgence of ISIS. Turkey has in the past told the U.S. that Ankara could deploy three commando brigades in Syria to fight Islamic State, and to run al-Hol, the detention camp for IS families, Guler said, adding that Washington had rejected both offers. 'Instead, they cooperated with the PKK/YPG terrorist organization under the banner of fighting DAESH. But you can't fight one terrorist organization with another terrorist organization.' Asked about the future involvement in Syria of Russia, a longstanding ally of Assad which last weekend granted him asylum, Guler said he saw no sign of a complete Russian withdrawal.

'I don't think the Russians are going to leave (Syria). They'll do everything they can to stay,' he said. On Sunday, a week after the fall of the Assad regime, most schools reopened. Foreign journalists who were at a Damascus boys high school said the students appeared happy and cheered when the principle raised the Free Syria flag In one classroom, a student pasted the new flag on a wall.

'This is a deeply regrettable decision from the Netanyahu government. I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-International law,' he said in a post on X. 'Ireland wants a two state solution and for Israel and Palestine to live in peace and security.

Coalition leaders debate controversial judicial reform and attorn...	Lawmakers deliberate dismissal of Baharav-Miara and revival of judicial reforms, facing resistance from Haredi leaders; FM Sa’ar urges caution, while Justice Minister Levin slams Supreme Court for rejecting compromise efforts Coalition leaders met Sunday to discuss a contentious bill to overhaul the judicial appointments committee and a proposal to dismiss Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, a polarizing figure among government officials. The push to revive the divisive legislation is spearheaded by Justice Minister Yariv Levin as part of long-standing tensions between the government and the Supreme Court, with critics from both sides accusing each other of eroding Israel's democracy. The meeting, which ended without decisions, saw hardline National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir raising the issue of Baharav-Miara's dismissal. Ultra-Orthodox parties, however, made clear they would not support any initiatives, including judicial reforms, until a draft exemption law for yeshiva students is passed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is barred from direct involvement in judicial matters due to a conflict of interest stemming from his ongoing corruption trial, emphasized coalition stability, saying, 'We must pass the budget and project stability, even if disagreements remain.' Ben-Gvir argued for initiating the process to dismiss Baharav-Miara, claiming she obstructs government operations. Levin outlined the formal steps required, including presenting the issue to the Cabinet, involving a special review committee, and returning the matter to the Cabinet for a final decision. Coalition leaders expressed no overt opposition to the proposal, though progress remains uncertain. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Baharav-Miara has faced criticism for opposing government decisions and refusing to defend controversial policies in court. Critics accuse her of aligning with judicial overreach, while supporters see her as a vital check on executive power. Levin also addressed his escalating confrontation with the Supreme Court, which recently blocked his refusal to convene the judicial appointments committee. 'They rejected every compromise we proposed,' Levin said, describing the court’s orders as 'outrageous.' Coalition whip MK Ofir Katz added, 'The judges threw every compromise out the window—it seems they want to crush us.' Some coalition leaders, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Shas Party head Aryeh Deri, expressed reservations about reintroducing the 2023 judicial reform proposal, warning it could deepen public tensions. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, while supporting measured reforms, cautioned against further polarization and urged responsibility given Israel’s significant security and diplomatic challenges. The push to dismiss Baharav-Miara requires complex steps, including reconstituting the Grunis Committee, gathering complaints from ministers about her performance and holding hearings. These actions, if pursued, would likely face scrutiny from the Supreme Court, adding another layer of tension. Senior coalition figures suggested Levin would proceed with Baharav-Miara’s dismissal only if there is a majority consensus among coalition leaders. Levin has hesitated to act unilaterally, fearing accusations of implementing a 'judicial overhaul on steroids.' Instead, Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi has been circulating a public petition to gauge support for the move. Meanwhile, Religious Zionist Party Minister Orit Strock, a member of the judicial appointments committee, proposed direct negotiations between Levin and Supreme Court Deputy Chief Justice Yitzhak Amit to resolve the standoff. In a letter to committee members, Strock emphasized the importance of returning to consensus-based decision-making, noting that under previous agreements, the committee had appointed 162 judges in less than a year. 'Recent Supreme Court rulings have derailed the committee from its cooperative path to one of confrontation,' she wrote. 'We can return to fair compromises on appointments, including for the president and deputy president of the Supreme Court, new justices and other key positions.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjm4asnn1e	2024-12-15T04:33:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/04/S1OBF87Ah/S1OBF87Ah_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israel closes embassy in Ireland, citing hostility; opens new emb...	Sa’ar announces unprecedented move, citing Dublin's 'extreme anti-Israel policies'; 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its treatment of Israel,' he says as Israel pivots toward friendly countries In an unprecedented move, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar announced on Sunday the closure of Israel’s embassy in Dublin, citing Ireland’s 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' The decision follows escalating tensions, including Ireland’s recent decision to join South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing the state of genocide. 'Ireland’s actions and rhetoric are rooted in delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, accompanied by blatant double standards,' Sa’ar said. 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its treatment of Israel. We will redirect our resources toward strengthening ties with nations that respect Israel.' Tensions between Israel and Ireland have been simmering for years. In May 2024, Ireland unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state, prompting Israel to recall its ambassador to Dublin, Dana Erlich, for consultations. Calls for Erlich’s expulsion in Ireland intensified after Hamas’ October 7 massacre, and last week, Dublin formally joined the ICJ case against Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Erlich, a highly regarded diplomat, has continued to manage Israel-Ireland relations from abroad, first from London and later from the ambassador’s residence in Madrid. According to Foreign Ministry sources, this arrangement was necessary after the Finance Ministry refused to fund returned ambassadors’ salaries. Despite the challenging circumstances, Erlich has been praised for her steadfast defense of Israel in one of Europe’s most hostile environments. The diplomatic rift deepened further in October when Irish UNIFIL troops in Lebanon refused Israel’s demand to relocate five kilometers northward. Ireland’s President Michael Higgins strongly criticized the Israeli request, calling it 'outrageous,' escalating a war of words between Dublin and Jerusalem. While announcing the Dublin embassy closure, Sa’ar revealed plans to open a new embassy in Moldova. 'The relationship between Israel and Moldova is friendly, and both nations seek to deepen ties. Moldova already has an embassy in Israel, and it is time for Israel to reciprocate,' Sa’ar said. He emphasized that Israel’s diplomatic network would be adjusted to prioritize nations willing to strengthen ties with the Jewish state. The move reflects a broader policy shift in Israel’s foreign strategy, focusing resources on countries with a more cooperative stance toward Jerusalem while reducing engagement with adversarial nations. Ireland’s relationship with Israel has long been fraught. In September, President Higgins accused Israel’s Dublin embassy of leaking his congratulatory message to Iran’s president, a claim dismissed by Israeli officials who pointed out that Iran’s embassy had publicly posted the message on social media. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkflmlh4yx	2024-12-15T04:12:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/29/ryVuP3ozp/ryVuP3ozp_77_76_1045_589_0_small.jpg

Nova festival massacre survivors welcome firsborn	Maia and Oshri Bouganim escaped Hamas attack and married just days later; after a little over a year, they are celebrating the birth of their first son; ‘The baby we've been blessed with is nothing less than a great miracle’ A little over a year after surviving the Nova music festival massacre, Maia and Oshri Bouganim welcomed their first child, Ariel, into the world. 'Holding Ariel in my arms is nothing short of a miracle for me. I never imagined we'd reach this joyful moment from where we were a year ago,' said Maia Bouganim, 27, from Afula, who works at a local law firm. 'Just a year ago, we were fighting for our lives, surviving the worst massacre in Israel's history. Today we've had the privilege of holding a brit milah (circumcision) ceremony for our firstborn,' added Oshri Bouganim, 28. Maia and Oshri met in Afula six years ago. The day before October 7, they excitedly arrived at the Nova music festival, scheduled just five days before their wedding date. 'The event turned into the greatest tragedy in the history of our country,' Oshri recounted. 'We fled the festival site at 7 a.m. and ran for over six hours until we found shelter in Moshav Patish. We didn’t separate for a moment when we fled because we felt we couldn't split up. I believe this was a testament to the strong bond we share,' he added. Despite the disaster, the couple kept their original wedding date, marrying in a small ceremony with their family at a synagogue in Afula only five days after the tragic attack.

1.6 million views on YouTube: Iranian singer arrested after perfo...	Parastoo Ahmadi, 27, defies Iran’s ban on women singing solo before men in viral live performance, sparking global headlines; security forces raid her home, arresting her and two band members for challenging Iran’s modesty laws Iranian authorities arrested singer Parastoo Ahmadi over the weekend after she made international headlines for performing in an online YouTube concert with her hair uncovered—violating the Islamic Republic’s modesty laws, which require women to cover their heads. The 27-year-old singer’s bare-headed performance, intentionally staged to defy the regime’s laws, has garnered over 1.6 million views on YouTube. Milad Panahipour, Ahmadi’s lawyer, confirmed that she was arrested on Saturday in Sari, the capital of Mazandaran province in northern Iran. Her arrest followed the Iranian prosecution’s decision to launch an investigation against her on Thursday. 'Unfortunately, we do not know the charges brought against Ms. Ahmadi, who arrested her, or where she is being held, but we will pursue the matter through legal channels,' Panahipour said. Opposition news site Iran International reported Sunday that Ahmadi was released that morning, but no official confirmation has been made. The uproar surrounding Ahmadi began on Wednesday when she livestreamed a YouTube performance wearing a long black dress with her arms and neck exposed, and no hijab. She was accompanied by four male musicians. In a post sharing the concert link the day before, Ahmadi wrote: 'I am Parastoo, a girl who wants to sing for the people she loves. This is a privilege I cannot ignore—to sing for the country I love so much.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following the performance, security forces raided Ahmadi’s home, and she was summoned to the prosecutor’s office for questioning. Iranian authorities announced plans to put her on trial. Two members of her band, Soheil Faghih Nasiri and Ehsan Beiraghdar, were also arrested on Saturday in Tehran. Ahmadi's appearance on YouTube: Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, restrictions on female performers have been a point of contention in Iran. Initially, women were completely banned from singing, though the restrictions were later loosened to allow performances in certain conditions. Currently, women may only sing as part of a choir in mixed-gender audiences or perform solo in front of all-female audiences. Performing without a hijab in front of unrelated men is strictly prohibited under Iran’s Sharia-based laws. Ahmadi’s arrest comes two years after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who died in custody after being arrested by Tehran’s morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Amini’s death sparked nationwide protests against the regime’s dress code and broader restrictions, with the slogan 'Women, Life, Freedom' becoming a rallying cry. Ahmadi previously performed a song titled From the Blood of the Youth of Your Country in support of the movement. Although Iranian authorities initially eased the enforcement of hijab laws following the protests, the past few months have seen a renewed crackdown. Ahmadi’s defiance has drawn praise on social media, with many users hailing her as a symbol of resistance. Political activist Hossein Ronaghi posted on X (formerly Twitter): 'Our message is clear—we will stand up to any form of hostility against women and oppression of the people. Parastoo Ahmadi and the musicians are the voice of the nation and must be freed.' In contrast, a regime-affiliated Iranian newspaper labeled the performance as a 'cultural provocation and an incitement of public opinion.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syjwd7n4je	2024-12-15T03:11:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/rJeUp8fh4Jl/rJeUp8fh4Jl_1_0_781_440_0_small.jpg

Their loved ones are free, but the fight for hostages continues	Even after their loved ones returned to Israel, many relatives of hostages remain steadfast in their efforts to secure release of those left behind; ‘It’s not over for anyone’ The late Yagev Buchshtab, brother of Nofar Buchshtab, was kidnapped on October 7 from his home in Kibbutz Nirim with his wife, Rimon. Rimon returned in the hostage deal, while Yagev survived in captivity for many months until he was murdered. 'I think that something about how it ended for us brings with it, beyond pain, loss and bereavement, also a sense of missing out,' says Nofar. 'We could have brought him home and we failed as a family and as a country. So I continue the fight because I don't want to see more families in my situation, more hostages ending their lives like Yagev and others.' Nofar Buchshtab, 30, is one of many family members of hostages who continue the struggle, even though their loved ones have returned home or were murdered in captivity. 'We went into this struggle with 251 families, and this is how we will end it,' she says. 'When Yagev was alive we thought about what would happen if others returned before him. I knew I would want them to continue the struggle with me, and I had no doubt that I would too.' 'Fighting for values' Some 251 Israelis were kidnapped on October 7. One hundred are still in captivity and 151 returned in deals and military rescues, some alive and some deceased. And yet, even the family members whose loved ones returned to Israel for burial are not taking their feet off the gas. 'I fought shoulder to shoulder with the families of the hostages,' explains Chen Avigdori, 54, who was able to hug his wife and daughter after they were returned in the deal. 'I can't look them in the eye and say, 'Mine was released, thank you very much.' I call everyone in the families of the hostages my brothers and sister.' 'Obviously, I have a kind of feeling of guilt, but I also know that the way my story ends gives hope. Beyond that, in my opinion, this is the most important public struggle in the history of the country. We are fighting for the values ​​that we were raised on,' he adds. 'There was no hesitation in continuing to fight,' says Inbar Goldstein, 36, who fought for 51 days for her sister-in-law Chen Almog Goldstein and her niece and nephews, Gal, Tal and Agam. Inbar's brother, Nadav, was murdered with his oldest daughter, Yam. Even today, Inbar continues to fight for the other hostages who are still in captivity. 'It's not over for anyone. There's something unfair about it. What, will I leave them alone? My family is most important to me, but politically it's no more important than anyone else. In the end, we're all one family,' she says. But there are a few that are especially important to her. 'I only got to know the Angerst family, the family of Matan, who is in captivity, after my own family returned. Before that, I wasn't focused on getting to know people around me. There was some mistake in the information that they received and they contacted me to find out something and it went deep into my heart. There's something noble, quiet, determined and sharp about them. They are people with kind eyes and I simply love them. It's a shared destiny that a stranger wouldn't understand,' she explains. There is no jealousy, there is a smile Nofar Buchshtab is among a group of young advocates from hostage families, including Mor Korngold, the brother of Tal Shoham. Like Nofar until recently, Korngold is a younger sibling now fighting tirelessly for the release of his older brother. 'I would very much like to be in Mor's place,' says Nofar sadly, 'but mostly I want their story to be better. I imagine the moment when Tal returns and I don't feel jealous, I smile. Sometimes I say to myself, wait, maybe I don't belong anymore? Maybe I have nothing to do with this action, or this meeting, but the voices from the families are the opposite: 'We need you to continue with us, you have a place with us.' It's scary to be left alone.' 'There's a lot of talk in the war about survivor's guilt,' says Inbar Goldstein. 'When we were just starting out, and they were still in Gaza, a lot of people felt survivor's guilt. Then my family came back, and I discovered what survivor's guilt is, the guilt of those who returned, of returning alive. That's also one of the reasons why no one leaves this struggle even after their story is over.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The reports of a possible deal are also affecting them. 'We are once again in the yes/no hostage release deal talk that is driving the mind crazy,' Goldstein continues, 'and it is clear to us that here too the struggle will not end. Earlier this week I met Yifat, the mother of the late Inbar Heyman. I promised her that no one is giving up on Inbar, that I will not give up. Giving up on them is giving up on us, and I am not willing to give up. Even families like mine, whose story is 'closed', who could have said a year ago: 'Thank you very much, goodbye'; we are not going anywhere.' 'The struggle now and before is no different, the goal is the same goal,' concludes Chen Avigdori. 'The messages are the same messages, and I may no longer be anxious for my loved ones, but I am anxious for Liri and Tal Shoham and Omer Wenkert and Omer Shem Tov as I am anxious for my child. This is the struggle and I will continue to be a part of it until the last captive.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bk9xez2vkg	2024-12-15T02:41:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/B1y3HBi4Jx/B1y3HBi4Jx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

'We think that we need to see what the new administration will do and to give them a chance.' When asked whether Turkey was considering military cooperation with the new Syrian government, Guler said Ankara already had military cooperation and training agreements with many countries.

Manpower crunch forces IDF to rely on civilians in enemy territor...	Facing soldier shortages, worn-out bulldozers and delayed US delivery of D9s, military employs civilians for high-risk missions: leveling buildings in Gaza, building embankments in Syria and clearing thickets in Lebanon; Here's how the system works 'Combat engineering, combat engineering and more combat engineering of all kinds. If we could double the Combat Engineering Corps, not just Yahalom, we’d have done it by now,' a senior IDF officer told Ynet, highlighting the growing demand for engineering capabilities amid prolonged fighting across multiple arenas. To address these challenges, the IDF plans to establish an additional regular combat engineering battalion in the coming months, adding to the existing three. However, this move is only a partial solution. Ynet has learned that, in recent months, the IDF has increasingly relied on civilian contractors for operational missions in combat zones, under the command of IDF officers. Initially limited in scope, this practice has grown significantly. Civilian contractors, using large orange bulldozers, have been deployed to level hundreds of buildings in the Netzarim Corridor in northern Gaza, drill for Hamas tunnels in areas like the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza and clear space for safer IDF operations. The Philadelphi Corridor itself has been expanded to a width of 3-4 kilometers, providing a buffer for IDF forces. This trend has extended beyond Gaza. In Lebanon, contractors have crossed the border to clear vast thickets where Hezbollah has hidden military infrastructure, including observation posts, underground firing ranges and bunkers. Since the collapse of the Assad regime, contractors in bright yellow vests have also been active along the Syrian border, working on five major sites. Their tasks include blasting basalt cliffs, digging deep trenches and building embankments to secure the border with a disintegrating Syria teeming with armed militias While the IDF has historically employed civilian contractors for border fortifications during peacetime, their current use in active combat zones and beyond Israeli territory marks a significant shift, reflecting the demands of ongoing multi-front operations. The urgent needs of the IDF 'Hundreds of IDF bulldozers and tractors were worn out during the operation in the Gaza Strip, including D9 bulldozers, so the need arose to lease or mobilize equipment from civilians. Later, we realized that we would also need operators and contractors due to the enormous number of engineering missions, and not just in the Gaza arena,' according to the IDF. 'The use of civilian contractors creates flexibility: The heavy mechanical equipment companies in the engineering battalions operate in the most advanced and dangerous missions on the attack lines, for example now in Jabaliya or alongside tanks on the most advanced lines of the operation in the Syrian Golan, and behind them, in 'safer' missions, the contractors are deployed after we take operational control of the area. Hundreds of our engineering soldiers were injured and killed throughout the long fighting, this is not an infinite resource. That is why we turned to civilian contractors through regular procedures carried out by the Defense Ministry.' 'We are briefed by the officers before each work day and are warned about how to behave in the event of an operational incident. It is clear that this is dangerous work' Compounding the IDF's shortage of engineering personnel is the delay of a shipment of 132 D9 bulldozers ordered from the U.S. months ago. The delivery has been stalled due to a silent embargo by the U.S. State Department, as reported by Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth last month. 'Workday' in the Gaza Strip This is how the method works: The IDF defines a specific, time-bound task, for example, the demolition of 20 buildings in a Gaza neighborhood in which the forces have finished fighting; a request is issued for a civilian contractor who shows up with his workers and large equipment to operate in daylight, under the protection of soldiers and the supervision of IDF engineering units. In the evening, the civilian workers leave the area, and return the next day to continue the work. 'We are looking for operators of excavators and bulldozers and we don't stop on Saturdays, and it's usually for two months, five days a week, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sometimes we also destroy terrorist infrastructure for the army that they take out, such as lathes, factories, etc.,' one of the labor managers described to Ynet, noting several types of payment. 'A private individual who has an excavator and brings it with him receives the highest payment, it's the best money; an operator under a company is paid hourly, also respectably, well above minimum wage; and someone who served in the IDF and wants to do so as a reservist enjoys all the grants and benefits for reserve personnel.' 'It's obviously a dangerous job' Some civilian engineering missions in Gaza have reached the front lines, with battalion commanders deploying teams to demolish buildings used to fire on IDF forces. In several recent cases, contractors were spotted working without protective gear such as helmets, overalls or uniforms. One of them described that 'even if they ask us to protect ourselves, it is not comfortable to drill or dig under the sun for hours with a helmet on. We are briefed by the officers before each workday and are warned about how to behave in the event of an operational incident. It is clear that this is dangerous work.'

Addressing the growing use of civilian contractors in combat zones, the IDF said: 'The contractors understand the risks and sign off on them.

Significant progress in hostage talks; majority in government su...	Senior official says agreement will not include release of all hostages, leaving room for both sides to return to fighting; while majority of Cabinet backs deal, concerns linger Hamas could still derail it There is 'significant progress' in talks on a hostage deal that would bring many of them home from Gaza, the main points of which are currently being kept under the radar in order to prevent political interference that would thwart it, a senior Israeli official told Ynet Saturday night. 'The head of the Mossad and the head of the Shin Bet reported to the cabinet that Hamas is showing a willingness to reach a deal that has not existed before,' the senior Israeli official explained, 'and the assessment is that an agreement can be reached within a few weeks.' This runs contrary to Arab reports of major difficulties in the negotiations. The senior official claimed that what caused the change in the terrorist organization's position was 'the blows they suffered' and the fact that Donald Trump will enter the White House in about a month. In the past, such events - and identical interpretations attached to them by political and security elements in Israel - have come to nothing. The deal is reportedly expected to be implemented in phases, starting with the Biden administration and continuing into the Trump administration. The first phase will be humanitarian and will include the release of hostages in exchange for a seven-week cease-fire. The official explained that the parties currently are talking about a humanitarian deal for 'an unknown number of kidnapped women, children and adults, in which each side reserves the option to return to fighting.' On Saturday, several of the families of hostages being held in Gaza protested this, claiming that such a 'partial deal' would mean a death sentence for those who would be left behind. Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, even claimed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lied to her in their conversation last week, and that after speaking with members of the negotiation team, she realized that 'he has no intention of returning Matan, but only a few hostages.' Such a deal could pave the way for both a deal that would end the war and a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. However, at this stage, it is not yet clear whether Hamas will agree to a limited deal without ending the war, and there are several conflicting reports about it. On the one hand, there are reports of Hamas' flexibility and readiness for a limited IDF presence in Gaza, and on the other hand, there are reports that Israel has agreed to a temporary withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor, but these have not been confirmed. In Israel, they estimated last week that a deal could be reached within two weeks. According to the senior official: 'If Netanyahu brings a reasonable deal, he will have a majority in the government and the cabinet, even if (Public Security Minister Itamar) Ben-Gvir and (Finance Minister Bezalel) Smotrich oppose it and it is doubtful that they will support it. The right has many achievements, and this will make it possible to pass a deal. The problem is that this is Hamas, and we were at a similar point in the past, and in the end they torpedoed it then. That's why it's not over until it's over.' Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's adviser on hostages and missing persons, Adam Boehler, 45, is expected to visit Israel this week. A source familiar with the details of the visit said that it was a private visit by Boehler, who is Jewish, to Israel, but Ynet learned that he will also hold meetings and consultations regarding the hostage deal in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, the Defense Minister's office has received a request to coordinate a meeting with Boehler, which will likely take place as early as Monday. Opportunities in Lebanon and Syria The Israeli official also referred to Israel's take over of the buffer zone on the Syrian border, explaining that Israel 'will remain in the areas it has captured until the rebels stabilize the country.' He said that 'it does not appear that the rebels have any interest in entering into a conflict with Israel, but in the coming weeks and months we will see how they stabilize Syria. This is something big that holds a positive opportunity.' On Saturday, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, addressed Israel for the first time, saying that they were not seeking conflict - and also claimed that Israel no longer had a reason to interfere in what was happening in Syria. Shortly afterward, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said that the IDF had no intention of intervening in Syria except to protect the border from extremist rebels. In the meantime, Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem admitted that his organization had 'lost its supply route from Syria,' and at the same time called on the rebels 'to see Israel as an enemy and not to normalize relations with it.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In this context, the Israeli official also referred to Lebanon, saying that 'the cease-fire is holding, and Hezbollah is left without a supply of weapons. Here too, there is an opportunity for Lebanon to regain control of the country.' Qassem also noted in his speech that one of Hezbollah's goals is to 'strengthen the Lebanese army,' but this is a smokescreen: in reality, the West sees the local army as an alternative to the military power of the terrorist organization, which has grown in recent years to enormous proportions that terrorized the towns and cities of the north for most of the months of the war. Now, the intention is to work to push Hezbollah further away from the Litani River, as far as possible from the border with Israel, so that the only armed forces in the border area will be the Lebanese security forces. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk4evehvjl	2024-12-14T22:42:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/rJVm90OQyx/rJVm90OQyx_0_107_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF officers hold first talks with Syrian leaders in Golan	As Syrian Golan Druze call for annexation to Israel, IDF officers meet openly with Syrian village elders, assuring them their daily lives would continue undisturbed; officer says asked village leader to collect weapons taken from abandoned Syrian outposts In recent days, Israeli military officers have held their first meetings with leaders of Syrian villages captured in the Golan Heights following the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime last week. The officers met openly with village elders in their homes to reassure them that no harm would come to residents and that their daily lives would continue undisturbed. Capt. Omer, a company commander from the 77th Battalion of the 7th Armored Brigade, reached the deepest point of the IDF’s advance in Syria so far, the village of Umm Batnah, located approximately 12 kilometers (8 miles) from the border. 'I asked the village elder to collect weapons from residents after they had taken rifles from abandoned Syrian military outposts,' the officer said. According to the IDF, the residents have complied, and no unusual incidents have been reported. The IDF is currently operating in seven villages in the Syrian Golan, some beyond Quneitra. Over the weekend, troops reportedly reached abandoned Assad regime military outposts near the town of Khan Arnabah. The IDF intends to remain in the area until the territory can be handed over to an 'established and defined state entity' to prevent terrorist groups from seizing control. In videos circulated online over the weekend, Druze residents in the village of Hader, near the Israeli border in southern Syria, were heard calling on Israel to annex them. 'What is our fate?' one speaker asked, prompting the crowd to respond, 'Israel.' The speaker continued, 'On behalf of everyone in Hader, if we must choose, we choose the lesser evil. We want to be annexed to the Israeli Golan to preserve our dignity. This applies to all villages in the area because the fate of Hader is the fate of the entire region. We ask to join our people in the Golan and live in freedom and dignity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ahmad al-Sharaa, the Syrian rebel leader formerly known by his call sign Abu Mohammed al-Golani, addressed Israel for the first time on Saturday, rejecting the country's involvement in Syria. Speaking in a televised statement in the wake of Israel’s series of strikes on Syrian territory and its occupation of the buffer zone near the Golan Heights, Sharaa said, 'Syria needs laws and state institutions. We have a plan to address all the crises, and we are gathering information. We are not entering into conflict with Israel.' Sharaa claimed Israel has no justification for involvement in Syria following the departure of Iranian forces. 'What happened is a victory over the Iranian plan, which threatened the entire region,' he said. Sharaa also suggested his faction could have targeted Russian bases in Syria but opted instead to 'build good relations.' Despite his criticism of the Iranian regime, Sharaa emphasized, 'We have entered our cities—not Tehran. We have no issue with the Iranian people.' Shortly later, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi dismissed Sharaa’s claims that Israel has no justification for its involvement in Syria, saying that the IDF's actions along the border are solely to ensure Israel's security. Halevi, speaking during a situational assessment on the Golan Heights with senior military officials, said, 'We are not interfering in what is happening inside Syria, nor do we intend to govern it. However, we are unequivocally involved in ensuring the security of Israeli citizens living in communities behind us in the Golan Heights. This is something we are handling with professionalism, determination and precision. 'Syria was once an enemy state; its army has collapsed, and there is a real threat that terrorist elements will try to establish themselves near our border. We have acted decisively to prevent extremist groups from settling right next to us.' Halevi also praised the IDF’s preparations along the border, which stretch from Mount Hermon to the Israel-Syria-Jordan tri-border area. 'The readiness here is solid and effective,' he said, urging commanders to continue adapting to emerging threats. 'Make the necessary changes—you have all the IDF resources and an excellent force at your disposal.' Meanwhile, Syria’s interim government called on the UN Security Council to take action to compel Israel to immediately stop its attacks on Syrian territory and withdraw from areas it has penetrated in the north 'in violation of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tynx24yl	2024-12-14T22:13:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/yk14186610/yk14186610_0_111_817_460_0_small.jpg

Iran is at the 'most precarious moment in its modern history'	Islamic Republic has gone from being able to produce two new ballistic missiles a day to one a week, but may rush to produce nuclear weapons to fill the gap, senior Washington Post columnist reports; Looming confrontation between Israel and Iran is 'most urgent and dangerous' 'Iran appears to be at the most precarious moment in its modern history,' Washington Post senior columnist David Ignatius wrote late Saturday. In his latest column, in which he interviewed, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is currently in the United States, Ignatius exposed the Israeli moves that damaged Tehran's strategic assets, which, along with the collapse of the Assad regime, has brought it to unprecedented weakness. According to Ignatius, Iran's 'proxy armies have been crushed in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. And it appears to be nearly naked to attack after a wave of pinpoint Israeli airstrikes on its air defense system in October.' Gallant told Ignatius that 'we showed that Iran is vulnerable,' and that the Israeli strikes on October 26 created 'a window to act against Iran' before it produces a nuclear weapon. Ignatius wrote that U.S. decisions on how to exploit Iran's weakness - whether in negotiations for a nuclear agreement or in decisive military action - will be made by the next president, Donald Trump. He, for his part, told Time magazine that 'anything can happen.' According to Ignatius, senior Biden administration officials are now seeing an opportunity for 'coercive diplomacy' on the nuclear issue, with a weakened Iran. He noted that while Israel 'played the decisive role in humbling Iran,' President Joe Biden has provided an important deterrent to it by deploying aircraft carriers, submarines and other U.S. military forces throughout the Middle East. The aim of the attack on October 26 was to leave Iran defenseless against a future attack on its territory; Some 120 fighter jets participated in the raid, Ignatius reported, citing an Israeli military source, striking air defense radars and antiaircraft batteries that protect Tehran, as well as important factories for producing fuel for Iranian ballistic missiles. Although the attack was carried out in retaliation for the Iranian attack on October 1 , the planning began many months before that, Ignatius wrote. Gallant told Ignatius that the mission, in simple terms, was to ensure that after the attacks 'Iran is weaker and Israel is stronger,' so that Tehran will not be able to respond with force to future attacks. According to Ignatius, Israeli sources believe that in the next two years Iran will not be able to add a significant number of ballistic missiles to its arsenal, which remains large, and in the meantime its air defense has also been significantly damaged. 'Israel appears to have created a corridor into Iran, providing a clear path for its aircraft to strike Tehran,' he wrote. 'This is a new level of operational freedom, allowing Israel to attack targets in Iran nearly as easily as it did in Gaza and Lebanon.' The former defense minister also referred to Israel's first attack on Iran, on April 15 , when the war cabinet chose to respond in a limited manner with a targeted strike on a Russian-made S-300 battery near Isfahan, in order to send a message that would deter Tehran. 'We hit them precisely, but it wasn't enough to deter them,' Gallant said. In the October attack, Israeli planes had already hit four such batteries around Tehran, even though their radars are supposed - in theory - to detect attacks from a distance of about 300 kilometers. Gallant emphasized that currently 'there is no strategic defense around Tehran.' Along with this, key components of Iran's ballistic missile production capabilities were also reportedly damaged. The fighter jets hit all the mixers that produce solid fuel for these missiles, and the acquisition of new facilities 'may take at least a year' - according to the Institute for the Study of War. Thus, the IDF strikes have halted, at least temporarily, the progress of Iran's ballistic missile program. An Israeli military source estimated to Ignatius that, before the October attack, Iran was able to produce enough solid fuel for two new ballistic missiles a day, and now its output is limited to one missile a week. This shortage, he said, will last for at least a year. But Ignatius notes that, paradoxically, Iran's vulnerability could drive it to acquire a nuclear arsenal to deter its adversaries. Iran has enough fuel for a bomb, but estimates suggest it is many months away from being able to build a warhead that could be mounted on a long-range ballistic missile. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Now, if 'coercive diplomacy' cannot prevent Iran from moving forward with its nuclear program, Israel and the United States may consider military action. Iran's nuclear facilities are buried deep in the ground, and estimates are that only the U.S. military has conventional weapons large enough to breach these bunkers. However, Gallant emphasized to Ignatius that although he hopes the U.S. and Israel will work together, 'Israel has the means to strike Iranian assets in a precise, forceful and sophisticated manner. If needed, we will not hesitate to act.' Ignatius concluded by calling the 'looming standoff between Israel and Iran' as Trump's 'most urgent and dangerous' challenge. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syy6ukhvye	2024-12-14T21:07:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/26/HkulpRKgJx/HkulpRKgJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Ukraine to set up mechanism to supply food to Syria, Zelensky say...	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he had instructed his government to set up supply mechanisms to deliver together with international organizations and partners food to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of President Bashar Assad. Ukraine has been one of the world's top grain and oilseeds exporters, and has been exporting wheat and corn to Middle Eastern countries, but not to Syria. Syria imported food from Russia during the Assad era, but Russian wheat supplies have been suspended amid the uncertainty and payment delays, Russian and Syrian sources said on Friday. 'We are ready to assist Syria in preventing a food crisis, particularly through the humanitarian program 'Grain from Ukraine,'' Zelensky wrote on X. 'I have instructed the government to establish food supply mechanisms in cooperation with international organizations and partners who can help.' Ukraine's exports were buffeted by Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, which severely reduced shipments via the Black Sea. Ukraine has since broken a de facto sea blockade and revived exports from its southern ports of Odesa.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkjgzg24jg	2024-12-14T21:04:04-08:00

Sister demands release of Israeli-Russian researcher kidnapped in...	Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov has been held by a Shiite militia since March 2023; her US-based sister, leading the fight for her release, shares about her frustration with US tax dollars going to her sisters' kidnappers, the hierarchy vs. Gaza hostages, hopes for Trump and years without sleep The pain of Emma Tsurkov, 36, sharpens at one recurring moment each month: when she receives her paycheck as a research director for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in California. The numbers representing her income and deductions stir an unbearable thought—that her American taxes, deducted from her salary, might indirectly reach the kidnappers in Iraq who are holding her older sister, Elizabeth Tsurkov. 'Each time I see taxes deducted from my paycheck, or when we file our taxes in April, my blood boils,' she tells Ynet in an interview. 'I can’t help but feel that the taxes I pay here are sent to the Iraqi government, which then uses them to pay the salaries of terrorists—terrorists who killed American soldiers and are now holding a Princeton graduate student hostage. And they just get away with it.' Elizabeth, 38, a dual Israeli-Russian citizen, was kidnapped in March 2023 in Baghdad by the Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-linked group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other Western countries. Despite this designation, the militia is part of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a coalition of militias funded and supported by the Iraqi government. Tsurkov, a researcher and Middle East expert, entered Iraq on her own initiative using her Russian passport to conduct academic research as part of her doctoral studies at Princeton University. In November, her captors released a video of her, but no official information about her condition or whereabouts has surfaced since. Officials in contact with the family have confirmed that she is alive and being held in Iraq. However, the kidnappers have never issued any official demands for her release. 'People hear 'Kataib Hezbollah' and envision some insular terrorist group hiding somewhere in the mountains, but that’s not the case at all. They’re actually part of the Iraqi Security Forces. Many members of Kataib Hezbollah are Iraqi government employees. They’re on the payroll, getting money and arms from the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government, in turn, gets hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance every year from the U.S. government. So the taxes I pay living in California—which I pay plenty—are used to pay the salaries of the people holding my sister. And it’s just maddening. We’re suckers. We hand over this money and demand no accountability, which is absurd to me, and it just really frustrates me to no end.' 'I don’t need any fancy meetings—I just need my sister' Last April, this frustration drove Emma to sneak into an event in Washington where Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani was speaking. Facing the cameras, she confronted him: 'You should be ashamed of yourself... your government is funding these terrorists!' Even now, she has no regrets. 'It was a very genuine display of frustration—just pure, unfiltered frustration—knowing that my sister is stuck in some hole in Iraq, being held by terrorists funded with American money and the taxes we all pay. And the fact that the Iraqi prime minister gets to just waltz around D.C., enjoy the tulips, eat macarons, and be treated with a red carpet as if nothing is wrong, as if he’s just a legitimate leader and not the coalition partner of a bunch of terrorist militias—which is exactly what he is, make no mistake about it. 'The Iraqi Prime Minister kept making this lip service, saying, 'Oh yeah, we’re very concerned about the fate of the Princeton student, and we’re determined to do everything we can to find out what happened to her,' which is nonsense. They’ve done nothing. Literally nothing. If the Iraqi prime minister wanted to, she could be home now. And the way I know this is because, in the past, when the same terror organization kidnapped an Iraqi person who was working for an American employer, the Iraqi prime minister picked up the phone, called Kataib Hezbollah, and told them to let him go. Within two weeks, he was home—no ransom or anything. 'The militia holding my sister has a political wing, similar to Hamas, with both a military and a political branch. The political wing of Kataib Hezbollah is part of the Iraqi parliament and actually part of the prime minister’s governing coalition. It’s insane to me that he gets away with pretending he doesn’t know anything or can’t do anything. He’s either blind or incompetent, and neither should inspire us to send another single dollar over there without my sister’s freedom being secured.' Your anger is directed at Iraq and the U.S., but Elizabeth isn’t an American citizen—she’s Israeli and Russian. Why aren’t your demands directed at Jerusalem and Moscow? 'The U.S. government is the party with the strongest ties and ability to influence the kidnappers, and therefore the greatest power to secure my sister's release. This is both because of her ties to the U.S.—she was kidnapped while conducting research funded by Princeton University—and because she is a New Jersey resident. 'The Israeli government doesn’t have a relationship with their government. There are no diplomatic ties between the countries, and this isn’t generally a space where Israel has much influence. However, the U.S. government has the reach—and, I think, the moral obligation—because it is terrorists who are holding my sister hostage. 'Even if she were an American Jew and not Israeli, she’d still be in this situation. Terror groups target Jews—not just Israelis. To them, it doesn’t matter. They see every Jew as a target. I don’t know what’s in their heads, but based on the fact that they kill Jews who aren’t Israeli, I have no reason to believe it would’ve made much difference. So really, this is about America. This is aimed at America. The U.S. is the one that’s responsible and should be accountable. So as far as I'm concerned, anything that doesn't bring my sister home is a distraction.' Although President Joe Biden reportedly raised the issue during his meeting with Iraq’s prime minister at the White House, Tsurkov herself has never spoken with him or been invited to the White House. 'I met with Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf, and I will say that everyone has been kind, showed a lot of empathy, and expressed how sorry they are for what my family and I are going through,' she continues. 'But there just hasn’t been a willingness to actually hold the Iraqi government accountable. What I want to see—while I do appreciate the kindness and empathy—is my sister back at the end of the day.' Is it a trigger for you to sit at home and watch President Biden’s meetings with the families of the American hostages in Gaza? 'That’s not what I’m asking for. Let me put it this way—I don’t need any formalities or gestures. What I need is my sister. If no one wants to meet with me but they bring my sister back, that’s perfectly fine with me. I’m not focused on the process, only the result. However it happens, I don’t care. I just want my sister back. I don’t need any fancy meetings—I just need my sister.' The U.S. State Department responded: 'We are deeply concerned about this case and are closely monitoring it. We strongly condemn the kidnapping. We have urged, and continue to urge, Iraqi officials to locate Elizabeth and secure her release as soon as possible.'

She plans to travel to Capitol Hill early in the year, once key officials in the new administration take office, to 'speak to anyone willing to listen and help move things forward.' The incoming White House press secretary, Caroline Leavitt, said: 'The American people reelected President Trump because they trust him to restore stability and peace to the Middle East. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary steps to achieve exactly that.' Mean people on the Internet Elizabeth and Emma Tsurkov were born in St. Petersburg to Jewish dissidents who had previously been imprisoned in Siberia. When they were four and two years old, respectively, the family immigrated to Israel and settled in Kfar Eldad in the West Bank, where their mother still lives. They have a younger brother and sister who also live in Israel, while their father resides in Brazil. After her military service, Elizabeth earned a bachelor’s degree in international relations and communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a master’s degree in Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University and political science at the University of Chicago. She later began a Ph.D. at Princeton, which brought her to Iraq as part of her research. Her studies focused on the Middle East, particularly Syria, ISIS and the Syrian civil war. She conducted fieldwork in Syria, Jordan, Turkey and other countries in the region. Emma also pursued an academic career in the U.S. After studying law in Israel and clerking for Supreme Court Justice Hanan Melcer, she began a master’s degree at Stanford in 2014, where she continued to a Ph.D. She began working for the Anti-Defamation League in 2022. Recent hostage and prisoner exchange deals—such as those brokered between the U.S. and Russia, and between Israel and Hamas—evoke mixed emotions for the Tsurkov family. 'It’s bittersweet,' Emma explains. 'I’m elated for the families who get to see their loved ones come back. I envy them so, so much—just imagining the excitement on their faces standing on the tarmac makes my heart feel like it could explode. I’m thrilled for them, but it’s also deeply painful because I want so badly to see my sister again. 'But it also gives me hope, because it shows that even in the bitterest rivalries, agreements can happen. The deal with Hamas that brought Israelis and other nationals home gives me hope that these deals are possible. Let’s be clear: this is how hostages come home.' Can you understand the criticism that the circumstances of Elizabeth's abduction are different from those of the hostages in Gaza, and that there may be levels of importance or priority in such a case? 'It’s not my job to tell anyone which hostage is more important. It’s not for me to judge. I’m just saying that my sister is in a very unique position. She’s currently the only hostage being held in a country that is an ally of the United States. It defies reason to me that a government that is such a strong U.S. ally, and gets so much support from the U.S. government, can still allow a graduate student from a U.S. institution to be held hostage there.' Israelis live in a zero-sum game Still, criticism coming from Israel has made it impossible for Emma and her family to ignore this 'hierarchy.' After October 7, she felt a bond of shared suffering with the families of the hostages in Gaza—'like suddenly there were 251 families who joined the terrible version of hell that I was already living in.' But it didn’t take long for the Tsurkov family to sense they weren’t seen as part of the collective—and perhaps even unwelcome in the struggle. This escalated into repeated harassment, threatening messages and phone calls. 'I don’t want to judge how anyone deals with this horrible torment,' Tsurkov says. 'This is truly an unthinkable tragedy for anyone to go through. For some people, everything about this is painful. It’s brutal—the idea that some hostages might come at the expense of others. I personally don’t feel that way, but I also can’t judge people who do. It’s just such a heartache. 'Whenever someone is about to say something mean to a relative of a hostage, they should pause and consider what has brought them to this point. I’m generally not someone who’s particularly sensitive to what the Internet says but this is just torture to see people speculate. One of the most painful things about having a loved one in captivity is the uncertainty and the desperation for any shred of information. And yet, there are a lot of mean people on the Internet who take advantage of it and just torment hostage families. I don’t even know why they do it, but it’s deeply disheartening.' Does this affect your fight? 'You’re not focusing on the criticism—you’re focusing on the reasons to bring her back. I don’t see any good coming out of any type of divide and conquer between hostage families. It doesn’t benefit anyone—the only ones who benefit are the terrorists, and I’m not giving them that satisfaction. The only reason I even finished my PhD is because I was supposed to finish it not long before she was kidnapped. I felt like they were already taking her PhD away, and I wasn’t going to give them the satisfaction of taking mine as well. That’s pretty much the only reason. To me, the fact that terrorists would benefit from this infighting among hostage families is more reason not to take part in this.' And how have the responses been toward you in the U.S.? 'The reactions I get from Israelis are different from responses I get from non-Israelis. I also get a lot of warm messages and words of support and kindness from both Israelis and especially the Jewish community in the U.S. It has been truly remarkable to see how many kind Jewish souls around the U.S. who never heard about my sister but were willing to help simply because they're also Jewish.' How do you explain this difference? 'The comments I get from Israelis have to do more with how undeserving my sister is of any empathy or compassion. Israelis are constantly in a sense of a zero-sum game. Everything is a struggle or a competition for something. 'The kindness extended to me by American Jews feels like it comes from this sense of Judaism as something that unites us, this shared feeling of destiny. It’s this idea of standing with someone who shares a sense of fear of persecution. And my sister is in the unenviable position of being a Jewish woman held captive by radical, extremist terrorist groups. I think that resonates strongly with American Jews, and I’m deeply, deeply grateful for that.' Mom cried live on air One of the most important messages she received from the Jewish community was not to neglect her personal life. 'Although it feels like all I want to do is stop doing anything else and throw myself into this, it's really important for me to still have some sense of self outside of my sister being a hostage,' she says. 'These things take time, and it's going to be a long journey, and to make it to the end of it, I need to be able to exist in parallel.' Elizabeth has already missed her sister’s Ph.D. graduation ceremony at Stanford University. That moment, like every significant milestone in the life of Emma’s two-year-old son, Daniel, is carefully documented and saved in a digital 'time capsule,' in the hope that one day Elizabeth will be able to see what she missed. In the videos Emma records, Daniel refers to her as 'the aunt in Iraq.' He doesn’t know any other reality. Where are your parents and siblings in this fight? 'We prefer to keep them out of this. When it all began, someone made my mom cry live on television, and we decided this isn’t for them. I’ve become the face of the fight, and that’s how we’ve been managing.' She adds, 'There’s a two-year age gap between Elizabeth and me, but we always said she was the eldest by mistake. Growing up, I was basically the eldest in behavior—the one who took responsibility—and somehow, that’s happening again now. 'I still have this habit—when something interesting happens, I reach for my phone to text her about it because we would always think the same thing. We would often text each other the exact same message at the same time, or call each other to say the exact same thing. I know that if she gets to see the news, she thinks the same things as I do. I just hope I get to see her soon, because we have a lot of inside jokes that we need to catch up on.' And how are you coping in the meantime? 'I can’t even explain what a nightmare this is. I haven’t slept properly a single night since March 2023. I think about her all the time. I wish I could tie her to the bed so something like this could never happen again.' Do you feel any anger toward her? 'There is nothing in the world a person could do to deserve such a punishment. Whatever mistake she may have made, she doesn’t deserve what happened to her. In any case, that belongs to the category of things I can think about later. Right now, anything that doesn’t bring her back home is irrelevant and unimportant. And if she doesn’t come back, then what does it matter? This isn’t about inner strength or anything like that—it’s just that there’s no other choice. Nothing good awaits me at the bottom of that pit of ‘what ifs.’ There’s no point in going there.' Some relatives of hostages admit that sometimes they wish for the nightmare to simply end, even if it means knowing their loved ones are no longer alive. Do you relate to that feeling? 'At the end of all this, if she doesn’t survive, then of course I... I would prefer she didn’t suffer. But if she comes home alive, it will have been worth everything. I can’t know what she’s going through there. I’ve imagined it all—everything from the darkest scenarios to the most optimistic ones. I don’t think I have the moral right to judge whether this effort is worth it or not. That’s a question only she can answer, if and when I bring her back.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkduorin1x	2024-12-14T15:01:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/ry11YEBL00mJe/ry11YEBL00mJe_208_398_784_442_0_small.jpg
Senior official: Significant progress in hostage talks; majority ...	A senior Israeli official told Ynet on Saturday that there has been 'significant progress' in talks for a hostage deal, with its main details currently kept under the radar to avoid political interference that could derail it. 'The heads of Mossad and Shin Bet reported to the Cabinet that Hamas has shown a willingness to reach a deal that wasn’t there before, and the assessment is that an agreement could be reached within a few weeks,' according to the official. The official attributed the shift in Hamas’ stance to 'the blows they’ve suffered' and the impending inauguration of Donald Trump as U.S. president next month. 'If Netanyahu presents a reasonable deal, he will have a majority in the government and Cabinet, even if [Itamar] Ben-Gvir and [Bezalel] Smotrich oppose it,' the official added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byjga00iejl	2024-12-14T12:50:19-08:00	
Israel’s new fear: From Shiite to Sunni jihad	Commentary: Assad’s regime collapse marks a rare moment, but Syria’s new leadership may eventually demand the return of the Golan Heights; in his final hours in power, Assad raged, attempted bribery and accused his generals of corruption before fleeing The Middle East often brings prolonged and grinding tragedy for all of us. Yet there are very few historic moments—those that change everything. One such moment was October 7. Another occurred this week when Damascus fell. The Iranian axis no longer exists. Until just a few weeks ago, the regime in Tehran could send a truck from southern Iran, travel north through mullah-friendly Iraq, cross into Syria’s eastern border—where it would be welcomed by a regime that served them—and proceed via Damascus all the way to Hezbollah on the Mediterranean coast in Beirut. With Syria's collapse and the severe blows to Hezbollah, that is no longer possible. Decades of investment and hundreds of billions of petro-dollars by the Iranians have gone down the drain. Iran’s proxy strategy—the network of operatives it built against Israel—once seemed effective and intimidating. But it turns out that slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s 'spiderweb' metaphor wasn’t about Israel, but rather Iran’s network. Iran’s proxies were supposed to protect it, but in the end, it was dragged into defending them—and failed. This week, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was filled with accusations. His bitterness will bring satisfaction to anyone seeking peace in the region. That said, there are no illusions about Damascus. Even there, we will be on our own. 'The rebels have won,' an Israeli security official told his American counterpart, who immediately corrected him: 'Don’t say rebels, they’re jihadists. Terrorists.' The Israeli official didn’t need the reminder; he was overseeing an IDF operation to eliminate Syrian army capabilities. The prevailing view in Israel’s security establishment is that Shiite jihadism has been replaced by Sunni jihadism. For now, the new regime will persuade the world it isn’t al-Qaida and will attempt to take control of the entire state and restore order. But in a year or two, it will begin framing the return of the Golan Heights as a sacred Islamic mission. Even before addressing the dire predictions—realistic as they may be—it must be said outright: Syria has been freed. From the depths of the Syrian desert to Idlib province, from the torture chambers of Saydnaya prison to the markets of Aleppo, from the streets of Beirut to the borders of Iraq, and across the entire Middle East, this is a revolutionary reality. The Assad dynasty was not only, or even primarily, a link in the so-called 'axis of resistance'; it was a symbol of a stagnant, dictatorial regime akin only to North Korea—a place frozen in time. For Syrians themselves, the fall of Damascus was less significant than the liberation of Saydnaya prison—the site where tens of thousands were executed and countless others vanished. Videos emerging from the prison this week revealed the sheer magnitude of the horror: the gallows, the bodies dissolved in acid, the prisoners forgotten in underground cells, the execution lists. Some prisoners had been there for decades, knowing nothing of the outside world. Stories even surfaced of children born inside the prison. Saydnaya was the ultimate symbol of the regime's boundless brutality. This week, families from across the country flocked to the prison, searching for loved ones who had disappeared. In nearly every case, they found nothing. The regime had erased its opponents—and any trace of their existence. The Syrian butterfly effect There is a lesson here. No building on any Western university campus was seized in solidarity with the Syrian people. No fiery protests were held at prestigious campuses while hundreds of thousands were being slaughtered. Unlike the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this war lacked a simplistic, false narrative of 'white oppressors' and 'indigenous victims.' As a result, Syrian blood was deemed expendable. The war was treated as an unfortunate but immutable reality—and then forgotten. The Syrian refugees I’ve spoken to in Europe were filled with boundless disappointment at the West, which they felt had abandoned them. And it must be said: they were undoubtedly abandoned. The key moment came in 2012, when U.S. President Barack Obama issued a 'red line' warning to the Assad regime, demanding it refrain from using chemical weapons against its own people. Assad ignored the warning and massacred scores with nerve gas. The U.S. and Britain prepared a response—limited airstrikes. The rebels believed such action could topple Assad’s faltering regime. But then came a turning point of weakness. The American public, scarred by Iraq, was so averse to further Middle Eastern conflicts that it opposed even airstrikes. In other words, Syrians were left to choke. Obama’s resolve collapsed in record time. His administration briefed that he reversed course after a contemplative 'walk' with his chief of staff across the White House lawn. A romantic and vivid image: a stroll on Washington’s tranquil grass while Syrians suffocated. The consequences were catastrophic. Obama accepted a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin, a cunning initiative from Moscow’s czar. Syria’s chemical weapons would be removed, and in return, the West would refrain from striking. But several things happened: Russia entered Syria with overwhelming force while the U.S. barely reacted. The disarmament process dragged on, and it became clear not all chemical weapons had been removed. Moreover, the relevant conventions didn’t classify chlorine as a chemical weapon, allowing Assad to use it freely in the years that followed. Like a nuclear reactor meltdown, Syria became increasingly toxic. ISIS took control of 40% of the country and declared an Islamic Caliphate. This hardly disturbed the West until the group began beheading foreigners and Christians. We live in a world where the image of a single beheading carries more weight than the deaths of thousands who were simply shot. Meanwhile, the refugee crisis in Europe erupted after Assad, encouraged by the Russians, began pushing his own people out of Syria. Syrians crossed the sea from Turkey to Greece, some perishing along the way, and hundreds of thousands arrived in Europe. Refugees are rarely welcomed, and Germany reached an agreement with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to stem the flow of Syrians into the continent. But it was too late; the Syrian civil war—a conflict few paid attention to, in a remote country with no vast oil reserves—had already played a decisive role in Brexit. Brexit (along with the refugee crisis and its images) then contributed to Donald Trump’s rise in 2016. Would all this have happened without the Syrian war? Perhaps. But it played a crucial role. The butterfly effect of Syrian suffering unleashed hurricanes—not one, but many. The tragedy lies in the persistence of this situation: the slow, grinding history of suffering. Assad’s regime was weak from the start of the war but managed to maneuver its way forward. Hezbollah saved him, followed by the Revolutionary Guards and Iran, and then the Russians. The Americans eventually entered Syria, primarily to fight ISIS. Yet the prevailing perception was that Assad couldn’t be toppled, with Russia and Iran backing him. As reported earlier this week by Ynet’s sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, Israeli Military Intelligence (Aman) had assessed that the Syrian army was gradually recovering. This assessment, though grounded in material terms—acquisition of weaponry, training and improved command and control—proved to be a mistake. As history has shown, regimes don’t collapse solely due to material factors. In his final hours before fleeing to Moscow, the sanctuary for deposed dictators, Assad still didn’t grasp his reality. Western intelligence sources observed astonishing scenes in real time: the dictator raged uncontrollably. He accused his generals of corruption and blamed the army for its failures. He tried every trick in the book—offering last-minute proposals to the West and Gulf states, issuing threats and attempting bribes. He was even convinced that he had another division at his disposal, only to discover it had vanished. None of it worked. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Therefore, it is essential not to dismiss the pure joy of Syrians at the fall of their oppressive regime or underestimate their desire to build a new state. Assad’s supporters in the West mourned the dictator’s downfall this week, labeling his successors as 'Woke Al-Qaida.' Many of these figures, like George Galloway and Max Blumenthal, are among the most vocal anti-Israel voices. It was a delight to witness their profound frustration and the disarray of anonymous social media accounts, likely managed from Russia, as they scrambled for explanations. The Russians, who poured a fortune into Syria, were quick to search for scapegoats this week—blaming Assad himself, and, when desperate, even pointing fingers at Israel’s 'imperialism.' Assad is now a guest-prisoner in Russia, where Moscow is already considering the next dictator. Assad should know that the empire won’t abandon him, even if the masses demand his hanging. The blow to Moscow is severe and could deepen if Russia is forced to vacate its naval base on the Mediterranean coast in Tartus. In this sense, what happened in Syria stands out amid global trends of recent years: consider where, in recent memory, Iran and Russia have retreated, or where people have freed themselves from an iron grip. Who's next on the chopping block? Official and unofficial Israel celebrated the fall of Assad’s regime this week and the dramatic shift—largely credited to the actions of the IDF and the defense establishment—since October 7. These celebrations are entirely understandable. It’s no coincidence that U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is visiting the country. Beyond urgent matters, there’s a legacy at stake. In its final moments, the Biden administration is attempting to claim credit for the dismantling of the so-called 'axis of resistance.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the success entirely to himself, and not even the opening of his trial dampened his euphoric mood. Mistakes, as usual, were quick to follow. Perhaps there was significant strategic value in seizing the Syrian Golan Heights and taking control of the buffer zone. But it’s doubtful Israel gained anything from the boastful declarations and high-profile visits by the prime minister and defense minister to the Golan Heights. Golani’s announcement of a free-market economy and a ban on acts of revenge was interpreted in the West as a serious gesture toward the future. Simultaneously, his men executed one of Assad’s relatives by hanging him from a crane, filming the act and posting it on Telegram Israel said it all this week: it threatened Syria, bragged about bombings there, expressed interest in 'relations' as Netanyahu put it and issued further warnings about Iranian involvement. For the first two days, the world remained silent about Israel’s incursion into Syria, but at some point, the noise from public declarations became deafening. I can only commend the military press corps for securing a tour across the Syrian border. They did their job diligently. But what exactly is the point of presenting a temporary occupation—as described in the Cabinet meeting—as some sort of achievement, especially when it was accomplished without a fight? The Israeli establishment, jubilant, was swept into an internal competition over credit. The result: within a short time, the Middle East—and even European nations—woke up and began demanding an Israeli withdrawal. Israel injected itself into the narrative and, in doing so, became the story. Following Defense Minister Israel Katz's statement—where he threatened that anyone following Assad’s path 'will end like Assad'—military historian Prof. Danny Orbach wrote on his Facebook page: 'There is a new regime in Syria. Its leaders barely talk about us. Even if they are deeply hostile to Israel, they are even more hostile to Iran. This creates an opportunity to build bridges for cooperation, even after Assad’s arsenal is destroyed. Why, for heaven’s sake, send them every possible signal that ‘Israel is your enemy’?' Silent amidst this was Abu Mohammed al-Golani, Syria’s new ruler. A shrewd and ruthless leader, he seems to have learned lessons from the fall of ISIS—his sworn enemy—and the crushing of al-Qaida, his former roots. Despite Israel’s devastating strikes on Syria’s military infrastructure and its entry into the Syrian Golan, Golani refrained from issuing threats against Israel or the West. His announcement of a free-market economy and a ban on acts of revenge was interpreted in the West as a serious gesture toward the future. The West, however, takes such declarations far too seriously. Simultaneously with these signals of goodwill, Golani’s men executed one of Assad’s relatives by hanging him from a crane, filming the act and posting it on Telegram. Across Damascus, arrests and purges have begun. Assad's father’s grave was torched. This isn’t the end. Western intelligence is closely monitoring developments in Lebanon, where Sunni and Christian elements are likely to seize the opportunity to move against Hezbollah. It is not unthinkable that Israel is waiting for this scenario to unfold. The final neutralization of Hezbollah can only occur through a united Lebanese effort to strip it of its weapons. If this doesn’t happen now, in the wake of Assad’s flight, it is doubtful the Lebanese will ever be able to free themselves from Hezbollah’s grip. Another critical issue for Israel and the United States is the Kurds. Western intelligence agencies are still trying to discern the nature of the relationship between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), its leader Golani and Turkish President Erdoğan. There is no doubt about their cooperation in intelligence sharing, weapons transfers and long-term strategic goals. The question, however, is whether Turkey merely influences the new Syrian regime or exercises full control over it. A clue came shortly after the takeover of Damascus: Erdoğan reportedly asked HTS to address the Kurdish issue. Despite HTS’s ongoing conflict with another pro-Turkish opposition force, the Syrian National Army (SNA), Golani quickly complied. The Kurds are historic allies of Israel, serving as a counterweight to countless groups in Syria and Iraq that seek Israel’s destruction. The United States has stepped in to halt the assault on the Kurds, a move likely influenced by Israel, which has reportedly leveraged its sway in Washington—under both Biden and Trump—to protect Kurdish autonomy. The concern was a swift dismantling of Kurdish self-rule and a dramatic rise in Turkey’s power in the region. This has left the U.S. in a peculiar position: two NATO allies, the U.S. and Turkey, are pursuing completely opposing goals in Syria. Turkey is waging a determined campaign to dismantle the Kurdish administration, while the U.S.—at least the current administration—is committed to defending it. About 1,000 American troops are stationed alongside Kurdish forces, and as long as they remain, Erdoğan and pro-Turkish forces are unlikely to push for a decisive victory. However, on January 20, Trump will be inaugurated as president of the United States. A battle is now unfolding in Washington: pro-Israel advocates are working to preserve Kurdish interests, while Turkey’s supporters—less visible but not insignificant in D.C.—are lobbying for the opposite. The 'new Syria' is bound to bring many more upheavals. Damascus has fallen, but it remains unclear what will rise in its place. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rksoavonje	2024-12-14T12:43:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/By11rIruE1e/By11rIruE1e_0_23_2362_1330_0_small.jpg
Israeli leaders demand probe into ex-prosecutor calling for milit...	Former state prosecutor Moshe Lador urges voluntary pilots to refuse service if Israel 'becomes a dictatorship' as government reintroduces some parts of plan to reform judiciary, sparking condemnation from across political spectrum Israeli leaders across the political spectrum have condemned former state prosecutor Moshe Lador for remarks perceived as endorsing military disobedience, with several calling for legal action. Lador had said that 'pilots whose service is voluntary must tell the state that if it becomes a dictatorship, they will not enter the cockpit.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the comments as 'a red line that endangers democracy and undermines our future,' and called on Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara to act against 'this dangerous phenomenon.' Defense Minister Israel Katz echoed the prime minister, saying, 'Disobedience of any kind cannot be accepted under any circumstances.' Justice Minister Yariv Levin formally requested an investigation, asserting that 'calls for disobedience, whether in peacetime or wartime, constitute a clear and severe violation of the law.' Levin warned that failure to take decisive legal action could embolden further incidents of incitement. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir criticized Lador’s comments as 'a stab in the back to the nation and IDF soldiers,' adding that 'we saw on October 7 the heavy price of disobedience in human lives.' He accused the attorney general of granting 'automatic backing to any action against the government.' President Isaac Herzog also condemned the remarks, saying, 'In a democracy, everyone has the full right to express opinions and protest, but disobedience is off-limits. Anyone who says otherwise harms Israel’s security.' Herzog warned against returning to the 'divisive and dangerous rhetoric of pre-October 7.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi issued a rare public statement, calling for an end to any talk of disobedience or refusal to serve. 'The Israel Defense Forces must remain outside of political disputes, especially at a time when security challenges are so pressing,' the military said in a statement on his behalf. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also weighed in, condemning Lador’s statement and emphasizing, 'I oppose all forms of disobedience and evasion of service in the IDF.' Lador’s comments come against the backdrop of a contentious political debate over the government’s renewed push for judicial reform. The proposed legislation, championed by Prime Minister Netanyahu's right-wing coalition, seeks to limit the authority of the Supreme Court, reduce judicial oversight of government decisions and grant the coalition greater influence over judicial appointments. Supporters of the reforms argue they are necessary to restore the balance of power between the judiciary and the legislature, which they claim has been eroded over time. Critics, however, view the reforms as a threat to Israeli democracy, warning that they could undermine judicial independence and erode checks and balances in the political system. The revival of the reform drive has reignited mass protests across Israel, with opponents expressing fears that the changes would consolidate power in the hands of the ruling coalition. These tensions have spilled over into the military, where voluntary reservists, including elite pilots, have issued warnings of potential refusal to serve if the reforms are enacted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1zrpvivyg	2024-12-14T11:30:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/01/HylLI4tp002/HylLI4tp002_0_63_1280_721_0_small.jpg

It appeared to be the first letter to the UN from Syria’s new interim government. The letters are dated Dec. 9, days after rebels ousted Assad and ended his family’s more than 50-year authoritarian rule of Syria. 'At a time when the Syrian Arab Republic is witnessing a new phase in its history in which its people aspire to establish a state of freedom, equality and the rule of law and to achieve their hopes for prosperity and stability, the Israeli occupation army has penetrated additional areas of Syrian territory in Mount Hermon and Quneitra Governorate,' ambassador Aldahhak wrote. Israel still controls the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War. The Disengagement Agreement ending the 1973 war between Israel and Syria established a demilitarized buffer zone between the two countries, monitored by a UN peacekeeping force known as UNDOF. In a letter to the Security Council circulated Friday which was also written on Dec. 9, Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon said his country had taken 'limited and temporary measures,' deploying troops temporarily in the separation area 'to prevent armed groups from threatening Israeli territory.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r15mi8o4ye	2024-12-14T10:36:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/BJlx1roNJx/BJlx1roNJx_0_71_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Trump envoy on hostages to visit Israel for consultations on Gaza...	Adam Boehler to meet with Katz and discuss potential hostage deal; Netanyahu calls Hamas videos 'cruel psychological warfare' Adam Boehler, an advisor to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on hostages and missing persons, is set to visit Israel in the coming days, Ynet learned on Saturday. While sources familiar with the visit describe it as private, ynet has learned that Boehler, 45, will hold meetings and consultations regarding a potential hostage deal involving captives held by Hamas in Gaza. The Defense Ministry has reportedly received a request to arrange a meeting with Boehler, likely to take place on Monday. Both Israeli and U.S. officials have kept the visit under wraps. Trump, who has already warned Hamas to release hostages before his inauguration on January 20 or face severe consequences, has adopted an aggressive stance on the issue. 'There will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East,' he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Boehler, a Jewish-American known for his hardline approach toward Hamas, echoed this sentiment last week, saying, 'Anyone holding hostages should think carefully about what could happen to them.' Boehler served as Trump’s envoy during the Abraham Accords negotiations and was recently appointed 'Special Presidential Envoy for American Hostage Affairs' following Trump’s reelection. In a statement announcing Boehler’s appointment, Trump said, 'Adam knows that NO ONE is tougher than the United States of America... Adam will work tirelessly to bring our Great American Citizens HOME.' In the past, Boehler has called for stronger U.S. action in retrieving hostages. In an op-ed for The Hill, he advocated for military operations, including commando raids, to rescue American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. 'The Biden administration has reverted to a philosophy of hostage rescues that sees a military operation as a last resort,' Boehler wrote. 'This approach cedes the upper hand to hostage takers, who feel emboldened to capture Americans with little fear of paying for it with their lives.' He added, 'American servicemembers are more than equipped to pull off a rescue. In the wake of the failed mission to rescue Americans held hostage by Iran in 1980, U.S. Special Operations teams were rebuilt to achieve what President Jimmy Carter’s aborted raid could not.

Those averse to an American military presence inside Gaza must remember that a single, surgical raid is not the same thing as a protracted U.S. military presence.' The emerging deal Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday, 'Hamas' barrage of propaganda videos is cruel and malicious psychological warfare. I am in constant contact with the families of the hostages, who are enduring a terrible and prolonged nightmare. I have said and will repeat: anyone who harms our hostages will bear full responsibility. We will continue working tirelessly to bring all the hostages home—both the living and the deceased.' According to reports, the emerging deal is expected to unfold in stages, beginning under the Biden administration and continuing into the Trump administration. The first stage would be humanitarian, involving the release of hostages in exchange for a seven-week cease-fire. Such an agreement could also pave the way for a broader deal, potentially ending the war and facilitating normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. An Israeli official likened the negotiations to a pregnancy, saying, 'The assumption is that the 'pregnancy' will continue after a humanitarian release. The key is to get both sides committed.' Earlier Saturday, Arab media reported difficulties in the negotiations due to Hamas’ demands to release high-profile prisoners. However, Israeli sources, maintaining strict confidentiality in recent weeks to avoid jeopardizing the talks, dismissed these claims as 'untrue.' These developments come amidst a week of cautious optimism regarding a possible deal. On Thursday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and President Joe Biden’s special envoy, Brett McGurk, met with Netanyahu and senior Israeli officials to discuss the hostage negotiations. Mossad chief David Barnea and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar also attended the meeting. On Wednesday, Barnea met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani in Doha, following a secret meeting held two weeks earlier in Vienna. Qatar currently serves as the central mediator for the deal, and the outgoing U.S. administration is cooperating fully with the incoming administration in a shared effort to finalize an agreement before Trump’s inauguration. However, it remains unclear whether Hamas will agree to a limited deal without ending the war entirely. Conflicting reports have emerged: some suggest Hamas is showing flexibility, including a willingness to accept a limited IDF presence in Gaza, while others claim Israel has agreed to a temporary withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor which borders Egypt, though these reports remain unconfirmed. For now, Israeli officials estimate that a deal could be reached within two weeks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjy7eijvje	2024-12-14T10:16:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/Skeqq5BiNkl/Skeqq5BiNkl_0_208_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
