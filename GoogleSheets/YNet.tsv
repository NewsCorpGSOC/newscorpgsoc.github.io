After explosive pager attacks, Hezbollah missile strike injures 8...	Wounded taken to northern hospitals for treatment; IDF responds with artillery fire aimed at sources of attack; Hezbollah, which had vowed retaliation for mysterious explosions in Lebanon, claims responsibility for missile launch Eight people were injured Thursday morning when an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon struck the Upper Galilee. The wounded were evacuated to hospitals in northern Israel, with one person listed in serious condition, one in moderate condition and the others sustaining minor injuries. The IDF responded with artillery fire targeting the sources of the attack. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the missile strike. The incident occurred amid rising tensions following a series of mysterious explosions in Lebanon over the past two days, which have been attributed to Israel and have resulted in thousands of casualties, including Hezbollah operatives. In response to these attacks, Hezbollah has threatened retaliation. Overnight, Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck Hezbollah military sites in several southern Lebanese towns, including Chihine, Taybeh, Blida, Meiss al-Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela, according to the IDF. Additionally, aircraft targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot in Khiam. According to a New York Times report, Israeli intelligence identified an opportunity to act against Hezbollah following a speech by the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in February. In his remarks, Nasrallah warned his followers about the dangers of using mobile phones, urging them to replace them with pagers. 'The phone in your hands, in the hands of your wife and children, is the agent,' Nasrallah said. 'Bury it, put it in an iron box and lock it away.' The report noted that Nasrallah’s directive to expand the use of pagers ultimately backfired seven months later, leading to the devastating explosions. Even before Nasrallah’s speech, Israeli intelligence had begun implementing a plan to establish a fake international pager company. According to three intelligence sources, the Hungarian pager company that manufactured the devices that exploded earlier this week was set up by Israel. At least two other companies were also created to disguise the fact that the pagers were produced by Israeli intelligence officers. Budapest-based BAC Consulting KFT provided legitimate pager services to other clients, manufacturing devices without explosives. However, the pagers intended for Hezbollah operatives were produced separately, with PETN explosives concealed inside their batteries. These devices were shipped to Lebanon starting in 2022, though initially in small quantities. After Nasrallah’s speech, production ramped up quickly. In addition to banning the use of cellphones during Hezbollah meetings, he also ordered that sensitive information should never be transmitted via mobile phones, according to intelligence officials who spoke to the Times. Hezbollah officers were required to carry pagers at all times, and in the event of war, pagers were to be used to direct fighters. American intelligence officials said that over the summer, thousands of pagers were shipped to Lebanon and distributed among Hezbollah officers and their allies. While Hezbollah viewed them as a 'defensive' tool, Israeli intelligence saw them as 'buttons' that could be pressed at any moment. That moment appeared to arrive earlier this week. Meanwhile, as U.S. officials continue to push for a diplomatic solution to prevent further escalation, Ibrahim al-Amin, editor of Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper, published an editorial titled 'The War of Annihilation, Lebanese Edition — Israel Wants to Eliminate Hezbollah.' He wrote that Israel seems to be preparing for a new phase of conflict with Hezbollah, targeting the group’s human and military capabilities, making talk of an all-out war increasingly realistic. 'If the enemy has decided to carry out operations against more than 10,000 people, military personnel and civilians, in command centers, outposts or homes, then it has decided that we are in a no-holds-barred war,' al-Amin concluded. 'Ironclad' American support Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday following the explosions in Lebanon, which have been attributed to Israel by foreign media. The Pentagon said that the U.S. was not involved in the operations and that Israel had provided information about the incidents through intelligence channels. According to the Pentagon, Gallant and Austin 'reviewed regional security developments' during their call. Austin reiterated the United States’ 'ironclad' support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Hezbollah and Tehran’s regional allies. Austin emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring Israel’s adversaries and efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region. He also underscored Washington’s preference for a cease-fire agreement in Gaza that would secure the return of hostages and a 'lasting diplomatic solution to the Israel-Lebanon border conflict that would allow civilians on both sides to return to their homes.' Iran also responded to the explosions in Lebanon, which injured its ambassador to the country, Mojtaba Amani. Tehran said that it 'reserves the right under international law to take necessary measures to respond to the attack on its delegation.' Additionally, Iran called on UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council to 'condemn Israel’s terrorist act and heinous crime against the Iranian delegation in Lebanon and Lebanese sovereignty.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjltkufpa	2024-09-19T00:37:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/SyW3ph0060/SyW3ph0060_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israeli businessman indicted in Iranian plot to assassinate Israe...	An Israeli businessman based in Turkey was indicted Thursday on serious security charges, accused of being recruited by Iranian intelligence. Prosecutors say he was smuggled into Iran twice, received payment for various missions and plotted to assassinate top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The Shin Bet and Israel Police revealed that the suspect was arrested in August on suspicion of committing security offenses on behalf of the Iranian regime.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk6vabftc	2024-09-19T00:06:09-07:00	
US says Iran emailed stolen Trump campaign material to Biden camp	Intelligence agencies say malicious cyber activity 'latest example of Iran's multi-pronged approach to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process' Iranian hackers sent emails containing stolen material from Republican former President Donald Trump's campaign to people involved in Democratic President Joe Biden's then re-election campaign, part of an alleged broader effort by Tehran to influence the U.S. election, U.S. agencies said on Wednesday. 'Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump's campaign to U.S. media organizations,' the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. 'This malicious cyber activity is the latest example of Iran's multi-pronged approach ... to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process,' the agencies said. They added that there is currently no information indicating those recipients replied. They did not provide further details on the nature of the stolen material. In August, the United States accused Iran of launching cyber operations against the campaigns of both U.S. presidential candidates and targeting the American public with influence operations aimed at fanning political discord. Iran has denied interfering in U.S. affairs. On Wednesday, its permanent mission to the United Nations in New York said the latest U.S. allegations were 'fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.' It added: 'Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election.' Malicious cyber actors sent unsolicited emails to individuals in Biden's campaign in late June and early July that contained a text excerpt from stolen material from the Republican presidential candidate's campaign, the agencies said. Biden dropped out of the presidential race on July 21 and was replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate. Polls show Trump and Harris are in a tight race. In a statement, the Trump campaign said Harris and Biden should disclose whether they used the hacked material 'to hurt' Trump. The former president later said in a rally on Wednesday night that Iran hacked into his campaign to help Democrats, calling it foreign election interference. 'We're not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign,' a Harris campaign spokesperson said after the statement by U.S. agencies. 'A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt.' Tehran also says Washington has interfered in its affairs over decades ranging from a 1953 coup of a prime minister to the 2020 killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1jc9vkt0	2024-09-18T22:55:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/28/S1om80oIC/S1om80oIC_0_0_1310_738_0_small.jpg

First female soldier to die in Gaza is one of many war heroines	Female courage seen in current war: Major E. rescued hostages and crashed on the Philadelphi Corridor; Staff Sergeant Agam Naim was killed in Rafah and Sergeant Gaia Tzubari was shot while treating wounded soldiers in Shijaiyah Paramedic Staff Sergeant Agam Naim, who fell in Rafah on Tuesday, was the first female soldier to be killed in this current war since the IDF began its incursion into Gaza. For the past six months, she served in the Gaza Strip alongside the 52nd Battalion's Armored Corps, and was due to begin her leave soon. Like her, dozens of female paramedics risk their lives in the war to save the lives of others, and so do a myriad of other women in countless roles. The female medical soldiers like Naim take a crucial part in the fighting. They evacuate the wounded and provide medical treatment under fire, standing side by side with the male soldiers even in tragic events. Sergeant Gaia Tzubari, the first female soldier to be seriously injured since the IDF entered Gaza, who also lit a beacon on the last Independence Day, served as a paramedic in Gaza. She gave medical treatment to soldiers who were hit by an anti-tank missile in Shijaiyah and was shot: 'Even if I had known this would happen, I would have gone in again,' she said. 'We are being prepared for exactly this moment: treating the wounded under fire. If there is a wounded person, you go to help him, even though it's scary and your heart is pounding. Your mind is on autopilot and you run without thinking twice,' she added. On October 7, women fought and worked to save lives. Lt. Col. Yarden Shukrun, commander of the Shahar Battalion in the Rescue and Training Division, left her home in Ofakim on that Saturday morning and fought the terrorists. In an interview with Ynet, she said: 'We woke up from the sirens. I hugged my children tightly in the bomb shelter, and received an initial update about terrorists at the Home Front Command base. I took my weapon and a soldier from the battalion who lives next to us, and we ran to the base.' She added that the two joined the forces that fought the terrorists who were entrenched in the base, and after they were all eliminated, she joined other female officers from the battalion under her command. They returned to Ofakim, where they rescued residents who were besieged in their homes. 'For 72 hours we rescued people. Some of them are actually my neighbors. We made a heroic effort as a battalion together with cadets from the 1st Brigade. I was bursting with pride,' she said. Shukrun was the first female battalion commander to participate in combat, and thus actually made history. 'I don't know what will happen to the female combat soldier status in Israel the day after the war, I don't think about it either. I want to be the best rescue soldier there is. If we stick to the task, there seems to be no gap. I never felt like there was something I was told 'you can't do' only because I'm a woman. We can also operate deep in Lebanon if they have to,' she said. 'A great privilege to take part in combat' Lt. Col. Or Ben Yehuda, commander of the mixed male and female Caracal Battalion, fought on the morning of October 7 against dozens of terrorists who occupied the Sufa outpost. At Ynet's annual women's conference, held about six months ago, she said: 'Every day I feel like a winner when I see female soldiers push boundaries. People don't believe me that they load the shells by themselves and activate the system. I say to both my men and women, we had a great privilege to take part in the fighting.' The Iron Swords War has proven to be a turning point for women in the IDF, especially for female combat soldiers. From the War of Independence in 1948 until this past year, they were not given the opportunity to take such a significant part in fighting in enemy territory. Along with the achievements of female soldiers, there are also fallen heroines who died protecting Israel and its people: the female reconnaissance soldiers who warned of the upcoming attack and those who were killed in their base on October 7; the female Armored Corps soldiers who repelled terrorists in the Eshkol Region during the massacre; the late Captain Nimri who was killed on base while protecting her soldiers in Nahal Oz; and Major E. who rescued hostages in Gaza and was injured in last week's helicopter crash in the Philadelphi Corridor. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjtml2oar	2024-09-18T21:55:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/Hkpa8iOT0/Hkpa8iOT0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Hamas releases psychological terror video, threatening more suici...	Hamas posts video of its suicide bomber who blew himself up in Tel Aviv in August, and says that the IDF's continued operation in the West Bank against Palestinian terrorist insurgence 'will double the bill of revenge', as fear of escalation during holidays grows Hamas released an unusual video on Wednesday evening that presented clips from attacks in Israel in the early 2000s and the reading of the will of Jafar Muna, the terrorist who carried out the attack in Tel Aviv at the end of August. 'Every day that passes, when in the background there is aggression against our people in Gaza, will double the bill of revenge. The only thing in exchange will be blood,' he said. The attack in Tel Aviv, in which a bystander was moderately injured, has not yet been classified as a suicide bombing. However, in the psychological terror video released on Wednesday, the terrorist was recorded saying 'I am the fighter from the Al-Qassem Battalion, the living martyr with the help of Allah, Jafar Muna. You (Israel) have lit a fire that will not be extinguished until we remove you from our land with the help of Allah, we have prepared attacks for you. The fire you lit is going to burn you, your settlers, and your army.' At the time, Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed joint responsibility for the attack, but the defense establishment investigated whether there was another party that sent the terrorist. In a statement issued a day after the explosion, the commander of the Israel Police Tel Aviv District said: 'This is not a person who is in our systems or appears in our databases, and the explosive was probably created in the West Bank. It is estimated that the terrorist was supposed to arrive at a certain place, and probably noticed the synagogue. He decided to stop for a moment to prime the explosive, but apparently clicked on something else and activated it.' Since the outbreak of the war, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been trying to set the West Bank ablaze and, together with Iran, he is pouring a lot of money and weapons into the region. So far, Hamas has not succeeded in dragging the Palestinians into a conflict with Israel and succeeded in creating wide-scale riots and clashes with IDF forces. The Shin Bet already noticed the trend of explosive device attacks, which mostly originate in the West Bank, and warned the phenomenon is gaining traction thanks to the dual-use of materials such as fertilizer. Suicide attacks, which haven't been used in years, will be an escalation in the war against terrorism. They require recruitment, infrastructure and preparation, raising concerns that Israel is headed to a third intifada. At the beginning of this month, the defense establishment estimated that although the situation is not hte same as it was in 2002, Israel fears the return of suicide bombings in the heart of Israel, especially before the holidays. Following increased alerts, the Central Command launched its latest operation in the West Bank, focusing on the refugee camps in northern Samaria, Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur al-Shams, and other areas. So far, about 70 terrorists have been killed during the operation, and dozens have been arrested. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzpr60060	2024-09-18T21:35:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/22/SJ3rdLNoC/SJ3rdLNoC_0_63_590_333_0_small.jpg

According to the Pentagon statement, Austin expressed to Gallant the U.S.'s 'unwavering' support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Hezbollah and Tehran's other regional partners. Austin also emphasized the commitment of the U.S. to deter Israel's enemies and to continue efforts to reduce tensions throughout the region. He also emphasized that the U.S. prefers to reach a cease-fire agreement in Gaza that would return the hostages, as well as 'a lasting diplomatic solution to the conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border that would allow citizens from both sides to return to their homes.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skf11fxf6r	2024-09-18T21:04:23-07:00	
Hezbollah hides numbers killed in attacks, Radwan force loses muc...	Lebanon reports 26 killed over two days of pager and walkie talkie explosions, but estimates are that the pager attack alone killed dozens of Hezbollah members and maybe more, while elite Radwan force commanders were decimated According to the official updates from Lebanon, 12 people were killed when thousands of pagers exploded on Tuesday and 20 in the walkie-talkie blasts on Wednesday, but in Israel officials believe that the announced dead and injured from the pager explosions is significantly lower than reality. It is estimated that there are many dozens of dead, if not more. Significant damage was inflicted on Hezbollah's special operation forces unit Radwan force, which lost large parts of its command structure. At least 450 were injured in the explosion of the hand-held walkie talkie radios throughout Lebanon, and these join the more than 3,000 Hezbollah operatives who were injured by the pager blasts. Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is expected to give a speech on Thursday, in his first public remarks since the series of explosions in Lebanon. U.S. officials publicly expressed anger at not receiving an update on the operation to blow up the pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon that could lead to war while conducting diplomatic efforts for a settlement. But three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that Israeli officials had informed the United States of the intention to carry out an operation in Lebanon - including in the conversation this week between Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and his counterpart Lloyd Austin - but did not provide additional details about that operation. 'The fact that no details were given about the operation meant that the United States was left in the dark until the reports of the explosions shortly after,' a source said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on his way from Washington to Cairo when the stunned American diplomats watched live on their television screens on the plane the news from Lebanon of the operation that was reportedly a joint operation by the Mossad and the IDF. At the press conference in Egypt, Blinken said that the United States 'did not know and was not involved in these incidents.' Another U.S. source said that the Americans also sent a similar message to Iran, asking Tehran not to lead an escalation. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was injured in the explosion of one of the pagers. According to the Lebanese MTV network, he was transferred from Beirut to Tehran to complete treatment in Iran. On the same plane were about 90 other wounded people who were flown to Iran to receive treatment, along with their families. The White House also said its officials were not involved in the explosions. 'We believe that there is a diplomatic way to solve the Lebanon issue. It is too early to know how the radio explosions will affect the cease-fire deal,' according to the White House, which stressed that 'it is still too early to know what effect the events will have on the high level of tension between Israel and Hezbollah at the border.' Sources privy to the details said that if Israel is indeed behind the series of explosions, it is beginning to realize the goal of returning the residents of the north to their homes. A source said that 'It is clear that this is not how a military campaign with Lebanon will look and it will require an exchange of rockets and missiles from both sides, but Israel - if it is the one that acted - has already had an effect' though it may not avert war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj00fvautc	2024-09-18T15:01:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/ryik9XPpR/ryik9XPpR_0_347_2500_1407_0_small.jpg

Zelensky said in August he wanted to present a peace plan to Biden, Harris and Trump. While Trump and Zelensky talked over the phone in July, they have not talked in person since Trump's 2017-2021 term.

Shin Bet tried to legitimize pager attack by disclosing planned H...	Shin Bet discloses Hezbollah's attempt on former Israeli security official hours before pager explosions; UN condemns the attack but doesn't identify a culprit; Israel neither confirms not denies attack Less than two hours before the pagers exploded across Lebanon, the Shin Bet allowed the publication of a report that it had thwarted a Hezbollah attack against former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon in Yarkon Park in September 2023. 'This was supposed to give international legitimacy in the face of the accusations,' sources said. Even after more than 11 months of fighting in the north and launching thousands of rockets and hundreds of drones, Israel needed international legitimacy to allegedly carry out what is attributed to it in Lebanon. Thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured and some were killed in two days of communication device explosions. Less than two hours before the pagers exploded in Lebanon and Syria on Tuesday afternoon, the Shin Bet disclosed that Hezbollah planned to assassinate former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon with an IED in Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv in September 2023. The Shin Bet lifted the gag order to supposedly justify retaliation against the terror organization and its affiliates. Since Hezbollah escalated its aggression, Israel has bolstered security around officials, embassies abroad and national symbols. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called the pager explosion attack a violation of human rights and called for those responsible to be prosecuted. Petra De Sutter, the deputy prime minister of Belgium, condemned Israel and said: 'I strongly condemn the massive terror attack in Lebanon and Syria, which injured thousands of people. A brutal escalation of violence. Silence is not an option. An international investigation is called for. The bloodshed must end.' Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association(EJA), attacked her and said that calling the pager operation a terrorist attack is upside down and that she has completely lost her moral compass. The possibility of expanding the campaign in the north is reflected in a series of senior officials' throughout this week. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the cabinet meeting that 'the existing situation in the north cannot continue. This requires a change in the balance of power on our northern border. We will do everything necessary to return our residents safely to their homes. I am committed to this, the government is committed to this and we will not settle for anything less.' On Monday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that a possible settlement in the north was fleeting, while Netanyahu was discussing Gallant's replacement with former Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar. On the same day, Netanyahu met with Amos Hochstein, the American envoy for Lebanon and emphasized that it will be impossible to return our residents home without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north. The following night, almost a year after the fighting began which led to the mass evacuation of tens of thousands of residents, the government added a new goal to the war: the safe return of the citizens to their homes in the north. On the next day, Hezbollah's pagers began exploding in Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjtpzs0060	2024-09-18T14:10:35-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/H1z5QWPT0/H1z5QWPT0_0_561_1279_720_0_small.jpg
Pager manufacturer BAC goes dark after Lebanon explosions, CEO de...	BAC, registered in Hungary’s corporate registry in 2022, presents itself as a consultancy firm, and the woman listed as its CEO claims she’s merely a 'broker'; the listed company address points to a private residence, and the website – filled with generic images and vague project descriptions – has since been taken down The Taiwanese company Gold Apollo claims that BAC, the firm allegedly responsible for manufacturing the pagers that exploded in Lebanon on Tuesday, has gone underground. Attempts to contact BAC's offices were unsuccessful, and the one time phone contact was made, the company representative declined to comment and immediately hung up. Shortly afterward, BAC's official website went offline. However, Cristiana Arcidiacono-Barsony, listed on the site as BAC’s CEO, denied any involvement in the affair during a call with an Italian news outlet. 'I don’t make pagers. I’m just a broker. I think you’ve got the wrong person,' she said, before cutting the call short. The address listed on BAC's website led to what appeared to be a private residence in Budapest. On Wednesday, a simple A4 paper sign appeared on the door, listing companies operating in the building, including BAC Consulting. According to Hungarian reports, BAC was registered in 2022, and its 49-year-old CEO has a background in physics, with degrees from prestigious London institutions. She also worked with the European Union, UNESCO, and the UN’s education arm. While BAC's website notes its involvement in telecommunications, there is no mention of specific devices or pagers. BAC's name surfaced after Gold Apollo President Hsu Ching-Kuang held a press conference to distance his company from the explosions. 'This product is not ours,' Hsu told reporters at the company's headquarters in New Taipei City, explaining that the AR-924 pagers were manufactured and sold by BAC. 'We only provide the brand name for approval; we have no involvement in the design or production,' Gold Apollo said in a statement. Initially, Hsu refused to disclose BAC’s location, but it later emerged that the company operates out of Budapest, Hungary. He further revealed that the agreement between Gold Apollo and BAC has been in place for three years, and that BAC was responsible for manufacturing the pagers that exploded. When pressed for additional details, Hsu declined to provide the terms of the agreement with BAC, but hinted at past payment issues, stating, 'The payments were very strange,' and noting that they had been routed through the Middle East. BAC's website, which features generic images and text, describes Bressoni-Arcidiacono as an expert in consultancy services across several fields, including environmental, development, and international relations. However, there is little detail on the company's specific projects or clients. The site claims the European Union is a client, though the attached descriptions are vague, consisting of general marketing language. Another project refers to BAC’s involvement in developing technology and a 'business bridge' in Asia, but again, without specifics or named clients. A European delegation is also listed as a client, but the project page is similarly sparse, filled with clichéd management and marketing slogans. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk00of300ar	2024-09-18T13:59:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/rkqVQ11da0/rkqVQ11da0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Wolt messenger delivers baby instead of pizza	Ilan Buaron was on his way to deliver a pizza in Ramat Gan when he got a message from MDA about a women in the middle of giving birth in her home two blocks away; Buaron, a Magen David Adom volunteer went to help; The pizza didn't make it, but the baby is safe When Wolt messenger Ilan Buaron, 22, started his shift Tuesday night he had no idea what kind of delivery task would be waiting for him during it.Buaron, who in addition to his work as a Wolt courier has also been volunteering for Magen David Adom in recent years, picked up a delivery of pizza from a restaurant in Ramat Gan at 2:00 a.m., put it in a box and started riding his moped to the address of the order. The delivery should have ended like hundreds of other deliveries he has made in the past, but shortly after Buaron collected the pizza, he received a message on his cellphone from MDA about a woman from Ramat Gan, who was in the middle of giving birth in her home in the city. Buaron quickly realized that the address of the woman who giving birth was two blocks away from him and he did not hesitate: He immediately changed his route and drove, together with the pizza, to the woman's home. Within a few minutes he arrived at the scene and located the woman, surrounded by her husband and mother, in an advanced stage of labor. He began to assist her in giving birth. For Buaron, it was the first time he was in an active labor situation, and he successfully delivered the couple's son. During the event, Buaron also managed to send a message to Wolt's service center and inform them that the pizza he collected would probably not reach its destination. 'I received a notification of an active birth on the way to the delivery address, I stopped here and helped the woman deliver her baby and I'm going to stay here a little longer,' he wrote. And what happened to the pizza? A new pizza was delivered to the hungry customers, and the pizza he carried on his moped was eaten by the ambulance crew that arrived on the scene. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylqdjupc	2024-09-18T12:40:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/S1gTE5OTA/S1gTE5OTA_0_544_772_435_0_small.jpg

Communities bordering West Bank warn they are vulnerable to attac...	Funds to bolster security promised by the government have not been delivered and a local mayor says his residents are at risk as Palestinians breach the partition wall easily, most looking for work; After troops locate a West Bank tunnel being built, fears grow Leaders of a municipal council bordering the partition wall separating the West Bank from Israel warned again on Wednesday of a real security risk to its residents, after the government failed to transfer funds needed to bolster security in the area. The government voted to allocate 100 million shekels to increasing security along the border wall, but the funds have not been delivered. 'I'm certain that a minute after a terror attack here, the money will make its way,' Ilan Sadeh, head of the Menashe Regional Council said. 'Why can't the government live up to its commitments before an attack?' Since the Hamas massacre in the south on October 7, residents bordering the West Bank have warned that they could fall victim to a similar attack. Communities have come under fire from West Bank terrorists who have been shooting into their homes and, in some cases, trying to launch rockets targeting their communities. Menachem Greenberg, head of security for the council, said it would take no more than seconds to reach homes of Israelis once the border is breached. Palestinians regularly climb over the border wall into Israel, to find work, mostly undisturbed by security forces. 'It is a matter of decision for anyone coming over the wall, whether to seek work to launch an attack,' he said. Greenberg said more should be done to stop Palestinians from entering Israel illegally. 'We want to see more troops on either side of the border,' he said. Greenberg praised the work of the IDF brigades that have been conducting anti-terrorism raids on West Bank cities bordering Israel but said that was not enough. Troops found a tunnel in the early stages of construction in the West Bank town of Tulkarm last week increasing the concerns of residents on the Israeli side of the fence that terror groups would attempt to infiltrate into their communities. The lessons of October 7 were learned on both sides of the partition wall, Sadeh said, adding that the massacre has changed things and that, although efforts to protect his residents have been made, they were not enough. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrcge00ac	2024-09-18T12:06:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/11/ryZK8JvkpR/ryZK8JvkpR_39_94_440_248_0_small.jpg
They called me a dirty Jew' says victims of antisemitic attack i...	Harrison Hipp, who was wearing a kipa under a hat, was attacked while walking down the street; He landed in the hospital with a concussion and cerebral hemorrhage; 'I’m real messed up... and for what? ... just because I’m Jewish? It’s ridiculous' A Jew man was the victim of a severe attack in Oklahoma by a man who called him a 'dirty Jew.' The victim was taken to the hospital suffering from bruises and a cerebral hemorrhage. The apparent antisemitic incident happened in Norman, Oklahoma when Harrison Hipp and his girlfriend passed by a pizza shop. A stranger approached Hipp and askedif he could try on his cowboy hat for a moment. 'I said, ‘No, this is my hat, you know, sorry,’ and I was polite about it,' Hipp told local media. According to him, at this point the man and his friends became aggressive. 'I take off the hat and yarmulke and I start running and then he chases me and he says, ‘I’m going to get you, you dirty Jew.’ and I’m like panicking at this point because I know I’m going to get jumped,' said Hipp. He added that the attackers stole his hat and kippa and slammed his head against the concrete multiple times. The woman who was with him tried to prevent the attack. 'I start trying to pull the original guy off of him and then I get thrown off of him and then a guy, grabs my arms and is like holding my arms, so I can’t do anything,' said Emily Rodriguez, Hipp’s girlfriend. Hipp said the attackers left him bleeding in the street. According to him, his next memory was when he woke up in the hospital. He now has a long road to recovery, having been diagnosed with a concussion and brain bleed. 'I’m real messed up, I can’t go to work, I can’t function and for what? You know, I don’t know, just because I’m Jewish? It’s ridiculous,' said Hipp. The victim believes that this is a hate crime and that he was attacked because he is Jewish. 'Everybody that attacked me called me a dirty Jew, so I would like them all to be charged with hate crime,' said Hipp. Officers from the Norman Police Department met Hipp at the hospital. The police said that so far no arrests have been made, though a possible suspect has been identified and all facts including allegations of a possible hate crime are part of the ongoing investigation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkll25u6r	2024-09-18T11:46:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/HJHplIDpR/HJHplIDpR_0_9_974_549_0_small.jpg

Gallant says 'new phase in war' as Netanyahu vows to return north...	Comments come hours after the explosions of Hezbollah-distributed walkie talkies in Lebanon, which killed at least nine people and injured at least 300 Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that Israel 'is on the verge of a new phase in the war. This is not Hamas — we’re dealing with something different, and we need to prepare accordingly.' At the same time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi discussed the movement of the war to the north. The comments of the three leaders came hours after the explosions of Hezbollah-distributed walkie talkies in Lebanon, which killed at least nine people and injured at least 300, and a day after thousands were injured in the explosion of Hezbollah-distributed pagers. During a visit to the Ramat David Air Force, Gallant addressed the escalating tensions on the northern border with Lebanon. Without directly referencing the recent explosion of beepers and communication devices, he said, 'The center of gravity is moving north. We are diverting forces, resources, and energy toward the north. We are entering a new phase of the war – one that demands courage, determination, and perseverance.' ''We have not forgotten the hostages and we have not forgotten our tasks in the south. This is our duty and we are performing it at the same time. This operation involves all branches, and the mission is clear and simple: to bring the residents of northern communities back to their homes in safety,' Gallant emphasized. He highlighted the IDF's successes, saying, 'When you look at the current situation, the IDF is achieving excellent results, working in tandem with the Shin Bet, Mossad, and all relevant bodies. The outcomes are highly impressive. There is full coordination across the system, and unity in pursuing our goals between the prime minister, the chief of staff, the head of the Shin Bet, the head of Mossad, and myself. Everything is dedicated to one objective: bringing the residents of the north back home.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a short message on Wednesday evening: 'I already said - we will return the residents of the north safely to their homes. And that's exactly what we'll do.' Shortly after his announcement, the prime minister's motorcade was spotted near Mossad headquarte IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Herzi Halevi, held a simultaneous situational assessment in the Northern Command with the members of the General Staff Forum, and confirmed the attack and defense plans for the northern arena. 'We are very determined to create the security conditions that will return the residents to their homes, to the communities, with a high level of security, and we are ready to do all that is required to bring about these things. Throughout the war for almost a year, we have been fighting in Gaza with two main goals, as well as others - dismantling Hamas and returning the hostages. We have achieved a lot, and we still have further forward to go,' he said. 'We still have many capabilities that we have not yet activated. We saw some of these things here, and it seems to me that the readiness is good and we are preparing these plans going forward. The rule is that every time we work on a certain stage, the next two stages are already ready to advance. At each stage, the price for Hezbollah must be high.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1svmcoar	2024-09-18T11:04:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/Hy5O5dOpR/Hy5O5dOpR_0_99_1280_720_0_small.jpg
These are stories of the soldiers killed in Rafah	Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff was doing everything to bring the hostages back; Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri did everything he could to transfer to a combat unit; Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon was wounded by shrapnel, and after two days, he went back to the fight; paramedic Staff Sgt. Agam Naim is the first woman soldier killed in Gaza Since the war began on October 7, 713 IDF soldiers have been during the Gaza operation; four of them –Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff, 23, from Moreshet, Staff Sgt. Agam Naim, 20, from Mishmarot, Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri, 21, from Yoshevia, and Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon, 21, from Elazar – died Tuesday when a building exploded in Rafah in southern Gaza. As part of the 401st Armored Brigade operation, soldiers were conducting searches for weapons in a building in the Tel Sultan neighborhood. For reasons still under investigation, a deadly explosion occurred. A helicopter evacuated the wounded, including five soldiers in serious condition and two others in moderate condition, to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva. Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff was the deputy company commander in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. He had taken over the role from Lt. Yaron Eliezer Chitiz, 23, of Ra’anana, who was killed in December during a battle in northern Gaza. Daniel’s father, Shlomo Toaff, an executive at Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, told Army Radio that'Daniel had been in Gaza since day one. He never complained. When we asked, ‘Is everything okay?’ he’d just say, ‘Yes, Dad, everything’s fine.’' 'Pure-hearted children who gave everything for Israel' Shlomo shared how Daniel, an avid mountain biker, had studied at a religious high school in Sde Yaakov and spent two years at the Bnei David pre-military academy before joining the IDF. 'He was supposed to attend a company commander course in three months, and we had hoped we would finally have peace. Well, now we have peace,' Shlomo said, noting that one of his other sons serves in the reserves and his daughter is an intelligence officer. 'We deeply believe in doing everything for the people of Israel, and Daniel gave everything,' Shlomo said. 'Last night, we went to a café, came home, and my wife, Orit, went to her sports class. I stayed home. At 8:30 p.m., there was a knock on the door, and I opened it to see three good people standing there. I knew something had happened.' He recalled videos Daniel had sent of his unit in action, saying: 'If there's anything that gives hope to the people of Israel, it's these incredible children.' Staff Sgt. Agam Naim, a paramedic in the 52nd Battalion of the Iron Tracks Formation (401st Armored Brigade), was the first female soldier killed in the ground offensive in Gaza. Her cousin, Yaron, eulogized her: 'You promised you’d take care of yourself, but you always reminded us that if it wasn’t you, there would be no one to do your job, no one to protect and care for the soldiers. You were my hero, a true hero.' Agam’s aunt, Mariel, added: 'She spent the last six months in Gaza. Her father is a bereaved brother, so he worried even more. She didn’t have to go, but she insisted. She was the most beautiful, joyful, talented person. She volunteered with Magen David Adom, spent a year in service working with post-hospitalized youth. Last weekend, she was sick and stayed home. Her commander told her she didn’t need to return, but she went back to Gaza anyway.' Agam’s mother, Dorit, had written about her daughter’s complex service in recent months, sharing how proud they were when Agam was selected for the paramedic course. 'She finished the course with honors and was immediately attached to the Armored Corps,' Dorit wrote. 'Two days later, she was already in Gaza with the engineering corps. We stopped breathing; our lives changed. I discovered anxiety attacks I hadn’t known before.' In a later post, Dorit described her reaction to hearing of other casualties in the war: 'Agam called me and said, ‘Mom, do you see? It could happen anywhere.’ Yes, it feels like losing control, like being stuck in a tunnel with no end. Just last week, she treated severely wounded soldiers. What kind of child will I get back at the end of this war?' Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri was a combat operative in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. His sister, Noa, shared: 'He enlisted in the Military Police as an investigator. But when the war broke out, he couldn’t stay in that role. Despite his medical profile, he did everything he could to transfer to a combat unit. Amit was unstoppable when he set his mind to something.' Noa recalled that, just last week, Amit was home when he was called back to Gaza. 'He’d been injured three weeks ago by an anti-tank missile, but even after being treated at Soroka Medical Center, he returned to his unit immediately. He said, ‘There’s no way my team stays there while I’m here.’ He was all-in for the war.' Amit had spoken to his family after being allowed to use his phone. 'He wasn’t too worried about himself, but he mentioned the anti-tank missile incident was scary.' Noa added, 'He was supposed to come home in two weeks.' Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon, also a combat operative in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade, lost his sister Nofar, 17, in a car accident in 2013. His brother Guy, the only surviving son in the family, said: 'Dotan was the most perfect person you could imagine. He had a radiant smile, and was incredibly handsome, with a heart of gold. He was the best brother anyone could ask for.' Guy recounted Dotan’s journey in the IDF, where he had completed a course for commander trainees. 'His company commander wanted him to stay on, so he was assigned as a team leader. He’d been in Gaza for over a month when he was lightly wounded by shrapnel a few weeks ago. But after two days, he went back to the fight.' Guy said the family never considered that Dotan might not come home. 'There was concern, but we had become accustomed to the situation. It wasn’t like the beginning of the war. I believe our parents worried more, but I felt safer. Now, I’m the only son left for my parents.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qnj00utc	2024-09-18T10:46:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/ByKec6vpA/ByKec6vpA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Germany has stopped approving war weapons exports to Israel	Germany has put a hold on new exports of weapons of war to Israel while it deals with legal challenges, according to a Reuters analysis of data and a source close to the Economy Ministry. Last year, Germany approved arms exports to Israel worth 326.5 million euros ($363.5 million), including military equipment and war weapons, a 10-fold increase from 2022, according to data from the Economy Ministry, which approves export licenses. However approvals have dropped this year, with only 14.5 million euros' worth granted from January to Aug. 21, according to data provided by the Economy Ministry in response to a parliamentary question. Of this, the 'weapons of war' category accounted for only 32,449 euros. A source close to the ministry cited a senior government official as saying it had stopped work on approving export licenses for arms to Israel pending a resolution of legal cases arguing that such exports from Germany breached humanitarian law. The government has said no weapons of war have been exported under any license issued since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, apart from spares for long-term contracts, the source added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjnrhy006a	2024-09-18T10:23:46-07:00

Jewish US Senator Bernie Sanders bids to halt some weapons sales ...	U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday he would file legislation seeking to block the sale of offensive U.S. weapons to Israel, citing the toll on civilians of Israel's campaign against Hamas. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he intended to file Joint Resolutions of Disapproval next week. The U.S. Arms Export Control Act gives Congress the right to stop a major foreign weapons sale by passing a resolution of disapproval. 'Providing more offensive weapons to continue this disastrous war would violate U.S. and international law,' Sanders said in a statement. President Joe Biden has faced calls from his fellow Democrats throughout Israel's campaign in Gaza to press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to ease the devastating humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave. In his announcement, Sanders noted that the Biden administration last month approved arms sales to Israel totaling more than $20 billion that included systems tied to tens of thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza. He said exporting such weapons would violate human rights provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Arms Export Control Act.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdgjk006a	2024-09-18T10:18:35-07:00

UN approves proposal for arms embargo on Israel	Palestinian proposal, which calls, among other things, to 'return the Palestinians to their land' and to enforce sanctions on senior Israeli officials, was passed by a large majority in the UN General Assembly, while 43 countries abstained. Ambassador Danon: 'Voting in favor of this resolution adds fuel for further violence' The UN General Assembly on Wednesday evening approved a Palestinian proposal that requires Israel to implement the decisions of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which calls, among other things, for the end of the Israeli presence 'in the Occupied Palestinian Territory' within six months, the withdrawal of the IDF from there, the cessation of 'settlements' and 'the return of the Palestinians to their land.' The proposal also includes a call to countries not to legally recognize Israel's presence 'in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,' in addition to enforcing sanctions on senior Israeli officials, end the transfer of weapons to Israel if it is suspected that they will be used in those territories, and avoiding the establishment of diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. Some 124 countries supported the proposal, 14 opposed and 43 abstained. Along with Israel, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Fiji, Hungary, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, Tuvalu and the United States also opposed the proposal. Among those that abstained were Germany, Ukraine, Great Britain, Canada, India and 38 other countries. Greece, Cyprus and France surprised - and disappointed - when they voted in favor of the resolution. The vote means that monitoring and control mechanisms of the UN will be established to implement the decision of the court in The Hague regarding the withdrawal of Israel from the territories. The decision will harm Israel's image in the world and will give fuel to organizations and countries to pass their own resolutions against Israel. The call for an arms embargo and the imposition of sanctions against Israel could work to convince countries to act on this decision and stop arms sales to the country. Greece's ambassador to the UN, Evangelos C.Sekeris, said after the vote that 'Israel has a right to security and self-defense. The current decision does not concern the need to hold direct negotiations on the two-state solution. However, Greece decided to support the vote. This is due to its broad support for international law and the International Court of Justice, which must be defended even if there are differences of opinion. We call for a political process to advance the two-state solution.' A political official said in response that 'Greece and Cyprus have disappointed badly. We will demand clarifications.' The vote of the two countries in support of the proposal came as a surprise, especially since Israel supplies weapons to Greece and Cyprus. British Ambassador Barbara Woodward said that 'Britain abstained from today's proposal. Britain did so because the decision does not provide sufficient clarity to advance the common goal of peace based on a two-state solution to be achieved through negotiations. We are committed to the rule of law and respect the court and call on the countries to unite behind the renewed efforts toward an agreed solution in accordance with international law.' She added that 'Israel needs to end its presence in the territories as quickly as possible and create the conditions for the establishment of a free Palestine alongside a safe and free Israel - while recognizing the security and self-determination needs of each side. The unification of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza must also be brought about according to the 1967 borders We condemn the settlers' violence in the West Bank to pressure Palestinian communities to leave their land, and call on Israel to prosecute those responsible.' Before the vote, the diplomatic community held an event of solidarity with the families of hostages, and the ambassador of South Sudan attacked the ambassador of Norway and representatives of other countries: 'You should be ashamed of yourselves. To sit in front of the families of hostages on the day you vote against Israel at the UN.' He called on the representatives to leave the event and 'Run' to call their prime ministers, 'beg them to change their vote,' he said. 'Each country has a vote, and the world is watching us,' Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the General Assembly on Tuesday. 'Please stand on the right side of history. With international law. With freedom. With peace.' He also called on the UN and the member states to implement their responsibilities under international law. In his speech, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, attacked what he called the hypocrisy and bias of the United Nations against Israel, which since the October 7 massacre passed two resolutions in the General Assembly that ignored Hamas and its responsibility for the events of that day. 'Anyone who supports this circus is a collaborator. Anyone who votes in favor of this proposal fuels further violence. This show is an insult to the victims of the massacre, it is an insult to the hostages,' he said. In his speech, Danon presented a photo of the tunnel where the six murdered hostages were held, showing their blood spilled on the floor: 'Eden, Hirsh, Alex, Carmel Uri and Almog. These are their names. Six innocent Israelis were murdered in cold blood after months of suffering in the tunnels. Imagine how you would feel if it was your child, your partner or your friend. Would you be silent even then? I tell you clearly: Jewish blood is not worthless. The days when Jewish blood was spilled without any response are over.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj11ja00da0	2024-09-18T09:45:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/ryxkrWdda0/ryxkrWdda0_0_421_961_540_0_small.jpg

The pager devices used in mass detonations in Lebanon were never in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government said in a statement on Wednesday. Taiwanese pager firm Gold Apollo said on Wednesday the model of pagers used in the attack against Hezbollah were made by Budapest-based BAC Consulting, , adding it had only licensed its brand to the company and was not involved in the production of the devices. 'Hungarian authorities have established that the company in question is a trading-intermediary company, which has no manufacturing or other site of operation in Hungary,' government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said on Facebook.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjhl9ooac	2024-09-18T09:04:27-07:00

The pager operation's goal was 'deterrence' of Hezbollah	Security officials postpone music show following pager operation in Lebanon: 'Never in any country have they hit so many terrorists in a minute, deterrence is stronger' Security officials on Wednesday said that 'The strategic purpose was deterrence' - referring to the pager operation in Lebanon, resulting in thousands of wounded Hezbollah operatives, which is attributed to Israel. According to a source, 'Never, and in any country, have so many terrorists been hit in one minute. This is about 4,000 targeted assassinations. If we wanted to kill them, we could, but deterrence is stronger.' According to the sources, 'this is not the last move and there will be more.' and, in fact, on Wednesday afternoon, over 100 people were injured when walkie talkies exploded across Lebanon. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed for offensive operations in the north, and a security source has said he did so despite opposition from the IDF and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's reservations. On Saturday night, Netanyahu convened an emergency discussion due to operational circumstances. Foreign sources reported that Hezbollah began to suspect the beepers and therefore there was an urgent need for execution. The Prime Minister's Office denied reports concerning the recent discussions. At the same time, the IDF instructed the Mateh Asher Regional Council to postpone popular Israeli sinter Hanan Ben Ari's concert that was scheduled for Thursday at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot's amphitheater with an audience of 4,300 people. Following the escalation, President Isaac Herzog hosted Prime Minister Netanyahu for an unusual briefing. Following the pager blasts in Lebanon, the IDF is on high alert. The 98th Division, considered one of the elite IDF units which includes the commando and the paratrooper unit, left the Gaza Strip and went up to the northern border. Their shift may hint at the expansion of war against Hezbollah. Moving the 98th Division to the north and leaving the 162nd Division and the 252nd Division proved that the IDF is shifting its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Since Tuesday, the Chief of Staff has been conducting a continuous situation assessment concerning what is happening in the north, and so far the IDF has not issued new guidelines. Lebanese residents were shocked by the explosions of the pagers. AFP quoted a man from Dahiyeh in Beirut who said he has never seen a person walking down the street and explode. A Lebanese engineer who lives in the U.S. and is visiting Beirut, said he was not surprised by what happened because 'wars are dirty.' He added that the war of attrition between Israel and Hezbollah would take time. Abu Jawad Hamda, a resident of Beirut, promised that there would be a response from Hezbollah. 'We will respond, we need to teach them a lesson they won't forget because these people won't stop,' he said. Meanwhile, new details regarding the operation are beginning to surface. A Taiwanese company allegedly sold thousands of pagers to the terror organization but deny making any adjustments to the product. The Taiwanese company said that the AR-924 type device is manufactured and sold by a Hungary-based company called BAC. The president of the Taiwanese company, 'Gold Apollo,' noted that there were problems with the company's payments in the past. He said they came through the Middle East. Taiwan's Economy Minister said the pager manufacturer claimed they must have undergone 'adjustments' after they were shipped. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sknikpd6r	2024-09-18T08:56:44-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/SJcRgwupA/SJcRgwupA_1_418_900_507_0_small.jpg

New attack across Lebanon: 14 killed and at least 450 injured, fi...	A day after thousands of pagers exploded, hand-held radios used by Hezbollah blow up across Lebanon; The walkie talkies were purchased by Hezbollah around the same time as the pagers A day after the unprecedented operation in which thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon, explosions again are heard in Beirut and in other areas across Lebanon. According to reports from Lebanon, late on Wednesday afternoon hand-held radios or walkie-talkies exploded in several areas of Beirut and southern and eastern Lebanon. At least 14 people were killed and 450 were reported injured in the explosions of the devices, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Many of the injured were hit in the stomach and hands. According to the reports, there are casualties in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, and in Saida in southern Lebanon and Baalbeck in eastern Lebanon. The explosions occurred in many houses, as well as in vehicles, according to local reports. A security official told the Reuters news agency that the hand-held radios that exploded Wednesday are different from the pagers that exploded on Tuesday. The radios were purchased by Hezbollah about five months ago, around the same time as the pagers, a security source told Reuters. Al Jazeera reported that the devices that exploded were the icom f82 model. A security official told CNN that according to the initial tests, there were between 15 and 20 explosions in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, and a similar number in southern Lebanon. According to him, the walkie-talkies were less used than the pagers that exploded Tuesday. The Lebanese National News Agency reported that solar energy systems exploded in several houses in southern Lebanon, at the same time as the explosion of the walkie talkies in large areas of the country. According to Sky News in Arabic, the explosions happened at the same time as the funeral of the son of Hezbollah parliament member, Ali Amar, in Dahiyeh; footage taken at the funeral show panic at the moment of the explosion. Sources told the Voice of the Capitol news website, which is affiliated with the Syrian opposition, that 'high frequency waves were sent that caused equipment and broadcasting stations to explode.' The Voice of the Capital also reported that the Syrian regime also called on all security forces and military units to turn off wireless devices, disconnect switchboards and use wired communication. Top Hezbollah official Hashem Safeiddine on Wednesday afternoon said that the group is entering a 'new phase' in the conflict with Israel and that 'punishment is certainly coming.' Also on Wednesday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the pager blasts targeting Hezbollah indicate 'a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon and everything must be done to avoid that escalation.' 'Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation,' he told reporters. Sky News correspondent Alex Crawford was at a funeral in Beirut for four people killed in Tuesday's attacks. She described the 'small sound of something popping' when the explosions occured. 'We came out to try and found out what the sound was and people were running. People were covered in blood,' she says. 'There was blood on a car.' She also reported that Hezbollah operatives collected the devices of funeral-goers and took the batteries out of them >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rymn1wda0	2024-09-18T07:19:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/r1ZoKkDupC/r1ZoKkDupC_181_5_935_526_0_small.jpg

Finland's president defends decisions to buy Israeli arms, not re...	Finland's President Alexander Stubb defended his country's decision to buy arms from Israel despite the war in Gaza, saying it had no link to Finland's unwillingness to recognize an independent Palestinian state at the present time. Finland is acquiring a ground based, high altitude, missile defense system called David's Sling from Israel. Helsinki considers the system a high priority for its own defense due to neighboring Russia's ongoing missile attacks on civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland's new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism,' which he has said was about 'achieving things in the world as it is,' instead of 'promoting only the world how I want to see it.' In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Stubb said the time was not right to recognize a Palestinian state, even though its Nordic neighbors, Sweden, Iceland, and most recently Norway, have done so.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rja2s8opa	2024-09-18T06:31:07-07:00
