Iran gave Russia missiles but no launchers, sources say	European and U.S. officials say reason behind lack of equipment raises questions about when and if the weapons will be operational Iran did not include mobile launchers with the close-range ballistic missiles that Washington last week accused Tehran of delivering to Russia for use against Ukraine, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. The sources - a European diplomat, a European intelligence official and a U.S. official - said it was not clear why Iran did not supply launchers with the Fath-360 missiles, raising questions about when and if the weapons will be operational. The U.S. official, who like the other sources spoke on condition of anonymity, said Iran had not delivered the launchers at the time of the U.S. announcement about Iran's delivery of the weapons. The European intelligence official said without elaborating that they did not expect Iran to provide launchers. Reuters first reported Iran's plan to send the missiles to Russia. Two experts told Reuters there could be several reasons why the launchers were not sent. One is that Russia may plan to modify trucks to carry the missiles, as Iran has done. Another is that by withholding the launchers, Iran is allowing space for new talks with Western powers on easing tensions. The Russian defense ministry declined to comment. The U.S. National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Pentagon declined to comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tehran denies providing Moscow with the missiles or with thousands of drones that Kyiv and Western officials have said Russia uses against military targets and to destroy civilian infrastructure, including Ukraine’s electrical grid. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sept. 10 that Iran had delivered the Fath-360s to Russia and would 'likely use them within weeks in Ukraine.' The missile would pose an additional challenge for Ukraine, which is constantly adapting its air defenses to innovations by Russian forces. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency says the missile travels at four times the speed of sound when approaching targets. Blinken said the missiles threatened European security and would be fired against short-range targets, allowing Russia to reserve more of its extensive arsenal for targets beyond the front lines. The Fath-360 has a range of up to 75 miles (121 km). The United States, Germany, Britain and France imposed new sanctions on Iran, and the EU said the bloc was considering fresh measures targeting Iran's aviation sector. The Kremlin at that time declined to confirm its receipt of the missiles but acknowledged that its cooperation with Iran included 'the most sensitive areas.' Blinken did not say how many Fath-360s Iran supplied to Russia or when they were sent. Reuters determined through shipping data that a Russian freighter sanctioned by Washington, the Port Olya-3, made voyages between Iran’s Caspian Sea port of Amirabad and the Russian port of Olya several times between May and Sept. 12. Fabian Hinz, an expert on Iranian missiles with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said he could not confirm that Tehran withheld the launchers. Ballistic missiles require specifically designed launchers in order to be fired. According to Hinz, one reason Iran didn't send launchers may be that the civilian trucks that Iran modified to launch these and other missiles are not robust enough to operate in rough terrain during Ukraine's harsh winter. Iran modifies trucks made by Mercedes and other companies and turns them into easily disguised missile launchers, he said. That suggests, he continued, that Russia could modify its own military-grade vehicles. 'A commercial, off-the-shelf Mercedes truck is just not that off-road capable,' he said David Albright, a former UN nuclear inspector who heads the Institute for Science and International Security, also could not say whether Iran delivered the launchers. But he noted that Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and other Iranian officials will be meeting with European officials on the sidelines of next week’s UN General Assembly in New York to test the potential for diplomacy on Tehran’s nuclear program, regional tensions and other disputes. 'It could be that they (Iran) are holding back the launchers to provide a little space for these talks,' he said. 'One can imagine that if there are Iranian missiles raining down (on Ukraine) there would be condemnation at the General Assembly.' But he was skeptical of any progress, saying he doubted Iran would make the necessary compromises. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1rj00jh60	2024-09-21T13:31:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/06/ryBjTCunC/ryBjTCunC_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF reports eliminated terrorists holding six slain hostages	Military confirms two Hamas terrorists who held six hostages in Gaza were eliminated by forces based on gathered DNA evidence from scene IDF Spokesperson RADM Daniel Hagari reported on Saturday that forces have eliminated two Hamas terrorists who held the six hostages murdered in captivity in Gaza — Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Uri Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov — in a tunnel near Rafah. 'This evening, we updated the families of Hersh, Eden, Ori, Alex, Almog, and Carmel, may their memories be a blessing, that we eliminated two terrorists who had held them hostage in a tunnel in the Rafah area,' Hagari said. 'The day after the hostages were murdered, troops from the 162nd Division identified two terrorists emerging from an underground tunnel shaft in the Tel al-Sultan area and eliminated them during an encounter. After investigating the findings from the tunnel and equipment on the terrorists, we found DNA evidence and several items belonging to the terrorists we eliminated,' he added. 'Based on the findings and the information available to us, these terrorists that were eliminated were the same terrorists who were in the tunnel where the bodies of the six hostages were discovered. The findings show they were there when they were murdered and we are investigating their involvement in the murder. 'Should we obtain further information, we will first update the families and then the public. We will pursue and reach everyone responsible for this heinous murder, and we will not stop until we reach them all,' Hagari noted. Liel Avraham, Uri Danino’s partner, said, 'We had no doubt that the IDF would hold the murderers accountable. This closure doesn’t bring satisfaction or comfort. They were supposed to come back alive. Their elimination is a moral and obvious duty.' The bodies of the six were found on August 31. According to the IDF investigation, Hamas lookouts noticed soldiers approaching the tunnel and ordered the terrorists to murder the six hostages a day or two before their deaths. The terrorists shot the hostages at close range. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjvuv9htc	2024-09-21T12:15:55-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/BJPtSY3T0/BJPtSY3T0_314_303_1050_591_0_small.jpg

IDF prepares for Hezbollah retaliation as soon as Sunday	Military leadership says Israel entering 'tense 24 hours' after estimations Hezbollah will attack Israel with significant force following eliminations of senior commanders; Home Front Command updates guidelines including in Haifa Israel is on high alert, as evidenced by a video released by the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Saturday showing Israeli Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar said forces are at 'the highest level of readiness.' Estimations in Jerusalem say Hezbollah will retaliate following the elimination of its senior commanders and hundreds of operatives in Lebanon as soon as Sunday. Israeli Air Force fighter jets eliminated thousands of Hezbollah munition launchers across southern Lebanon earlier on Saturday, strengthening officials’ estimations a major attack is set to take place against Israel. Security sources estimate that an attack may take place within the next 24 hours, warning that 'we're entering a tense 24 hours.' IDF Home Front Command guidelines in the north are also expected to change on Saturday. 'The changes are relevant for the following areas: the Lower Galilee, the Upper Galilee, the Haifa Bay, the Central Galilee, and some of the communities in the southern Golan Heights (Emek Hayarden) in accordance with the situational assessment,' the IDF Spokesperson's Unit said in a statement. The coming days are expected to significantly shape the trajectory of the conflict with Hezbollah and determine its potential expansion to an all-out war. Israel believes Hezbollah will escalate the scope of its attacks in the next 24 hours and could possibly use even harsher measures following so. On the other hand, the IDF has taken a different approach in the north in recent days. Israel has been eliminating Hezbollah’s short- and medium-range rocket launchers in its waves of strikes. These strikes aim to diminish Hezbollah's ability to retaliate against Israel but also serve as an opportunity to degrade the terror group’s overall operational capacity. Israel has developed an impressive intelligence capability against Hezbollah since the Second Lebanon War in 2006. Billions of shekels have been invested in these capabilities and Israel is now reaping the benefits. The northern front has been recently prioritized over progress in Gaza due to the more significant threat posed by Hezbollah. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjn2zt260	2024-09-21T10:48:49-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/ByZOdaunaR/ByZOdaunaR_0_524_486_274_0_small.jpg

Admiration' and 'anxiety': U.S. officials' shocked response to p...	While U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan commended pager attack attributed to Israel, other White House officials fear escalation behind U.S.'s back could launch all-out war in the Middle East The world and specifically the U.S. were impressed with Israel’s intelligence capabilities after the pager detonations in Lebanon and Syria attributed to it injured hundreds of Hezbollah terrorists and senior Radwan Force operatives in precise airstrikes. However, these developments reignited worries about an all-out war taking place in the Middle East. While the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the eliminations in Beirut were a 'good result', others in U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration think otherwise. Researcher Lina Khatib told the New York Times that the last week marked the end of '18 years of mutual deterrence,' between Israel and Hezbollah, during which both sides refrained from actions that could lead to war. She noted that this balance has now been replaced by 'a new phase of unilateral Israeli dominance.' According to the Washington Post, Israel didn’t inform the U.S. in advance about the attack involving the pagers and walkie-talkies attributed to it. 'Privately,' it was reported, 'some of them [U.S. officials] had expressed a range of responses, from 'awestruck admiration' that Israel’s could pull off such an ‘ingenious plan,' to 'anxiety' that the brazen operation risks provoking a wide regional war.' Reuters reported that Hezbollah began distributing the pagers to its members starting in 2022, continuing until just days ago. At least one device exploded while still in the mailbox of the terrorist to whom it was addressed. Each device contained 'up to 3 grams' of explosives which Hezbollah failed to detect for months, despite testing the devices upon their arrival. As part of its inspections, Hezbollah even passed the devices through airport security to ensure they didn’t trigger explosive alerts. However, a security source told Reuters that 'it's very hard to detect it through any means. Even with any device or scanner.' Former CIA officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who served in counterterrorism roles in the Middle East, told the Washington Post the operation was ' the most impressive kinetic operation I can recall in my career. Israeli intelligence is living in [Hasan] Nasrallah’s brain.' A senior Biden administration official noted that while the White House was impressed by the Israeli operation, it still doesn't fully understand Israel’s broader strategy in Lebanon. According to the Washington Post, some expressed frustration that 'Israel acted against the backdrop of months of painstaking U.S. efforts to secure a cease-fire in Gaza, which would have also led to the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian aid to the Strip.' The Washington Post added that American officials 'expressed frustration,' the U.S. and its allies had worked to reduce tensions in Lebanon for nearly a year before the operation. They pointed out that, up until now, Hezbollah’s attacks on Israel, though deadly, had been 'sporadic.' Now, the conflict could escalate into a broader war, according to the officials. ' The U.S. will have to decide how much they want to do to help Israel, and I don’t know what the answer to that is,' an American advisor told the Washington Post. 'They’ll likely continue to supply Israel with whatever it needs to defend itself, but there are serious voices in the administration who wonder, ‘Israel did this to themselves — why should we help them?' he added. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who praised Ibrahim Aqil’s elimination in Lebanon, also warned of an 'acute risk of escalation' on the Israel-Lebanon border. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hksloon60	2024-09-21T10:14:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/S1elXw26R/S1elXw26R_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF strikes 180 targets in southern Lebanon, dismantles launchers	Military reports Israeli Air Force strikes in southern Lebanon hit 180 targets in the area and eliminate capabilities of thousands of munition launchers The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Saturday reported that a number of strikes in Lebanon managed to hit over 180 targets and dismantle thousands of munition launchers throughout the country's south. 'Following the sirens that sounded throughout the past day in the areas of the Upper Galilee, Golan Heights and Safed area, approximately 90 projectile launches were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,' the military said in a statement. The IDF added that 'the IAF struck thousands of launcher barrels that were ready for immediate use to fire toward Israeli territory. Additionally, IDF artillery struck a number of areas in southern Lebanon. The IDF will continue operating to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah's capabilities and terror infrastructure.' In addition, the military said Israeli Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar held a situation assessment with senior commanders following development across the northern border. 'We continue to keep the Air Force at the highest level of readiness especially in defense, and it has been going on for a while,' Maj. Gen. Bar said during the briefing.

IDF reveals names of Radwan commanders killed in Beirut strikes	Military publishes names of senior Hezbollah military chiefs following series of strikes aiming to weaken terror group; these are the senior figures still alive and active The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Saturday released the names of senior commanders of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force who were eliminated on Friday following airstrikes in Beirut’s Dahieh neighborhood. According to the military, Ibrahim Aqil, head of operations and commander of the Radwan Force is the most senior figure eliminated in the latest series of strikes. 'As well as Aqil, 15 other Hezbollah terrorists were eliminated in the strike, including senior commanders in the Radwan Force chain of command,' the IDF said in a statement on Saturday. 'Among the terrorists eliminated, was Abu Hassan Samir, who served as the head of the Radwan Force training unit. He held various positions within the terrorist organization and was commander of the Radwan Force for a decade until early 2024. 'He was one of the planners and leaders of the 'Conquer the Galilee' attack plan and was involved in advancing Hezbollah's entrenchment in southern Lebanon while attempting to improve the organization's ground combat capabilities. Over the years, and during the first months of the war, he planned and executed numerous shooting attacks and infiltrations into Israeli territory,' the statement added. According to the IDF, other senior Hezbollah commanders killed in the strikes included: Samer Abdul-Halim Halawi, commander of the coastal area. Abbas Sami Maslamani, commander of the Qana area. Abdullah Abbas Hajazi, commander of the Ramim ridge area. Muhammed Ahmad Reda, commander of the Al-Khiam area. Hassan Hussein Madi, commander of the Mount Dov area. 'These commanders had been leading and planning the Radwan Force's attack and infiltration plan into Israeli territory for years, to be executed when given the order,' the military said. The IDF also confirmed that two other senior Hezbollah members, Hassan Yussef Abad Alssatar and Hussein Ahmad Dahraj, were eliminated in the operation. Alssatar was responsible for Radwan Force operations and advanced all the force's munitions operations while Dahraj acted as the Radwan Force’s chief of staff and was involved in the transfer of weapons and the terror group’s strength-building. 'Aqil and the commanders eliminated in the strike were responsible for planning, advancing, and executing hundreds of terrorist operations against Israel, including the planning of Hezbollah's murderous scheme to raid the communities of the Galilee,' the military said. Other of Hezbollah’s military officials remain alive, however. These include: Ali Karaki – A commander on the level of Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil, both of whom were assassinated. Karaki is responsible for Hezbollah's military operations in southern Lebanon, overseeing the terror group's geographical units in the area. Muhammad Haydar – Haydar was previously a member of the Lebanese parliament on behalf of Hezbollah. According to Lebanese outlet Al-Akhbar he managed the organization's networks outside Lebanon. Talal Hamiyah – Leads the terror group’s Unit 910, responsible for conducting Hezbollah's 'foreign operations' through cells around the world. This unit is in charge of planning, coordinating, and executing attacks outside Lebanon, particularly against Western targets. The U.S. designated Hamiyah as a wanted terrorist in 2012. Haytham Ali Tabatabai – A high-ranking, mysterious figure within Hezbollah. He was designated an international terrorist by the U.S. in 2016. According to reports, he’s a central military leader in Hezbollah and commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen. Abu Ali Rida – Commander of Hezbollah’s Badr Unit which oversees the region north of the Litani River up to the city of Sidon in Lebanon. Rida is the only remaining regional Hezbollah commander in the country’s south. Another senior military figure is Khuder Yusef Nader who commands Hezbollah’s Unit 900, which serves as Hezbollah’s secret police. Other high-ranking officials, both in Hezbollah's military and political leadership, also play a role in the organization's military decision-making. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk11fksh60	2024-09-21T07:07:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/BJrp5B2pC/BJrp5B2pC_0_0_1600_900_0_small.jpg

Palestinian woman with a false ID discovered working in elementar...	A concerned mother called the police upon seeing an unidentified woman working in sanitation in an elementary school in central Israel; Upon examination, it was discovered her ID was forged and she was carrying a large knife, prompting officers to congratulate the mother for her alertness in a very delicate situation Orly (a pseudonym) was on her balcony on Wednesday, overlooking the yard of the Menachem Begin Elementary School in the town of Hod Hasharon, where her daughter is in first grade. She noticed one of the cleaning staff holding a long knife and peeling fruit, which raised her suspicions. After making several calls, including to the police, it was revealed that the worker was a resident of Qalqilya pretending to be from Jerusalem. 'I happened to be at home today, sitting on my balcony that overlooks the school,' Orly explains. 'I'm very anxious. When my daughter needs to go to the bathroom, I ask someone to accompany her because the workers roam freely among the students. There are Arab cleaning workers, and when I saw one of them with a really large knife, I thought it was inappropriate in a school setting.' Concerned for the students, she called the parents' committee, but they did not take her concerns seriously. 'I called the school and told them it didn't make sense for the children to be on break while she was walking around with a knife. They told me it was being handled.' She then contacted the police: 'They arrived quickly, approached the worker, and she became very upset, acting out in front of the children and hitting herself on the head. I saw them shouting at her because of her behavior, and the officer handcuffed her hands and feet and took her away.' She added, 'Later, the officer called me and said, 'Thank you very much, you saved several children. She was an infiltrator pretending, and no one checked her. She lives in Qalqilya.' There was panic at the school; they didn't understand where it came from. The children were very frightened, and the principal called to thank me for preventing a serious incident.' The police stated, 'A resident of Qalqilya was arrested on suspicion of impersonating a Jerusalem resident and working in cleaning at a school in Hod Hasharon. Officers arrived at the school this morning following a report about a suspicious cleaning worker. Station officers found that she was a resident of Qalqilya working without the appropriate permits, pretending to be from Jerusalem. The worker was taken to the station, and it will be decided if her detention will be extended based on the investigation's needs.' Hod Hasharon Mayor Amir Kochavi stated: 'Earlier today, following a resident's inquiry, sanitation workers at Begin School were interviewed. The investigation revealed that one worker's ID card was forged and that she is actually a resident of Qalqilya. Our preliminary inquiry indicates that she started yesterday as a replacement worker under the cleaning contractor. It seems there were several procedural violations, including the contractor not identifying the forged ID and failing to submit the worker for a check with the municipal security department as required. 'The municipality will conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine whether this was negligence or fraud and will act accordingly. The procedures for working with various contractors serving the municipality will be clarified, and surprise checks will be increased. We will continue coordinating with the police to ensure this deviation is addressed and to prevent it from recurring.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkyyh42tr	2024-09-21T05:18:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/By6Kd3dTA/By6Kd3dTA_0_119_960_541_0_small.jpg

UK overhauls tourist entry rules	Beginning January 8, anyone who wishes to visit the United Kingdom would have to register ahead of time in a specialized digital system and pay £50 per person; 'Digitization allows for a seamless experience for the millions crossing the border annually,' says senior official Beginning January 8, 2025, tourists from around the globe, including those from Israel, will need to complete a pre-entry application via a new electronic system to enter the United Kingdom. This requirement involves a fee of £10, roughly 50 shekels per person. The new system, known as the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA), will replace the existing procedure. As stated on the UK government's website, 'Anyone wishing to visit the UK – except British and Irish citizens – must register in advance,' with comprehensive guidance available online. The ETA will be valid for two years, permitting multiple entries into the UK and stays of up to six months per visit. Travelers are encouraged to submit their application at least 72 hours prior to their intended departure. Registration can be completed using the UK ETA app, which is available for both Android and Apple devices. Seema Malhotra, the UK's Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, remarked that 'digitization allows for a seamless experience for the millions crossing the border annually, including visitors we welcome to the UK, who are expected to contribute over £32 billion to our tourism economy this year.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rknthmnpa	2024-09-21T03:19:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/01/26/9745195/9745195_1_53_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Israel declares skies over Hadera northward as restricted airspac...	Given the swarms of Hezbollah UAV, rocket attacks and Israel's recent string of assassinations against their senior officers, Israel has decided to effectively shut down the skies from the city of Hadera all the way to the Lebanese border After a tumultuous week on the northern front, starting Saturday and lasting a full day, the skies from Hadera (A city about 30 miles north of Tel Aviv) northward were declared as restricted airspace. Head of air intelligence at the Civil Aviation Authority announced that 'due to security tensions, all infrastructures in the domestic space are closed to all types of aircraft' to facilitate Air Force operations. Ynet analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, interprets this airspace closure as yet another signal to Hezbollah: 'We are aware of your plans.' Facing the drone swarms from the Shiite terrorist organization, Israel's main defense lies in its F-35 jets, equipped with superior radar, and the F-16s for closer encounters. The closure of the airspace from Hadera northward suggests Hezbollah has not yet broken the rules nor decided to aim its launches toward the center of the country. Alternatively, this move might be intended to ensure flight safety due to fears of missiles targeting the northern region up to Hadera. The last similar announcement was made on June 19, though with more limited restrictions and airspace closure duration. Back then, it followed a day after Hezbollah released extraordinary footage from a drone dubbed 'Hudhud'—Hebrew for Hoopoe—that recorded nine and a half minutes of missile ships at Haifa port, surrounding neighborhoods, the 'BIG' shopping complex, a Rafael factory, and even tracked a moving vehicle. The organization's secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, threatened post-footage release to expand his organization's attack range within Israeli territory. 'We have long hours of footage of Haifa, what comes after Haifa, and after-after Haifa,' he declared. The activities permitted today in the northern airspace include air evacuation, police, and aerial firefighting; Haifa CTR; transport route (CVFR) along the coast to and from Haifa; international flights to and from Haifa. Additionally, the Megiddo airfield remains closed to activity, except for commercial flights that need to take off southward, subject to approval upon coordination. On Friday, IDF eliminated in Beirut the head of Hezbollah's operations system, Ibrahim Aqil, and along with him, the top of the operations system and the command chain of the Radwan Force, the organization's elite unit, were also neutralized. Less than a day later, newspapers across the Arab world, some serving as the mouthpiece of the Shiite terrorist organization, painted a grim picture with a clear message: Israel has 'exceeded the boundaries' previously set, and Hezbollah will respond with 'new and unexpected methods.' The death toll from the attack has risen to 31. On Tuesday, thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured in a beeper explosion, followed by hundreds more the next day in a walkie-talkie explosion. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared that Israel is at the brink of a 'new phase in the war,' and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi re-approved attack plans—as the north, amid high tension, braces for Hezbollah's retaliation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjsigfhpc	2024-09-21T02:37:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/16/rkl7FnC2cC/rkl7FnC2cC_405_147_1596_899_0_small.jpg
Israel and the Philippines, strategic interests and common values	October 7 Hamas attack have deepened Philippines-Israel ties, including Filipino President Marcos siding with Israel from the jump; Cooperation expands in defense, agriculture, and technology, despite Philippines' diverse internal opinions and ongoing regional security concerns with China When, on October 7, 2023, Hamas broke across the Israeli border to carry out massacres and kidnappings, Angelyn Aguirre, a 32-year-old Filipino caregiver, remained by side by side with the elderly woman she took care of in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Nira Ronen, with whom she tried unsuccessfully to hide in the vault of the house, before they were both killed by the terrorists. Aguirre, who had been married for just a year and had returned to Israel to work just a few days before the attack, is among 4 Filipino citizens who were killed by Hamas on October 7; two others were kidnapped and taken to Gaza, only to be released in November. There are about 30,000 Filipino workers living in Israel, mainly employed as caregivers and in the hotel sector. When, on August 9, the Israeli Embassy in the Philippines celebrated the 67th anniversary of relations between the two countries by planting trees in the courtyard of San Francisco High School in Quezon City, 4 trees were dedicated to each one of the victims. Since that tragic day, current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has strongly sided with Israel, unambiguously condemning Hamas. The relationship between Manila and Jerusalem is also dictated by common interests in the defense sector; The Philippine Air Force has recently purchased long-range patrol aircrafts from the Israeli company Elbit Systems, due to recent tensions with China in the South China Sea. While Israel Shipyards Industries recently sold two patrol ships equipped with missile launchers to the Philippine Navy. In order to better understand how relations between the two countries have evolved, we spoke with Filipino entrepreneur and economist Andrew James Masigan, a columnist for The Philippine Star daily newspaper and an advisor to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI). What were the relations between the Philippines and Israel before October 7? 'Relations have always been good. Since the Philippines is, besides East Timor, the only predominantly Catholic nation in Asia, we have always felt that we have a connection with the Jewish people. In the 1930s, under the leadership of then-President Manuel Quezon, our country welcomed about 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing Europe, when no other Asian country was willing to do so. Some of their descendants still live here. And when, in 1947, the Plan for the Partition of Palestine was put to a vote at the United Nations, the Philippines voted in favor of the birth of a Jewish State. The rest, as they say, is history; since 1957 we have had excellent diplomatic relations with Israel, which over time have turned into a real friendship.' How are Filipino politicians and public opinion aligned regarding the ongoing war? 'First of all, it is necessary to make a clarification; Since Israel is a geographically distant country, some sectors of the Filipino society are not really aware of the situation. Besides that, the Philippines is the only country in Southeast Asia to have openly declared its support for Israel. Not only politicians, but also society as a whole stands with Israel, and does not cultivate any feelings of hatred or anti-Jewish prejudice. 'Personally, I can testify to this solidarity with Israel also through my own experience; I have written several articles on the Israeli reaction after October 7 for the Philippine Star newspaper, one of the most widely read in the country, and every day I receive hundreds of emails from readers. Out of a hundred comments on my articles about Israel, I would say that only 4 or 5 are pro-Palestinian, while all the others are generally pro-Israel.' The Philippines is home to an important Muslim minority, particularly on the Mindanao island. How are they aligned on the subject compared to the Catholic majority? 'The Philippine archipelago is mainly composed of three main regions: the island of Luzon in the north, the Visayas Islands in the center, and Mindanao in the south. If Luzon and Visayas are predominantly Christian, in Mindanao the Muslim component is very present. And it is in Muslim areas that pro-Palestine demonstrations have taken place. But even there, it is not that much if compared to what can be seen in neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where anti-Jewish hatred and pro-Palestinian positions are evident. In the Philippines, Muslims are just 6% of the population, few compared to the 200 million Muslims in Indonesia, most of whom are lined up against Israel.' In an analysis published in May on the MEMRI website, you argued that the Philippines is trying to oppose Chinese expansionism in the Pacific Ocean. How much does this factor impact military cooperation with Israel? 'The Philippines has military cooperation agreements only with a small number of countries. Israel opened its own military exchange office in Manila in 2020, and has expanded its diplomatic network; in addition to the Embassy in Manila, it has also opened two consulates in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. 'Israel has been a major supplier of arms and ammunition to us for a long time. In the last period, due to the Chinese threat, relations have strengthened; the Israeli company Elbit Systems has provided us with patrol aircrafts, but apart from that Israel provides us with guns, bullets, military suits and helmets. In addition, we also cooperate with them in military training.' In addition to defense and the armed forces, in what other areas do you have a fruitful collaboration? 'We have many programs for technology exchanges, the most profitable of which is in the agricultural sector: every year, we send between 300 and 400 Filipinos to Israel to study their innovations in agriculture and bring them here. In addition, there are several active joint ventures, whereby Filipino companies cooperate with Israeli companies in the agricultural sector. 'To give an example, thanks to the use of Israeli technologies, Metro Pacific Agro Ventures Inc., one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines, is building what will be the largest dairy in the country and in all of Asia. It will be used to produce 6 million liters of milk per year, and the opening is scheduled for November. They have also invested one billion Philippine pesos (about 65.5 million shekels) to build a greenhouse where they can cultivate 1,600 tons of vegetables a year. 'Apart from agriculture, there are fruitful collaborations between Israel and the Philippines also in the IT sector, for the development of start-ups and new technologies. Overall, we have very good relations with Israel, although there are still areas for improvement.' What can be improved? 'Trade is not consistent for now, and even tourism between the two countries has not yet reached significant levels. Although, it must be said that negotiations are currently underway to implement tourist travel so that the Philippine Airlines can make direct flights to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Negotiations had stopped after 7 October, but have since resumed. 'In any case, when one of the two countries needs help, the other is there: to give an example, Mashav, the international agency for cooperation and development of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gives the Philippines the status of priority nation, the highest one. For this reason, there is cooperation in various areas between the two countries, for example when natural disasters occur: in these cases, Israel always sends us food aid, blood donations, professional doctors. And even during the Covid-19 pandemic, Israel allowed us to vaccinate tens of thousands of our compatriots.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkjjwz3pc	2024-09-21T01:51:49-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/22/BygcIuqzMT/BygcIuqzMT_0_169_558_315_0_small.jpg

A closer look on the 6 top Hezbollah commanders killed by Israel	Since the Gaza conflict began, IDF has eliminated six top Hezbollah operatives, including Fuad Shukr in Beirut; These strategic strikes have targeted key figures responsible for military operations and have significantly disrupted Hezbollah’s leadership and operational capabilities Since the onset of the Gaza conflict, IDF have successfully targeted numerous high-ranking members of Hezbollah, marking significant blows to the militant organization's capabilities. Over the past week, Israeli forces has employed advanced tactics including the detonation of beepers and communication devices across Lebanon. According to Hezbollah's official statements, 496 operatives have been killed so far, including several key leaders who served pivotal roles within the organization and linked it to the Shiite-Iranian axis. In a recent attack in Beirut, Ahmad Mahmoud Wahbi, a senior commander, along with Ibrahim Aqil, who led Hezbollah’s operations since 2004, were eliminated. Aqil, involved in various military initiatives like sabotage and air defense, was designated a terrorist by the U.S. in 2015 due to his involvement in global attacks. Known as the 'Commander of the Great Jihad,' Aqil was a potential successor to Hezbollah's Chief of Staff, Fuad Shukr, who was also killed earlier. Ahmad Mahmoud Wahbi, who bore the title 'The Martyr Commander,' was responsible for leading military operations against Israel and managed the central training unit for the Radwan Force. His elimination follows those of three other senior Hezbollah figures earlier in the conflict. The aforementioned Fuad Shukr, another high-profile target, was killed in the Dahiya district of Beirut. Known as 'Hezbollah's Chief of Staff,' he was integral to the strategic planning and execution of operations against Israel. His legacy includes orchestrating attacks against Israeli forces in the 1990s and involvement in the 2000 abduction of Israeli soldiers' remains. Among other notable eliminations is Muhammad Naama Nasser, additionally known as Hajj Abu Naama, who commanded the Aziz Unit in southern Lebanon. Nasser, who had a rank equivalent to brigadier general, was killed in a drone strike in July. His counterpart, Sami Taleb Abdallah, commander of Hezbollah's Nasr Unit, was similarly eliminated in June. Both were key figures in conducting terror operations against Israel. Earlier this year, Wissam Tuwail, reported to be a senior member of the elite Radwan Force, was killed in a drone strike. Tuwail played a central role in directing military operations in southern Lebanon and was considered a significant loss for Hezbollah. To date, at least six senior Hezbollah operatives have been eliminated since the conflict began, with two targeted in Beirut's Dahiya district and four others across various operations in Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjlq90oac	2024-09-20T22:56:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/BJB2xHoTR/BJB2xHoTR_0_5_853_481_0_small.jpg

IAF kills Aqil with F-35 fighter jet and four missiles two storie...	Hezbollah remains silent after the assassination of the head of the operations array while rescues are still underway; 'No matter how much Israel escalates, the support for Gaza will remain' Hours after the attack in the Dahieh district in Beirut, where, according to the IDF, the head of Hezbollah's operations array, Ibrahim Aqil, was assassinated with about 10 other Radwan Force commanders. The Lebanese Interior Minister ordered a blockade around the building that was attacked and collapsed to facilitate the rescue efforts of the injured and the dead. According to the IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, Aqil and the Hezbollah commanders gathered underground under residential buildings. According to the IDF, the attack was carried out by F-35 fighter jets, which launched missiles at the building. The Al-Jazeera network reported that four missiles were fired at the location of the Radwan Force meeting, two stories underground. More than 20 people took part in the meeting and Al-Jazeera quoted a Lebanese security source who said several members of the Radwan Force came out injured. According to the Lebanese MTV news network, the families of three senior Radwan Force operatives were informed that more bodies are expected to be uncovered, increasing the death toll. According to the figures published in Lebanon, at least 14 people were killed in the attack, and another 66 were injured, including nine who were critically injured. Footage of the attack shows heavy damage to the targeted structure and to dozens of adjacent cars. Parked cars were overturned, and windows were shattered. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network, dozens of shops were also damaged in the attack. An eyewitness who spoke to the New York Times said that he did not hear the sound of a missile coming at all before the attack: 'It was more like an earthquake. Our building shook for a bit.' Other residents reported chaos, and one of them, Mortada Smaoui, testified that when he arrived at the scene he found a building completely destroyed and a car overturned on its side. He said that he tried to help a woman who was looking for her child, but the rescue forces demanded that he leave: 'The building was destroyed completely, I am shaking.' The attack in Dahieh was the third one carried out by the Air Force since the beginning of the war. In the first attack, senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was eliminated, and in the second, Fuad Shukr, known in Israel as Hezbollah's chief of staff. The Iranian embassy in Lebanon condemned the attack and said that the 'Israeli madness has crossed all borders.' According to the IDF, Aqil and the commanders who were eliminated were among the architects of the 'plan to occupy the Galilee', in the Shiite terrorist organization's plan to raid Israel, occupy the Galilee settlements, and murder innocent civilians, similar to the massacre carried out by Hamas on October 7. At the same time, the Qatari Al-Araby Al-Jadeed quoted a Hezbollah parliamentary source who said: 'The attack in Dahieh follows Israel's extermination war that Israel is waging in the region. No matter how much Israel escalates the operations, the Lebanese front will remain open to support Gaza. The reckoning will come, and the retribution will be just, time will tell. Every Israeli violation will be answered accordingly.' A diplomatic source, whose identity was not reported, told the Saudi Al-Hadath network that 'the assassination of Aqil carries a political and military message according to which Hezbollah's escalation will be met with an escalation in Dahieh.' Netanyahu urges France to pressure Hezbollah Meanwhile, in the diplomatic aspect, Several countries attempt to avoid escalation into an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron accused Israel of pushing the region into war, and Netanyahu responded that instead of pressuring Israel, it's time for France to increase the pressure on Hezbollah. A French diplomat said that it is clear there are differences of opinion between the two sides going forward. France called on all parties in the region to exercise maximum restraint to close the negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza and to facilitate a diplomatic settlement on Israel's northern border. He added that recent security developments in Lebanon have further increased the likelihood of war, while convinced that a diplomatic path still exists. Last year, to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the White House announced a $7 million reward for information on Aqil, who was one of the masterminds of the attack that killed 63 people. Alongside Aqil, Imad Mughniyeh, a former Hezbollah military chief who was killed in a strike attributed to Israel, was also considered responsible for the attack. Aqil was also involved in the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 U.S. service members. In addition, he oversaw the abduction of American and German hostages in Lebanon and was considered a potential successor to Hezbollah’s military leadership long before Shukr’s assassination, also in Dahieh. Aqil survived several assassination attempts, including one in February 2000 when Israeli Apache helicopters fired missiles at his car, leaving him lightly wounded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ij9hip0	2024-09-20T14:03:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/S1E5cEjp0/S1E5cEjp0_0_0_853_481_0_small.jpg

Air Force on high alert: 'We are the most prepared we have ever b...	Tel Nof's 106th Squadron shares its recent operations in Yemen and Lebanon, beaming with pride but cautious as not to become arrogant: 'We're as modest as they come' The waiting is nerve-racking. Incidents along the northern border are becoming ever more frequent. Our enemies to the east are threatening us with missiles. To the south, maritime movement in the Red Sea to Eilat has been blocked. It’s clear to everyone that escalation is on the way. Anyone who might feel they’ve been here before is no kid. Try telling the youngsters about the anticipation of the summer of 1967, which ended with Israel dealing a crushing blow to the Arab armies in a war that went on for just six days. It sounds to them like an Arabian Nights tale. That's understandable when all they have known is a 300-day war that’s very far from ending anytime soon. Israel is constantly revisiting its past. We’re at the Tel Nof IAF base that could well be a target for Iran and Hezbollah. We used to add mystery by saying it was 'somewhere in central Israel' but now Waze can take you up to the main gate. Everyone serving at this huge base has been on high alert for the past week. The wait in 1967 went on for two months. A month after the IAF shot down half a dozen Syrian MiG fighter jets over the Sea of Galilee in April 1967, Nasser closed the Red Sea on us. He'd advanced his troops deep into Sinai and Israel was panic-struck. Tel Aviv children dug trenches along Allenby Street by the Carmel Market. Teenagers in Ashkelon filled sandbags and piled them up in the neighbors’ yards. The wait for the great war that everyone feared was possibly harder than the war itself that broke out June 5. The waiting period ended with a surprise blow to the Arab armies and air forces. Mirage and Skyhawk fighter jets took off to attack Egyptian airfields from Tel Nof. But that’s all in the past. Today, the pilots sit and wait in the 'villa,' which is a house that looks like the newer homes on a kibbutz or moshav. The yard is well kept with greenery and ornamental rocks, a wooden pergola over a deck balcony, and electric blinds shading the living room. This is where the aircrews are on standby. There are three rooms with beds arranged like in a hotel, a fully equipped kitchen with soda and espresso machines, a huge TV screen, and a new Sony PlayStation. We found a deck of cards and a pile of gambling chips on the coffee table – evidence of a heated poker game while waiting for the long-expected attack. As of Thursday, the war hasn’t yet broken out and fear is at an all-time high. Foreign airlines have suspended their flights to Israel and thousands of Israelis are stranded overseas, desperately searching for a spot on one of the Israeli airlines, who are exploiting the situation, charging exorbitant prices. The streets are empty as people prefer staying at home with the children and the safe room close. You should have seen Tel Aviv earlier in the week. The city was almost as deserted as during the COVID lockdown. But there’s a huge discrepancy between the fears and pressure conveyed on TV news programs and what happens in the 106th F15 squadron crew. Just two weeks ago, Hezbollah released a nine-minute aerial video of Ramat David airbase. The Shiite drone circled over the base, filming the squadron’s headquarters, aircraft hangers, runways, and even the commander’s office with great quality. We can reasonably assume that all the IAF bases are targets for Hezbollah and Iran. When you have a threat and a state of vigilance, response time should be incredibly fast. This is why deputy squadron commander Maj. N. is walking around in a G-suit over his flight overalls. He has pipes coming out just beneath his waist, to be connected to an air pipe in the plane to avert pressure on the blood vessels at dizzyingly high speeds and altitude and maneuvering during flight. He has a cloth cap that he wears under his helmet dangling on his hip. He’s ready for immediate deployment and if a siren sounds at the squadron, he’s in the plane in minutes. 'But let’s not talk about us IAF crew,' says N. 'The plane is ready for immediate takeoff. I just need to connect the parachute, and the plane can also land in the water and float if we need to eject. But right now, the plane’s looking good, fueled and armed. I just switch it on and take off. ' 'I don’t want to talk about our level of vigilance. It changes according to intelligence and estimates. The transition from one level to the next is a matter of minutes. There’s a level where you’re in the air in minutes. There’s an immediate level that involves sitting in the cockpit with the engine turned off waiting for deployment. And then, the highest level where you’re in the cockpit with engine on, and the plane ready for takeoff and you’re in the air in ten seconds. You’re looking at preparations for a war that may be just around the corner. I’m not walking around like this for nothing.' The squadron holds two F15 models – a single seater, and a double seater. They’re not as new and sophisticated as the F35 but with a takeoff speed of 254 meters per second, and a maximum flight range of 3,459 km per second, this C model has nothing to be ashamed of. 'This plane, by definition, is for interception. It’s what we call ‘air superiority’,' says the deputy squadron commander. 'But unfortunately, we have no one to fight in the air, at least not for now.' He looks genuinely disappointed that there’s not a decent air force in the region. Perhaps reports this week of an Iranian order of state-of-the-art Sukhoi planes from the Russians signals the creation of a worthy competitor. 'But it doesn’t mean we have no air-to-air missions before that. Look at the Iranian attack on April 14. The squadron has a good number of interceptions to its name on that night, both UAVs and cruise missiles.' How many did you take down? 'I can’t say. I can only say that I was in one of the interception jets and it was a crazy scene. I was at 20 thousand feet, it was pitch dark and the sky was full of SSMs (Surface-to-Surface Missiles). I could see their fire trails. They have one heck of a rocket engine. I also saw fire trails of Arrow missiles fired at the SSMs, taking off at a crazy speed, and the interceptions above me. The challenge is locating the cruise missile moving toward us, an inclusive target as it travels at around 300 knots - the speed of a commercial plane. You need to make sure it’s the enemy.' 'And if you think that’s where it ends, you’ve no idea. It’s just the beginning. Once you’ve exposed it, you have to decide whether or not to take it down, whether to fire from close or long range, above or below, from in front of it or behind, and every such decision impacts armament and maneuvering and the angle toward the target - and I need to make all these decisions in a second, a second-and-a-half tops.' 'And we took down a good number of UAVs and cruise missiles. It’s been four months since then, in which time we’ve been working non-stop. Last week, I was on a mission in South Lebanon. We took out a Hezbollah cell in one of the villages. Oh, and we also made it to Yemen. That alone was crazy.' Speaking of Yemen, meet navigator Maj. R. His appearance is deceptive, like that of a mortgage bank clerk. But he’s an expert in driving 'television missiles' directly to target. 'It’s nice that you want to talk about Yemen when we’re on full alert for an incident with Hezbollah in Lebanon and a possible attack from Iran or one of its proxies, or all of them together. Yes, I was in Yemen. Visibility was okay for half the way there. I saw the Straits of Tiran. But then, there was horrible haze and it ruins the whole sexy part of the story.' The IDF is considering a possible attack on Iran, having attacked Yemen. N. explains that there’s no room for malfunctions during the flight. 'Imagine you’re on a long flight to the United States, and just before reaching the ocean, there’s a malfunction in the plane. You veer 20° right and you can land at London’s Heathrow Airport. If you have a malfunction while you’re flying to attack Yemen, or some other target at a similar distance, where are you going to land? Sudan? Saudi Arabia?' 'And after flying for hours, you then have to bring yourself to a fantastic level of concentration to realize the reason you came all this way - taking the armaments and hitting them right on target. Flying all that way and then hitting next to the target, just isn’t good enough.' 'Think of ten seconds refining everything you’ve learned and practiced,' says navigator R. 'This is your story as a combat soldier– these ten seconds. Making an alpha (hitting the target) at the first strike. In real life, we’re used to correcting ourselves, doing better next time, like shooting hoops, and if it’s no good, you rebound and try again. In an attack like this, like the one we carried out at Hudeidah Port in Yemen, there is no second time, no rebound. My pilot released a missile and I directed him there. You’re not dreaming at a time like this. You’re not hallucinating, you’re not thinking about anything. You’re 100% driving the missile to its target. You don’t let anything distract you. How did you feel when you hit the target? 'Hell, I’m over Yemen and I now need to get back home’. Getting home is part of the mission.' You don’t hear the drums of war here. We spent a few good hours at Tel Nof and we barely saw three F15s land. 'Barely' as one of them did a quick flight over the base to make sure everything was in order, so that doesn’t really count. We climbed the control tower where we found female reservist Capt. N. who, in civilian life, is an air traffic controller at Ben Gurion Airport. She had two soldiers assisting her. N. was holding binoculars watching a plane approaching from the east for landing. 'Watching to see that the plane’s wheels really pulled out when it’s ready to land is extra confirmation' she explained and, over the walkie-talkie, told the pilot '33 X left authorized to land.' There was a ceramic vest lying on a chair in the control tower, a reminder of threats from outside. But N. refused to show us fear. 'Our focus needs to be operating the airfield, taking off and landing planes, focusing only on that, not on threats and fears.' Major B., the technical officer, also isn’t thinking about fears and threats. That’s what he has his wife for. She’s currently on maternity leave with two-month-old little Adam. 'We live in the family barracks on base and my wife is very much aware of what’s going on. She has a bag packed and she needs 15 minutes to get out of here. That’s how long it takes her to fold up the stroller, get it along with the bag and the baby into the car, and push on the gas pedal. I trust our warning system to give enough time to prepare accordingly.' We were sitting in an office in one of the hangers. Outside was a plane called 'Ayelet Hashachar,' tail number 970, ready for battle, packed with bombs and missiles. 'Look at it' he says, nodding his head toward the plane. 'What a wonderful machine. Look how the heavy hail sits on it.' Heavy hail? 'JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition), a bomb weighing a ton. It has a fantastic carrying capacity. I can put on three detachable fuel canisters if it’s a long-distance mission. It can carry a great deal of ammunition for both attack and interception – bombs or missiles of all kinds. 'Ayelet Hashachar,' for example, is armed with both missiles and heavy hail. 'I can tell you the vigilance here is at the highest level. This includes preparing the planes and the threats against us. Everyone here knows where the nearest safe room is. We all know that, even if they drop missiles here, planes will still have to take off and everyone knows how to conduct missions and prepare planes for attack under fire. There will be functional continuity, at a pace faster than now that we’re not under fire.' 'Planes are ready for takeoff within a very short time after landing – if there are no malfunctions. This means checking oil, refueling, rearming, putting air pressure in the tires, and running electrical voltage to test the cockpit systems. Whatever the mission: Gaza, Beirut, Iran, or Yemen, we run to every plane as if Judgement Day has come.' There’s something about visiting a base like Tel Nof that gives the feeling that Israel isn’t yet completely lost. Three army bases have been broken into by rabble in the past two weeks. A few dozen Haredim broke into the Tel Hashomer recruitment offices. They were climbing the fences and the police wasn’t there to stop them. Moreover, criminals broke into the Sde Teiman base, with right-wing MKs and a government minister egging them on. The mob then went on to break into the Biet Lid base. The Air Force is our national security’s backbone. Our enemies have long known this. If a base or, God forbid, two are attacked, we would have a knife to our neck. I looked at how serious and professional those serving here at Tel Nof are, and couldn’t help but think this is the same army as at Beit Lid, Tel Nof, and Tel Hashomer. And if the mob broke in there, could it happen here too? Then you sit with technical officer B. from Netanya and N. the navigator from Efrat as they both proudly talked about what they do and their awe of the great responsibility placed upon them. N. glances at Ayelet Hashachar ready for take-off and casually says 'It can be over Lebanon in minutes.' They sit around in standby rooms, briefing and memorizing flight paths and flights to targets and the dangers awaiting them en route. 'What we’ll encounter at every point,' says N. 'It might be a shoulder-held missile or missile batteries. Not just in Lebanon – in Iran too and anywhere we might need to go. Look at this plane. It’s an amazing tractor with the most cutting-edge technology, totally state of the art. It’s a beast that can carry bombs to every corner of the Middle East. We proved it a month ago in the attack in Yemen. Anyone who needed to understand, understood our capabilities. ' That smells a bit smug. Aren’t we being a bit too arrogant? 'We’re as modest as they come. Our enemies may strike us, but don’t worry about us. We’re ready. Whatever their attack looks like, we’ll be able to deal with it and address it. We’re the readiest we’ve ever been.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1m6f7saa	2024-09-20T10:59:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/08/rJlX8eNf9A/rJlX8eNf9A_2_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg
Gallant: 'We'll pursue Hezbollah even in Dahieh'	Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday that Israel will continue to hunt down Hezbollah operatives, even in the terrorist group’s main base of operations in Beirut’s Dahieh district. 'Even in Beirut’s Dahieh, we will continue to pursue our enemies to protect our citizens,' Gallant said after a security assessment with the IDF chief of staff and senior military officials following what he described as the elimination of Hezbollah’s 'operational leadership.' 'The series of operations in this new phase will continue until we achieve our goal: the safe return of northern residents to their homes.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj8q6qst0	2024-09-20T10:17:29-07:00	
Hezbollah blasts worsen displacement crisis along Israel-Lebanon ...	Explosions targeting Hezbollah devices have killed dozens and worsened the displacement crisis, with thousands of Israelis and Lebanese remaining in temporary shelters amid ongoing border tensions At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured, many seriously, after communication devices used by Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the latest round of blasts yesterday, walkie-talkies exploded, killing 20 and injuring at least 450 people, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Despite not admitting this publicly, Israel is considered to be behind this accident, and for this reason, a possible retaliation from Hezbollah may occur. After almost a year of crossfire between Israel and the Shia militia, which deeply affected both countries and their citizens, this time seems inevitable an open war front. 'No one saw this coming. There are many things that we don’t know about. This proves that we are not alone and that the IDF is everywhere to protect us. It was a surprise for everyone, but it was indeed incredible,' commented Mark Lagunov, manager of the Golan Brewery in Katzrin. Nadia, a resident of Katzrin, had a different opinion: 'If what happened is true and Israel is behind it, well, this is terrible news. War is not a good thing, and I stand against these methods that generate further fear and chaos.' In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, Jewish communities both in the southern and northern parts of the country were evacuated (or self-evacuated) from their homes for safety reasons, reaching almost 250,000 people. As of June 2024, about 90,000 Israelis remained internally displaced from the north, according to data provided by the UN. Additionally, according to the UN, 95,000 residents have been evacuated from southern Lebanon, and over 90 civilians were targeted by IDF strikes. Throughout the months, both the northern part of Israel and the southern part of Lebanon became 'buffer zones' and ghost towns, profoundly impacting the lives of people who used to inhabit those areas. In Israel, the government decided to financially help those families affected by the conflict and offered temporary accommodation in hotels within the country. Almost a year has passed, and thousands of families still find themselves trapped in hotels away from their homes. The Caesar Premiere Hotel in Tiberias is an example of this phenomenon, hosting more than 400 families internally displaced from the northern border. 'Most of the people that we are hosting come from Kiryat Shmona and nearby kibbutzim. Despite being in a difficult situation, we are trying to sustain them in any way possible by providing food and emotional support to make them feel at home,' affirmed Eran Ohayon, manager of the Caesar Premiere Hotel in Tiberias. 'In case of a possible retaliation that may affect the area of Tiberias, we have bunkers that can host all the guests. Moreover, the government financially sustains each family and us as facilities, which is important for not leaving anyone behind,' he added. Talking with families staying at the hotel, the common feeling is collective tiredness. Everyone shared the same fears about the future and hoped to return home soon. 'I don’t complain about the hotel and the services offered, but we have been here for almost a year. It is inhumane what is happening to us. We just want to return home. Me and other members of my kibbutz founded the place, and being away is painful,' said Yehuda, who was displaced from Kibbutz Bar Am close to the border with Lebanon. 'How long can you stay away from your home? After a week of enjoying the hotel's services, you want to return to your comfort zone and your place. It is not manageable to carry on like this', stated Yanai Shlomi, coming from a kibbutz in the south and visiting his relative Yehuda, who has been living in the hotel for 11 months.

Everything is on the table,' Israeli official says as Beirut str...	Official vows to 'keep hitting Hezbollah until war’s objective achieved' and northern residents return home safely as terror group expected to retaliate; White House insists war not inevitable, pushes for diplomatic resolution An Israeli official said Friday that the strike in Beirut targeting Hezbollah head of operations Ibrahim Aqil signals a 'new phase in the war.' The official said that Israel will continue to target Hezbollah and is prepared for a response. 'Everything is on the table,' the source added. Israel assesses that Hezbollah will not overlook the strike and the reported assassination of Aqil. 'There are no red lines in this new phase,' another official said. 'We will keep hitting Hezbollah until the war’s objective is achieved: the safe return of northern residents to their homes. We understand the potential costs.' Lebanese media reported that at least three people were killed and several others were injured in the attack on the Dahieh district. The IDF confirmed that Aqil, Hezbollah’s head of operations, was targeted in the strike. A Hezbollah source told AFP that Aqil was killed. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying that it 'proves once again that the Israeli enemy disregards humanitarian and moral considerations.' The U.S. quickly denied any involvement or prior knowledge of the Israeli strike, reiterating its stance that war is not inevitable and that diplomacy remains the best path to de-escalation. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby emphasized that the U.S. is doing everything possible to prevent a regional war. Ibrahim Aqil, the target of the strike, was a senior member of Hezbollah’s Jihad Council and served as the group’s head of operations. Designated a terrorist by the U.S. in 2015, he was linked to numerous global terror attacks, including Hezbollah’s military operations in Syria. Last year, the White House offered a $7 million reward for information on Aqil, one of the masterminds behind the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that killed 63 people. He was also involved in the attack on a U.S. Marine Corps base later that year, which killed 241 military personnel. Aqil was seen as a potential successor to Hezbollah’s military chief Fuad Shukr, who was assassinated in July in Beirut. Aqil had survived several assassination attempts, including one in 2000 when Israeli helicopters fired missiles at his car, leaving him slightly injured. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhmowot0	2024-09-20T09:41:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/rJ2Jb7oaA/rJ2Jb7oaA_0_0_3000_1682_0_small.jpg
IDF confirms Hezbollah head of operations Ibrahim Aqil eliminated...	Key architect of Hezbollah’s plan to invade northern Israel assassinated in Israeli strike on building in Beirut’s Dahieh; army says strike also took out other senior members of terror group's operations unit The IDF confirmed on Friday that it eliminated Ibrahim Aqil, Hezbollah’s head of operations, in a strike in Beirut, along with senior members of the group’s operations unit and the leadership of its elite Radwan Force. Lebanese reports said at least nine people were killed and 59 wounded in the attack, eight of them critically. Prior to the IDF’s announcement, Lebanese officials confirmed to foreign news agencies that Aqil was among the dead. Reuters reported that, according to a local security source, the strike occurred during a meeting Aqil held with members of the Radwan Force. The IDF said that Aqil and the commanders killed were key architects of the 'Operation to Conquer the Galilee,' a plan for Hezbollah to invade Israeli territory and capture northern communities in a future war. Aqil had served as Hezbollah’s operations chief since 2004, overseeing attacks involving explosives, anti-tank missiles and other military operations. Aqil began his career with Hezbollah in the 1980s in its Islamic Jihad wing, responsible for carrying out attacks outside Lebanon, targeting international civilians and organizations. He also commanded the Radwan Force, Hezbollah’s elite unit, and was reportedly involved in the 2019 anti-tank missile attack on the Avivim military post, the 2023 bomb attack at the Megiddo junction and recent attempts by Hezbollah fighters to infiltrate Israeli territory during the war to kill civilians and soldiers. 'The IDF will continue to target Hezbollah’s capabilities and take action in all arenas to ensure the security of Israel’s citizens,' the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjapsms60	2024-09-20T09:20:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/HJRctgj6A/HJRctgj6A_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Ibrahim Aqil: Elusive Hezbollah mastermind and one of America's m...	Terror group's operations chief, reportedly target of Israeli strike in Beirut, designated terrorist by US in 2015, with $7 million reward for information on him The target of Friday afternoon's strike in Beirut’s Dahieh district was reportedly Ibrahim Aqil, the head of Hezbollah’s operations, according to local reports. Aqil is a senior member of the group’s Jihad Council and was previously responsible for its military activities. The United States designated Aqil a terrorist in 2015, linking him to numerous attacks worldwide and military operations in Syria. In 2019, the U.S. added him to the sanctions list again, freezing any assets under American jurisdiction and banning U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with him. The same list included Hezbollah’s military chief Fuad Shukr, who was assassinated in July, and senior member Mohammed Haidar. Last year, to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the White House announced a $7 million reward for information on Aqil, who was one of the masterminds of the attack that killed 63 people. Alongside Aqil, Imad Mughniyeh, a former Hezbollah military chief who was killed in a strike attributed to Israel, was also considered responsible for the attack. Aqil was also involved in the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 U.S. service members. In addition, he oversaw the abduction of American and German hostages in Lebanon and was considered a potential successor to Hezbollah’s military leadership long before Shukr’s assassination, also in Dahieh. Aqil survived several assassination attempts, including one in February 2000 when Israeli Apache helicopters fired missiles at his car, leaving him lightly wounded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkz5rzot0	2024-09-20T08:19:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/04/18/SkBMfN2M2/SkBMfN2M2_0_0_679_383_0_small.jpg

IDF spokesperson says the military's target was a senior Hezbollah official in the Dahiyeh neighborhood in Beirut Lebanon media says 5 children killed and extensive damage caused in F-35 attack The IDF said on Saturday afternoon that its aircraft attacked two buildings in Beirut's Dahieh neighborhood, a Hezbollah stronghold. The military said it carried out a targeted strike. Lebanese media claimed five children were killed and extensive damage caused in the F-35 strike. Lebanese media was first to report the strike on the city's southern sector, a primarily Shiite part of the capital and where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has established the group's headquarters and powerbase. The IDF said there was no change announced to the instructions to Israeli by the Home Front Command Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he would be postponing his plans to travel to the U.S. early next week to address the UN General Assembly.

Lebanese receive threatening messages attributed to Israeli hack	You are a supporter of Hezbollah so you will be rewarded with a meeting with him in Hell,' the message reads; Saudi channel quotes expert saying electric cars can detonate next causing greater harm Lebanese media has reported that citizens of the country received threatening and disconcerting messages on their phones in recent days. One screenshot seen by the media outlets read 'We see you are a supporter of [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nassrallah so you will be rewarded with a meeting with him in Hell.' Other messages kept on screenshots included claims that the senders were Jewish Israelis who hate their country and government and want to assist in its destruction. 'IO have many ties and capabilities that no one can doubt,' the message read. It is unclear who was behind the messages that were written in unclear Arabic. One Lebanese television channel claimed they were sent from an Israeli messaging app that disseminates clips and recordings without revealing the senders. The Lebanese reports of the messages came after Israelis received messages on their phones calling them to enter shelters immediately and warning of a massive Hezbollah attack. The Home Front Command denied it had issued any warnings to civilians and the messages were considered a likely cyberattack. Meanwhile, the Saudi Al Arabiya media outlet quoted an expert who said electric cars could also be breached and detonated, as the communication devices had been, but would cause much greater damage and harm. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syw85kopr	2024-09-20T05:33:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/rJborpaqaC/rJborpaqaC_0_152_961_540_0_small.jpg
Owner of Bulgarian company selling pagers to Hezbollah is missing...	Indian-borne Rinson Jose, founder of Norta Global involved in the sale of devices to the Lebanese terror group, is unreachable after leaving on a 'pre-planned' trip on the day pagers detonated The Indian-borne businessman who founded a Bulgarian company implicated in the coordinated detonation of Hezbollah communication devices has disappeared after 'inadvertently' assisting Israel in the plot, the Daily Mail said on Saturday. A report by the Hungarian news outlet Telex claimed the devices alleged to have been sold by the BAC company in Hungary, were imported to Lebanon from Bulgaria by a company named Norta Global Ltd., based in Sofia and owned by a Norwegian national. Bulgaria's National Security Agency has since launched an investigation, saying that no approval was found for relevant sales and that the only known transaction involved 1.6 million euros being transferred to Hungary. Norta Global founder Rinson Jose, who resides in Oslo, was said to have gone on a pre-planned trip on Tuesday but his employers at Norwegian media conglomerate NHST, have been unable to reach him since,' the paper said. Oslo police launched an investigation. 'Blinds were drawn today at his flat in Mortensrud, an upmarket suburb on the outskirts of Oslo. The grass was overgrown, and neighbors claimed to have not seen him for several months,' the Daily Mail reported. 'His profile on Founders Nation, a site connecting entrepreneurs with Israeli start-ups described him as an entrepreneur-minded business developer looking for a co-founder or like-minded people to start a venture.' Norta Global was described as an innovative, consulting, outsourcing, recruiting and technology service company. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qtwjjp0	2024-09-20T05:05:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/SknGET5T0/SknGET5T0_1_0_1023_575_0_small.jpg
More than 100 rockets in barrages targeting Galilee, Golan	Hezbollah-affiliated channel says rocket fire is response to 'false' Israeli claim it struck 1,000 launchers overnight; security cabinet to convene Israel's north came under heavy fire when Hezbollah launched more than 100 hundred rockets in barrages targeting the Galilee and Golan Heights in the early afternoon hours on Saturday. While one man suffered mild injuries, the attack caused damage and several brush fires to ignited. Lebanon's Hezbollah-affiliated al-Manar channel, said the strike was in response to Israel's 'false claims' that it struck some 1,000 rocket launchers in Lebanon since Friday. The outlet said the rockets were aimed at Israeli military bases. esidents of northern Israel were told by the Home Front Command earlier that they were no longer instructed to remain near shelters after they were warned late on Friday to do so. The IDF conducted strikes on Hezbollah targets overnight in dozens of sorties in response to Hezbollah attacks including a barrage of some 50 Iranian falaq missiles at the border communities. Israel's security cabinet will meet later on Saturday to discuss the ongoing cross border violence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjod4r5p0	2024-09-20T04:05:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/rkFoRp5pA/rkFoRp5pA_0_307_961_540_0_small.jpg

Meet Hezbollah's unit tasked with enlisting operatives in Israel	Shin Bet says thwarted Iranian and Hezbollah efforts to enlist operatives, and carry out attacks, since the start of the war; says unit 133 is behind IED detonating inside Israel, assassination attempts on former defense minister and others and smuggling of arms Since the start of the war, Shin Bet revealed eight attempts by Iran and Hezbollah to enlist operatives in Israel that would carry out attacks. On Thursday, an Israeli businessman was indicted on charges that he had been tapped by Iranian intelligence operatives to assassinate senior Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, and to carry out missions inside the country. Security officials also say there is direct contact between Israeli crime gangs and terrorists, which Iran has used to entice people with promises of financial rewards and a supply of weapons. Hezbollah's unit 133 is tasked with conscripting operatives in Israel. It replaced unit 1800, whose notorious commander, Khalil Kharev, successfully enlisted Palestinians to construct a terror infrastructure and carry out attacks. Unit 133 had taken over that mission and was given a wider birth to operate not only in Israel but around the world, mostly in Europe as well as in Egypt and Jordan. According to Arab reports, under the current commander of unit 133 operatives is working with Lebanese drug smugglers to bring explosives into Israel and the West Bank with the help of crime gangs in South Lebanon. Conscripts undergo military and security training, learn how to raise funds, prepare cover stories and conduct surveillance. They often meet handlers from the unit in Syria and Lebanon but also in Europe in other parts of the world. The security officials in Israel believe Hezbollah's unit 133 was behind the plot to assassinate former defense minister Moshe Ya'alon last year using an explosive device planted on his daily jogging route in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park and the explosive device that severely wounded one man at the Megiddo intersection in the north in March 2023. The Alma Research and Education Center which specializes in security challenges on Israel's northern border said unit 133's mission is to bolster terror infrastructure inside Israel by among other means, using smuggling routes to insert weapons for its operators with the collaboration of Lebanese crime families. Researchers believe Kharev is still heavily involved in the unit's work and uses his connections to the local criminals, to the unit's ends. He is also thought to be at the head of Hezbollah's efforts to train Shiite militias in Iraq and Yemen. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj00ytp9ta	2024-09-20T03:42:40-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/SkpjdrKT0/SkpjdrKT0_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

US believes Gaza ceasefire deal unlikely in Biden's term, reports	Pentagon spokesperson says she does not believe the deal is falling apart but unnamed sources claim Israeli demands to control Philadelphi Corridor and Hamas demands on prisoner releases, remain obstacles to progress U.S. officials now believe that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza is unlikely before President Joe Biden leaves office in January, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The newspaper cited top-level officials in the White House, State Department and Pentagon without naming them. Those bodies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'I can tell you that we do not believe that deal is falling apart,' Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters on Thursday before the report was published. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said two weeks ago that 90% of a ceasefire deal had been agreed upon. The United States and mediators Qatar and Egypt have for months attempted to secure a ceasefire but have failed to bring Israel and Hamas to a final agreement. Two obstacles have been especially difficult: Israel's demand to keep forces in the Philadelphi corridor between Gaza and Egypt and the specifics of an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The United States has said a Gaza ceasefire deal could lower tensions across the Middle East amid fears the conflict could widen. Biden laid out a three-phase ceasefire proposal on May 31 that he said at the time Israel agreed to. As the talks hit obstacles, officials have for weeks said a new proposal would soon be presented. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknk625ta	2024-09-20T02:25:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/03/r100ONcoN0/r100ONcoN0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Coordinated pager blasts were 15- years in the making, report	American intelligence sources say plan involves shell companies, multiple layers of intelligence officers and assets fronting legitimate companies, adding CIA rejected similar-style operations for fear of injury to innocent bystanders American intelligence officials said the operation to detonate thousand of communication devices used by Hezbollah in Lebanon was at least 15 years in the making, ABC News reported late on Friday. 'Planning for the attack involved shell companies, with multiple layers of Israeli intelligence officers and their assets fronting a legitimate company that produced the pagers,' the network said, adding that at least some of those involved were unaware of who they were really working for. ABC's sources said 30 to 60 grams of explosives were inserted into the pagers along with an electronic trigger. One source said similar attacks were also considered by the CIA but rejected because of the high risk to innocent bystanders. According to reports in Lebanon, over 3,000 Hezbollah operatives were wounded when the pagers exploded and 450 more were hurt in the second wave of the attack a day later, when hand radio devices also exploded. Officially Hezbollah confirmed 37 fatalities in total but Israeli officials estimated the death toll to be much higher. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byb00whcp0	2024-09-20T01:35:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/rJ9N3ePTA/rJ9N3ePTA_0_0_809_456_0_small.jpg

Trump says if he loses the elections it will be the fault of Jews	Republican presidential hopeful said in a Kamala Harris administration Israel would be obliterated, describing how rockets would rain on the country and terrorists would go door to door massacring and raping innocent civilians 'I'm here tonight to deliver an urgent warning to Jewish Americans and to friends of Israel all around the world, ' Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump said on Friday adding that evangelical Christians who support Israel love it more than Jewish people in New York, sometimes. 'If we continue down this path for four more years with Kamala, Israel will be faced not only with an attack but with total annihilation.' Trump spoke to the Israeli American Council in Washington wearing a yellow tie to symbolize his support for the hostages held in Gaza. He invited rescued hostage Andrei Kozlov to the stage honoring his bravery. 'You have a big protector in me. You don't have a protector on the other side,' he said. ''Anybody who's Jewish and loves being Jewish and loves Israel, is a fool if they vote for a Democrat… You should have your head examined.' He said in a Kamala administration Iran would obtain nuclear weapons. He went on to describe a future where rockets would rain down on Israel, terrorists would go door to door massacring and raping innocent civilians and Tel Aviv and Jerusalem would become unlivable. He said Israel must win its war on terror but win it fast. Trump said Kamala Harris has repeatedly demanded a cease-fire, to save Hamas and had said she would consider imposing an arms embargo on Israel. Trump complained that only 29% of Jews supported him in the 2020 elections, which he lost to Bide, despite 'giving' Israel the Golan Heights, the Abraham Accord and the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital along with billions and billions of dollars. He claimed polls now show he has 40% support of American Jews, but 60% remaining percent still support the Democrats, whom he called the enemy. 'You didn't treat yourselves well,' he told the Jewish crowd. 'I wasn't treated properly by the voters who happen to be Jewish,' he said. 'If I don't win these elections, the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.' Trump said his administration would 'stop the spread of toxic antisemitism that's spreading here,' but only if voters reject Harris. 'November 5 2024 will be the most important day in the history of Israel and the history of the United States he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkk00f59pa	2024-09-19T23:58:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/BkeisbUq6C/BkeisbUq6C_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Dubious character, would've conned the Iranians': New details on...	Moti Maman, indicted of being recruited by Iran to carry out assassinations against Israeli officials, had criminal connections with acquaintances saying he always seemed shady Moti Maman, 72, an Israeli businessman based in Turkey who was indicted Thursday of being recruited by Iranian intelligence, lived in Ashkelon after leaving from northern Israel’s Bustan Hagalil 10 years ago. A., a local resident, told Ynet the man 'always seemed like a dubious character.' Another resident of Bustan HaGalil shared, 'He has a plot in the area, but hasn't lived there for years. He’s told a lot of people here that he’s a Mossad agent and a graduate of the IDF’s intelligence Unit 8200. We always laughed about it because those weren’t the kind of people we'd see him hanging out with.' A source familiar with the criminal world said, 'Moti isn’t a well-known businessman.' According to him, 'he was involved in shady dealings with criminals in Nahariya. He did a lot of business with Arabs and I think that’s how the Iranians got to him because they realized they could exploit him since he’s quite naïve and isn’t deeply familiar with the criminal world.' 'Even if he agreed to carry out the operation, I think he would’ve taken the money from the Iranians and then disappeared. I know he’s done that with other businesses he went to in Africa — he didn’t pay back his debts to those he did business with there,' he added. On the other hand, D. from Bustan HaGalil described him as a good person. 'He lived in Romania for a while; a woman there conned him and took all his money. He was left with nothing. Overall, he’s really a good guy — he’s never done anything to harm others.' After his divorce, Maman moved to Ashkelon. Many of Maman's neighbors told Ynet they have known him for years and always knew he was involved in criminal activities but refuse to provide information because they fear for their personal safety. Maman left Bustan HaGalil nearly a decade ago, and the residents were shocked by the reports about their former neighbor and the severity of the allegations against him. One of Maman’s sons serves in an IDF combat unit. His ex-wife, son and daughter still live in the northern Israeli town and are considered good neighbors. It’s unclear whether they’ve maintained contact with him in recent years. 'His family is strong and well-established, and we’ll stand by them and support them if necessary. We’re convinced they have no connection to this,' residents of Bustan HaGalil said. Maman owned a shawarma stand in Nahariya for a short while, which he allegedly bought from a criminal a decade ago. The police suspected at the time that he was running a front from the criminals and refused to grant a business license for the eatery. A city resident said that Maman was 'a people person.' According to him, 'he was one of those friendly guys, making friends with everyone. He always had friends hanging out at his place. I don’t believe he would’ve actually done it; in my opinion, he would’ve conned the Iranians.' Maman is accused of contacting a foreign agent after being recruited by Iran to promote, among other things, the assassination of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. 'I don't know what would have happened if they had given me a million dollars and what I would have done. We're only human,' the defendant said during his interrogation, referring to the financial advance he requested from the Iranian agents he met with — which wasn’t paid to him — leading to his refusal of the proposal. During his court hearing, Maman couldn't stop smiling. It was also revealed on Thursday that the prosecution filed an indictment against Maman at the Be'er Sheva District Court, accusing him of offenses against national security, including contacting a foreign agent and entering an enemy state without permission. According to the indictment, Maman engaged in discussions on Iranian soil with local agents operating on behalf of the Islamic Republic's intelligence services. He entered Iran twice and discussed the possibility of carrying out terror operations within Israel during meetings with Iranian agents. After the defendant explained to the Iranian agents that the high level of security around senior officials made it impossible to harm them, other options for carrying out terror and espionage operations by the defendant were discussed including harming former prime minister Naftali Bennett or Israeli mayors. 'What might have happened if the advance he demanded had been paid worries the prosecution, but it will settle for referring to the defendant’s own words,' the request to remand Maman until the end of legal proceedings against him read. This referred to his statement during the interrogation where he admitted he didn't know what he would have done if his handlers had given him the monetary sum he requested. The prosecution also mentioned that during the discussions about terror operations against Israel, 'the transfer of funds, the delivery of photographic information to Iranian sources documenting crowded places in Israel and even the establishment of assassination cells in Russia and the U.S. by the defendant were considered, aimed at murdering opponents of the Iranian regime.' Maman, who acted out of financial greed, requested a financial advance from Iran before carrying out any action for the regime, which is why his meetings didn’t result in any concrete terror operations. According to the prosecution, Maman confessed to the charges during 14 Shin Bet interrogations and four additional police interrogations. 'Throughout these interrogations, he revealed the extent of his crime to the investigators and consistently stood by his confession, enriching it with facts and details,' the prosecution’s statement said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hypu11g96r	2024-09-19T22:33:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/HybP111DYT0/HybP111DYT0_268_313_753_424_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah targets north after Israel strikes 1,000 launchers	Residents of the north told instructions to remain near shelters are lifted; over 70 air force strikes on Lebanon mark most in one day since the war began; U.S. official believe a ground incursion is not imminent Residents of the northern border communities in the Upper Galilee woke up to sirens on Friday after a relatively quiet night. They were told by the Home Front Command that instructions to remain near shelters, given to them late last night, were lifted. The IDF said the air force attacked some 1,000 of Hezbollah's rocket launchers and other targets based on intelligence information. Lebanese media reported Israel carried out over 70 strikes on Lebanon, making the most in one day since the war began. Officials in the Biden administration told the Wall Street Journal that despite the deployment of Israel's elite fighting 98th division to the north, they did not believe that an Israeli ground offensive was imminent because IDF reserves had not been called up. They said weeks would be needed to prepare for the movement of forces across the border, adding that Israel could choose a limited operation that would begin sooner but would not involve a more significant military maneuver. The U.S. and its European allies urgently called for calm and a diplomatic solution to the crisis although Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech on Friday that his terror group would not stop the attacks on Israel until the war in Gaza ends. Nasrallah spoke in a televised address for the first time since the coordinated explosions of thousands of his group's communication devices earlier in the week, attributed to Israel. He said the operation which dealt a severe blow to his organization, could be seen as a declaration of war and was a massacre and genocide. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday that the Israeli attacks on Lebanon would increase after the government added to its objectives in the war that began in the wake of the Hamas massacre on October 7, the safe return of residents evacuated from the north to their homes. The IDF urged civilians in the north to remain outside areas used by the military to conduct drills. In a statement the military said in no uncertain terms that entering restricted areas could come at the cost of lives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkldjo96r	2024-09-19T22:24:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/r1XWQ01156C/r1XWQ01156C_0_0_1600_900_0_small.jpg

Russia's Kadyrov accuses musk of 'remotely disabling' his cybertr...	That's not a nice thing for Elon Musk to do. He gives expensive gifts from the bottom of his heart and then remotely switches them off,' Chechen leader says Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful leader of Russia's Chechen Republic, accused Elon Musk on Thursday of disabling a Tesla Cybertruck that he claimed to have received from the billionaire last month. Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist for over 17 years, shared a video in August of him driving around in the electric vehicle with what appeared to be a machine gun mounted on its roof. Kadyrov said he received the vehicle from Musk, a claim that the Tesla owner called a lie on his social media platform X. 'Now, recently, Musk remotely disabled the Cybertruck,' said Kadyrov in a post on his Telegram account. 'That's not a nice thing for Elon Musk to do. He gives expensive gifts from the bottom of his heart and then remotely switches them off,' he said. The Cybertruck is an electric pick-up truck that was first unveiled by US carmaker Tesla in 2019 before going into production last year. Kadyrov claimed in his social media post that the vehicle he received was used in combat and sent to Ukraine, where it 'performed admirably'. The son of a former rebel warlord, Kadyrov is now one of Putin's most vociferous backers and has long referred to himself as the president's 'footsoldier'. The 47-year-old Chechen leader says he has deployed thousands of troops to help the Kremlin with its Ukraine offensive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvzpm9pr	2024-09-19T15:00:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/18/SJcO1HyjR/SJcO1HyjR_0_0_634_357_0_small.jpg

After Hezbollah chief insinuates explosion of communication devices across Lebanon could be considered an 'act of war', defense minister makes clear Israel's actions to change the situation in the north will continue Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday said Israel’s 'course of action will continue,' after Hezbollah leader General Hassan Nasrallah’s speech in which he said the detonation of communication devices in Lebanon the terror group attributed to Israel 'could be considered a declaration of war.' Israel has not claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks. Gallant held consultations on the various possibilities for continuing the campaign against Hezbollah on the northern border with IDF Chief of Staff LTG Herzi Halevi, senior military officials, Shin Bet and Mossad officials. 'In recent days, we’ve been holding a series of important discussions. This is a new stage in the war, one that presents significant opportunities, but also substantial risks,' Gallant said. 'Hezbollah is feeling pressured and our sequence of military actions will continue. Our goal is to return northern residents to their homes safely. Hezbollah will pay a growing price as time goes on. At the same time, we’ll continue our efforts to bring the hostages home and dismantle Hamas in Gaza.' 'We were dealt a massive blow,' Nasrallah said in his first comments since the coordinated detonation of pagers and walkie-talkies used by the terror group in Lebanon, calling it 'genocide.' However, he said that the fighting would not stop until the war in Gaza ended. 'Even a full-scale war won’t lead to the return of the northern residents,' he said addressing his words to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Gallant. Nasrallah also threatened that Hezbollah would have a 'historic opportunity' if Israel initiated a ground operation in Lebanon, recalling the past guerrilla operations against IDF forces in the buffer zone from which Israel withdrew in 2000. In his speech, Nasrallah promised a 'proper,' punishment but didn’t elaborate. 'it’ll come from somewhere either expected or unexpected.' Israel was preparing for a harsh response and is shifting its focus in the war to the northern front, with a commitment to achieving the war’s goals of returning the northern residents to their homes — after 11 months of fighting. Jerusalem was also concerned about possible Iranian involvement — as its ambassador to Lebanon was seriously injured in the pager attack. Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami declared that he informed Nasrallah that Israel would face 'a crushing response from the axis of resistance.' Just before Nasrallah began his speech, the IDF announced it had launched a wave of strikes in Lebanon. 'The IDF is currently striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon to degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure,' an IDF statement read 15 minutes before the speech began. Reports indicated bombings across southern Lebanese villages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjb9zk9ac	2024-09-19T13:53:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/r1C2F6tpA/r1C2F6tpA_548_190_658_371_0_small.jpg
Company implicated in pager strike uses fake CEO photo on website	Neighbors on the quiet street and nondescript building are upset at the unwanted publicity they are subjected to after their address was identified as the office of the BAC company that marketed the Taiwanese Gold Apollo pagers purchased by Hezbollah The photo of Italian-Hungarian Christina Arcidiacono Barsony, the woman identified as CEO of the BAC company, implicated in the coordinated pager explosions in Lebanon, and who disappeared off the face of the earth, is not who she was claimed to be. 'I know the woman from the photos, and I’ve heard there’s been trouble at the apartment where she lives in Budapest. I know her well. That’s not Christina,' a neibor of the company's offices said. The Hungarian company BAC, which the Taiwanese brand 'Gold Apollo' claims produced the pager that exploded in Lebanon, operated in a discreet, ideal location for secretive activities. The building from which BAC operated—allegedly used by Mossad for the pager operation, according to foreign reports—is tucked away on a side street in a quiet neighborhood, not far from a highway. The area consists of single-family homes with gardens, alongside office buildings and an industrial zone, including a garage. The BAC office is located near house number 33. 'I’ve had my business here for 12 years,' said the owner of the garage, who declined to give his name. 'In all that time, this office building was always full of companies. They’d come for a few months or a year and then leave. We never saw or heard anyone.' He, like many other neighbors, appeared uneasy, baffled by the sudden attention. The office building itself is an unremarkable two-story cream-colored structure, surrounded by a black iron fence with brown-tiled roof decorations between the gates. A parking lot on the right holds four bins for waste sorting, while a driveway on the left leads to an underground garage. Four steps lead up to the entrance, where a large white mailbox bears the names of two companies, next to an intercom with four buttons. The second button from the top reads 'Claudia.' At 10:30 am, a couple stepped out onto the second-floor balcony of house number 33, chain-smoking cigarettes. 'I just want them to leave us alone,' the woman said. 'Yesterday morning, we had a quiet, normal life, and now the whole world wants to know who we are. It’s crazy, absolutely insane. We’re terrified. Our home and address are exposed to everyone, and for something like this? Today it’s journalists, but who knows who’ll come next week. We’ve never seen anyone from BAC—just a secretary who showed up occasionally, but we don’t know who she worked for. We just want to be left in peace.' One day, you live in a forgotten corner where no one cares, and the next, you’re on the front pages worldwide. 'It’s crazy and frightening. We’re scared,' she added, lighting a new cigarette with the previous one, her hands trembling. An elderly couple from a nearby house got into their red Dacia and left for shopping. 'There’s never been even a hint of noise here,' the man said in German before quickly disappearing down the street. The story of the pagers and communication devices that exploded on Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon is turning into a thriller even John le Carré couldn’t have dreamed up. Christina herself, and her background, are shrouded in inconsistencies and suspicions. The places she claimed to have worked don’t exist, and their websites are nowhere to be found. She personally denied any connection to the production of pagers in a statement to NBC, also refuting the claim by the Taiwanese 'Gold Apollo' brand that she had received permission only to use their trademark, while all manufacturing and design were handled by her company. Before BAC’s website went offline, according to the German newspaper Bild, the company had also offered a jewelry line for sale, called 'Nelkhael,' after the 21st angel from a list of 72 angels in Kabbalah. Meanwhile, the Hungarian site Telex reported that the pagers were actually sold to Hezbollah by a Bulgarian company named 'Global NORTA Ltd.' Telex further reported that Global NORTA, based in Sofia, Bulgaria, was responsible for manufacturing and exporting the pagers to Lebanon, while BAC merely served as a broker. This was supported by a Hungarian government spokesperson, who claimed the devices never physically passed through Hungarian territory. However, this statement should be taken with caution: if it is revealed that devices intended for terrorist groups were produced on Hungarian soil, it would constitute a serious violation of European Union laws. The report added that BAC was merely a shell company facilitating the deal between Taiwan and Bulgaria, while 'Global NORTA Ltd.' handled the import of the devices from Taiwan and their shipment to Lebanon. Global NORTA, founded in April 2022, just a month before BAC, is owned by a Norwegian citizen. The address listed for the Bulgarian company is also home to 196 other registered businesses. 'I informed the tech company where I work as a project manager in the 11th district that I won’t be coming in. I have a six-month-old daughter. We lived very quiet lives, and now our address is everywhere, 'the neighbor at number 33 said. 'My instinct is to be afraid of any grieving family member who lost someone in these explosions and might come here. I know they probably understand this address is nothing, but I’m thinking rationally here—and there’s no rationale in this.' 'I’m not angry at Israel,' he added. 'What do I care about Israel? If it weren’t for this house, I wouldn’t even know about the whole thing. I like to run and spend time with my family. How does this concern me? I took my kids to school and took public transportation to work. Then my wife called me and said I should probably come home.

Mohamed Al Fayed, former Harrods boss, accused of multiple rapes	A year after his death BBC releases an investigative report in which over 20 women accuse Al Fayed of sexual assault, five alleging rape claiming he would promote attractive women to work in his office and then assault them Five women claimed Mohamed Al Fayed, the former owner of Harrods, had raped them while they were employed at Harrods, London's luxury department store, a BBC investigative report said. BBC gathered testimony from more than 20 former female employees, many of whom claim the billionaire sexually assaulted or raped them. Al Fayed, who passed away last year at 94, was alleged to have committed these crimes during his ownership of Harrods. The documentary and podcast, Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods, revealed evidence suggesting that not only did Harrods fail to intervene but had helped cover up the abuse. The store’s current owners expressed their shock and condemnation over the allegations, apologizing to the victims and acknowledging that they had been failed. 'The spider’s web of corruption and abuse in this company was unbelievable and very dark,' said barrister Bruce Drummond, who represents several of the women. Since the initial report, more former Harrods employees have come forward, saying they were also assaulted by Al Fayed. Allegations of rape across multiple cities The incidents reportedly took place in locations including London, Paris, St. Tropez, and Abu Dhabi. One woman said Al Fayed raped her in his Park Lane apartment. 'I made it obvious that I didn't want that to happen. I did not give consent. I just wanted it to be over,' she said. Another woman, who said she was a teenager at the time, claimed Al Fayed raped her at the same Mayfair address. 'Mohamed Al Fayed was a monster, a sexual predator with no moral compass whatsoever,' she said, adding that Harrods staff were treated as his 'playthings.' Fayed, whose son Dodi died in a car crash with Princess Diana in 1997, faced claims of sexual assault during his lifetime. However, the scale and severity of the recent allegations are unprecedented. Harrods' toxic culture Several women describe a toxic environment at Harrods when it was owned by Al Fayed. Sophia, who worked as his personal assistant from 1988 to 1991, said he attempted to rape her more than once. 'That makes me angry; people shouldn’t remember him as pleasant. That’s not how he was,' she said. Former staff members told the BBC that Al Fayed regularly scouted the sales floors, selecting attractive young female assistants to be promoted to work in his offices where many of the alleged assaults took place. Other claims were of assault in his London apartment, or during overseas trips to properties like the Ritz Hotel in Paris, which he also owned. 'We watched each other walk through that door thinking, ‘You poor girl, it's you today,’' said Alice, a former employee, recalling the fear and helplessness that surrounded the abuse. Assaults in Paris and beyond Rachel, who worked as Al Fayed’s assistant in the 1990s, said he raped her at his Park Lane apartment. 'I remember feeling his body on me, the weight of him, and just hearing him make these noises,' she said. 'He raped me.' Sophia said she felt trapped in her job. 'I couldn’t leave. I didn’t have a family home to go back to. I had to pay rent,' she said. Gemma, who worked as one of Al Fayed’s assistants from 2007 to 2009, described a terrifying ordeal during a work trip to his Villa Windsor property in Paris. She said he raped her there, then instructed her to wash herself with Dettol. 'He wanted me to erase any trace of him being near me,' she said. Eight other women told the BBC they were sexually assaulted at Al Fayed’s Paris properties. and five described the attacks as attempted rape. An open secret Tony Leeming, a Harrods department manager from 1994 to 2004, said the abuse of women wasn’t a secret. 'It wasn’t even a secret on the shop floor. Anyone who says they didn’t know is lying,' he said. Several former Harrods security staff backed these claims, revealing that they were aware of Al Fayed’s inappropriate behavior toward young female employees. They also disclosed that some women underwent invasive sexual health checks, the results of which were sent to Al Fayed. A culture of fear pervaded the store, with many employees believing their phones were tapped and that they were being filmed. Eamon Coyle, former deputy director of security, confirmed that part of his role was listening to recorded calls. 'He [Al Fayed] bugged everybody he wanted to bug,' Coyle said. Attempts to expose the abuse Al Fayed faced scrutiny during his lifetime. A 1995 Vanity Fair article alleged racism, staff surveillance, and sexual misconduct. Fayed dropped a subsequent libel lawsuit, provided any further evidence of his misconduct would be locked away. Other media outlets, including ITV’s The Big Story and Channel 4’s Dispatches, also aired serious allegations against him. Despite these reports, it is only now—after Al Fayed’s death—that many women feel able to speak publicly about rape and attempted rape. Several of them had been bound by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which were used to suppress allegations in exchange for settlements. Legal claims and settlements In July 2023, Harrods’ current owners began settling civil claims brought by women who alleged that they were sexually assaulted while working at the store. Harrods has pledged to settle the claims quickly and without requiring NDAs. The barristers representing the women argue that Harrods was responsible for creating an unsafe working environment. 'Any place of work has a duty to ensure the safety of its employees. Without question, the company failed these ladies,' Drummond said. 'They enabled it.' Gemma, who was among those to sign an NDA after she was raped, said she hopes speaking out now will help others heal. 'I’ve spent so many years being quiet, not speaking up,' she said. 'I hope talking about it now helps.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1juw6fac	2024-09-19T11:26:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/09/23/BJcoHg97K/BJcoHg97K_0_15_1508_849_0_small.jpg
Air Force strikes 30 launchers loaded with 150 rockets aimed at I...	Jets fly over the Beqaa Valley and break the sound barrier over Beirut during Nasrallah's speech; IDF says it also struck Hezbollah structures and weapons storage facilities in South Lebanon Air Force jets struck 30 Hezbollah launchers ready to fire 150 rockets toward Israel, the IDF said on Thursday evening. The military said the strikes were made based on intelligence information adding that military structures and weapons storage facilities in several areas in South Lebanon were also hit. The military earlier announced it was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon to degrade the terror group's capabilities and infrastructure. The IDF has rarely revealed its attacks while they were still underway. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization has turned southern Lebanon into a combat zone. For decades, Hezbollah has weaponized civilian homes, dug tunnels beneath them, and used civilians as human shields,' the IDF said. Leading up to and during a televised speech of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, his first since the coordinated explosions over two days, of his group's communication devices, Lebanese media outlets reported Israeli jets flying over the Beqaa Valley and over Beirut's southern sector, both Hezbollah strongholds. The planes flying over the Lebanese capital broke the sound barrier making loud noise that was heard throughout the city as residents watched Nasrallah speak. Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel's north along the border and in the Golan Heights, throughout the afternoon after anti-tank missile fire earlier in the day, resulted in the killing of two IDF servicemen and the wounding of at least one other. Power outages were reported in the coastal Israeli city of Nahariya after a power line was hit in the afternoon attack. The military also said earlier that the IDF Chief of Staff had approved the battle plans for an offensive on Lebanon and was prepared for the government to give the go-ahead. Also, earlier the IDF said its forces had thwarted a Hezbollah terror attack on the border on Monday. 'IDF soldiers conducting operations on the northern border identified two Hezbollah terrorists planting explosive devices on the border with Lebanon. The soldiers directed artillery and an aircraft which struck and eliminated the terrorists as they attempted to conduct the attack in the area of the 'Tziporen' post,' the military said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjmrwjqta	2024-09-19T11:12:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/rJKoZAY6C/rJKoZAY6C_0_728_961_540_0_small.jpg

I grabbed it by the head, but it wouldn't release me' Thai woman...	Snake attacks a woman in her kitchen coiling itself around her body and holding her captive for hours before a neighbor calls police and the struggle to release her begins A 64-year-old woman was preparing to do her evening dishes at her home outside Bangkok when she felt a sharp pain in her thigh and looked down to see a huge python taking hold of her. 'I was about to scoop some water and when I sat down it bit me immediately, Arom Arunroj told Thailand's Thairath newspaper. 'When I looked I saw the snake wrapping around me.' The four-to-five-meter-long (13-to-16-foot-long) python coiled itself around her torso, squeezing her down to the floor of her kitchen. 'I grabbed it by the head, but it wouldn't release me,' she said. 'It only tightened.' Pythons are non-venomous constrictors, which kill their prey by gradually squeezing the breath out of it. Propped up against her kitchen door, she cried for help but it wasn't until a neighbor happened to be walking by about an hour and a half later and heard her screams that authorities were called. Responding police officer Anusorn Wongmalee told The Associated Press on Thursday that when he arrived the woman was still leaning against her door, looking exhausted and pale, with the snake coiled around her. Police and animal control officers used a crowbar to hit the snake on the head until it released its grip and slithered away before it could be captured. In all, Arom spent about two hours on Tuesday night in the clutches of the python before being freed. She was treated for several bites but appeared to be otherwise unharmed in videos of her talking to Thai media shortly after the incident. Encounters with snakes are not uncommon in Thailand, and last year 26 people were killed by venomous snake bites, according to government statistics. A total of 12,000 people were treated for venomous bites by snakes and other animals 2023. The reticulated python is the largest snake found in Thailand and usually ranges in size from 1.5 meters to 6.5 meters (5 to 21 feet), weighing up to about 75 kilograms (165 pounds). They have been found as big as 10 meters (33 feet) long and 130 kilograms (287 pounds). Smaller pythons feed on small mammals such as rats, but larger snakes switch to prey such as pigs, deer and even domestic dogs and cats. Attacks on humans are not common, though do happen occasionally. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk116sckpc	2024-09-19T10:32:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/BkgFp0tTC/BkgFp0tTC_0_134_459_259_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah chief calls the coordinated explosions a declaration of war, a massacre and a genocide that broke all rules; during his speech Israeli jets reported flying low over Beirut Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech on Thursday that the coordinated attack attributed to Israel was the most severe and unprecedented blow in the history of the conflict. 'This is a declaration of war,' he said. 'We know the enemy has technological superiority especially supported by the U.S. and the West. We bet on Jihad, attrition. We've won many times before.' מזכ'ל חיזבאללה חסן נסראללה התגרה בנאומו בישראל ואמר כי 'ההצעה של אלוף פיקוד הצפון להקים חגורת אבטחה בדרום לבנון היא מטופשת. אנחנו מקווים שהם יישמו אותה אנחנו רואים בכך הזדמנות היסטורית שיהיו לה השפעות גדולות על הקרב. הם מוזמנים. זו הזדמנות היסטורית שאנחנו מחכים לה.אם האויב יקים רצועת ביטחון עליו לדעת שהיא תהפוך למלכודת, בוץ, למארב. הוא יעמוד בפני חשבון קשה'. הוא הוסיף: 'המתקפות בשלישי ורביעי ייענו בעונש הולם. אנחנו בשלב הכי רגיש במערכה'. During the terror group's leader's televised speech, the first he has made since the coordinated explosions of Hezbollah's communication devices on Tuesday and Wednesday, Lebanese media reported Israeli fighter jets flying over Beirut, breaking the sound barrier. Earlier media outlets reported jets over the Beqaa Valley and areas in the South. Nasrallah said Israel broke all rules in the coordinated explosions of the group's communications devices on Tuesday and Wednesday. He said the Israelis did not care if the pagers were among civilians, claiming dozens were killed including women and children and thousands wounded. 'This is an act of terror, a massacre, a genocide,' he said. The terrorist leader also thanked Lebanon's government, Iran and health officials for their actions in the wake of the explosions. He said Israel had intended to kill thousands in its coordinated attack on the terror group's communication devices but had failed. He also claimed that the pagers and communication devices that detonated, were not used by senior members of the Iran-backed group. 'The enemy tried to destroy Hezbollah's command structure and hurt its leaders and cause chaos in our organization but that has not happened. We are prepared for all eventualities,' he said Nasrallah said Israel had admitted to losing its north and that forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant to find a solution after Israel's first historic defeat that is testimony to the effectiveness of Hezbollah's attacks. 'Israel has been trying from day one to stop the Lebanese support for Gaza,' he said adding the conflict on the border is an important player in the Palestinian resistance's efforts to end the attacks in Gaza. 'The Lebanese front would not stop until Israeli aggression in Gaza ends,' he said. Nasrallah addressed Netanyahu and Gallant directly in his speech and said they will not be able to return the residents of Israel's north to their homes unless they end the war in Gaza and the West Bank.

Polling shows Vice President trails behind Jewish Green Party candidate and Republican Donald Trump in state home to large Muslim community angered over Biden policy on Gaza war Arab-American and Muslim voters angry at U.S. support for Israel's offensive in Gaza are shunning Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential race to back third-party candidate Jill Stein in numbers that could deny Harris victories in battleground states that will decide the Nov. 5 election. A Council on American-Islamic Relations poll released this month showed that in Michigan, home to a large Arab American community, 40% of Muslim voters backed the Green Party's Stein. Republican candidate Donald Trump got 18% with Harris, who is President Joe Biden's vice president, trailing at 12%. Stein also leads Harris among Muslims in Arizona and Wisconsin, battleground states with sizable Muslim populations where Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by slim margins. Harris was the leading pick of Muslim voters in Georgia and Pennsylvania, while Trump prevailed in Nevada with 27%, just ahead of Harris' 26%, according to the CAIR poll of 1,155 Muslim voters nationwide. All are battleground states that have swung on narrow margins in recent elections. Biden won the 2020 Muslim vote, credited in some exit polls with more than 80% of their support, but Muslim backing of Democrats has fallen sharply since Israel's nearly year-long action in Gaza. About 3.5 million Americans reported being of Middle Eastern descent in the 2020 U.S. Census, the first year such data was recorded. Although they make up about 1% of the total U.S. population of 335 million, their voters may prove crucial in a race that opinion polls show to be close. On Tuesday, Harris called for an end to the Israel-Gaza war and the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. She also said Israel must not reoccupy the Palestinian enclave and backed a two-state solution. But at closed-door meetings in Michigan and elsewhere, Harris campaign officials have rebuffed appeals to halt or limit U.S. arms shipments to Israel, community leaders say. 'Decades of community organizing and civic engagement and mobilizing have not manifested into any benefit,' said Faye Nemer, founder of the Michigan-based MENA American Chamber of Commerce to promote U.S. trade with the Middle East. 'We're part of the fabric of this country, but our concerns are not taken into consideration,' she said. Stein is aggressively campaigning on Gaza, while Trump representatives are meeting with Muslim groups and promising a swifter peace than Harris can deliver. The Harris campaign declined to comment on the shifting dynamics; officials tasked with Muslim outreach were not available for interviews. Stein's 2016 run ended with just over 1% of the popular vote, but some Democrats blamed her and the Green Party for taking votes away from Democrat Hillary Clinton. Pollsters give Stein no chance of winning in 2024. But her support for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, for an immediate U.S. arms embargo on Israel and for student movements to force universities to divest from weapons investments have made her a star in pro-Palestinian circles. Her running mate Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is Muslim. This month Stein spoke at ArabCon in Dearborn, Michigan, an annual gathering of Arab Americans and was featured on the cover of The Arab American News under the headline 'The Choice 2024.' Last week in an interview with The Breakfast Club, a New York radio program, she said, 'Every vote cast for our campaign is a vote against genocide,' a charge that Israel denies. Trump team campaigns for Arab American votes At the same time, the Trump team has hosted dozens of in-person and virtual events with Arab Americans and Muslims in Michigan and Arizona, said Richard Grenell, Trump's former acting Director of National Intelligence. 'Arab American leaders in Detroit know this is their moment to send a powerful message to the Democrat party that they shouldn't be taken for granted,' Grenell said. Trump has said he would secure more Arab-Israeli peace deals. The Trump outreach and Stein's appeal could translate into numbers that might threaten Harris. The Green Party is on most state ballots, including all battleground states that could decide the election, except for Georgia and Nevada, where the party is suing to be included. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by just thousands of votes in some states, thanks in part to the support of Arab and Muslim voters in states where they are concentrated, including Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes in 2020, but Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton there by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016. The state is home to overlapping groups of more than 200,000 registered voters who are Muslim and 300,000 who report ancestry from the Middle East and North Africa. In Philadelphia, which has a large Black Muslim population, activists have joined a national 'Abandon Harris' campaign. They helped organize protests during her debate with Trump last week. Philadelphia CAIR co-chair Rabiul Chowdhury said, 'We have options. If Trump pledges to end the war and bring home all hostages, it's game over for Harris.' Trump has said the war would never have erupted if he were president. It's unclear how he would end it. Trump is a firm supporter of Israel. In Georgia, where Biden won in 2020 by 11,779 votes, activists are rallying 12,000 voters to commit to withhold votes from Harris unless the Biden administration acts by Oct. 10 to halt all arms shipments to Israel, demands a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the West Bank, and pledges to uphold a U.S. law that imposes an arms embargo on nations engaged in war crimes. Thousands have already signed similar pledges in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. U.S. Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, said he worries about the impact the Gaza war will have in November. He said not only Arab Americans and Muslims, but a much broader group of younger voters and others are also upset. 'You can't unring a bell,' he said, adding Harris still had 'the space and grace' to shift gears, but time was running out. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk3k8jypr	2024-09-19T06:58:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/Hk0PnYFTR/Hk0PnYFTR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah pager blasts traced to shadowy Bulgarian firm	After Taiwan and Hungary, attention now turns to Bulgaria, where local media identify Norte Global as company behind sale of pagers to Hezbollah; firm’s official website offers little information, with no contact details or company specifics available The Taiwanese manufacturer of the pagers that exploded across Lebanon this week has shifted blame to a Hungarian company, while new details have emerged linking the devices to a mysterious firm in Bulgaria. As Hezbollah grapples with the aftermath of Wednesday’s walkie-talkie explosions, the focus now turns to how the pagers, which detonated on Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, reached the group. The pagers in question, AR-924 models from Taiwan's Gold Apollo, were allegedly sold by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Budapest. However, BAC CEO Cristina Arcidiacono-Barsony, asserted that the firm was 'only an intermediary.' A report by the Hungarian news outlet Telex claims the devices were imported to Lebanon from Bulgaria by a company named Norta Global Ltd., based in Sofia and owned by a Norwegian national. Norta Global’s website offers little information, lacking contact details and listing no personnel. The company's purported manager, identified as Rinsan Hawes, has no digital footprint. On Wednesday, Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs said that the pagers were not manufactured in Hungary. 'Authorities have established that the company in question is a trading intermediary with no manufacturing site in Hungary. The devices were never in the country,' Kovacs said. According to sources cited by Telex, BAC’s CEO was involved with the Bulgarian company. Despite BAC holding the contract with Gold Apollo, it was reportedly Norta Global that managed the deal, importing the pagers from Taiwan and arranging their sale to Hezbollah. Bulgaria's National Security Agency has since launched an investigation, saying that no approval was found for relevant sales and that the only known transaction involved 1.6 million euros being transferred to Hungary. Thousands of pagers were delivered to Hezbollah as part of an effort to establish a secure communication system. Distribution accelerated after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah urged members to avoid cellphones, calling them agents of Israel, and endorsed pagers as a safer alternative. Meanwhile, the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday were purchased around the same time as the pagers in April. Icom Inc., the Japanese manufacturer of the handheld radios that reportedly exploded in Lebanon, said it discontinued those models a decade ago. The company is investigating, and on Thursday confirmed that its IC-V82 devices were exported to the Middle East between 2004 and 2014. Shock in Lebanon The unprecedented attacks, which Hezbollah has attributed to Israel, have sent shockwaves through the Lebanese population. 'People are panicking and trying to get rid of their wireless devices,' reported the Saudi Al Hadath network, quoting Iranian sources who noted that the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday are also widely used in Iran. According to the New York Times, the walkie-talkies were larger and heavier than the pagers that exploded the day before, and the resulting fires were more intense due to the greater amount of explosives used. Meanwhile, as U.S. officials continue to push for a diplomatic solution to prevent further escalation, Ibrahim al-Amin, editor of Hezbollah’s Al Akhbar newspaper, published an editorial titled 'The War of Annihilation, Lebanese Edition — Israel Wants to Eliminate Hezbollah.' He wrote that Israel seems to be preparing for a new phase of conflict with Hezbollah, targeting the group’s human and military capabilities, making talk of an all-out war increasingly realistic. 'If the enemy has decided to carry out operations against more than 10,000 people, military personnel, and civilians, in command centers, outposts, or homes, then it has decided that we are in a war without rules,' al-Amin concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rycmgfkaa	2024-09-19T06:05:30-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/SyIOeuYa0/SyIOeuYa0_253_57_959_540_0_small.jpg

Explosive toll: Hezbollah deaths mount from south to the north in...	Terror group reports 37 killed across Lebanon following series of mysterious explosions; dead range from 16 to 54 years old, mostly from south; Nasrallah set to speak Thursday; Israel believes true toll much higher The list of Hezbollah’s fatalities in the last two days is remarkably diverse, with 37 operatives killed in communication device explosions all across Lebanon. The list includes operatives from various regions, such as the Bekaa Valley, the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahieh in Beirut, multiple locations in southern Lebanon and the Akkar region in the north. The youngest victim named is Abdel Moneim Jamal Abdel Moneim, a 16-year-old originally from Aitroun, who lived in southern Lebanon’s Kawthariyat al-Raz. The oldest was Hassan Adel Jaber, born in 1970, from Beni Hayyan in southern Lebanon. All the deceased were referred to in Hezbollah’s official statements as 'martyrs on the path to Jerusalem,' a term the group has used for its fighters since the war began. None were given titles indicating senior roles in the organization. The exact circumstances of their deaths remain unclear, as Hezbollah did not disclose whether they were killed in the pager and walkie-talkie explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday, or in recent targeted Israeli strikes. Lebanese media reports on Wednesday evening indicated additional Israeli strikes near the border following the communication device explosions. Since the start of the conflict, Hezbollah has reported a total of 477 fatalities. Israeli estimates suggest that the official death toll reported by Hezbollah is significantly lower than the reality, with likely dozens more killed. The elite Radwan force is believed to have suffered substantial losses, including senior command members, over the course of the war and in the past two days’ explosions. At least 450 have been wounded in the walkie-talkie explosions, adding to over 3,000 Hezbollah fighters injured in the pager blasts. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah is expected to deliver his first public address since the explosions Thursday afternoon. The 37 Hezbollah members who have been named since Tuesday are as follows: Yousef Madi Alwa, born 1986, from Bekaa; Hassan Ahmed Mohammed, born 1992, from Habushit in Akkar; Najib Abdul-Hussein Alaa Al-Din, born 1991, from Majdal Selm, South Lebanon; Hassan Mohammad Yassin, born 1986, from Majdal Selm; Hussein Ali Alaa Al-Din, born 1989, from Majdal Selim; Hussein Ahmad Mentesh, born 1994, from Kfar Sir, South Lebanon; Mohammed Zakaria Abbas, born 1986, from Jiyyeh, Mount Lebanon; Abbas Bilal Mon'em, born 1996, from Sohmor, West Bekaa; Mohammed Mahdi Ali Ammar, born 1985, from Dahieh, Beirut; Hussein Ayoub Faqih, born 1988, from Burj Shemali, South Lebanon; Abbas Fadl Yassin, born 1993, from Zuqaq Al-Blat, Beirut; Mahdi Abbas Samhat, born 1995, from Al-Tayri, South Lebanon; Ali Muhammad Shalabi, born 1993, from Kfar Melki, South Lebanon; Ali Muhammad Tarhini, born 2001, from Ebba, South Lebanon; Ibrahim Abdul Karim Zain al-Din, born 1995, from Safad El Battikh, South Lebanon; Abdel Moneim Jamal Abdel Moneim, born 2008, from Aitroun, living in Kawthariyat al-Raz, South Lebanon; Fadl Abbas Bazzi, born 1991, from Bint Jbeil, South Lebanon; Mohammad Hussein Al-Arab, born 1979, from Flaoueh, Bekaa; Hafez Hussein Ali Melhem, born 1976, from Qabrikha, South Lebanon; Ali Hassani Zuaitar, born 1999, from Baalbek, Bekaa; Ahmad Ali Lamaa', born 1982, from Aadchit, South Lebanon; Ali Fawaz Al-Hajj Hassan, born 1991, from Shaath, Bekaa; Jawad Yasser Abu Khalil, born 2005, from Kawthariyat al-Raz, South Lebanon; Mohammed Hassan Kourani, born 1982, from Yater, South Lebanon; Ali Ahmad Haidar, born 1986, from Kfar Dan, Bekaa; Muhammad Ali Alama, born 1983, from Adloun, South Lebanon; Ali Hussein Hammoud, born 1991, from Toulin, South Lebanon; Abbas Hassan Saif Al-Din, born 1987, from Halbata, Bekaa; Hassan Adel Jaber, born 1970, from Bani Hayyan, South Lebanon; Salim Abbas Shehadi, born 1974, from Maaroub, South Lebanon; Ahmed Ali Hassan, born 1998, from Aitroun, South Lebanon; Ali Mohammed Suleiman Samhat, born 1994, from Ainatha, South Lebanon; Nathir Yousef Noun, born 1971, from Bekaa; Fadlallah Shehadeh Msheik, born 1970, from Bekaa; Hussein Ali Amhaz, born 1971, from Bekaa; Bassam Hussein Ftouni, born 1975, from Khirbet Selm, South Lebanon and Jaafar Ahmad al-Hussein, born 1989, from Bekaa. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1y7tff60	2024-09-19T05:41:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/Bkiljctp0/Bkiljctp0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Jihadist attacks in Mali leave over 70 dead, security sources say	Jihadist attacks on Tuesday targeting a gendarmerie school and the military airport in Bamako, the capital of Mali, resulted in over 70 deaths and 200 injuries, marking one of the deadliest tolls in recent years for the security forces. A security source reported 77 dead and 255 injured, while an authenticated official confidential document indicated around 100 deaths, naming 81 victims. The daily newspaper Le Soir de Bamako reported on its front page that 'the funerals of about fifty gendarmerie cadets' would be held this Thursday. The Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (GSIM or JNIM, according to its Arabic acronym), which claimed responsibility for the operation, stated through its communication channels that a few dozen of its fighters had inflicted hundreds of casualties in the opposing camp, including among members of the Russian Wagner group, an ally of the Bamako military regime. The group said its fighters were later killed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjm2uktta	2024-09-19T04:21:30-07:00

Veteran CIA officer who drugged and sexually assaulted dozens of ...	Brian Jeffrey Raymond's victims described being deceived by a man who appeared kind, educated and part of an agency 'that is supposed to protect the world from evil' A longtime CIA officer who drugged, photographed and sexually assaulted more than two dozen women in postings around the world was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison Wednesday after an emotional hearing in which victims described being deceived by a man who appeared kind, educated and part of an agency 'that is supposed to protect the world from evil.' Brian Jeffrey Raymond, with a graying beard and orange prison jumpsuit, sat dejectedly as he heard his punishment for one of the most egregious misconduct cases in the CIA’s history. It was chronicled in his own library of more than 500 images that showed him in some cases straddling and groping his nude, unconscious victims. 'It’s safe to say he’s a sexual predator,' U.S. Senior Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in imposing the full sentence prosecutors had requested. 'You are going to have a period of time to think about this.' Prosecutors say the 48-year-old Raymond’s assaults date to 2006 and tracked his career in Mexico, Peru and other countries, all following a similar pattern: He would lure women he met on Tinder and other dating apps to his government-leased apartment and drug them while serving wine and snacks. Once they were unconscious, he spent hours posing their naked bodies before photographing and assaulting them. He opened their eyelids at times and stuck his fingers in their mouths. One by one, about a dozen of Raymond’s victims who were identified only by numbers in court recounted how the longtime spy upended their lives. Some said they only learned what happened after the FBI showed them the photos of being assaulted while unconscious. 'My body looks like a corpse on his bed,' one victim said of the photos. 'Now I have these nightmares of seeing myself dead.' One described suffering a nervous breakdown. Another spoke of a recurring trance that caused her to run red lights while driving. Many told how their confidence and trust in others had been shattered forever. 'I hope he is haunted by the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life,' said one of the women, who like others stared Raymond down as they walked away from the podium. Reading from a statement, Raymond told the judge that he has spent countless hours contemplating his 'downward spiral.' 'It betrayed everything I stand for and I know no apology will ever be enough,' he said. 'There are no words to describe how sorry I am. That’s not who I am and yet it’s who I became.' Raymond’s sentencing comes amid a reckoning on sexual misconduct at the CIA. The Associated Press reported last week that another veteran CIA officer faces state charges in Virginia for allegedly reaching up a co-worker’s skirt and forcibly kissing her during a drunken party in the office. Still another former CIA employee — an officer trainee — is scheduled to face a jury trial next month on charges he assaulted a woman with a scarf in a stairwell at the agency’s Langley, Virginia, headquarters. That case emboldened some two dozen women to come forward to authorities and Congress with accounts of their own of sexual assaults, unwanted touching and what they contend are the CIA’s efforts to silence them. And yet the full extent of sexual misconduct at the CIA remains a classified secret in the name of national security, including a recent 648-page internal watchdog report that found systemic shortcomings in the agency’s handling of such complaints. 'The classified nature of the activities allowed the agency to hide a lot of things,' said Liza Mundy, author of 'Sisterhood: The Secret History of Women at the CIA.' The male-dominated agency, she said, has long been a refuge for egregious sexual misconduct. 'For decades, men at the top had free rein.' CIA has publicly condemned Raymond’s crimes and implemented sweeping reforms intended to keep women safe, streamline claims and more quickly discipline offenders. 'There is absolutely no excuse for Mr. Raymond’s reprehensible, appalling behavior,' the agency said Wednesday. 'As this case shows, we are committed to engaging with law enforcement.' But a veil of secrecy still surrounds the Raymond case nearly four years after his arrest. Even after Raymond pleaded guilty late last year, prosecutors have tiptoed around the exact nature of his work and declined to disclose a complete list of the countries where he assaulted women. Still, they offered an unbridled account of Raymond’s conduct, describing him as a 'serial offender' whose assaults increased over time and become 'almost frenetic' during his final CIA posting in Mexico City, where he was discovered in 2020 after a naked woman screamed for help from his apartment balcony. U.S. officials scoured Raymond’s electronic devices and began identifying the victims he had listed by name and physical characteristics, all of whom described experiencing some form of memory loss during their time with him. One victim said Raymond seemed like a 'perfect gentleman' when they met in Mexico in 2020, recalling only that they kissed. Unbeknownst to the woman, after she blacked out, he took 35 videos and close-up photos of her breasts and genitals. 'The defendant’s manipulation often resulted in women blaming themselves for losing consciousness, feeling ashamed, and apologizing to the defendant,' prosecutors wrote in a court filing. 'He was more than willing to gaslight the women, often suggesting that the women drank too much and that, despite their instincts to the contrary, nothing had happened.' Raymond, a San Diego native and former White House intern who is fluent in Spanish and Mandarin, ultimately pleaded guilty to four of 25 federal counts including sexual abuse, coercion and transportation of obscene material. As part of his sentence, the judge ordered him to pay $10,000 to each of his 28 victims. Raymond’s attorneys had sought leniency, contending his 'quasi-military' work at the CIA in the years following 9/11 became a breeding ground for the emotional callousness and 'objectification of other people' that enabled his years of preying upon women. 'While he was working tirelessly at his government job, he ignored his own need for help, and over time he began to isolate himself, detach himself from human feelings and become emotionally numb,' defense attorney Howard Katzoff wrote in a court filing. 'He was an invaluable government worker, but it took its toll on him and sent him down a dark path.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by3rxky6r	2024-09-19T04:04:46-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/SyJJQUtpC/SyJJQUtpC_0_250_1194_673_0_small.jpg

Cyberattack sends Israelis rushing for cover with fake emergency ...	IDF clarifies not source of error-riddled messages falsely attributed to Home Front Command; more menacing messages follow, including one allegedly from 'Nasrallah,' reading, 'Say goodbye to your loved ones' Many Israelis received alarming SMS messages on Wednesday night urging them to immediately enter protected areas, in what appears to be a cyberattack impersonating the Home Front Command. The messages, which follow recent pager and walkie-talkie explosions in Lebanon, have been confirmed by the IDF as fraudulent. The messages were sent from 'OREFAlert,' mimicking the Hebrew name for the Home Front Command, Pikud HaOref. The message, riddled with spelling errors, warned: 'Emergency alert, you must immediately enter a protected area,' and included a malicious link. 'I received such a message. It seems fake. Maybe Hezbollah?' one reader wrote in an email to Ynet. Others speculated it could be a phishing attempt, a virus or an Iranian cyberattack. The IDF confirmed that the Home Front Command did not send the messages and said the incident is under investigation. 'There is currently no change in the Home Front Command’s instructions,' the army said. Later that night, additional threatening messages were received by Israelis. One, purportedly from 'SyHaNasrala,' read: 'Say goodbye to your loved ones; but don’t worry. You will embrace them in hell in a few hours.' Another message, written in English from 'NEMA,' read, 'If you want to live, leave. If you want to stay, go to hell,' also including a malicious link. A text message from 'CyberIL' claimed, 'Hackers have full access to your devices. Return to factory settings,' with another link that appeared to be harmful. Authorities are urging the public not to click on any suspicious links and to report any such messages to the relevant authorities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syg1zntp0	2024-09-19T02:33:12-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/BJNm5yFpR/BJNm5yFpR_37_291_835_471_0_small.jpg
Panic in Lebanon: 'Maybe tomorrow cigarette lighters will explode...	Lebanese fear electronic devices not done exploding; international media captivated by saga; this is how the drama played out step-by-step Thousands were injured Tuesday when pagers exploded, followed by hundreds more on Wednesday as handheld radios detonated, leaving Lebanon on edge for what might come next. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced a 'new phase in the war,' while IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi approved battle plans. Meanwhile, fear gripped Lebanon amid speculation about the next potential target: 'Maybe lighters will explode tomorrow? If you want to light a cigarette, it might blow up in your hands.' The unprecedented attacks, which Hezbollah has attributed to Israel, have sent shockwaves through the Lebanese population. 'People are panicking and trying to get rid of their wireless devices,' reported the Saudi Al Hadath network, citing Iranian sources who noted that the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday are also widely used in Iran. According to the New York Times, the walkie-talkies were larger and heavier than the pagers that exploded the day before, and the resulting fires were more intense due to the greater amount of explosives used. Although there were fewer walkie-talkies in circulation than pagers, Wednesday’s attack left 450 injured and 20 dead, compared to over 2,700 injured and 13 dead on Tuesday. 'I saw something you only see in the movies,' Hussein Awada, 54, told the Times, recalling how a man attempting to clear a path for ambulances in Beirut was gravely injured when the walkie-talkie in his hand exploded. 'It took seconds. It just blew up in his hands. Maybe lighters will explode tomorrow?' The Times editorial board remarked that while the attacks demonstrate 'tactical strength,' the long-term strategy remains unclear. Media outlets around the world have made these attacks their top story: the New York Post headlined 'Beep Beep Boom'; the Daily Mail ran with 'Tech War Spreads'; and CNN’s main headline read, 'Hezbollah Walkie-Talkies Explode Across Lebanon.' Firsthand accounts of the pager explosions were published in the Guardian. 'I didn’t understand what was happening. My first thought was that it was a terrorist attack,' said Ali, a 22-year-old trader. 'People started throwing their phones away in fear, thinking they would explode. I saw a man whose face was cut in half. His eyes were popping out, and blood was everywhere.' Outside a Beirut hospital, a doctor described a patient who lost consciousness from severe burns and lacerations to his face, neck and lips, 'as if he had been hit by a rocket.' The Lebanese daily An-Nahar reported similar scenes in hospitals across the country. Dr. Elias Jarade, a member of parliament and an ophthalmologist at the Beirut Ophthalmology Center, said some of the injured lost their sight, with surgeries lasting up to five hours. Dr. Elias Warak, another ophthalmology expert, described the incident as a 'real nightmare,' noting that most of the injured were in their 20s, suggesting many were Hezbollah operatives. The paper called the attacks a 'tragedy that has shaken the country and the world.' Dr. Elias Warak, an expert in ophthalmology, described the incident as a 'real nightmare' and said that most of the injured were in their 20s, which suggests that the great majority of them are Hezbollah operatives. The newspaper says that the evidence reflects 'the tragedy that shocked the country and the world.' How the attacks in Lebanon played out, step by step: Sunday, 12:50 p.m.: After more than 11 months of fighting in northern Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declares at a Security Cabinet meeting that 'the current situation cannot continue. We need to shift the balance of power on our northern border. We will do everything necessary to ensure the safe return of our residents. I am committed to this, the government is committed to this and we will settle for nothing less.' Monday, 7:30 a.m.: Following a conversation between Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Gallant issues a statement conveying Israel’s firm stance. 'The possibility of an agreement on the north is passing and the direction is clear,' Austin reportedly said. Meanwhile, Netanyahu is considering replacing Gallant with New Hope Party head Gideon Sa’ar. Monday, 6:00 p.m.: Gallant meets with White House special Middle East envoy Amos Hochstein and tells him that 'he only way to bring northern residents back to their homes is through military action. Netanyahu delivered a similar message to Hochstein an hour later: 'Our residents cannot return without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north.' Tuesday, 6:00 a.m.: Nearly a year after hostilities began and tens of thousands of residents were displaced, the Security Cabinet updates the war objectives to include a new goal: the safe return of citizens to their homes in the north. Tuesday, 1:30 p.m.: The Shin Bet announces it had foiled a Hezbollah plot to assassinate a former senior security official using a Claymore anti-personnel mine, which was set to detonate in the coming days. The announcement also revealed that an explosion in Yarkon Park last September, on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, was an attempted Hezbollah attack targeting former IDF chief of staff and defense minister Moshe Ya’alon. Sources suggest that the timing of this announcement was intended to bolster international support for strikes against Hezbollah. Tuesday, 3:30 p.m.: Thousands of pagers held by Hezbollah operatives explode simultaneously in Lebanon and Syria. According to official reports, 12 people were killed and 2,750 injured in Lebanon. An unverified report claimed 19 Iranian Revolutionary Guards were killed and 131 wounded in Syria. Israeli officials believe the actual death toll among Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon is significantly higher, with major damage inflicted on the Radwan force. The pagers, identified as AR-924 models from Taiwanese company Gold Apollo, were traced to Budpest-based BAC Consulting KFT. BAC’s CEO denied involvement, saying they were merely an intermediary, and the company’s website subsequently went offline. Reports suggest the attack was hastily executed by Israel after Hezbollah operatives suspected something was amiss with the pagers. Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: Hundreds of handheld radios explode across Lebanon, with additional reports of explosions in home solar systems and fingerprint scanners. The Lebanese health ministry updated the death toll to 20, with 450 injured. The walkie-talkies were reportedly delivered to Hezbollah operatives at the same time around April as the pagers. Wednesday, 9:00 p.m.: Prime Minister Netanyahu’s motorcade was seen near Mossad headquarters shortly after he issued a statement saying, 'I have promised to bring our northern residents back home safely, and that is exactly what we will do.' Earlier, Gallant announced from Ramat David Airbase that 'we are at the beginning of a new phase in the war,' while the IDF chief of staff conducted a situation assessment at Northern Command, stating, 'We still have many capabilities.' Thursday: Officials will decide whether to convene the Security Cabinet or limit discussions to security consultations. The Cabinet has reportedly authorized Netanyahu and Gallant to decide on the next steps in Lebanon. Additionally, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah is expected to deliver his first public address since the attacks at 2 p.m. UTC Thursday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzloeta0	2024-09-19T02:12:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/Bydoo2d60/Bydoo2d60_0_120_608_343_0_small.jpg
Israeli businessman indicted in Iranian plot to assassinate Israe...	Suspect in his 70s charged with working with Iranian intelligence; he was smuggled into Iran twice and paid to target senior Israeli officials, including Gallant and Netanyahu; he reportedly sought $1 million advance An Israeli businessman based in Turkey was indicted Thursday on serious security charges, accused of being recruited by Iranian intelligence. Prosecutors say he was smuggled into Iran twice and demanded a $1 million payment in advance for various missions, including plotting to assassinate top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The Shin Bet and Israel Police revealed that the suspect, a Jewish man in his 70s, was arrested in August in a joint anti-terror operation by the Shin Bet and the Israel Police’s Lahav 433 serious crimes unit on suspicion of committing security offenses on behalf of the Iranian regime. The investigation revealed that while living in Turkey, the suspect maintained business and social ties with Turkish and Iranian contacts. In April, through the mediation of two Turkish nationals, identified as Andrey Farouk Aslan and Junayd Aslan, he agreed to meet a wealthy businessman in Iran named Eddy to discuss potential business ventures. The suspect traveled to the Turkish city of Samandağ, near the Syrian border, where he met with two representatives sent by Eddy, who was unable to leave Iran. They held a phone conversation with Eddy during the meeting. According to the investigation, the suspect returned to Turkey in May and met again with Andrey, Junayd and Eddy’s representatives. When it became clear that Eddy still couldn’t leave Iran, the Israeli businessman was smuggled by car across a land border near the city of Van in eastern Turkey into Iran, where he met with Eddy and another individual named Khwaja, who was introduced as an operative for the Iranian security apparatus. Assassinating top officials and threatening collaborators in Israel The suspect met with the group at Eddy's home in Iran, where he was introduced as an Israeli citizen. During the meeting, he was asked to carry out various missions in Israel on behalf of the Iranian regime. These included transferring money or a weapon to a designated location, photographing crowded areas and sending the images to Iranian agents and threatening Israeli citizens working for the regime who had failed to complete their assigned tasks. The suspect asked for time to consider the proposal before agreeing. Last month, the suspect reportedly re-entered Iran, again being smuggled through a border crossing while concealed in a truck. During his stay at Eddy’s house, he met with additional Iranian intelligence officials who asked him to carry out terror attacks in Israel, including potential assassination attempts against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. They also asked him to explore the possibility of assassinating former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, purportedly in retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July—a killing attributed to Israel. The suspect demanded a $1 million advance payment before committing to any action. The following day, he held another meeting with Iranian intelligence officials, during which they reiterated their assassination proposal and discussed other potential activities. These included depositing funds at locations in Israel, identifying Russian and U.S. officials for potential operations against Iranian regime opponents in Europe and the United States and attempting to recruit a Mossad agent as a double agent. The suspect again requested the advance payment, but the Iranian agents refused, saying they would contact him later. Before leaving Iran, he received €5,000 from Eddy and an Iranian intelligence representative for his participation in the meetings. A senior Shin Bet official described the case as a 'grave incident' that highlights Iran’s persistent efforts to recruit Israeli citizens to carry out terrorist activities in Israel. 'Our assessment is that Iranian intelligence will continue its attempts to recruit operatives in Israel for intelligence gathering and terrorism, even reaching out to criminal elements to achieve their goals,' the official said. 'While Israel is at war on multiple fronts, an Israeli citizen traveled to an enemy country twice, met with Iranian intelligence agents and expressed willingness to commit serious acts of terrorism on Israeli soil,' the official added. 'His actions have aided Iran and its intelligence agencies in their campaign against Israel.' 'We are only human' Prosecutors expressed concern over what might have happened if the defendant had received the requested advance payment. During the investigation, the Israeli businessman reportedly said, 'I don’t know what I would have done if they had given me $1 million; we are only human.' In its request to remand the defendant until the end of the proceedings, the prosecution noted that during his meetings with Iranian agents, after he informed them that assassinating high-level officials was impractical due to their security measures, additional terrorist and espionage operations were discussed, including the possibility of assassinating Bennett or certain mayors. According to the indictment, the defendant confessed to the Shin Bet to the charges against him. 'His testimony is coherent, detailed and accurately reflects the nature, background, circumstances and execution of the alleged offenses, with precise chronological and geographical data,' the prosecution said. The confession was given over the course of 14 Shin Bet interrogations and four additional police interrogations, the indictment noted. 'Throughout these investigations, he revealed more details about his actions and consistently stood by his confession, enriching it with further facts and information,' the indictment said. 'We have just received the indictment and the request for detention until the end of the proceedings, We have not yet reviewed the investigation material, so it is difficult to address the specifics of the case at this stage,' the defendant’s attorney, Eyal Bessraglick, said. 'It is important to note that this is a person who has significantly assisted Israel’s security services and whose children serve in the security forces. He made a lapse in judgment in the context of his business dealings. It is notable that the indictment does not include other charges. My client has cooperated fully with the authorities and continues to do so.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcwrhy6r	2024-09-19T01:19:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/SkpjdrKT0/SkpjdrKT0_0_8_853_481_0_small.jpg
German FM: 'Warned all parties against escalation in Middle East'	Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced that 'we have warned all parties against an escalation in the Middle East,' following explosions of Hezbollah operatives' radios in Lebanon. She added: 'For months we and our partners have been holding discussions and working to promote stability in the region.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ykplkta	2024-09-19T00:50:52-07:00	
After explosive pager attacks, Hezbollah missile strike injures 8...	Wounded taken to northern hospitals for treatment; IDF responds with artillery fire aimed at sources of attack; Hezbollah, which had vowed retaliation for mysterious explosions in Lebanon, claims responsibility for missile launch Eight people were injured Thursday morning when an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon struck the Upper Galilee. The wounded were evacuated to hospitals in northern Israel, with one person listed in serious condition, one in moderate condition and the others sustaining minor injuries. The IDF responded with artillery fire targeting the sources of the attack. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the missile strike. The incident occurred amid rising tensions following a series of mysterious explosions in Lebanon over the past two days, which have been attributed to Israel and have resulted in thousands of casualties, including Hezbollah operatives. In response to these attacks, Hezbollah has threatened retaliation. Overnight, Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck Hezbollah military sites in several southern Lebanese towns, including Chihine, Taybeh, Blida, Meiss al-Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela, according to the IDF. Additionally, aircraft targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot in Khiam. According to a New York Times report, Israeli intelligence identified an opportunity to act against Hezbollah following a speech by the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in February. In his remarks, Nasrallah warned his followers about the dangers of using mobile phones, urging them to replace them with pagers. 'The phone in your hands, in the hands of your wife and children, is the agent,' Nasrallah said. 'Bury it, put it in an iron box and lock it away.' The report noted that Nasrallah’s directive to expand the use of pagers ultimately backfired seven months later, leading to the devastating explosions. Even before Nasrallah’s speech, Israeli intelligence had begun implementing a plan to establish a fake international pager company. According to three intelligence sources, the Hungarian pager company that manufactured the devices that exploded earlier this week was set up by Israel. At least two other companies were also created to disguise the fact that the pagers were produced by Israeli intelligence officers. Budapest-based BAC Consulting KFT provided legitimate pager services to other clients, manufacturing devices without explosives. However, the pagers intended for Hezbollah operatives were produced separately, with PETN explosives concealed inside their batteries. These devices were shipped to Lebanon starting in 2022, though initially in small quantities. After Nasrallah’s speech, production ramped up quickly. In addition to banning the use of cellphones during Hezbollah meetings, he also ordered that sensitive information should never be transmitted via mobile phones, according to intelligence officials who spoke to the Times. Hezbollah officers were required to carry pagers at all times, and in the event of war, pagers were to be used to direct fighters. American intelligence officials said that over the summer, thousands of pagers were shipped to Lebanon and distributed among Hezbollah officers and their allies. While Hezbollah viewed them as a 'defensive' tool, Israeli intelligence saw them as 'buttons' that could be pressed at any moment. That moment appeared to arrive earlier this week. Meanwhile, as U.S. officials continue to push for a diplomatic solution to prevent further escalation, Ibrahim al-Amin, editor of Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper, published an editorial titled 'The War of Annihilation, Lebanese Edition — Israel Wants to Eliminate Hezbollah.' He wrote that Israel seems to be preparing for a new phase of conflict with Hezbollah, targeting the group’s human and military capabilities, making talk of an all-out war increasingly realistic. 'If the enemy has decided to carry out operations against more than 10,000 people, military personnel and civilians, in command centers, outposts or homes, then it has decided that we are in a no-holds-barred war,' al-Amin concluded. 'Ironclad' American support Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday following the explosions in Lebanon, which have been attributed to Israel by foreign media. The Pentagon said that the U.S. was not involved in the operations and that Israel had provided information about the incidents through intelligence channels. According to the Pentagon, Gallant and Austin 'reviewed regional security developments' during their call. Austin reiterated the United States’ 'ironclad' support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Hezbollah and Tehran’s regional allies. Austin emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring Israel’s adversaries and efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region. He also underscored Washington’s preference for a cease-fire agreement in Gaza that would secure the return of hostages and a 'lasting diplomatic solution to the Israel-Lebanon border conflict that would allow civilians on both sides to return to their homes.' Iran also responded to the explosions in Lebanon, which injured its ambassador to the country, Mojtaba Amani. Tehran said that it 'reserves the right under international law to take necessary measures to respond to the attack on its delegation.' Additionally, Iran called on UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council to 'condemn Israel’s terrorist act and heinous crime against the Iranian delegation in Lebanon and Lebanese sovereignty.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjltkufpa	2024-09-19T00:37:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/SyW3ph0060/SyW3ph0060_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US says Iran emailed stolen Trump campaign material to Biden camp	Intelligence agencies say malicious cyber activity 'latest example of Iran's multi-pronged approach to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process' Iranian hackers sent emails containing stolen material from Republican former President Donald Trump's campaign to people involved in Democratic President Joe Biden's then re-election campaign, part of an alleged broader effort by Tehran to influence the U.S. election, U.S. agencies said on Wednesday. 'Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump's campaign to U.S. media organizations,' the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. 'This malicious cyber activity is the latest example of Iran's multi-pronged approach ... to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process,' the agencies said. They added that there is currently no information indicating those recipients replied. They did not provide further details on the nature of the stolen material. In August, the United States accused Iran of launching cyber operations against the campaigns of both U.S. presidential candidates and targeting the American public with influence operations aimed at fanning political discord. Iran has denied interfering in U.S. affairs. On Wednesday, its permanent mission to the United Nations in New York said the latest U.S. allegations were 'fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.' It added: 'Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election.' Malicious cyber actors sent unsolicited emails to individuals in Biden's campaign in late June and early July that contained a text excerpt from stolen material from the Republican presidential candidate's campaign, the agencies said. Biden dropped out of the presidential race on July 21 and was replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate. Polls show Trump and Harris are in a tight race. In a statement, the Trump campaign said Harris and Biden should disclose whether they used the hacked material 'to hurt' Trump. The former president later said in a rally on Wednesday night that Iran hacked into his campaign to help Democrats, calling it foreign election interference. 'We're not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign,' a Harris campaign spokesperson said after the statement by U.S. agencies. 'A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt.' Tehran also says Washington has interfered in its affairs over decades ranging from a 1953 coup of a prime minister to the 2020 killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1jc9vkt0	2024-09-18T22:55:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/28/S1om80oIC/S1om80oIC_0_0_1310_738_0_small.jpg

First female soldier to die in Gaza is one of many war heroines	Female courage seen in current war: Major E. rescued hostages and crashed on the Philadelphi Corridor; Staff Sergeant Agam Naim was killed in Rafah and Sergeant Gaia Tzubari was shot while treating wounded soldiers in Shijaiyah Paramedic Staff Sergeant Agam Naim, who fell in Rafah on Tuesday, was the first female soldier to be killed in this current war since the IDF began its incursion into Gaza. For the past six months, she served in the Gaza Strip alongside the 52nd Battalion's Armored Corps, and was due to begin her leave soon. Like her, dozens of female paramedics risk their lives in the war to save the lives of others, and so do a myriad of other women in countless roles. The female medical soldiers like Naim take a crucial part in the fighting. They evacuate the wounded and provide medical treatment under fire, standing side by side with the male soldiers even in tragic events. Sergeant Gaia Tzubari, the first female soldier to be seriously injured since the IDF entered Gaza, who also lit a beacon on the last Independence Day, served as a paramedic in Gaza. She gave medical treatment to soldiers who were hit by an anti-tank missile in Shijaiyah and was shot: 'Even if I had known this would happen, I would have gone in again,' she said. 'We are being prepared for exactly this moment: treating the wounded under fire. If there is a wounded person, you go to help him, even though it's scary and your heart is pounding. Your mind is on autopilot and you run without thinking twice,' she added. On October 7, women fought and worked to save lives. Lt. Col. Yarden Shukrun, commander of the Shahar Battalion in the Rescue and Training Division, left her home in Ofakim on that Saturday morning and fought the terrorists. In an interview with Ynet, she said: 'We woke up from the sirens. I hugged my children tightly in the bomb shelter, and received an initial update about terrorists at the Home Front Command base. I took my weapon and a soldier from the battalion who lives next to us, and we ran to the base.' She added that the two joined the forces that fought the terrorists who were entrenched in the base, and after they were all eliminated, she joined other female officers from the battalion under her command. They returned to Ofakim, where they rescued residents who were besieged in their homes. 'For 72 hours we rescued people. Some of them are actually my neighbors. We made a heroic effort as a battalion together with cadets from the 1st Brigade. I was bursting with pride,' she said. Shukrun was the first female battalion commander to participate in combat, and thus actually made history. 'I don't know what will happen to the female combat soldier status in Israel the day after the war, I don't think about it either. I want to be the best rescue soldier there is. If we stick to the task, there seems to be no gap. I never felt like there was something I was told 'you can't do' only because I'm a woman. We can also operate deep in Lebanon if they have to,' she said. 'A great privilege to take part in combat' Lt. Col. Or Ben Yehuda, commander of the mixed male and female Caracal Battalion, fought on the morning of October 7 against dozens of terrorists who occupied the Sufa outpost. At Ynet's annual women's conference, held about six months ago, she said: 'Every day I feel like a winner when I see female soldiers push boundaries. People don't believe me that they load the shells by themselves and activate the system. I say to both my men and women, we had a great privilege to take part in the fighting.' The Iron Swords War has proven to be a turning point for women in the IDF, especially for female combat soldiers. From the War of Independence in 1948 until this past year, they were not given the opportunity to take such a significant part in fighting in enemy territory. Along with the achievements of female soldiers, there are also fallen heroines who died protecting Israel and its people: the female reconnaissance soldiers who warned of the upcoming attack and those who were killed in their base on October 7; the female Armored Corps soldiers who repelled terrorists in the Eshkol Region during the massacre; the late Captain Nimri who was killed on base while protecting her soldiers in Nahal Oz; and Major E. who rescued hostages in Gaza and was injured in last week's helicopter crash in the Philadelphi Corridor. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjtml2oar	2024-09-18T21:55:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/Hkpa8iOT0/Hkpa8iOT0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Hamas releases psychological terror video, threatening more suici...	Hamas posts video of its suicide bomber who blew himself up in Tel Aviv in August, and says that the IDF's continued operation in the West Bank against Palestinian terrorist insurgence 'will double the bill of revenge', as fear of escalation during holidays grows Hamas released an unusual video on Wednesday evening that presented clips from attacks in Israel in the early 2000s and the reading of the will of Jafar Muna, the terrorist who carried out the attack in Tel Aviv at the end of August. 'Every day that passes, when in the background there is aggression against our people in Gaza, will double the bill of revenge. The only thing in exchange will be blood,' he said. The attack in Tel Aviv, in which a bystander was moderately injured, has not yet been classified as a suicide bombing. However, in the psychological terror video released on Wednesday, the terrorist was recorded saying 'I am the fighter from the Al-Qassem Battalion, the living martyr with the help of Allah, Jafar Muna. You (Israel) have lit a fire that will not be extinguished until we remove you from our land with the help of Allah, we have prepared attacks for you. The fire you lit is going to burn you, your settlers, and your army.' At the time, Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed joint responsibility for the attack, but the defense establishment investigated whether there was another party that sent the terrorist. In a statement issued a day after the explosion, the commander of the Israel Police Tel Aviv District said: 'This is not a person who is in our systems or appears in our databases, and the explosive was probably created in the West Bank. It is estimated that the terrorist was supposed to arrive at a certain place, and probably noticed the synagogue. He decided to stop for a moment to prime the explosive, but apparently clicked on something else and activated it.' Since the outbreak of the war, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been trying to set the West Bank ablaze and, together with Iran, he is pouring a lot of money and weapons into the region. So far, Hamas has not succeeded in dragging the Palestinians into a conflict with Israel and succeeded in creating wide-scale riots and clashes with IDF forces. The Shin Bet already noticed the trend of explosive device attacks, which mostly originate in the West Bank, and warned the phenomenon is gaining traction thanks to the dual-use of materials such as fertilizer. Suicide attacks, which haven't been used in years, will be an escalation in the war against terrorism. They require recruitment, infrastructure and preparation, raising concerns that Israel is headed to a third intifada. At the beginning of this month, the defense establishment estimated that although the situation is not hte same as it was in 2002, Israel fears the return of suicide bombings in the heart of Israel, especially before the holidays. Following increased alerts, the Central Command launched its latest operation in the West Bank, focusing on the refugee camps in northern Samaria, Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur al-Shams, and other areas. So far, about 70 terrorists have been killed during the operation, and dozens have been arrested. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzpr60060	2024-09-18T21:35:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/22/SJ3rdLNoC/SJ3rdLNoC_0_63_590_333_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah hides numbers killed in attacks, Radwan force loses muc...	Lebanon reports 26 killed over two days of pager and walkie talkie explosions, but estimates are that the pager attack alone killed dozens of Hezbollah members and maybe more, while elite Radwan force commanders were decimated According to the official updates from Lebanon, 12 people were killed when thousands of pagers exploded on Tuesday and 20 in the walkie-talkie blasts on Wednesday, but in Israel officials believe that the announced dead and injured from the pager explosions is significantly lower than reality. It is estimated that there are many dozens of dead, if not more. Significant damage was inflicted on Hezbollah's special operation forces unit Radwan force, which lost large parts of its command structure. At least 450 were injured in the explosion of the hand-held walkie talkie radios throughout Lebanon, and these join the more than 3,000 Hezbollah operatives who were injured by the pager blasts. Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is expected to give a speech on Thursday, in his first public remarks since the series of explosions in Lebanon. U.S. officials publicly expressed anger at not receiving an update on the operation to blow up the pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon that could lead to war while conducting diplomatic efforts for a settlement. But three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that Israeli officials had informed the United States of the intention to carry out an operation in Lebanon - including in the conversation this week between Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and his counterpart Lloyd Austin - but did not provide additional details about that operation. 'The fact that no details were given about the operation meant that the United States was left in the dark until the reports of the explosions shortly after,' a source said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on his way from Washington to Cairo when the stunned American diplomats watched live on their television screens on the plane the news from Lebanon of the operation that was reportedly a joint operation by the Mossad and the IDF. At the press conference in Egypt, Blinken said that the United States 'did not know and was not involved in these incidents.' Another U.S. source said that the Americans also sent a similar message to Iran, asking Tehran not to lead an escalation. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was injured in the explosion of one of the pagers. According to the Lebanese MTV network, he was transferred from Beirut to Tehran to complete treatment in Iran. On the same plane were about 90 other wounded people who were flown to Iran to receive treatment, along with their families. The White House also said its officials were not involved in the explosions. 'We believe that there is a diplomatic way to solve the Lebanon issue. It is too early to know how the radio explosions will affect the cease-fire deal,' according to the White House, which stressed that 'it is still too early to know what effect the events will have on the high level of tension between Israel and Hezbollah at the border.' Sources privy to the details said that if Israel is indeed behind the series of explosions, it is beginning to realize the goal of returning the residents of the north to their homes. A source said that 'It is clear that this is not how a military campaign with Lebanon will look and it will require an exchange of rockets and missiles from both sides, but Israel - if it is the one that acted - has already had an effect' though it may not avert war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj00fvautc	2024-09-18T15:01:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/ryik9XPpR/ryik9XPpR_0_347_2500_1407_0_small.jpg

Donald Trump says he will 'probably' meet Zelensky next week	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would 'probably' meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be in the U.S. next week to address a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Russia's war in his country. 'Probably, yes,' Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about whether he will meet the Ukrainian leader. Trump did not provide further details. Zelensky said in August he wanted to present a peace plan to Biden, Harris and Trump. While Trump and Zelensky talked over the phone in July, they have not talked in person since Trump's 2017-2021 term. Trump has consistently described U.S. aid to its eastern European ally as a waste of money and has declined to say he wants Ukraine to win.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj9t9pdtc	2024-09-18T14:48:42-07:00	
Shin Bet tried to legitimize pager attack by disclosing planned H...	Shin Bet discloses Hezbollah's attempt on former Israeli security official hours before pager explosions; UN condemns the attack but doesn't identify a culprit; Israel neither confirms not denies attack Less than two hours before the pagers exploded across Lebanon, the Shin Bet allowed the publication of a report that it had thwarted a Hezbollah attack against former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon in Yarkon Park in September 2023. 'This was supposed to give international legitimacy in the face of the accusations,' sources said. Even after more than 11 months of fighting in the north and launching thousands of rockets and hundreds of drones, Israel needed international legitimacy to allegedly carry out what is attributed to it in Lebanon. Thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured and some were killed in two days of communication device explosions. Less than two hours before the pagers exploded in Lebanon and Syria on Tuesday afternoon, the Shin Bet disclosed that Hezbollah planned to assassinate former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon with an IED in Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv in September 2023. The Shin Bet lifted the gag order to supposedly justify retaliation against the terror organization and its affiliates. Since Hezbollah escalated its aggression, Israel has bolstered security around officials, embassies abroad and national symbols. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called the pager explosion attack a violation of human rights and called for those responsible to be prosecuted. Petra De Sutter, the deputy prime minister of Belgium, condemned Israel and said: 'I strongly condemn the massive terror attack in Lebanon and Syria, which injured thousands of people. A brutal escalation of violence. Silence is not an option. An international investigation is called for. The bloodshed must end.' Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association(EJA), attacked her and said that calling the pager operation a terrorist attack is upside down and that she has completely lost her moral compass. The possibility of expanding the campaign in the north is reflected in a series of senior officials' throughout this week. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the cabinet meeting that 'the existing situation in the north cannot continue. This requires a change in the balance of power on our northern border. We will do everything necessary to return our residents safely to their homes. I am committed to this, the government is committed to this and we will not settle for anything less.' On Monday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that a possible settlement in the north was fleeting, while Netanyahu was discussing Gallant's replacement with former Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar. On the same day, Netanyahu met with Amos Hochstein, the American envoy for Lebanon and emphasized that it will be impossible to return our residents home without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north. The following night, almost a year after the fighting began which led to the mass evacuation of tens of thousands of residents, the government added a new goal to the war: the safe return of the citizens to their homes in the north. On the next day, Hezbollah's pagers began exploding in Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjtpzs0060	2024-09-18T14:10:35-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/H1z5QWPT0/H1z5QWPT0_0_561_1279_720_0_small.jpg
Pager manufacturer BAC goes dark after Lebanon explosions, CEO de...	BAC, registered in Hungary’s corporate registry in 2022, presents itself as a consultancy firm, and the woman listed as its CEO claims she’s merely a 'broker'; the listed company address points to a private residence, and the website – filled with generic images and vague project descriptions – has since been taken down The Taiwanese company Gold Apollo claims that BAC, the firm allegedly responsible for manufacturing the pagers that exploded in Lebanon on Tuesday, has gone underground. Attempts to contact BAC's offices were unsuccessful, and the one time phone contact was made, the company representative declined to comment and immediately hung up. Shortly afterward, BAC's official website went offline. However, Cristiana Arcidiacono-Barsony, listed on the site as BAC’s CEO, denied any involvement in the affair during a call with an Italian news outlet. 'I don’t make pagers. I’m just a broker. I think you’ve got the wrong person,' she said, before cutting the call short. The address listed on BAC's website led to what appeared to be a private residence in Budapest. On Wednesday, a simple A4 paper sign appeared on the door, listing companies operating in the building, including BAC Consulting. According to Hungarian reports, BAC was registered in 2022, and its 49-year-old CEO has a background in physics, with degrees from prestigious London institutions. She also worked with the European Union, UNESCO, and the UN’s education arm. While BAC's website notes its involvement in telecommunications, there is no mention of specific devices or pagers. BAC's name surfaced after Gold Apollo President Hsu Ching-Kuang held a press conference to distance his company from the explosions. 'This product is not ours,' Hsu told reporters at the company's headquarters in New Taipei City, explaining that the AR-924 pagers were manufactured and sold by BAC. 'We only provide the brand name for approval; we have no involvement in the design or production,' Gold Apollo said in a statement. Initially, Hsu refused to disclose BAC’s location, but it later emerged that the company operates out of Budapest, Hungary. He further revealed that the agreement between Gold Apollo and BAC has been in place for three years, and that BAC was responsible for manufacturing the pagers that exploded. When pressed for additional details, Hsu declined to provide the terms of the agreement with BAC, but hinted at past payment issues, stating, 'The payments were very strange,' and noting that they had been routed through the Middle East. BAC's website, which features generic images and text, describes Bressoni-Arcidiacono as an expert in consultancy services across several fields, including environmental, development, and international relations. However, there is little detail on the company's specific projects or clients. The site claims the European Union is a client, though the attached descriptions are vague, consisting of general marketing language. Another project refers to BAC’s involvement in developing technology and a 'business bridge' in Asia, but again, without specifics or named clients. A European delegation is also listed as a client, but the project page is similarly sparse, filled with clichéd management and marketing slogans. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk00of300ar	2024-09-18T13:59:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/rkqVQ11da0/rkqVQ11da0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Wolt messenger delivers baby instead of pizza	Ilan Buaron was on his way to deliver a pizza in Ramat Gan when he got a message from MDA about a women in the middle of giving birth in her home two blocks away; Buaron, a Magen David Adom volunteer went to help; The pizza didn't make it, but the baby is safe When Wolt messenger Ilan Buaron, 22, started his shift Tuesday night he had no idea what kind of delivery task would be waiting for him during it.Buaron, who in addition to his work as a Wolt courier has also been volunteering for Magen David Adom in recent years, picked up a delivery of pizza from a restaurant in Ramat Gan at 2:00 a.m., put it in a box and started riding his moped to the address of the order. The delivery should have ended like hundreds of other deliveries he has made in the past, but shortly after Buaron collected the pizza, he received a message on his cellphone from MDA about a woman from Ramat Gan, who was in the middle of giving birth in her home in the city. Buaron quickly realized that the address of the woman who giving birth was two blocks away from him and he did not hesitate: He immediately changed his route and drove, together with the pizza, to the woman's home. Within a few minutes he arrived at the scene and located the woman, surrounded by her husband and mother, in an advanced stage of labor. He began to assist her in giving birth. For Buaron, it was the first time he was in an active labor situation, and he successfully delivered the couple's son. During the event, Buaron also managed to send a message to Wolt's service center and inform them that the pizza he collected would probably not reach its destination. 'I received a notification of an active birth on the way to the delivery address, I stopped here and helped the woman deliver her baby and I'm going to stay here a little longer,' he wrote. And what happened to the pizza? A new pizza was delivered to the hungry customers, and the pizza he carried on his moped was eaten by the ambulance crew that arrived on the scene. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylqdjupc	2024-09-18T12:40:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/S1gTE5OTA/S1gTE5OTA_0_544_772_435_0_small.jpg

Communities bordering West Bank warn they are vulnerable to attac...	Funds to bolster security promised by the government have not been delivered and a local mayor says his residents are at risk as Palestinians breach the partition wall easily, most looking for work; After troops locate a West Bank tunnel being built, fears grow Leaders of a municipal council bordering the partition wall separating the West Bank from Israel warned again on Wednesday of a real security risk to its residents, after the government failed to transfer funds needed to bolster security in the area. The government voted to allocate 100 million shekels to increasing security along the border wall, but the funds have not been delivered. 'I'm certain that a minute after a terror attack here, the money will make its way,' Ilan Sadeh, head of the Menashe Regional Council said. 'Why can't the government live up to its commitments before an attack?' Since the Hamas massacre in the south on October 7, residents bordering the West Bank have warned that they could fall victim to a similar attack. Communities have come under fire from West Bank terrorists who have been shooting into their homes and, in some cases, trying to launch rockets targeting their communities. Menachem Greenberg, head of security for the council, said it would take no more than seconds to reach homes of Israelis once the border is breached. Palestinians regularly climb over the border wall into Israel, to find work, mostly undisturbed by security forces. 'It is a matter of decision for anyone coming over the wall, whether to seek work to launch an attack,' he said. Greenberg said more should be done to stop Palestinians from entering Israel illegally. 'We want to see more troops on either side of the border,' he said. Greenberg praised the work of the IDF brigades that have been conducting anti-terrorism raids on West Bank cities bordering Israel but said that was not enough. Troops found a tunnel in the early stages of construction in the West Bank town of Tulkarm last week increasing the concerns of residents on the Israeli side of the fence that terror groups would attempt to infiltrate into their communities. The lessons of October 7 were learned on both sides of the partition wall, Sadeh said, adding that the massacre has changed things and that, although efforts to protect his residents have been made, they were not enough. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrcge00ac	2024-09-18T12:06:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/11/ryZK8JvkpR/ryZK8JvkpR_39_94_440_248_0_small.jpg
They called me a dirty Jew' says victims of antisemitic attack i...	Harrison Hipp, who was wearing a kipa under a hat, was attacked while walking down the street; He landed in the hospital with a concussion and cerebral hemorrhage; 'I’m real messed up... and for what? ... just because I’m Jewish? It’s ridiculous' A Jew man was the victim of a severe attack in Oklahoma by a man who called him a 'dirty Jew.' The victim was taken to the hospital suffering from bruises and a cerebral hemorrhage. The apparent antisemitic incident happened in Norman, Oklahoma when Harrison Hipp and his girlfriend passed by a pizza shop. A stranger approached Hipp and askedif he could try on his cowboy hat for a moment. 'I said, ‘No, this is my hat, you know, sorry,’ and I was polite about it,' Hipp told local media. According to him, at this point the man and his friends became aggressive. 'I take off the hat and yarmulke and I start running and then he chases me and he says, ‘I’m going to get you, you dirty Jew.’ and I’m like panicking at this point because I know I’m going to get jumped,' said Hipp. He added that the attackers stole his hat and kippa and slammed his head against the concrete multiple times. The woman who was with him tried to prevent the attack. 'I start trying to pull the original guy off of him and then I get thrown off of him and then a guy, grabs my arms and is like holding my arms, so I can’t do anything,' said Emily Rodriguez, Hipp’s girlfriend. Hipp said the attackers left him bleeding in the street. According to him, his next memory was when he woke up in the hospital. He now has a long road to recovery, having been diagnosed with a concussion and brain bleed. 'I’m real messed up, I can’t go to work, I can’t function and for what? You know, I don’t know, just because I’m Jewish? It’s ridiculous,' said Hipp. The victim believes that this is a hate crime and that he was attacked because he is Jewish. 'Everybody that attacked me called me a dirty Jew, so I would like them all to be charged with hate crime,' said Hipp. Officers from the Norman Police Department met Hipp at the hospital. The police said that so far no arrests have been made, though a possible suspect has been identified and all facts including allegations of a possible hate crime are part of the ongoing investigation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkll25u6r	2024-09-18T11:46:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/HJHplIDpR/HJHplIDpR_0_9_974_549_0_small.jpg

Gallant says 'new phase in war' as Netanyahu vows to return north...	Comments come hours after the explosions of Hezbollah-distributed walkie talkies in Lebanon, which killed at least nine people and injured at least 300 Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that Israel 'is on the verge of a new phase in the war. This is not Hamas — we’re dealing with something different, and we need to prepare accordingly.' At the same time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi discussed the movement of the war to the north. The comments of the three leaders came hours after the explosions of Hezbollah-distributed walkie talkies in Lebanon, which killed at least nine people and injured at least 300, and a day after thousands were injured in the explosion of Hezbollah-distributed pagers. During a visit to the Ramat David Air Force, Gallant addressed the escalating tensions on the northern border with Lebanon. Without directly referencing the recent explosion of beepers and communication devices, he said, 'The center of gravity is moving north. We are diverting forces, resources, and energy toward the north. We are entering a new phase of the war – one that demands courage, determination, and perseverance.' ''We have not forgotten the hostages and we have not forgotten our tasks in the south. This is our duty and we are performing it at the same time. This operation involves all branches, and the mission is clear and simple: to bring the residents of northern communities back to their homes in safety,' Gallant emphasized. He highlighted the IDF's successes, saying, 'When you look at the current situation, the IDF is achieving excellent results, working in tandem with the Shin Bet, Mossad, and all relevant bodies. The outcomes are highly impressive. There is full coordination across the system, and unity in pursuing our goals between the prime minister, the chief of staff, the head of the Shin Bet, the head of Mossad, and myself. Everything is dedicated to one objective: bringing the residents of the north back home.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a short message on Wednesday evening: 'I already said - we will return the residents of the north safely to their homes. And that's exactly what we'll do.' Shortly after his announcement, the prime minister's motorcade was spotted near Mossad headquarte IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Herzi Halevi, held a simultaneous situational assessment in the Northern Command with the members of the General Staff Forum, and confirmed the attack and defense plans for the northern arena. 'We are very determined to create the security conditions that will return the residents to their homes, to the communities, with a high level of security, and we are ready to do all that is required to bring about these things. Throughout the war for almost a year, we have been fighting in Gaza with two main goals, as well as others - dismantling Hamas and returning the hostages. We have achieved a lot, and we still have further forward to go,' he said. 'We still have many capabilities that we have not yet activated. We saw some of these things here, and it seems to me that the readiness is good and we are preparing these plans going forward. The rule is that every time we work on a certain stage, the next two stages are already ready to advance. At each stage, the price for Hezbollah must be high.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1svmcoar	2024-09-18T11:04:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/Hy5O5dOpR/Hy5O5dOpR_0_99_1280_720_0_small.jpg
These are stories of the soldiers killed in Rafah	Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff was doing everything to bring the hostages back; Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri did everything he could to transfer to a combat unit; Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon was wounded by shrapnel, and after two days, he went back to the fight; paramedic Staff Sgt. Agam Naim is the first woman soldier killed in Gaza Since the war began on October 7, 713 IDF soldiers have been during the Gaza operation; four of them –Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff, 23, from Moreshet, Staff Sgt. Agam Naim, 20, from Mishmarot, Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri, 21, from Yoshevia, and Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon, 21, from Elazar – died Tuesday when a building exploded in Rafah in southern Gaza. As part of the 401st Armored Brigade operation, soldiers were conducting searches for weapons in a building in the Tel Sultan neighborhood. For reasons still under investigation, a deadly explosion occurred. A helicopter evacuated the wounded, including five soldiers in serious condition and two others in moderate condition, to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva. Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff was the deputy company commander in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. He had taken over the role from Lt. Yaron Eliezer Chitiz, 23, of Ra’anana, who was killed in December during a battle in northern Gaza. Daniel’s father, Shlomo Toaff, an executive at Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, told Army Radio that'Daniel had been in Gaza since day one. He never complained. When we asked, ‘Is everything okay?’ he’d just say, ‘Yes, Dad, everything’s fine.’' 'Pure-hearted children who gave everything for Israel' Shlomo shared how Daniel, an avid mountain biker, had studied at a religious high school in Sde Yaakov and spent two years at the Bnei David pre-military academy before joining the IDF. 'He was supposed to attend a company commander course in three months, and we had hoped we would finally have peace. Well, now we have peace,' Shlomo said, noting that one of his other sons serves in the reserves and his daughter is an intelligence officer. 'We deeply believe in doing everything for the people of Israel, and Daniel gave everything,' Shlomo said. 'Last night, we went to a café, came home, and my wife, Orit, went to her sports class. I stayed home. At 8:30 p.m., there was a knock on the door, and I opened it to see three good people standing there. I knew something had happened.' He recalled videos Daniel had sent of his unit in action, saying: 'If there's anything that gives hope to the people of Israel, it's these incredible children.' Staff Sgt. Agam Naim, a paramedic in the 52nd Battalion of the Iron Tracks Formation (401st Armored Brigade), was the first female soldier killed in the ground offensive in Gaza. Her cousin, Yaron, eulogized her: 'You promised you’d take care of yourself, but you always reminded us that if it wasn’t you, there would be no one to do your job, no one to protect and care for the soldiers. You were my hero, a true hero.' Agam’s aunt, Mariel, added: 'She spent the last six months in Gaza. Her father is a bereaved brother, so he worried even more. She didn’t have to go, but she insisted. She was the most beautiful, joyful, talented person. She volunteered with Magen David Adom, spent a year in service working with post-hospitalized youth. Last weekend, she was sick and stayed home. Her commander told her she didn’t need to return, but she went back to Gaza anyway.' Agam’s mother, Dorit, had written about her daughter’s complex service in recent months, sharing how proud they were when Agam was selected for the paramedic course. 'She finished the course with honors and was immediately attached to the Armored Corps,' Dorit wrote. 'Two days later, she was already in Gaza with the engineering corps. We stopped breathing; our lives changed. I discovered anxiety attacks I hadn’t known before.' In a later post, Dorit described her reaction to hearing of other casualties in the war: 'Agam called me and said, ‘Mom, do you see? It could happen anywhere.’ Yes, it feels like losing control, like being stuck in a tunnel with no end. Just last week, she treated severely wounded soldiers. What kind of child will I get back at the end of this war?' Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri was a combat operative in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. His sister, Noa, shared: 'He enlisted in the Military Police as an investigator. But when the war broke out, he couldn’t stay in that role. Despite his medical profile, he did everything he could to transfer to a combat unit. Amit was unstoppable when he set his mind to something.' Noa recalled that, just last week, Amit was home when he was called back to Gaza. 'He’d been injured three weeks ago by an anti-tank missile, but even after being treated at Soroka Medical Center, he returned to his unit immediately. He said, ‘There’s no way my team stays there while I’m here.’ He was all-in for the war.' Amit had spoken to his family after being allowed to use his phone. 'He wasn’t too worried about himself, but he mentioned the anti-tank missile incident was scary.' Noa added, 'He was supposed to come home in two weeks.' Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon, also a combat operative in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade, lost his sister Nofar, 17, in a car accident in 2013. His brother Guy, the only surviving son in the family, said: 'Dotan was the most perfect person you could imagine. He had a radiant smile, and was incredibly handsome, with a heart of gold. He was the best brother anyone could ask for.' Guy recounted Dotan’s journey in the IDF, where he had completed a course for commander trainees. 'His company commander wanted him to stay on, so he was assigned as a team leader. He’d been in Gaza for over a month when he was lightly wounded by shrapnel a few weeks ago. But after two days, he went back to the fight.' Guy said the family never considered that Dotan might not come home. 'There was concern, but we had become accustomed to the situation. It wasn’t like the beginning of the war. I believe our parents worried more, but I felt safer. Now, I’m the only son left for my parents.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qnj00utc	2024-09-18T10:46:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/ByKec6vpA/ByKec6vpA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Officials in Israel informed the U.S. ahead of time of the intention to carry out the operation in Lebanon on Tuesday, in which hundreds of beepers were detonated throughout the country, without providing details of the plan, CNN reported citing three sources familiar with the details. According to them, the Israeli update included a statement from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was sent to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday morning. The sources added that the U.S. did not know anything about what was being planned until reports of hundreds of explosions began to emerge throughout Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryb7pfoaa	2024-09-18T10:27:13-07:00

Germany has stopped approving war weapons exports to Israel	Germany has put a hold on new exports of weapons of war to Israel while it deals with legal challenges, according to a Reuters analysis of data and a source close to the Economy Ministry. Last year, Germany approved arms exports to Israel worth 326.5 million euros ($363.5 million), including military equipment and war weapons, a 10-fold increase from 2022, according to data from the Economy Ministry, which approves export licenses. However approvals have dropped this year, with only 14.5 million euros' worth granted from January to Aug. 21, according to data provided by the Economy Ministry in response to a parliamentary question. Of this, the 'weapons of war' category accounted for only 32,449 euros. A source close to the ministry cited a senior government official as saying it had stopped work on approving export licenses for arms to Israel pending a resolution of legal cases arguing that such exports from Germany breached humanitarian law. The government has said no weapons of war have been exported under any license issued since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, apart from spares for long-term contracts, the source added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjnrhy006a	2024-09-18T10:23:46-07:00

Jewish US Senator Bernie Sanders bids to halt some weapons sales ...	U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday he would file legislation seeking to block the sale of offensive U.S. weapons to Israel, citing the toll on civilians of Israel's campaign against Hamas. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he intended to file Joint Resolutions of Disapproval next week. The U.S. Arms Export Control Act gives Congress the right to stop a major foreign weapons sale by passing a resolution of disapproval. 'Providing more offensive weapons to continue this disastrous war would violate U.S. and international law,' Sanders said in a statement. President Joe Biden has faced calls from his fellow Democrats throughout Israel's campaign in Gaza to press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to ease the devastating humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave. In his announcement, Sanders noted that the Biden administration last month approved arms sales to Israel totaling more than $20 billion that included systems tied to tens of thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza. He said exporting such weapons would violate human rights provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Arms Export Control Act.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdgjk006a	2024-09-18T10:18:35-07:00

UN approves proposal for arms embargo on Israel	Palestinian proposal, which calls, among other things, to 'return the Palestinians to their land' and to enforce sanctions on senior Israeli officials, was passed by a large majority in the UN General Assembly, while 43 countries abstained. Ambassador Danon: 'Voting in favor of this resolution adds fuel for further violence' The UN General Assembly on Wednesday evening approved a Palestinian proposal that requires Israel to implement the decisions of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which calls, among other things, for the end of the Israeli presence 'in the Occupied Palestinian Territory' within six months, the withdrawal of the IDF from there, the cessation of 'settlements' and 'the return of the Palestinians to their land.' The proposal also includes a call to countries not to legally recognize Israel's presence 'in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,' in addition to enforcing sanctions on senior Israeli officials, end the transfer of weapons to Israel if it is suspected that they will be used in those territories, and avoiding the establishment of diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. Some 124 countries supported the proposal, 14 opposed and 43 abstained. Along with Israel, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Fiji, Hungary, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, Tuvalu and the United States also opposed the proposal. Among those that abstained were Germany, Ukraine, Great Britain, Canada, India and 38 other countries. Greece, Cyprus and France surprised - and disappointed - when they voted in favor of the resolution. The vote means that monitoring and control mechanisms of the UN will be established to implement the decision of the court in The Hague regarding the withdrawal of Israel from the territories. The decision will harm Israel's image in the world and will give fuel to organizations and countries to pass their own resolutions against Israel. The call for an arms embargo and the imposition of sanctions against Israel could work to convince countries to act on this decision and stop arms sales to the country. Greece's ambassador to the UN, Evangelos C.Sekeris, said after the vote that 'Israel has a right to security and self-defense. The current decision does not concern the need to hold direct negotiations on the two-state solution. However, Greece decided to support the vote. This is due to its broad support for international law and the International Court of Justice, which must be defended even if there are differences of opinion. We call for a political process to advance the two-state solution.' A political official said in response that 'Greece and Cyprus have disappointed badly. We will demand clarifications.' The vote of the two countries in support of the proposal came as a surprise, especially since Israel supplies weapons to Greece and Cyprus. British Ambassador Barbara Woodward said that 'Britain abstained from today's proposal. Britain did so because the decision does not provide sufficient clarity to advance the common goal of peace based on a two-state solution to be achieved through negotiations. We are committed to the rule of law and respect the court and call on the countries to unite behind the renewed efforts toward an agreed solution in accordance with international law.' She added that 'Israel needs to end its presence in the territories as quickly as possible and create the conditions for the establishment of a free Palestine alongside a safe and free Israel - while recognizing the security and self-determination needs of each side. The unification of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza must also be brought about according to the 1967 borders We condemn the settlers' violence in the West Bank to pressure Palestinian communities to leave their land, and call on Israel to prosecute those responsible.' Before the vote, the diplomatic community held an event of solidarity with the families of hostages, and the ambassador of South Sudan attacked the ambassador of Norway and representatives of other countries: 'You should be ashamed of yourselves. To sit in front of the families of hostages on the day you vote against Israel at the UN.' He called on the representatives to leave the event and 'Run' to call their prime ministers, 'beg them to change their vote,' he said. 'Each country has a vote, and the world is watching us,' Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the General Assembly on Tuesday. 'Please stand on the right side of history. With international law. With freedom. With peace.' He also called on the UN and the member states to implement their responsibilities under international law. In his speech, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, attacked what he called the hypocrisy and bias of the United Nations against Israel, which since the October 7 massacre passed two resolutions in the General Assembly that ignored Hamas and its responsibility for the events of that day. 'Anyone who supports this circus is a collaborator. Anyone who votes in favor of this proposal fuels further violence. This show is an insult to the victims of the massacre, it is an insult to the hostages,' he said. In his speech, Danon presented a photo of the tunnel where the six murdered hostages were held, showing their blood spilled on the floor: 'Eden, Hirsh, Alex, Carmel Uri and Almog. These are their names. Six innocent Israelis were murdered in cold blood after months of suffering in the tunnels. Imagine how you would feel if it was your child, your partner or your friend. Would you be silent even then? I tell you clearly: Jewish blood is not worthless. The days when Jewish blood was spilled without any response are over.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj11ja00da0	2024-09-18T09:45:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/ryxkrWdda0/ryxkrWdda0_0_421_961_540_0_small.jpg

The pager operation's goal was 'deterrence' of Hezbollah	Security officials postpone music show following pager operation in Lebanon: 'Never in any country have they hit so many terrorists in a minute, deterrence is stronger' Security officials on Wednesday said that 'The strategic purpose was deterrence' - referring to the pager operation in Lebanon, resulting in thousands of wounded Hezbollah operatives, which is attributed to Israel. According to a source, 'Never, and in any country, have so many terrorists been hit in one minute. This is about 4,000 targeted assassinations. If we wanted to kill them, we could, but deterrence is stronger.' According to the sources, 'this is not the last move and there will be more.' and, in fact, on Wednesday afternoon, over 100 people were injured when walkie talkies exploded across Lebanon. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed for offensive operations in the north, and a security source has said he did so despite opposition from the IDF and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's reservations. On Saturday night, Netanyahu convened an emergency discussion due to operational circumstances. Foreign sources reported that Hezbollah began to suspect the beepers and therefore there was an urgent need for execution. The Prime Minister's Office denied reports concerning the recent discussions. At the same time, the IDF instructed the Mateh Asher Regional Council to postpone popular Israeli sinter Hanan Ben Ari's concert that was scheduled for Thursday at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot's amphitheater with an audience of 4,300 people. Following the escalation, President Isaac Herzog hosted Prime Minister Netanyahu for an unusual briefing. Following the pager blasts in Lebanon, the IDF is on high alert. The 98th Division, considered one of the elite IDF units which includes the commando and the paratrooper unit, left the Gaza Strip and went up to the northern border. Their shift may hint at the expansion of war against Hezbollah. Moving the 98th Division to the north and leaving the 162nd Division and the 252nd Division proved that the IDF is shifting its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Since Tuesday, the Chief of Staff has been conducting a continuous situation assessment concerning what is happening in the north, and so far the IDF has not issued new guidelines. Lebanese residents were shocked by the explosions of the pagers. AFP quoted a man from Dahiyeh in Beirut who said he has never seen a person walking down the street and explode. A Lebanese engineer who lives in the U.S. and is visiting Beirut, said he was not surprised by what happened because 'wars are dirty.' He added that the war of attrition between Israel and Hezbollah would take time. Abu Jawad Hamda, a resident of Beirut, promised that there would be a response from Hezbollah. 'We will respond, we need to teach them a lesson they won't forget because these people won't stop,' he said. Meanwhile, new details regarding the operation are beginning to surface. A Taiwanese company allegedly sold thousands of pagers to the terror organization but deny making any adjustments to the product. The Taiwanese company said that the AR-924 type device is manufactured and sold by a Hungary-based company called BAC. The president of the Taiwanese company, 'Gold Apollo,' noted that there were problems with the company's payments in the past. He said they came through the Middle East. Taiwan's Economy Minister said the pager manufacturer claimed they must have undergone 'adjustments' after they were shipped. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sknikpd6r	2024-09-18T08:56:44-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/SJcRgwupA/SJcRgwupA_1_418_900_507_0_small.jpg

A day after thousands of pagers exploded, hand-held radios used by Hezbollah blow up across Lebanon; The walkie talkies were purchased by Hezbollah around the same time as the pagers A day after the unprecedented operation in which thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon, explosions again are heard in Beirut and in other areas across Lebanon. According to reports from Lebanon, late on Wednesday afternoon hand-held radios or walkie-talkies exploded in several areas of Beirut and southern and eastern Lebanon. At least 14 people were killed and 450 were reported injured in the explosions of the devices, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Many of the injured were hit in the stomach and hands. According to the reports, there are casualties in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, and in Saida in southern Lebanon and Baalbeck in eastern Lebanon. The explosions occurred in many houses, as well as in vehicles, according to local reports. A security official told the Reuters news agency that the hand-held radios that exploded Wednesday are different from the pagers that exploded on Tuesday. The radios were purchased by Hezbollah about five months ago, around the same time as the pagers, a security source told Reuters. Al Jazeera reported that the devices that exploded were the icom f82 model. A security official told CNN that according to the initial tests, there were between 15 and 20 explosions in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, and a similar number in southern Lebanon. According to him, the walkie-talkies were less used than the pagers that exploded Tuesday. The Lebanese National News Agency reported that solar energy systems exploded in several houses in southern Lebanon, at the same time as the explosion of the walkie talkies in large areas of the country. According to Sky News in Arabic, the explosions happened at the same time as the funeral of the son of Hezbollah parliament member, Ali Amar, in Dahiyeh; footage taken at the funeral show panic at the moment of the explosion. Sources told the Voice of the Capitol news website, which is affiliated with the Syrian opposition, that 'high frequency waves were sent that caused equipment and broadcasting stations to explode.' The Voice of the Capital also reported that the Syrian regime also called on all security forces and military units to turn off wireless devices, disconnect switchboards and use wired communication. Top Hezbollah official Hashem Safeiddine on Wednesday afternoon said that the group is entering a 'new phase' in the conflict with Israel and that 'punishment is certainly coming.' Also on Wednesday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the pager blasts targeting Hezbollah indicate 'a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon and everything must be done to avoid that escalation.' 'Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation,' he told reporters. Sky News correspondent Alex Crawford was at a funeral in Beirut for four people killed in Tuesday's attacks. She described the 'small sound of something popping' when the explosions occured. 'We came out to try and found out what the sound was and people were running. People were covered in blood,' she says. 'There was blood on a car.' She also reported that Hezbollah operatives collected the devices of funeral-goers and took the batteries out of them >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rymn1wda0	2024-09-18T07:19:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/r1ZoKkDupC/r1ZoKkDupC_181_5_935_526_0_small.jpg

Finland's president defends decisions to buy Israeli arms, not re...	Finland's President Alexander Stubb defended his country's decision to buy arms from Israel despite the war in Gaza, saying it had no link to Finland's unwillingness to recognize an independent Palestinian state at the present time. Finland is acquiring a ground based, high altitude, missile defense system called David's Sling from Israel. Helsinki considers the system a high priority for its own defense due to neighboring Russia's ongoing missile attacks on civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland's new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism,' which he has said was about 'achieving things in the world as it is,' instead of 'promoting only the world how I want to see it.' In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Stubb said the time was not right to recognize a Palestinian state, even though its Nordic neighbors, Sweden, Iceland, and most recently Norway, have done so.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rja2s8opa	2024-09-18T06:31:07-07:00
